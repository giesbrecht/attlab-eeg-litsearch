Conclusions: The following conclusions are offered: (1) standard clinical EEG is not useful: however, newer analytical procedures may be proven valuable; (2) consistent with current theory of MTBI, cognitive ERPs seem to be more sensitive to injury than EPs: (3) development of an assessment battery that may include EEG. EPs. ERPs, and neuropsychologic testing is advocated.

However, this assumption has been challenged by research suggesting that ERP peaks reflect event-related synchronization of ongoing EEG oscillations. In this study, we investigated the validity of a set of methods that have been used to demonstrate that particular ERP peaks result from synchronized EEG oscillations. We simulated epochs of EEG data by superimposing phasic peaks on noise characterized by the power spectrum of the EEG. When applied to the simulated data, the methods in question produced results that have previously been interpreted as evidence of synchronized oscillations, even though no such synchrony was present. These findings suggest that proposed analysis methods may not effectively disambiguate competing views of ERP generation.

However, Ballistocardiogram Artifact (BA), which is caused by the pulsatile motion related to the heart beat, dominates the EEG signal in the MR environment. The objective of this research is to reduce these MR-induced artifacts in order to extract useful information from the EEG recordings, specifically auditory Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). The BA was reduced through the use of an algorithm which creates an adaptive BA template by median-filtering the previous 10 artifacts in the EEG signal. The continuously updated template is then subtracted from each BA in the EEG signal. Results are reported for five subjects, and it was found that the results for the MisMatch Negativities (MMNs) were comparable to those that have previously been reported for studies using auditory frequency deviants. The methods used to reduce the BA in this study demonstrate that the acquisition of auditory ERPs along with the subsequent MMN component can validly be obtained in the MR-environment.

Confounding the EEG signal acquired in the MR environment is a ballistocardiogram artifact (BA), which is predominantly caused by cardiac-related body movement. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a method for reducing these MR-induced artifacts to retrieve small auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) from EEG recorded during fMRI. An algorithm for BA reduction was developed that relies on timing information obtained from simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and subsequent creation of an adaptive BA template. The BA template is formed by media n-filtering 10 consecutive BA events in the EEG signal. The continuously updated template is then subtracted from each BA in the EEG. The auditory ERPs are obtained through signal averaging of the remaining EEG signal. Experimental and simulated ERP data were estimated to assess effectiveness of the BA reduction. Simulation showed that the algorithm reduced BA without significantly altering the morphology of a signal periodically inserted in the EEG. Auditory ERP data, obtained in a 1.5-T scanner during a passive auditory oddball paradigm and processed with the BA reduction algorithm, were comparable to data recorded in a mock scanner outside the magnetic field with the same experimental paradigm. It is concluded that through adequate reduction of the BA, relatively small auditory ERPs can be acquired in the MR environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study examined these measures simultaneously in 54 adolescent unmedicated ADHD males and age and gender matched normal controls during an auditory oddball paradigm. Compared with controls, ADHD patients showed increased pre-stimulus EEG Theta activity and post-stimulus reduced N200 amplitude, increased P200 amplitude and delayed N200 and P300 latencies evoked to target stimuli. Moreover, Theta activity was negatively correlated with N200 amplitude and positively correlated with P200, N200 and P300 latency in ADHD. There were no correlations in the control group. Pre-stimulus preparatory state increases in Theta activity in ADHD may underlie some of the reported disturbances in information processing reflected in ADHD.

This article proposes an alternative method for mimicing both the electrical and geometrical properties of the head, including brain, skull, and scalp tissue with resistors. Two resistor mesh models have been designed to reproduce the three-sphere reference model (analytical model). The first one (spherical resistor mesh) closely mimics the geometrical and electrical properties of the analytical model. The second one (cubic resistor mesh) is designed to conveniently handle anatomical data from magnetic resonance imaging. Both models have been validated, in reference to the analytical solution calculated on the three-sphere model, by computing the magnification factor and the relative difference measure. Results suggest that the mesh models can be used as robust and user-friendly simulation or exploration tools in EEG/ERP. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.

Glucoregulation was estimated by deriving a recovery index to categorize subjects as having: better (BR) or poorer (PR) blood glucose recovery. Although glucoregulatory status, did not impact on EEG or task performance, PR subjects exhibited reduced P300b areas relative, to BR subjects prior to beverage administration. Glucose did not after P300b or memory scanning performance but, regardless of glucoregulatory status, it increased the EEG power in the slow alpha frequency band. The study results suggest that peripheral glucoregulation can influence neuroelectric measures of cognition, and that the acute ingestion of glucose can modulate central arousal processes.

Timing error may happen in the coupling of computers from various manufactures, resulting in the misalignment of event markers that signal the onset of stimuli. In one system, an impedance check desynchronized a computer and thus caused misalignment of events in EEG signals. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a method to identify and correct such timing errors that contaminated 114 raw data of EEG/auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in one of our longitudinal studies. A two-step procedure was introduced in the correction of timing errors. First, the time delay was roughly estimated by identifying a P-150 component in two ERP blocks. Second, a small phase-locked positive wave was identified for fine estimation. Reliability within and among evaluators was examined using ERP data with simulated timing errors. Concordant results were obtained in 104 (91.2%) of the 114 raw EEG/ERP data sets. Our results showed that the method presented here is reliable and can be used for correcting timing errors without introduction of experimenter bias. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial filters derived by ICA blindly separate the input data into a sum of temporally independent and spatially fixed components arising from distinct or overlapping brain or extra-brain sources. Both the data and their decomposition are displayed using a new visualization tool, the "ERP image," that can clearly characterize single-trial variations in the amplitudes and latencies of evoked responses, particularly when sorted by a relevant behavioral or physiological variable. These tools were used to analyze data from a visual selective attention experiment on 28 control subjects plus 22 neurological patients whose EEG records were heavily contaminated with blink and other eye-movement artifacts. Results show that ICA can separate artifactual, stimulus-locked, response-locked, and non-event-related background EEG activities into separate components, a taxonomy not obtained from conventional signal averaging approaches. This method allows: (1) removal of pervasive artifacts of all types from single-trial EEG records, (2) identification and segregation of stimulus- and response-locked EEG components, (3) examination of differences in single-trial responses, and (4) separation of temporally distinct but spatially overlapping EEG oscillatory activities with distinct relationships to task events. The proposed methods also allow the interaction between ERPs and the ongoing EEG to be investigated directly. We studied the between-subject component stability of ICA decomposition of single-trial EEG epochs by clustering components with similar scalp maps and activation power spectra. Components accounting for blinks, eye movements, temporal muscle activity, event-related potentials, and event-modulated alpha activities were largely replicated across subjects.

Ten patients with NES underwent preictal (on hospital admission) and postictal (less than or equal to 6 hours after seizure) ERP recordings of an auditory oddball paradigm. Additionally, 10 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with partial seizures and secondary generalization underwent preictal, postictal (<6 hours after seizures), and interictal (7-48 hours after seizure) ERP recordings. We recently reported that ERPs recorded in TLE patients with partial epilepsy undergo a temporary change postictally, while returning to their preictal state during interictal recordings. In the current study intraclass correlations, transformed into z scores, are used to determine test-retest validity of repeated ERP recordings. An independent sample t test with z scores for the comparison of preictal and postictal recordings showed that ERP activation differed between NES and TLE patients (P = 0.009). More specifically, ERP recordings in the preictal and postictal states were similar in NES patients, but dissimilar in TLE patients. On the other hand, this dissimilarity in ERPs disappeared when comparing z scores for the preictal and postictal recordings in NES patients with z scores for the preictal and interictal recordings in TLE patients. This further supports the notion that identical waveforms during preictal and postictal recordings in NES patients reflect nonepileptic seizure activity. The current findings suggest that postictal ERP recordings are useful in the diagnosis of NES and differentiate TLE from NES. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We tested the hypothesis whether (and which) processing differences between spoken words and pseudowords are reflected by changes in cortical networks within the time window of a specific event related potential (ERP) component, the N400. Fourteen native speaking German subjects performed a lexical decision paradigm, while being confronted sequentially with two-syllabic nouns and phonologically legal pseudowords. Using ERP analysis, we defined the time window of the N400 effect, known to reflect semantic processing, and, subsequently, we examined the coupling differences. Lexico-semantic memory search appears to be subserved by a network between temporal, parietal and frontal areas, particularly restricted to the left hemisphere.

J	Price, GW				Price, GW			Interactive ERP recording increases the amplitude of the endogenous P300 peak in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related potential; P300; schizophrenia; selective recording	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA-ACTIVITY; AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; EVOKED-RESPONSE; EEG; DEPRESSION; COMPONENT; ATTENTION; BIPOLAR; MAPS	The P300 is a long-latency cognitive event-related potential (ERP) elicited by the presentation of relevant target stimuli. Unfortunately, the standard ERP recording technique takes no account of the background EEG during stimulus presentation. However, a recently developed technique (interactive recording) controls for variability in the EEG by applying stimuli only when the background EEG is in a predetermined state. The use of the interactive technique has led to significant changes in the P300 amplitude in control studies. Since P300 amplitude data are commonly used in schizophrenia research, and have previously been associated with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, we studied the effects of interactive recording in a schizophrenia population. The same ERP paradigm was implemented twice for each subject, using both standard ERP and the interactive recording techniques. There was a significant increase in the amplitude of the P300 peak with interactive recording, although no significant change in latency. The results indicate that the effect of background EEG may need to be taken into account when conducting general ERP-based studies in schizophrenia. The results also indicate that the method may be used to investigate the effects of EEG variation on ERP values and, by implication, on cognitive processes. In particular, the recognition of EEG states that lead to a higher amplitude ERP value may aid in the further development of EEG investigations of schizophrenia. A similar development is indicated between cognitive research in schizophrenia and the sub-second brain-states in which cognitive function may be reflected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Typically, such classification has been performed using signals from a set of selected EEG sensors. Because EEG sensor signals are mixtures of signals from multiple intra- and extra-cranial sources, single-trial sensory and motor evoked potentials can be difficult to detect and classify. In this paper, Second-order blind identification (SOBI) was used to preprocess EEG data and extract activity from the left and right primary somatosensory (SI) cortices. Subsequently, classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by a sequence of randomly mixed left, right, and bilateral median nerve stimulations was performed by back-propagation neural networks, using as inputs the two SOBI-recovered SI components or the two "best sensors". Results from four subjects showed that classification accuracy was significantly higher when SOBI-recovered left and right SI components were used for classification than when the EEG sensor signals were used directly.

We present a new method of removing gradient artifacts with time-varying waveforms, and evaluate it in continuous (non-interleaved) simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments. Methods: The current method consists of an analog filter, an EEG-fMRI timing error correction algorithm, and a temporal principal component analysis based gradient noise removal algorithm. We conducted a phantom experiment and a visual oddball experiment to evaluate the method. Results: The results from the phantom experiment showed that the current method reduced the number of averaged samples required to obtain high correlation between injected and recovered signals, compared to a conventional average waveform subtraction method with adaptive noise canceling. For the oddball experiment, the results obtained from the two methods were very similar, except that the current method resulted in a higher P300 amplitude when the number of averaged trials was small. Conclusions: The current method enabled us to obtain high quality EEGs in continuous simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments. Significance: Continuous simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition enables efficient use of data acquisition time and better monitoring of rare EEG events.

Divergent ERP responses have been found in schizophrenia and in Parkinson's disease (PD), which have abnormalities in cerebral dopamine activity. We used simultaneously magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to investigate, whether a single dose of haloperidol, a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, modulates preattentive auditory processing using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Our results showed that haloperidol did not alter MMN to frequency and duration changes, whereas the magnetic MMN to frequency change was significantly accelerated. The amplitude and latency changes of the electric and magnetic PSO and N100 were insignificant, Our results indicate that memory-based sound comparison and preceding cortical processing underlying stimulus detection are not attenuated by haloperidol, whereas haloperidol appears to accelerate preattentive sound comparison.

Multiple equivalent current dipoles were estimated from the P300 and P300m waveforms obtained from visual and somatosensory oddball paradigm tasks. Estimated sources from P300m were located on both sides of the occipito-temporal gyrus for visual stimuli and on the post central gyrus for somatosensory;stimuli. The sources of P300m were modality specific. The equivalent current dipoles of P300 were located on the cingulate gyrus and the thalamus in addition to the locations estimated from P300m. However, the dipoles of P300m in MEG were not located on the cingulate gyrus and the thalamus. The discrepancy between EEG and MEG was due to the difficulty to measure radially oriented dipoles in MEG.

Several methods have been developed to enable extraction of single trial ERPs. A quantitative method was developed for testing the accuracy of single trial ERP estimates. ERP signals were simulated by using a piece-wise model of a well known ERP. A large number of unique ERPs were generated by randomly varying parameters of the model. Each of these was embedded in simulated EEG noise modelled as an auto-regressive process driven by white noise. Both stationary and nonstationary noise was simulated. The known simulated ERPs were then compared to the corresponding estimates produced by single trial ERP extraction techniques in terms of the amount of distortion introduced. The techniques tested were time sequence adaptive filtering, singularity detection using wavelets, adaptive multi-resolution analysis and a modification of the multi-resolution analysis technique. None of the methods was found to extract sufficiently accurate waveforms from single trial ERPs contaminated with realistic EEG noise. Improved, but still unsatisfactory, ERP estimates were obtained when the AR EEG noise was replaced by Gaussian noise.

Instead of using a generic classifier off-the-shelf, like a neural network or support vector machine, our classifier design is guided by prior knowledge about the problem and statistical properties found in the data. In particular, we exploit the well-known fact that event-related drifts in EEG potentials, albeit hard to detect in a single trial, can well be observed if averaged over a sufficiently large number of trials. We propose to use the average signal and its variance as a generative model for each event class and use Bayes' decision rule for the classification of new and unlabeled data. The method is successfully applied to a data set from the NIPS*2001 Brain-Computer Interface post-workshop competition. Our result turned out to be competitive with the best result of the competition.

With regard to the reported effects of MP on sleep, 22 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy were exposed or sham exposed for 45 min to the MP (900 MHz, specific absorption rate 0.06 W/kg) placed close to the right ear in a double blind study. There were no changes of the EEG recorded after the MP exposure. A subgroup of 17 patients was studied on visual ERP recorded during the MP exposure. Using an adapted "odd-ball" paradigm, each patient was instructed to strike a key whenever rare target stimuli were presented. There were three variants of target stimuli (horizontal stripes in (i) left, (ii) right hemifields or (iii) whole field of the screen). The exposure enhanced the positivity of the ERP endogenous complex solely in response to target stimuli in the right hemifield of the screen (P < 0.01). The reaction time was shortened by 20 ms in response to all target stimuli (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the electromagnetic field of NM may suppress the excessive sleepiness and improve performance while solving a monotonous cognitive task requiring sustained attention and vigilance.

To evaluate co-existent multi-frequency oscillations, EEG responses to unimodal (auditory or visual) and bimodal (combined auditory and visual) stimuli were analyzed by applying a new method called wavelet entropy (WE). The method is based on the wavelet transform (WT) and quantifies entropy of short segments of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). For each modality, a significant transient decrease of WE emerged in the post-stimulus EEG epoch indicating a highly-ordered state in the ERP. WE minimum was always determined by a prominent dominance of theta (4-8 Hz) ERP components over other frequency bands. Event-related 'transition to order' was most pronounced and stable at anterior electrodes, and after bimodal stimulation. Being consistently observed across different modalities, a transient theta-dominated state may reflect a processing stage that is obligatory for stimulus evaluation, during which interfering activations from other frequency networks are minimized.

J	Price, GW				Price, GW			EEG-dependent ERP recording: using TMS to increase the incidence of a selected pre-stimulus pattern	BRAIN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS			English	Article						event-related potential; transcranial magnetic stimulation; interactive ERP; selective averaging	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; P300; HUMANS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; CORTEX; REAL	EEG dependent event-related potential (ERP) recording (interactive ERP) is an extension to ERP paradigms whereby stimuli are initiated in response to a selected pattern of background EEG. This form of recording is critically dependent upon the incidence of the particular pattern of interest. We introduce here a process that modifies the EEG in a predictable manner so as to increase the incidence of a particular pattern. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimuli are applied in response to a selected pattern of pre-TMS activity, and the post-TMS response is characterized by the incidence of a defined pattern of EEG activity. Analysis of validation test results obtained with the TMS modification part of the process verifies an increased incidence of the response pattern after TMS stimuli, compared with placebo stimuli. The TMS modification procedure is then combined with interactive ERP recording in a two step process to affect the ERP response to sensory stimuli. The post-TMS pattern from the first step becomes the pre-stimulus pattern of the interactive ERP recording in the second step. The TMS modified interactive ERP (TMIERP) process is illustrated here using an auditory oddball paradigm. The amplitude of the P300 peak obtained using this process was significantly higher than that obtained using the standard auditory oddball paradigm.

J	Yordanova, J; Rosso, OA; Kolev, V				Yordanova, J; Rosso, OA; Kolev, V			A transient dominance of theta event-related brain potential component characterizes stimulus processing in an auditory oddball task	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; time-frequency analysis; entropy; multi-frequency oscillations; electroencephalography; brain microstates	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS; WAVELET ENTROPY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; P300; INFORMATION; GAMMA	Objective: Following external stimulation, electroencephalographic (EEG) responses from different frequency bands occur simultaneously, but little is known about whether and how concurrent multi-frequency responses depend on each other during stimulus information processing. The present study assessed the effects of task stimulus relevance on locally co-existent time-frequency components of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Methods: The wavelet entropy (WE) of ERPs was used as an analytical tool because low entropy values correspond to a narrow-band (mono-frequency) activity characterizing highly ordered (regularized) bioelectric states. The minimum of WE in the ERPs (WEmin) was identified to reflect a transient dominance of one particular frequency ERP component over other frequency components. In an auditory oddball condition, effects of stimulus relevance were analyzed for the timing, rate of decrease, and frequency determinants of WEmin in 10 subjects. Results: Major results demonstrate that a highly ordered EEG microstate emerged in response to both target and non-target stimuli, as evidenced by the substantial decrement of ERP entropy. This microstate (1) was short lasting as indexed by the transitory entropy decrease, (2) had a functionally specific time-localization as reflected by stimulus and electrode effects on WEmin latency, and (3) for both stimulus types was determined by a pronounced dominance of locally synchronized theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Conclusions: These results reveal a new neuroelectric correlate of stimulus processing and suggest that a theta-dominated microstate in the ERP may reflect a basic processing stage of stimulus evaluation, during which interfering activations from other frequency networks are minimized. Significance: In the framework of event-related brain dynamics, this study provides evidence that during stimulus processing, there is an interaction of locally co-existent multiple frequency ERP components. It is characterized by a transitory dominance of synchronized theta oscillations over other frequency ERP components emerging irrespective of stimulus task relevance and frequency ERP content, which may reflect basic processing mechanisms.

All subjects were assessed once every 15 min for four trial blocks at the same time of day to assess EEG/ERP changes with time on task-induced fatigue. Spectral analysis was applied to the pre- and post-stimulus EEG segments. ERP values were evaluated with respect to group differences for component amplitude and latency measures. Spectral analysis demonstrated that HIV patients evinced greater pre-stimulus delta power over frontal areas compared to control subjects, and less post-stimulus spectral power for the delta, theta, and alpha bands over the central/parietal areas. P300 amplitude was smaller, and latency was marginally longer fur the HIV patients compared to control subjects. P300 latency correlated positively with increases in the patient HIV viral load. Time-on-task generally did not affect EEG or ERP measures for either group other than contributing to an overall decrease in neuroelectric responsivity. Group spectral power effects were consistent with differences in arousal/fatigue level. P300 group differences were consistent with declines in cognitive capability, and P300 latency increased with increased viral load. HIV infection negatively affected central nervous system function as measured by EEC and cognitive ERPs in a manner that suggests decreased arousal and increased fatigue in HIV patients.

Their significance against surrogate data as well as between different experimental conditions is tested. These methods are validated by simulations using stochastic dynamical systems with time-dependent control parameters and compared with traditional ERP-analysis techniques. Continuous EEG data are cut into epochs according to stimuli events presented to the subjects. These ensembles of time series can be considered as ensembles of trajectories given by some dynamical systems. We employ a statistical mechanics approach motivated by the Frobenius-Perron equation and apply it to coarse-grained symbolic descriptions of the dynamics. We develop time-dependent measures of complexity founded on running cylinder sets and show that these quantities are able to distinguish simulated data obtained by different control parameters as well as experimental data between different experimental conditions. As a first finding, our approach restores the well-known ERP components and it reveals additionally qualitative changes in the EEG that cannot be detected by means of the traditional techniques. We criticize the prerequisites of the traditional approach to ERP analysis and propose to consider ERP instead in terms of dynamical system theory and information theory.

The purpose of this study was to further investigate whether event-related potential (ERP) measures of brain function could be used to reliably classify normal controls versus children and adolescents with two subtypes of AD/HD. Methods: Behavioural and topographic ERP data from children aged 8-12 years (n = 75) and adolescents aged 13-18 years (n = 75) were entered into stepwise discriminant function analyses separating controls and subjects with AD/HD, and also subjects with AD/HD-Predominantly Inattentive type (AD/HDin) from those with AD/HD-Combined type (AD/HDcom). Results: For children aged 8-12 years, controls and children with AD/HD could be separated with an overall classification accuracy of 73.3%, and the AD/HD subtypes were classified with 69.4% overall accuracy. For adolescents aged 13-18 years, 58.7% of the control vs. AD/HD subjects were correctly classified, and 62.7% of subjects in the subtypes. Classification function coefficients for each of these discriminations are presented for the purposes of cross-validation. Conclusions: In children aged 8-12 years, analysis of ERP data may aid a clinician in diagnosing AD/HD, although the clinical utility of ERP analysis is reduced for adolescents aged 13-18 years. Suggestions are made to combine ERP measures with other measures of brain function in order to improve classification accuracy, and also to predict drug response in children diagnosed with AD/HD.

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for several ERP characteristics (P300, N100, N400) and for the beta frequencies of the EEG where we report linkage and linkage disequilibrium at a GABA(A) receptor gene on chromosome 4. Genetic analyses of ERPs suggest that several regions of the human genome contain genetic loci related to the generation of N100, N400 and P300, which are possible candidate loci underlying the functional organization of human neuroelectric activity.

The current paper reviews all recently published MMN studies in the field of schizophrenia research. A reduced MMN in schizophrenic patients is found in the majority of the studies. This deficit is likely to be related to the disorder, since antipsychotic medication seems to have little influence on these results. Interestingly, a reduced MMN is also found in first-degree relatives of patients. Clear evidence for a hemispheric lateralization of the MMN reduction in schizophrenic patients is lacking. A hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is discussed as a possible explanation of this deficit.

We exploit the well-known fact that event-related drifts in EEG potentials can well be observed if averaged over a sufficiently large number of trials. We propose to use the average signal and its variance as a generative model for each event class and use Bayes decision rule for the classification of new, unlabeled data. The method is successfully applied to a data set from the NIPS*2001 Brain-Computer Interface post-workshop competition.

Such techniques are necessary as single trial ERP signals are generally obscured by ongoing EEG activity, with signal to noise ratios below -10dB. The averaging process does not preserve changes in the ERP signal from trial to trial. As these may provide clinically useful information, several methods have been developed to enable extraction of single trial ERPs. A quantitative method was developed for testing the accuracy of single trial ERP estimates. ERP signals were simulated by using a piece-wise model of an ERP known as the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV). By randomly varying parameters of the model, a large number of unique ERPs were generated. Each of these was embedded in simulated EEG noise modelled as an autoregressive process driven by white noise. The known simulated ERPs were then compared to the corresponding estimates produced by single trial ERP extraction techniques in terms of the amount of distortion introduced. The above method was used to test a number of single trial ERP extraction techniques. These were Time Sequence Adaptive Filtering, Singularity Detection using wavelets, Adaptive Multi-resolution Analysis and a modification of the multi-resolution analysis technique. None of the methods was found to extract sufficiently accurate waveforms from single trial ERPs contaminated with realistic EEG noise. Improved, but still unsatisfactory, ERP estimates were obtained when the AR EEG noise was replaced by Gaussian noise.

This may be due to the small number of studies undertaken examining ELF MF effects upon the human electroencephalogram (EEG), and the associated analysis of evoked related potentials (ERPs). Relatively few studies have examined how MF exposure may affect cognitive and perceptual processing in human subjects. The introduction of this review considers some of the recent studies of ELF MF exposure upon the EEG, ERPs and cognitive and perceptual tasks. We also consider some of the confounding factors within current human MF studies and suggest some new strategies for further experimentation. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss Inc.

Analysis of event-related EEG signals typically assumes that poststimulus potentials emerge out of a flat baseline. Signals associated with a particular type of cognitive event are then assessed by averaging data from each scalp channel across trials, producing averaged event-related potentials (ERPs). ERP averaging, however, filters out much of the information about cortical dynamics available in the unaveraged data trials. Here, we studied the dynamics of cortical electrical activity while subjects detected and manually responded to visual targets, viewing signals retained in ERP averages not as responses of an otherwise silent system but as resulting from event-related alterations in ongoing EEG processes. We applied infomax independent component analysis to parse the dynamics of the unaveraged 31-channel EEG signals into maximally independent processes, then clustered the resulting processes across subjects by similarities in their scalp maps and activity power spectra, identifying nine classes of EEG processes with distinct spatial distributions and event-related dynamics. Coupled two-cycle postmotor theta bursts followed button presses in frontal midline and somatomotor clusters, while the broad postmotor "P300" positivity summed distinct contributions from several classes of frontal, parietal, and occipital processes. The observed event-related changes in local field activities, within and between cortical areas, may serve to modulate the strength of spike-based communication between cortical areas to update attention, expectancy, memory, and motor preparation during and after target recognition and speeded responding.

The neurophysiological effects of a cumulative dose of alcohol were investigated as subjects drank three glasses of alcoholic or placebo red wine, I h apart. In a double-blind procedure, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded for social drivers during rest and performance of a working memory task at two levels of difficulty. Background EEG power in the theta, slow alpha, and beta bands increased with alcohol consumption. Along with this systemic increase in background cortical resonant activity, event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes decreased between 200 and 350 ms poststimulus and P300 latency increased, effects that occurred while relevant stimulus factors were being evaluated. These neurophysiological effects endured 3 h after drinking, whereas blood/breath alcohol concentration had decreased considerably and cognitive performance returned to normal. These findings seem to indicate that moderate social alcohol consumption has cumulative effects on brain function that persist for hours after chemical and behavioral indicators of intoxication have diminished. The results seem to indicate that neuronal populations needed for stimulus processing were less available after wine consumption (as evidenced by reduced ERP amplitudes) because of increased background oscillatory activity (as evidenced by increased background EEG power).

We investigated the importance of the phase of narrow-band EEG activity in generating N1 and P2 components in the auditory ERP. An auditory oddball paradigm requiring a button-press response to targets, with fixed interstimulus interval (ISI) and 15% target probability, was utilised. The continuous EEG at Cz was recorded from 16 subjects as the raw data set. Offline digital filtering was used to separate the EEG into 13 narrow bands from 1 to 13 Hz. For each band, the phase at the onset of each non-target stimulus was determined. These were used to sub-average the unfiltered data stream at each of four phases for each of 13 frequencies for each subject. Phase effects were examined in terms of two orthogonal dimensions of electrical brain activity: Cortical negativity and negative driving. Stimulus onset varied as a function of these dimensions in a non-random fashion across frequency, indicating the preferential occurrence of particular phases, interpretable as preferred brain states. Large differential effects were also apparent in N1 and P2 amplitudes. These data indicate important aspects of brain dynamics, suggesting that in a fixed-ISI paradigm the component frequencies of the EEG are dynamically adjusted in order to provide particular brain states at stimulus occurrence to facilitate the brain's processing of the stimulus.

Often, all epochs contaminated by large eye artifacts are rejected as unusable, though this may prove unacceptable when blinks and eye movements occur frequently. Methods: Frontal channels are often used as reference signals to regress out eye artifacts, but inevitably portions of relevant EEG signals also appearing in EOG channels are thereby eliminated or mixed into other scalp channels. A generally applicable adaptive method for removing artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA) (Neural Computation 7 (1995) 1129; Neural Computation 10(8) (1998) 2103; Neural Computation 11(2) (1999) 606) overcomes these limitations. Results: Results on EEG data collected from 28 normal controls and 22 clinical subjects performing a visual selective attention task show that ICA can be used to effectively detect, separate and remove ocular artifacts from even strongly contaminated EEG recordings. The results compare favorably to those obtained using rejection or regression methods. Conclusions: The ICA method can preserve ERP contributions from all of the recorded trials and all the recorded data channels, even when none of the single trials are artifact-free.

In this paper, we employed advanced methods for the modeling of human cortical activity related to voluntary right one-digit movements from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Multimodal integration between EEG and fMRI data was performed by using realistic head models, a large number of scalp electrodes (128) and the estimation of current density strengths by linear inverse estimation. Results. Increasing of spatial details of the estimated cortical density distributions has been detected by using the proposed integration method with respect to the estimation using EEG data alone. Conclusion: The proposed method of multimodal EEG-fMRI data is useful to increase spatial resolution of movement-related potentials and can also be applied to other kinds of event-related potentials.

Spencer et al. [1999, 2001] demonstrated that these are two distinct components, both of which may be elicited, with different amplitudes, by both rare and novel events. However, the locations of the intracranial sources of the components remain unknown. We describe the application of cortical potential imaging (CPI) analysis to the data described by Spencer et al. [1999]. The ERPs were recorded from 15 healthy subjects presented with auditory oddball sequences. Cortical potential mars (CPMs) were reconstructed from the scalp potential maps (SPMs) corresponding to the P300 and Novelty P3 components by deblurring the smoothing effect of the head volume conductor. The reconstructed CPMs, derived from the SPMs by means of the CPI, showed localized areas of activity? distributed in both the frontal and parietal lobes; the parietal region was active throughout the period of the late positivities. The reconstructed CPMs associated with novel events showed prominent activity at the frontal lobe (Novelty P3) followed by progressively pronounced parietal lobe activity (P300), and these two components can be well separated by the CPMs. These analyses show how the CPI can be used to relate the scalp electrical recordings to the underlying brain activity.

It has generally been held that an ERP is the result of a set of discrete stimulus-evoked brain events. A recent study, however, provides new evidence to suggest that some ERP components might be generated by stimulus-induced changes in ongoing brain dynamics. This is consistent with views emerging from several neuroscientific fields, suggesting that phase synchronization of ongoing rhythms across different spatio-temporal scales mediates the functional integration necessary to perform higher cognitive tasks.

Entropy method is effective in describing the transition of clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. TDE is used to characterize ill a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in EEG signals. In this work TDE is computed for ERPs recorded from 14 healthy subjects in a cognitive task. From the experimental results, the dynamic characteristics of clinical brain electrical activities call be demonstrated by using nonextensive entropy method.

Ten patients with partial seizures and secondary generalization underwent preictal (upon hospital admission), postictal (less than or equal to 6 h after seizure), and interictal (7-48 h after seizure) ERP recordings of an auditory oddball paradigm. Preictal ERPs were compared to postictal and interictal recordings. Intraclass correlations, transformed into z scores, were utilized to analyze amplitude differences between electrodes placed on the hemisphere ipsilateral versus contralateral to the epileptogenic focus. The results showed that in 9 out of 10 patients the ERP amplitude was reduced in postictal compared to preictal recordings for electrodes placed ipsilateral to the epileptogenic focus (P < 0.0001). However, there was no difference in amplitude between ipsilateral and contralateral electrodes in preictal and interictal recordings. These findings suggest that postictal ERPs are of localizing value in patients with TLE while interictal ERPs are not. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Peak latencies of ERP components showed no significant change between straight eyes and averted eyes, but amplitude for averted eyes, particularly when averted to the right, was significantly larger than that for straight eyes at the lateral temporal electrode of the right hemisphere. Single-unit recordings in monkeys and neuroimaging studies in humans have revealed activity in the lateral temporal region, mainly the superior temporal sulcus, and a clinical study demonstrated the importance of the right hemisphere when viewing gaze direction. This is the first systematic neurophysiological report to confirm these findings using ERP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Electroencephalography was recorded from 129 electrodes in 10 healthy university students during presentation of pictures from the international affective picture system. Frequency measures and ERPs were obtained for pleasant, neutral. and unpleasant pictures. Results: In accordance with previous reports, a modulation of the late positive ERP wave at parietal recording sites was found as a function of emotional arousal. Early mid gamma band activity (GBA; 30-45 Hz) at 80 ms post-stimulus was enhanced in response to aversive stimuli only, whereas the higher GBA (46-65 Hz) at 500 ms showed an enhancement of arousing, compared to neutral pictures. ERP and late gamma effects showed a pronounced right-hemisphere preponderance, but differed in terms of topographical distribution. Conclusions: Late gamma activity may represent a correlate of widespread cortical networks processing different aspects of emotionally arousing visual objects. In contrast, differences between affective categories in early gamma activity might reflect fast detection of aversive stimulus features. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In certain rodent models, high versus low alcohol consumption is associated with similar neurophysiological differences. For example, alcohol-preferring (P) rats have increased spectral power and decreased P300 amplitudes compared with alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats. In the present study, the neurophysiological profiles of high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) rats were assessed (1) to determine if their electrophysiological profiles are similar to P and NP rats and (2) to examine the relationship of these neurophysiological indices to ethanol drinking. Methods: Ethanol-naive HAD and LAD rats were implanted with cortical and amygdalar recording electrodes. Baseline EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) then were assessed. Subsequently, all rats were trained to self-administer ethanol by using a sucrose-substitution procedure. Results: Baseline EEG and ERP (i.e., pre-ethanol exposure) were assessed based on line (HAD versus LAD) and actual ethanol consumption (high drinkers versus low drinkers). At baseline, ethanol-naive HAD rats displayed significantly greater power in the cortical EEG and decreased amygdala N1 ERP amplitude compared with ethanol-naive LAD rats. Similar EEG and ERP profiles have been observed when P and NP rats are compared. No differences in P300 between lines were observed, but high-drinking rats, independent of line, had significantly decreased P300 amplitude in the amygdala compared with low-drinking rats. Conclusions: These data suggest there are some similarities in EEG and ERP profiles of P and HAD rats compared with NP and LAD rats. Furthermore, the data suggest that decreased P300 amplitude in the amygdala is associated with increased limited access ethanol drinking.

Methods The study had a cross-over design with eight healthy volunteers (one drop out). It consisted of four legs with four different administrations: intranasal (i.n.) placebo, 4 mg diazepam i.n., 7 mg diazepam i.n. and 5 mg intravenous (i.v.) diazepam. Polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300) was used as a vehicle in the nasal formulations to solubilize a clinically relevant dose of diazepam. Changes in N100, P200 and P300 brain event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by auditory stimulation and electroencephalographic beta -activity were used to assess effects on neurological activity. Results The mean [95% confidence intervals] differences between before and after drug administration values of P300-N100 amplitude differences were -0.9 [ -6.5, 4.7] -6.4 [-10.1, -2,7], -8.6 [-11.4, -5.8] and -9.6 [-12.1, -7.1] for placebo, 4 mg i.n., 7 mg i.n. and 5 mg i.v. diazepam, respectively, indicating statistically significant drug induced effects. The bioavailabilities of 4 and 7 mg i.n. formulations, were found to be similar, 45% [32, 58] and 42% [22, 62], respectively. Conclusion The present study indicates that it is possible to deliver a clinically effective nasal dose of diazepam for the acute treatment of epilepsy, using PEG300 as a solubilizer.

Methods: EEG responses to button-press targets, from 14 subjects presented with 4 blocks of 150 stimuli (50% target probability), were examined. Pre-stimulus alpha activity (8-13 Hz) at Pz was assessed for each trial by digital filtering of the EEG. The alpha cycle at Pz, starting from a negative-going zero crossing, was used to sort trials into 4 phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz, and Pz. Results: Preferred brain states in this paradigm were indicated by an 8% greater occurrence of negative driving than positive driving, and a 33% greater occurrence of waxing than waning phases. Negative driving phases were associated with increased N1 latencies and decreased N2 amplitudes. Latencies of N1 and P2 were reduced in waxing phases. These reflected systematic changes in alpha frequency and amplitude at stimulus onset. Conclusions: In a fixed-inter-stimulus interval paradigm, component frequencies of the EEG are dynamically adjusted in order to provide brain states at the moment of stimulus presentation which differentially affect the EEG correlates of stimulus processing. Significance: The results add to our understanding of the genesis of the ERP, indicating the importance of the dynamic interplay between instantaneous EEG activity and stimulus processing reflected in the ERP, (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

To further test the Barabasz et al. (1999) hypothesis, we obtained EEG visual P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) from 20 high- and low-hypnotizable subjects. The effects of positive obstructive and negative CI obliterating instructions were tested during waking and alert hypnotic conditions. High-hypnotizables showed greater ERP amplitudes in response to the negative hallucination condition and lower ERP amplitudes in response to the positive obstructive hallucination when compared to the low-hypnotizables. Contrary to socio-psychological or role play conceptualizations, the hypnotic induction resulted in specific psychophysiological responses which could not be produced by waking imagination or by the lows who were trying to mimic hypnotic responding.

However, it is unclear whether EEG and ERPs are influenced by common or independent genetic factors. This study examined phenotypic and genetic correlations between EEG spectral power and P300 amplitude using data from 206 Dutch twin pairs, age 16 years. Multivariate genetic models (Cholesky decomposition) were fitted to the observed twin covariances using Mx software. In males, genetic correlations between P300 and EEG power measures were high (0.54-0.74); 30% of the total P300 variance could be explained by genetic factors influencing EEG delta power and 26% by P300-specific genetic factors (total heritability 56%). In females, 45% of P300 variance could be attributed to familial influences that were shared with the EEG. However, it was not possible to distinguish between the genetic versus shared environmental factors, consistent with previous analysis of P300 in this sample (van Beijsterveldt et al., 1998). The results suggest that a substantial proportion of genetic influences on P300 amplitude can be explained by strong heritability of slow EEG rhythms contributing to P300.

Thirty-seven subjects who stuttered and 25 nonstuttering subjects, matched for age, sex and education, were evaluated employing visual evoked potentials, auditory evoked potentials, event-related potentials (P-300), WISC-(IQ), and electroencephalography. A significant reduction of amplitude of P-loo of visual evoked potentia Is was found in stutterers with a significant prolongation of wave latencies I, III, V and interpeak latencies I-III and I-V in brainstem auditory evoked potentials. No significant abnormalities were recorded in P-200, N-200 and P-300 of event-related potentials in stutterers compared with the control group. The dominant EEG rhythm was slower in stutterers with a significant interhemispheric asymmetry compared with the control group. Fifty-four percent of the stutterers had pathological EEG. Epileptiform activities were recorded in 16.2% of stuttering subjects. Focal left temporal spike activity was recorded in 5.4% of stuttering subjects. The findings of this study point to a possible role of an organic etiopathogenesis of stuttering. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from 7 healthy volunteers while they performed spatial working memory tasks and while they rested quietly. Behavioral measures, EEG power spectra. and event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared between separate sessions in which subjects ingested either 10 mg/kg of phenytoin or placebo. Results: Peak serum levels of phenytoin were in the low therapeutic range. Although participants reported subjective effects of the drug, task accuracy and response time were not affected. In the resting EEG, phenytoin decreased power in the alpha band. In the task-related EEG, the frontal midline theta signal was enhanced in response to increased task difficulty following placebo but not following phenytoin. An attention-related augmentation of the N160 ERP to matching stimuli was also reduced by phenytoin. Conclusions: Neurophysiological measures displayed sensitivity to subtle alterations in attentional processing even in response to a dose of phenytoin too low to produce behavioral impairment. Such results indicate that EEG and ERP measures can provide information about the neurocognitive side effects of medications that cannot be inferred from cognitive task performance measures alone.

Our method uses ensembled electroencephalogram (EEG) data just as used in conventional averaging, however without the need for a priori data subgrouping into distinct categories (e.g,, stimulus-or event-related), and thus avoids conventional assumptions on response invariability. The competitive ANN, often described as a winner takes all neural structure, is based on dynamic competition among the net neurons where learning takes place only with the winning neuron, Using a simple single layered structure, the proposed scheme results in convergence of the actual neural weights to the embedded ERP patterns. The method is applied to real event-related potential data recorded during a common odd-ball type paradigm. For the first time, within-session variable signal patterns are automatically identified, dismissing the strong and limiting requirement of a priori stimulus-related selective grouping of the recorded data. The results present new possibilities in ERP research.

It is based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's t-statistic. Applied to event-related brain potential (ERP) data in brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms, the method provides fully automated detection and quantification of the ERP components that best discriminate between two samples of EEG signals and are, therefore, particularly suitable for classification of single-trial ERPs. A simple and fast CWT computation algorithm is proposed for the transformation of large data sets and single trials. The method was validated in the BCI Competition 2003 [1], where it was a winner (provided best classification) on two data sets acquired in two different BCI paradigms, P300 speller and slow cortical potential (SCP) self-regulation.

WS was computed for ERPs recorded from nine healthy subjects with three different types of stimuli, among them target stimuli in a cognitive task. A significant decrease of entropy was correlated with the responses to target stimuli (P300), thus showing that these responses correspond to a more "ordered" state than the spontaneous EEG. Furthermore, we propose the WS as a quantitative measure for such transitions between EEG ("disordered state") and ERP ("ordered state").

Until now, statistical tests for these two situations have developed separately. This work introduces statistical tests for assessing simultaneously the significance of spatiotemporal event-related potential/event-related field (ERP/ERF) components and that of their sources. The test for detecting a component at a given time instant is provided by a Hotelling's T-2 statistic. This statistic is constructed in such a manner to be invariant to any choice of reference and is based upon a generalized version of the average reference transform of the data. As a consequence, the proposed test is a generalization of the well-known Global Field Power statistic. Consideration of tests at all time instants leads to a multiple comparison problem addressed by the use of Random Field Theory (RFT). The Union-Intersection (UI) principle is the basis for testing hypotheses about the topographic and tomographic distributions of such ERP/ERF components.

For that purpose 74 individuals (Intelligence: M=107: S.D. = 12; range 73-35), of average creativity passively listened to two tones and performed two auditory, and two visual oddball tasks while their EEG was recorded. The approximate entropy parameters, peak latencies and amplitudes were determined. The correlation coefficients indicated that in the attended conditions, the more intelligent individuals showed more regular ERP waveforms than less intelligent individuals. It was further Found that less intelligent individuals showed increased P300 latencies and reduced amplitudes. The differences were explained with a more specific engagement of neural networks in more intelligent individuals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These signals are usually small in amplitude and are embedded in background electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. To analyze them the most common method used is to perform a simple averaging of time aligned ERP segments. However, this method assumes that the ERP signal will not change from segment to segment. In reality, this assumption is not true since the ERP may reflect the activity of cognitive mechanisms in the brain that may change over time. The failure to satisfy this assumption will result in loss of information after the averaging. Here we describe a method to analyze a single segment ERP in noise using the Wavelet Transform and the Hidden Markov Tree model. The goal is to reduce the noise content in the signal. We present experimental results using this method on both synthetic and real single-trial visual ERP signals.

The masked stimuli (line-drawings of coherent, familiar objects and scrambled, meaningless non-objects) were presented below, near, and above the subjective perceptual threshold. A prominent negative ERP deflection, peaking around 260-270 ms from stimulus onset, was observed only for the stimuli reaching subjective visual awareness. The results indicate a direct relationship between the crossing of the subjective threshold and this negative ERP deflection. A similar ERP response called 'visual awareness negativity' (VAN) has been observed in recent studies, using completely different stimulus manipulations (change blindness, reduced contrast stimuli). Hence, VAN appears to be a general electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness, observed in any experimental design that contrasts consciously perceived vs. unperceived visual stimuli.

Previous results with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggest that schizophrenia patients have attenuated MMN response and that preattentive auditory processing preceding MMN appears to be functionally asymmetric in schizophrenia. Here we studied parallel MMN activity of the hemispheres using a whole-head MEG by presenting stimulus blocks consisting of frequent standard and infrequent deviant tones to 15 schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy control subjects. Auditory evoked fields (AEFs) were recorded simultaneously over both auditory cortices. The equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling revealed that patients had significant MMNm reduction (magnetic counterpart of MMN) in both temporal lobes. In addition, patients had significantly delayed MMNm in the left but not in the right hemisphere to ipsilateral auditory stimuli. these results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have impaired auditory processing in the temporal lobes underlying preattentive stimulus discrimination that is also selectively delayed in the left hemisphere.

An algorithm was developed for estimation of ERP from a record with the statistically independent background EEG noise, which makes no prior assumptions about the frequency range or other properties of the ERP to be estimated. Results from a series of simulation and experiments show that, single trial ERP extraction could be realized by these processing methods, and the communication rates of BCI's would be improved.

Using 64 channel event-related potential (ERP) recording and source localization using distributed source model, we investigated, with high temporal resolution, whether similar or different spatiotemporal patterns of brain activation are involved in the perception of words of different languages and/or pictures. Experimental results seem to corroborate left hemispheric dominance in language processing, and temporal/spatial characteristics in word perception revealed by previous ERP and neuroimaging studies. Observed differences in spatial pattern of activation at specific time periods between English and Korean, and Korean and Chinese, could be explained in terms of required visual pattern analysis due to the orthographic characteristics of each language.

This may be due to a decrease in configural and an increase in featural processing. It is not known whether this processing is continuous or reflects two distinct processing systems. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the Thatcher effect on thatcherized and normal faces at varying orientations. The ERPs paralleled the perceptual illusion. The effect of thatcherization on upright faces was visible in P1 and N170 ERP components, possibly reflecting attentional engagement due to unpleasantness of thatcherized faces. Effects were also found over two later components, the P250 component, which has been related to configural recognition, and a late parietal component possibly reflecting featural processing. The effect of thatcherization on the two later components decreased gradually (for the P250 component) and abruptly (for the late parietal component) as the faces were rotated away from the upright.

Methods: ERP studies exploring various aspects of brain functioning in AD/HD are reviewed, ranging from early preparatory processes to a focus on the auditory and visual attention systems, and the frontal inhibition system. Implications of these data for future research and development in AD/HD are considered. Results: A complex range of ERP deficits has been associated with the disorder. Differences have been reported in preparatory responses, such as the contingent negative variation. In the auditory modality, AD/HD-related differences are apparent in all components from the auditory brain-stem response to the late slow wave. The most robust of these is the reduced posterior P3 in the auditory oddball task. There are fewer studies of the visual attention system, but similar differences are reported in a range of components. Results suggesting an inhibitory processing deficit have been reported, with recent studies of the frontal inhibitory system indicating problems of inhibitory regulation. Conclusions: The research to date has identified a substantial number of ERP correlates of AD/HD. Together with the robust AD/HD differences apparent in the EEG literature, these data offer potential to improve our understanding of the specific brain dysfunction(s) which result in the disorder. Increased focus on the temporal locus of the information processing deficit(s) underlying the observed range of ERP differences is recommended. Further work in this field may benefit from a broader conceptual approach, integrating EEG and ERP measures of brain function. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using an alternating checkerboard stimulus in a blocked presentation, visually evoked potentials were obtained with their expected configuration and latencies. A clustered echoplanar imaging protocol was applied to observe the hemodynamic response due to the visual stimulus interleaved with measuring ERPs. Influences of the electrode/amplifier set up on MRI scanning and the scanning process on the recording of electrophysiological signals are reported and discussed. Artifacts overlaid on the electrophysiological recordings were corrected by post hoc filtering methods presented here. Implications and limitations of conducting combined ERP/fMRI experiments using higher-level cognitive stimuli are discussed. Magn Reson Med 44: 277-282, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

For this aim, event-related potentials (ERPs) were analysed at 64 electrodes to evaluate the strength and timing of different stages of information processing in the brain. Electrophysiological indices of stimulus processing, sensorimotor integration/response selection and motor-related processing were used to compare the processing speed of young (n = 13, mean age = 22.5 years) and older adults (n = 14, mean age = 58.3 years) in simple- and choice-reaction tasks presented in two modalities, auditory and visual. The behavioural results showed significant ageing-related slowing, but only in the choice-reaction task. The quantification of separate central processing stages, in combination with advanced ERP methodology, helped to reveal that this slowing did not originate from the early processes of stimulus processing and response selection. Instead, it was produced by slower activation patterns over the contralateral motor cortex underlying response generation. It is concluded that ageing is accompanied by a functional dysregulation of motor cortex excitability during sensorimotor processing, with this deficit becoming progressively evident with greater task complexity.

Using responses to illusory figures in a visual oddball task, evoked potentials were obtained with their expected configurations and latencies. A rapid stimulation scheme using randomly varied trial lengths was employed, and class-wise characteristics of the hemodynamic response were obtained by a nonlinear analysis of the fMRI time series. Implications and limitations of conducting combined ERP-fMRI experiments using higher level cognitive stimuli are discussed. EEG/fMRI results revealed a sequential activation of striate and extrastriate occipital cortex along the ventral path of object processing for Kanizsa figures. Interestingly, Kanizsa figures activated the human motion area MT. Targets resulted in activations of frontal and parietal cortex which were not activated for standard stimuli.

J	Luu, P; Tucker, DM; Makeig, S				Luu, P; Tucker, DM; Makeig, S			Frontal midline theta and the error-related negativity: neurophysiological mechanisms of action regulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; supplementary motor area; error-related negativity; motor potentials; event-related potentials; theta; oscillations; phase resetting	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VISUOMOTOR TASK; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; FEEDBACK; ACTIVATION; RHYTHM; RESPONSES; DISSOCIATION	Objective: The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential (ERP) peak occurring between 50 and 100 ins after the commission of a speeded motor response that the subject immediately realizes to be in error. The ERN is believed to index brain processes that monitor action outcomes. Our previous analyses of ERP and EEG data suggested that the ERN is dominated by partial phase-locking of intermittent theta-band EEG activity. In this paper, this possibility is further evaluated. Methods: The possibility that the ERN is produced by phase-locking of theta-band EEG activity was examined by analyzing the single-trial EEG traces from a forced-choice speeded response paradigm before and after applying theta-band (4-7 Hz) filtering and by comparing the averaged and single-trial phase-locked (ERP) and non-phase-locked (other) EEG data. Electrical source analyses were used to estimate the brain sources involved in the generation of the ERN. Results: Beginning just before incorrect button presses in a speeded choice response paradigm, midfrontal theta-band activity increased in amplitude and became partially and transiently phase-locked to the subject's motor response, accounting for 57% of ERN peak amplitude. The portion of the theta-EEG activity increase remaining after subtracting the response-locked ERP from each trial was larger and longer lasting after error responses than after correct responses, extending on average 400 ms beyond the ERN peak. Multiple equivalent-dipole source analysis suggested 3 possible equivalent dipole sources of the theta-bandpassed ERN, while the scalp distribution of non-phase-locked theta amplitude suggested the presence of additional frontal theta-EEG sources. Conclusions: These results appear consistent with a body of research that demonstrates a relationship between limbic theta activity and action regulation, including error monitoring and learning.

We compared the effects of task (target vs, nontarget) and electrode (Fz, Ct, Pz) on P300 and ERD, and correlated P300 amplitude/latency with ERD maximal amplitude/latency across individuals. The major findings were that P300 as well as slow and fast alpha ERD manifested similar task and electrode effects. P300 preceded ERD and predicted individual variance of both slow and fast alpha ERD. The relationships of P300 with alpha ERD were different for the slow and fast alpha frequencies. These findings indicate that P300 and ERD are related such that slow and fast alpha ERDs are specifically guided or modified by the internal event(s) indexed by P300.

EEG alpha(1), delta, and theta frequency amplitudes decreased, whereas alpha(2) and beta frequency amplitude increased. Short, middle (EP) and long latency ERP were also studied in nonsmokers and smokers just after smoking, and after overnight abstinence from tobacco. Short latency potentials were unaffected by tobacco smoking or abstinence. Middle and long-latency potentials were reduced during abstinence and enhanced immediately after tobacco smoking. These findings indicate that compared to nonsmokers smokers have a higher arousal level after smoking than when partially abstinent. Evidence for both normalization from tobacco abstinence as well as stimulation was obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study repeats several of these earlier studies and reports on whether, and how, these findings can be utilized in our particular research/clinical situation. METHODS: Neurophysiological investigations were carried out on 37 schizophrenia patients, before and after commencing a clinically indicated trial of clozapine. Data from three areas of investigation - EEG, quantitative EEG (QEEG), and evoked response potential (ERP) - were compared with findings from earlier studies. Analysis was also extended to include clinical indicators, dosages, and several novel combinations of features. RESULTS: Our local population has a higher incidence of baseline abnormalities than that found in earlier investigations. Even with this difference, clozapine still leads to an increase in EEG slow-wave activity. The slow-wave increase is significantly correlated with an increase in P3 amplitude of the ERP. While QEEG changes were correlated with clinical changes, the ERP correlation did not reach significance levels. CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological findings, particularly from small numbers of studies, may not be generalizable to all populations. Findings which were replicated, however, support the potential use of slow wave changes in the EEG in clinical management.

The amplitude of P2 increases when subjects perceive the stimuli or pay attention to the stimuli. Six volunteer subjects were directed to look at a train of visual oddball stimuli. The oddball stimuli consisted of a square on one side and a circle on the other side of the visual field. Subjects were requested to push a button at the visual cue 800 ms after the target stimuli were displayed. EEG activities were recorded at 64 points over the head. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used for the source estimation. Event-related potential P2 was observed at around 200 ms after the onset of the target stimuli. The activity of the parietal and frontal region at P2 changed according to the attention to the hemi-visual field. The activity of the P2 may be located on the parietal lobe, and the frontal lobe (the frontal eye field) may be also activated according to the attention. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to elucidate frequency-specific behavioural effects and neurophysiological mediators, this study applied neurofeedback protocols to healthy volunteers, and assessed impact on behavioural and electrocortical attention measures. Operant enhancement of a 12-15 Hz component was associated with reduction in commission errors and improved perceptual sensitivity on a continuous performance task (CPT), while the opposite relation was found for 15-18 Hz enhancement. Both 12-15 Hz and 15-18 Hz enhancement were associated with significant increases in P300 event-related brain potential amplitudes in an auditory oddball task. These relations area interpreted as stemming from band-specific effects on perceptual and motor aspects of attention measures. NeuroReport 12:4155-4159 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Methods: This contribution was studied using a set of systematically varying experimental paradigms. Such a strategy enabled the demonstration of the variations in the event-related potentials and the event-related oscillations as task conditions and respective cognitive operations systematically changed. The study employed easy oddball, hard oddball, mismatch negativity and single stimulus paradigms and it was conducted on 42 healthy adults (age range 19-30 years, 26 females, 16 males) from the university student population. Data were analyzed with electrophysiological (selective averaging, amplitude frequency characteristics, digital filtering) and statistical methods (analysis of variance, multivariate step-down regression). Results: The data showed that the morphology of the ERP components for different experimental paradigms represented a specific pattern of superposition of the delta and theta oscillatory responses. Conclusions: The cognitive correlates of the oscillatory responses were discussed and the results were evaluated on the basis of the superposition principle and the theory of oscillatory neural assemblies.

Reaction times increased monotonically with larger angular displacements from the upright (for mental rotation) and with number of squares carried (for mental paper folding). Both the tasks resulted in amplitude modulation of an approximately 420-700 ms latency ERP component at parietal electrodes. Scalp topographies indicated that right parietal cortex was activated during mental rotation, but bilateral parietal regions were activated during mental paper folding. Our results support the notion of a right hemispheric superiority for tasks involving simple, single mental rotations, but indicate greater involvement of the left hemisphere when a more complex sequence of transformations are required. This task-dependent lability of hemispheric function may account for some of the inconsistent results reported by previous neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies.

Accurate detection has been demonstrated with this approach (near 100% on a few channels) using a single-channel cross-correlation template matching (CCTM) method. Several opportunities for improved detection accuracy have been identified. Detection using a multiple-channel CCTM method and a variety of detection methods that take advantage of the simultaneous occurrence of ERPs and event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) have been demonstrated to offer potential for improved detection accuracy.

Most of these studies analysed this face-specific brain potential using smiling faces as stimuli. In electrophysiological studies, however, differences in amplitude due to the emotional valence of the stimuli were described as early as 100 ms after stimulus presentation, In order to investigate the effect of facial expressions with different emotional content on face-specific brain EEG potentials, event-related potentials (ERPs) to faces with sad, happy and neutral expressions were compared to ERPs elicited with buildings in 16 healthy subjects. A face-specific potential at vertex approximately 160 ms after stimulus presentation has been verified in the present study. No significant differences in latency or amplitude of this component were found for different facial expressions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Do these responses reflect the activation of associative other than somatosensory systems? Anticipatory processes were probed by alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz) for the evaluation of thalamocortical channels and by negative event-related potentials for the evaluation of cortical excitability. Compared with the control condition, a progressive reduction of the alpha power was recognized over the primary somatosensory cortex from 2 s before the painful stimulation. In contrast, the anticipatory event-related potentials were negligible during the expectancy period. The results on the alpha power suggest that the expectancy of the painful stimulation specifically facilitated the somatosensory thalamocortical channel. Remarkably, the associative frontal-parietal areas were not involved, possibly due to the predictable and repetitive features of the painful stimulus. The present results also suggest that negative event-related potentials are modest preceding warned stimuli (even if painful) with a simple information content.

The single epoch ERPs that did and did not evoke an OR, were sub-averaged separately. The control subjects (but not the patient group), revealed delayed P 300 latency in the ERP sub-averages without ORs (ERP-OR), compared with ERP sub-averages with ORs (ERP+OR) Between-group analysis showed reduced N 100, N 200 and P 300 amplitudes (as well as delayed P300 latency) in the ERP+OR sub-average in patients with schizophrenia. In the ERP-OR sub-average, the patient group also had smaller N 100, N200 and P300 amplitudes, but larger P200 amplitude (compared with normal controls). This study shows the potential to tease out physiologically based OR sub-processes, by simultaneous acquisition and analysis of ERPs and autonomic electrodermal activity. Such ERP sub-averages (based on autonomic responses) highlight that multiple processes overlap across the trial, and their delineation may elucidate more specific patterns of disturbance in schizophrenia; than traditional averaged measures.

Wavelet transform (WT) is a powerful signal processing tool for extracting the ERP components occurring at different time and frequency spots. A technical explanation of WT in ERP processing and its four distinct applications are presented here. The first two applications aim to identify and localize the functional oddball ERP components in terms of certain wavelet coefficients in delta, theta and alpha bands in a topographical recording. The third application performs a similar characterization that involves a three stimulus paradigm. The fourth application is a single sweep ERP processing to detect the P300 in single trials. The last case is an extension of ERP component identification by combining the WT with a source localization technique. The aim is to localize the time-frequency components in three dimensional brain structure instead of the scalp surface. The time-frequency analysis using WT helps isolate and describe sequential and/or overlapping functional processes during ERP generation, and provides a possibility for studying these cognitive processes and following their dynamics in single trials during an experimental session.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from 20 students divided into two matched groups defined by their aerobic fitness level (cyclists vs. sedentary subjects). The session of post exercise ERPs was performed immediately after body temperature and heart rate returned to preexercise values. At rest, no significant differences were observed in ERP parameters between cyclists and sedentary subjects. This finding argued against the hypothesis that ERP modifications may be directly assumed by aerobic fitness level. The postexercise session of ERPs showed a significant P300 amplitude increase and a significant P300 latency decrease in all subjects. Similarly. N400 effect increased significantly after the maximal exercise in all subjects. ERP changes were of the same magnitude in the two groups. The present study argues for a general arousing effect of maximal aerobic exercise, independently of the aerobic fitness level.

Evidence is reviewed that LEP represent a series of event-related potentials (ERP) that depend on vigilance and arousal, selective spatial attention and contextual task variables. Paradigms adopted from other stimulus modalities in the assessment of attention and cognition in ERP and applied to LEP allow the view that middle-latency (NI) and long latency (N2-P2) components of LEP can be overlapped or supplemented by endogenous components such as the processing negativity and distinct members (P3a and P3b) of the "P300" activities, each of which is considered in detail in this review. This composite entity needs to be considered when LEP are experimentally or clinically used in the assessment of sensory and cognitive phenomena and abnormalities of pain sensation.

J	Frasnelli, J; Lotsch, J; Hummel, T				Frasnelli, J; Lotsch, J; Hummel, T			Event-related potentials to intranasal trigeminal stimuli change in relation to stimulus concentration and stimulus duration	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						intranasal trigeminal system; CO2; event-related potentials	ODOR IDENTIFICATION; NASAL-MUCOSA; DISCRIMINATION	Few data are available on the relation of EEG-derived trigeminal event-related potentials (ERPs) to stimulus duration or stimulus concentration. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the relation between ERP components and both stimulus duration and stimulus concentration. Twenty healthy young subjects participated. Trigeminal ERPs were recorded after stimulation with CO2. Five concentrations (45 to 65% volume per volume CO2) and five stimulus durations (100 to 300 msec) were used. Trigerninal ERPs were quantified in terms of amplitudes and latencies of its major peaks N-410 (termed NI) and P-622 (termed P3). The relation between stimulus duration, concentration, and amplitudes or latencies of trigeminal ERP components could be described as a model of power, following the formula p = b + k(.)I(gl.)D(g2). A linear relationship was found between stimulus concentration, amplitude N1, and amplitude P3, and between stimulus duration and amplitude P3 respectively. Furthermore, a linear relationship was seen between intensity ratings, and stimulus duration and concentration. These data confirm that the different ERP components encode different stimulus characteristics. Specifically, later components of the trigeminal ERP encode not only stimulus concentration but, other than earlier ERP components, also encode stimulus duration. Thus, they reflect the integration of stimuli over relatively long periods of time.

This is because these technologies have good temporal resolution, are relatively noninvasive, and (with the exception of MEG) are economical. Many different experimental paradigms and analysis techniques for the assessment of psychiatric patients involving these technologies are reviewed including conventional quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG), EEG cordance, low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), frontal midline theta, midlatency auditory evoked potentials (P50, N100, P300), loudness dependency of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), mismatch negativity (MMN), contingent negative variation (CNV), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Many of these neurophysiologic stimulus paradigms hold the promise of improving psychiatric patient care by improving diagnostic precision, predicting treatment response, and providing new phenotypes for genetic studies. Large cooperative multisite studies need to be designed to test and validate a few of these paradigms so that they might find use in routine clinical practice. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from magnetic resonance images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimate based on boundary element mathematics. Furthermore, determination of the priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated voxels) and event-related (coupling of activated voxels) fMRI. Linear inverse source estimates of cortical activity were regularized by taking into account the covariance of background EEG sensor noise. As an example, these methods were applied to EEG (128 electrodes) and fMRI data, which were recorded in separate sessions while normal subjects executed voluntary right one-digit movements.

Essentially a functional MR imaging technique, EEG-fMRI can provide whole-brain maps of those changes, and hence has the potential to give a new form of localizing information on the generators of epileptiform discharges. The author briefly reviews the problem of localization in epilepsy and, in particular, the roles of EEG and functional MR imaging, and then discusses the motivations for combined EEG and functional MR imaging experiments, the possible ways in which the data can be acquired, and the associated technical requirements. This is followed by a presentation of the analysis methods used and a discussion of the applications of EEG-fMRI in epilepsy. An overview and discussion of the main findings and ideas for future research is also provided.

Methods: We monitored auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) before and after elective cardiac operation in 29 patients. Sedation levels, induced with propofol, were evaluated clinically with Ramsay score (RS). Results: During deep sedation (RS 6), patients could be categorized into 3 groups according to ERP responses evoked by a standard 'oddball' paradigm. In one group, there were no cortical responses indexing the detection of a sound (N100), another group showed clear responses, and the third group was characterized by a later P300a component which was taken to reflect orienting to a novel stimulus in adults who were awake. However, in deep sedation, P300a did not show behaviour characteristic to an orienting reaction. In moderate sedation (RS4), all the patients showed a visible N100. Total sedative propofol dose. hemodynamics and the spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) were not connected to the category of an individual's responses. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the detection and automatic auditory information processing function during postoperative sedation, and may signal the individual stages of awakening in a sensitive way. In addition, the findings suggest a deficit in sensory memory function during sedation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Ten healthy young students were told to fall asleep ignoring the tones presented through a loudspeaker above their head, Standard (1000 Hz, P = 0.90). high deviant (1200 Hz, P = 0.05), and low deviant (1050 Hz, P = 0.05) tones were presented in a quasirandom order with a fixed stimulus onset asynchrony of 500 ms. ERP waveforms were obtained separately for 5 successive stages characterized by typical electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns of the sleep onset period. The EEG staging was made manually with very short (5 s) scoring epochs. Results. The MMN appeared in wakefulness and in the early phase of stage 1 sleep (EEG stage II) but disappeared when low-voltage theta waves emerged after alpha flattening (EEG stage m). Instead P240 and N360 developed particularly for high deviant tones. Conclusions: Concurrently with the disappearance of alpha waves, the automatic change detection system in wakefulness seems to stop operating and a different steep-specific system becomes dominant.

The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is elicited through the superposition of the delta (1 - 3 Hz) and theta (3 - 7 Hz) band oscillatory responses. The cholinergic neurotransmitter system has a key function in modulating excitatory postsynaptic potentials caused by glutamate, and therefore influences P300 generation and the underlying oscillatory responses. Here we report significant linkage and linkage disequilibrium between target case frontal theta band, visual evoked brain oscillations and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from the cholinergic muscarinic receptor gene (CHRM2) on chromosome 7. We also demonstrate significant linkage disequilibrium between CHRM2 SNPs and target case parietal delta band visual evoked oscillations (LD P<0.001). These findings were not observed for the equivalent non-target case data, suggesting a role for the CHRM2 gene in higher cognitive processing in humans. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: EEG was recorded while subjects attended to flickering LEDs in either the right or left visual hemifield and responded by a button press to isoluminant color changes (targets). Results: Target isoluminant color changes elicited the typical ERP components P1, N1, N2 and P3, which were enhanced for attended targets compared to unattended targets. Consistent with previous findings, SSVEP amplitude was enlarged for attended flicker stimuli at posterior electrode sites contralateral to the attended visual hemifield. In addition, significant correlations were found between the N1, N2 and the SSVEP attention effects, whereas no such correlations were found between the P1, P3 and SSVEP attention effects. Conclusions: Results suggest that the SSVEP and ERP reflect partially overlapping attentional mechanisms that facilitate the discriminative processing of stimuli at attended locations.

By applying quantifiers based on wavelet entropy, it is demonstrated that a short-lasting ordering of the complex post-stimulus EEG signal occurs as a result of a transient synchronization in the theta frequency channel. Further, by using a developmental model it is shown that, independently of the frequency content of the background EEG and ERPs, a highly-ordered microstate in the ERP is always determined by theta frequency. Thus, transient dominance of synchronized theta oscillations may reflect an important functional mechanism subserving stimulus information processing.

J	Cacace, AT; McFarland, DJ				Cacace, AT; McFarland, DJ			Spectral dynamics of electroencephalographic activity during auditory information processing	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Evoked Response Audiometry Study Group Meeting	JUL, 2001	VANCOUVER, CANADA			electroencephalography; event-related synchronization; event-related desynchronization; event-related brain dynamics; spectral analysis; time domain analysis; psychophysics	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; ALPHA; GAMMA; THETA; P300; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT	Dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during auditory information processing were evaluated in response to changes in stimulus complexity, stimulus discriminability and attention using the oddball paradigm. In comparison to pre-stimulus baseline conditions, auditory stimulation synchronized EEG activity in delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. Event-related synchronization (ERS) effects were greatest at approximately 3 Hz (theta frequency band), and their magnitude depended on stimulus and task demands. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG activity was observed in the beta frequency band. This effect was greatest at approximately 21 Hz but occurred only for easily discriminable stimuli inattention-related target conditions. Because active discrimination tasks also required a button-press response with the right hand, ERDs involved more complex responses that may be related to a combination of perceptual, motor and cognitive processes. These results demonstrate that oddball and attention-related EEG responses to auditory stimulation could be characterized in the frequency domain. The specific design and analysis features described herein may prove useful since they provide a simple index of the brain's response to stimulation while at the same time provide powerful information not contained in typical time domain analysis.

The results of this study suggest that the amplitude of the c247 to repeated pictures of common objects was decreased significantly as compared to the unrepeated pictures for the LR group, but the same was not observed in the HR group. For the matching stimulus we describe an application of an artificial neural network (ANN) technique together with a feature extraction, the wavelet transform, for the classification of ERPs. Two classes of ERP were used: HR for alcoholism and LR for alcoholism. The architecture of the ANN used in the classification is a three-layered feedforward network that implements the backpropagation of error learning algorithm. After training, the network with wavelet coefficients was able to correctly classify over 71% of the HR and LR class of ERP.

Modern engineering principles suggest that excellent EEG signals can be collected with high scalp impedance (approximate to 40 k Ohm) without scalp abrasion. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of electrode-scalp impedance on EEG data quality. Methods: The first section of the paper reviews electrophysiological recording with modern high input-impedance differential amplifiers and subject isolation, and explains how scalp-electrode impedance influences EEG signal amplitude and power line noise. The second section of the paper presents an experimental study of EEG data quality as a function of scalp-electrode impedance for the standard frequency bands in EEG and event-related potential (ERP) recordings and for 60 Hz noise. Results: There was no significant amplitude change in any EEG frequency bands as scalp-electrode impedance increased from less than 10 k Ohm (abraded skin) to 40 k Ohm (intact skin). 60 Hz was nearly independent of impedance mismatch, suggesting that capacitively coupled noise appearing differentially across mismatched electrode impedances did not contribute substantially to the observed 60 Hz noise levels. Conclusions: With modern high input-impedance amplifiers and accurate digital filters for power line noise, high-quality EEG can be recorded without skin abrasion.

Objective: The central mode of action of SAMe was investigated in 20 healthy volunteers by mapping of electroencephalograms (EEGs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Design: In an acute and Subacute, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. subjects received in random order infusions of 800 mg SAMe and placebo for 7 d, with a washout period of 3 wk between the 2 treatment periods. EEG recordings were made 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after and ERP recordings were made 0 and I h after the drug infusions on days 1 and 7. Results: Multivariate analyses of variance and Hotelling T-2 tests showed significant acute and subacute encephalotropic effects of SAMe compared with placebo. Acute pharmaco-EEG changes were typical of classic antidepressants of the thymoleptic type; subacute alterations were typical of cognition enhancers. Regarding ERPs, standard N1 and P2 latencies were shortened, and tar-et P300 latencies were lengthened. N1 amplitudes increased after subacute treatment, and temporooccipital P300 amplitudes increased after the acute dose. Similar changes were described for antidepressants. LORETA showed that the N2 source strength increased in both the left and the right temporal lobes, whereas the P300 source strength increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal regions and decreased in the ventral limbic regions. Conclusion: EEG-ERP mapping identified SAMe as an antidepressant. LORETA targeted brain regions crucial in the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants.

J	Pavlenko, VB; Konareva, IN				Pavlenko, VB; Konareva, IN			Individual personality-related characteristics of event-related EEG potentials recorded in an experimental situation requiring production of time intervals	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials; readiness potential; contingent negative variation; P300 potential; production of time intervals; interindividual variability; personality-related specificity	P300; BRAIN	Event-related EEG potentials (ERP) were recorded from 75 tested adult men and women; recording was performed from C3 and C4 points. The experimental situation required internal counting of time intervals limited by two pushes of a button. The experimental paradigm provided a substantial level of uncertainty, and a high level of attention needed to be maintained. The tested subjects were not informed by the experimenter about the precise value of the preset time interval; they knew only its limits, 17-23 sec. The subject obtained information about the agreement or disagreement between the produced interval and its value preset by the experimenter by visual feedback signals obtained 2 sec after termination of counting; in the case of agreement the subject had to perform a confirming (third) push of the button. Pushes were preceded by readiness potentials (RP); contingent negative variation (CNV) developed before the feedback signals, and the latter were accompanied by P300 potentials. Significant positive correlations were found between the parameters of RP and P300 in both hemispheres. In general, ERP were characterized by very high interindividual variability, which in a few respects correlated with the personality-related characteristics of tested subjects evaluated by psychological testing with the use of corresponding questionnaires. In particular, under the experimental conditions used, negative correlations were observed between the RP amplitude and psychotism indices, CNV amplitude and emotional stability; CNV amplitude and extroversive features, and P300 amplitude and domination properties of a person. Positive correlations were observed between the CNV amplitude and autia factor (according to Eysenck's PEN and Cattell's 16 PF questionnaires). We suppose that correlations between the personal psychical features and ERP parameters are grounded in both inherited constitutional specificities of the nervous system and neurochemical/structural modifications in the brain determined by the acquired vital experience.

Healthy subjects performed a visual three-stimulus oddball paradigm with a difficult discrimination task while fMRI and high-density ERP data were acquired in separate sessions. This paradigm allowed us to differentiate the P3b component of the P300, which has been implicated in the detection of rare events in general (target and distractor), from the P3a component, which is mainly evoked by distractor events. The fMRI-constrained source model explained >99% of the variance of the scalp ERP for both components. The P3b was mainly produced by parietal and inferior temporal areas, whereas frontal areas and the insula contributed mainly to the P3a. This source model reveals that both higher visual and supramodal association areas contribute to the visual P3b and that the P3a has a strong frontal contribution, which is compatible with its more anterior distribution on the scalp. The results point to the involvement of distinct attentional subsystems in target and distractor processing.

Our study explored ERP activity for vergence eye movements used for the adjustment of the angle of the visual axes to the distance of the object. These movements are essential when exploring the natural 3D world. Subjects made the following visually guided movements to LED targets: pure convergence or divergence along the median plane, pure lateral saccades within the same distance, and combined movements (lateral and divergent or convergent). ERPs were recorded from 14 surface electrodes and were analyzed for 200 ms prior to the onset of the eye movement. The highest activation was observed prior to vergence. Activation was diffused and peaked at 50 ms prior to the onset of vergence. Combined vergence and sacccadic movements revealed a composite pattern of ERP activity from both saccades and pure vergence. These findings suggest a cortical substrate for vergence eye movements in humans that is engaged in the natural exploration of visual space.

The recorded event-related potentials (ERP) were analyzed in the time and frequency domains. In the music response condition the ERP peak latencies on the left hemisphere increased, whereas on the right hemisphere a decrease of peak latencies as compared with the silence response condition was observed. In the theta, lower-1 alpha and gamma band increases in induced event-related coherences were observed while respondents solved the oddball task and listened to music, whereas a decoupling of brain areas in the gamma band was observed in the silence response condition. It is suggested that auditory background stimulation can influence visual brain activity, even if both stimuli are unrelated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a pattern recognition approach that allows for a robust single trial detection of this error potential from multichannel EEG signals. By designing classifiers that are capable of bounding false positives (FP), which would classify correct responses as errors, we achieve performance characteristics that make this method appealing for response-verification or even response-correction in EEG-based communication, i.e., brain-computer interfacing (BCI). This method provides a substantial improvement over the choice of a simple amplitude threshold criterion, as it had been utilized earlier for single trial detection of error potentials.

J	Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ				Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ			Issues relating to the subtraction phase in EOG artefact correction of the EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; EOG; correction; ocular artefact; subtraction phase; forward propagation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL; P300	An important method for removing the effect of ocular artefact from the EEG is 'EOG correction'. This method estimates the proportion of ocular artefact that is in the EEG, and removes it by subtraction. To date, EOG correction research has focused on problems relating to the estimation of the correction coefficients. Using both mathematical rationale and empirical data, this paper addresses issues relating to the subtraction phase, such as the magnitude of error that can be expected due to EOG correction. Using ERP methodology, principal component and regression analyses, it is shown that the N1P2 complex propagates forward to the horizontal and radial (but not vertical) electrooculograms (EOG), and it is shown mathematically that this will result in EOG-correction error. Assuming an accurate estimate of ocular contamination of the EEG, maximal subtraction-phase error of the N1P2 complex was found to be a prefrontal attenuation of 15-22%, decreasing to central and occipital enhancements of 3-4% and 13-14%, respectively. The magnitude of this subtraction-phase error is compared to between-subject ERP variability and to error associated with EOG rejection (omitting data contaminated by ocular artefact). It is argued that such EOG correction error is small relative to both artefact rejection procedures and to normal variability found in ERP studies, and that it is less pernicious than artefact rejection procedures.

Refinement of the scale beyond a certain level would therefore not improve overall judgmental accuracy and consistency but just impose a heavier burden on their limited computational capacity. An experiment of probabilistic judgment was conducted to test this hypothesis. Results from both behavioral data and event-related potentials in EEG recordings supported our hypothesis.

So far, this question has only been addressed for early ERP components. Late ERP components, however, are generally thought to represent superimposed activities of several anatomically distinct brain areas. Thus, the question of which mechanism underlies the genesis of late ERP components cannot be easily answered based on scalp recordings. In contrast, two well-investigated late ERP components recorded invasively from within the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) in epilepsy patients, the so-called MTL-P300 and the anterior MTL-N400 (AMTL-N400), are based on single source activity. Hence, we investigated whether the MTL-P300 and the AMTL-N400 are based on an event-related activity increase, a phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity or both. ERPs were recorded from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex in subjects performing a visual oddball paradigm and a visual word recognition paradigm. With wavelet techniques, stimulus-related phase-locking and power changes were analyzed in a frequency range covering 2 to 48 Hz. We found that the MTL-P300 is accompanied by both phase reset and power increase P300 and that both effects overlap partly in time. In contrast, the AMTL-N400 is initially associated with phase locking without power increase and only later during the course of the out AMTL-N400 we observed an additional power increase. In conclusion, both aspects, event-related activation of neural assemblies and phase resetting of ongoing activity seem to be involved in the generation of late ERP components as recorded in cognitive tasks. Therefore, separate analysis of event-related power and phase-locking changes might reveal specific related insights into the mechanisms underlying different cognitive functions.

The stimulus intensity, at which each subject could detect 50% of the presented stimuli, was defined as the sensory threshold for that subject. Single ERP trials were separated into two groups: trials with detected and undetected stimuli. The ERPs and the average power spectra of the 1 s prestimulus periods were computed for both conditions. P300 amplitudes of the ERPs, and total power and relative band powers of the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-70 Hz) frequency bands of the prestimulus power spectra were measured. Between the two conditions, a specific difference was observed in the relative power of the alpha band, which was significantly lower before detected stimuli (p < 0.01) in line with significantly higher amplitudes of the ERPs (p < 0.001). These results show that short-lasting changes in brain's excitability state are reflected the relative alpha power of the EEG, which may explain significant variability in perceptual processes and ERP generation especially at boundary conditions such as sensory threshold.

A Genetic Perspective on the Developing Brain Electrophysiological Indices of Neural Functioning in Young and Adolescent Twins	EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						Genetics; heritability; twins; brain; EEG; ERP; P300; development; age		Changes in genetic and environmental influences on electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) indices of neural development were studied in two large cohorts of young (N = 418) and adolescent (N = 426) twins. Individual differences in these indices were largely influenced by genetic factors, and throughout development, the stable part of the variance was mainly genetic. Both EEG power (which describes the amount of variability in brain electrical potentials that can be attributed to different frequencies) and long-distance EEG coherence (which is the squared cross-correlation between two EEG signals at different scalp locations and can be regarded as an index for cortico-cortical connectivity) were highly heritable. ERP-P300 latencies and amplitudes were low to moderately heritable. Clear differences between young children and adolescents could be observed in the heritabilities of EEG and ERP indices. The heritabilities of EEG power and EEG coherence were higher in adolescents than in children, whereas the heritabilities of P300 latencies were lower. Both cohorts (young children and adolescents) were measured twice: The children were tested when they were 5 and again at 7 years, the adolescents when they were 16 and again at 18 years. Therefore, within these age ranges a more detailed analysis of age-related changes in heritabilities and in the emergence of new genetic influences could be studied. The heritabilities of EEG powers and P300 amplitudes and latencies did not change much from age 5 to age 7 and from age 16 to 18 years. The heritabilities of a substantial number of connections within the cortex, however, as indexed by EEG coherence, changed significantly from age 5 to age 7, though not from age 16 to 18. The only changes in the heritabilities in adolescents were connections within the prefrontal cortex, which is in agreement with theories of adolescent development. These age-related changes in the heritabilities may reflect a larger impact of maturation on cortico-cortical connectivity in childhood than in adolescence. Evidence was found for qualitative changes in brain electrophysiology in young children: New genetic factors emerged at age 7 for posterior EEG coherences and for P300 latency at some scalp locations. This supports theories of qualitative stage transitions in this age range, as previously suggested using behavioral and EEG data.	[van Baal, G. C. M.; van Beijsterveldt, C. E. M.; Boomsma, D.

Methods: Twenty intractable epileptic patients with depth electrodes at several intracranial locations in the frontal, temporal, parietal lobes, and in the amygdalo-hippocampal complex participated in the study. To evoke the ERP, a standard visual oddball task was used with target stimuli, and frequent non-habituated and habituated stimuli. The averaged responses of the 3 groups were superimposed and visually analyzed whether the shape appeared identical or non-identical. Results: The EEG response to target and frequent stimuli was recorded in 660 intra-cerebral sites. In 88 sites (14 different patients) localized in the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri, fusiform and lingual gyri, sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cingulated gyrus, the identical ERPs to target and both groups of frequent stimuli were observed. In 442 sites located in the above listed structures, and in the basal ganglia and parietal cortex, the shape of the ERP differed from 0.3 to 0.47 s on after the stimulus. The remaining 130 sites did not yield the task-specific potential change. Conclusions: The existence of identical ERPs to target and frequent stimuli in the oddball task suggests that a part of mental operations underlying the brain engagement in this task is not dependent on the way of responding.

Some advantages and disadvantages of the system, as applied to infants, are discussed. First, we illustrate that high-density data can be recorded from infants at comparable quality to that observed with conventional (low density) ERP methods. Second, we discuss ways to utilize the greater spatial information available by applying source separation and localization procedures. In particular, we focus on the application of one recent source separation method, Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Finally, we show that source localization can be applied to infant high-density data, although this entails adopting a number of assumptions that remain to be verified. In the future, with improved source separation algorithms, we suggest that single-trial or single-subject analyses may become feasible.

J	Ogilvie, RD				Ogilvie, RD			The process of falling asleep	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						sleep onset; sleep onset period (SOP); Hori nine-stage system; QEEG; ERP.; narcolepsy; insomnia; head injury; sleep apnoea	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLEEP-ONSET PERIOD; SLOW EYE-MOVEMENTS; TOPOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; HYPNAGOGIC IMAGERY; EEG ACTIVITY; REM-SLEEP; LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY; BRAIN	The process of falling asleep can best be measured by considering a convergence of behavioural, EEG, physiological and subjective information. Doing so allows one to see sleep processes as they unfold, but relying on any single sleep index can bias the description of this complex process. The studies reviewed do not support the idea that sleep begins "in a moment", but rather that entry into sleep is a continuous, interwoven series of changes which begin in relaxed drowsiness and continue through stage I, often into the first minutes of stage 2. The transition from waking brain to sleeping brain is traced accurately by Hori's nine-stage EEG system. Event-related potential (ERP) studies map complex changes in information processing as sleep begins, while quantitative EEG investigations have identified important spatiotemporal re-organisations of primary EEG frequencies which take place as one moves from waking to sleeping mode. To consider evidence from multiple levels of analysis, a three step electrophysiological model of central nervous system (CNS) regulation during sleep onset is proposed: initial processes appear to be alpha-related; intermediate processes, poorly studied to date. parallel the development of theta and vertex sharp wave activity, while the processes which terminate wakefulness are sigma sleep spindle-related. Clinical investigations of the sleep onset period in people with narcolepsy, insomnia, depression or sleep apnoea appear to indicate the presence of relatively unique electrophysiological signatures which may be of clinical significance.

The purpose of the present study was to extend the assessment of the neurophysiological indices associated with alcohol consumption to a recently developed mouse model of high ethanol consumption, the first replicate line of high alcohol preferring (HAP-1) and low alcohol preferring (LAP-1) mice. Male HAP-1, LAP-1, and HS mice from the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado Health Science Center (i.e., HS/Ibg mice) were implanted with cortical electrodes. EEG activity, and event related potentials (ERPs) were then examined. Following electrophysiological assessment, ethanol preference was assessed to examine the relationship between neurophysiological indices and ethanol consumption. EEG analyses revealed that HAPs and HS/Ibgs had greater peak frequency in the 2-4-Hz band and lower peak frequency in the 6-8- and 1-50-Hz bands of the cortical EEG compared to LAPs. Compared to HAPs, LAPs and HS/Ibgs had decreased peak EEG frequency in the 8-16-Hz band. Decreased parietal cortical power from 8 to 50 Hz was associated with high initial ethanol preference in HAP mice. In regards to ERPs, P1 amplitude was greater in HAPs compared to both LAPs and HS/Ibgs and the P3 latency in LAPs was decreased compared to both HAPs and HS/Ibgs. As expected, HAPs consumed more ethanol and had higher ethanol preference than LAPs and HS/Ibgs. There were no significant differences in ethanol intake or preference between HS/Ibgs and LAPs. These data indicate that selective breeding of the HAP and LAP lines has resulted in the divergence of EEG and ERP phenotypes. The differences observed suggest that increased cortical P1 amplitude and altered cortical EEG activity in the 8-50-Hz frequency range may be neurophysiological 'risk factors' associated with high ethanol consumption in mice. Decreased P3 latency in LAPs compared to HAPs and HS/Ibgs mice may be a 'protective factor'. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All right's reserved.

We compared processing of semantic meaning in language and music, investigating the semantic priming effect as indexed by behavioral measures and by the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators. Our results indicate that both music and language can prime the meaning of a word, and that music can, as language, determine physiological indices of semantic processing.

Both species were presented with a total of 100 auditory stimuli, divided into four blocks of 25 stimuli. By means of wavelet denoising, single-trial ERPs were established in both humans and rats. The auditory ERPs were characterized by the presence of two positive and two negative waves in both humans and rats, albeit with different latencies in the two species (P1, N1, P2, and N2). The results showed decreased amplitudes within blocks for the N1, P2, and N2 components in humans and for the N1 and P2 components in rats. Decreased amplitudes across blocks were found for the N2 component in humans and for the P2 and N2 components in rats. In both humans and rats, response decrements within a block were thus most prominent for the early ERP components, whereas the changes across blocks were most prominent for the later components. These results suggest a correspondence of the ERP correlates of elemental stimulus processing between humans and rats. It is further suggested that the observed amplitude reductions may reflect habituation and/or recovery cycle processes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The P300 component of event-related electrical potentials (ERP) has been related to the different degree of damage to gray and white matter. This study explores the possible relationship between P300 amplitude and/or latency and the existence of degenerative processes in schizophrenia, by assessing its correlation with volume of sulcal CSF and duration of illness, as transversal indicators of neurodegeneration, Nineteen patients (14 males, 5 females) and 13 controls (6 males, 7 females) were studied with MRI and electrophysiologic al records (P300). The possible influence of sex and age at the time of the exploration was statistically controlled in both groups. The results show a significant negative correlation between P300 amplitude and prefrontal CSF volume in the patient group. A lower though still significant correlation was also found between P300 amplitude and duration of illness, whereas no correlation was found in the control group. These results support the hypothesis that P300 amplitude may be interpreted as a marker of neurodegeneration in schizophrenia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The present association study was designed to test whether EEG and ERPs are modulated by genetic variations of the human GABA(A) beta2 (GABRB2) and gamma2 (GABRG2) genes on chromosome 5q33. The genotypes of two nucleotide substitution polymorphisms of the GABRB2 and GABRG2 genes were assessed in 95 psychiatrically healthy subjects of German descent. Neurophysiological phenotyping was performed with four factorized EEG/ERP parameters: EEG activation, anterior and posterior EEG synchronization, and event-related activity (N100/P200-complex). No genotypic association was found for the GABRB2 nucleotide exchange polymorphism with any electrophysiological parameter. A significant association was found between the genotype of the intronic GABRG2 G-->A nucleotide exchange and the event-related N100/P200 (ANOVA: F=3.81; df=2; P=0.026). A comparison of homozygous subjects carrying either the G/G or A/A genotype of the GABRG2 polymorphism consistently revealed an even stronger difference in the effect-size (ANOVA: F=11.13; df=1; P=0.002). Post hoc analysis of this association with current density analysis in three-dimensional neuroanatomic Talairach space-time showed a reduction in the event-related signal power after 120 ms in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Taking into account the risk of false-positive association findings attributable to multiple testing, our results encourage further replication studies to examine the phenotype-genotype relationship of GABRG2 gene variants and event-related prefrontal activity.

These measures can be readily used in infants and children, and we present some examples of their application to understanding cognitive development. The most widely used of these techniques for developmental research is the method of event-related potentials (ERPs). In addition, the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the more rarely used invasive, intracranial investigations are also important to furthering our knowledge of how the brain-behaviour relations develop. The paper summaries practical issues and presents some selected examples of experimental and clinical research.

Methods: In an experimental study (9 subjects), the probability-classification analysis of single-trial spectral EEG changes was utilized. Results were compared with auditory ERD/ERS. Results: It was shown that (1) variability of EEG spectral patterns was considerable, (2) EEG activity was different at various task stages, (3) probability measures were different from the results of conventional frequency analysis, (4) probability of trials with alpha- and theta-patterns was characteristically different in various task stages, (5) the occurrence of alpha- and theta-trials were most probable, but not frequent enough to characterize all the trials. The results suggest that the ERD/ERS responses are influenced by EEG characteristics in the pre-stimulus interval, which also have a strong influence on the EEG in the post-stimulus interval. Conclusions: Alpha- and theta-ERD/ERS responses during memory task performance are not typical for all trials. They reflect EEG changes only in similar to39% for alpha-activity and similar to43% for theta-oscillations of all trials, what reflects piecewise stationary EEG structure.

In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) to a secondary task were derived to determine whether they would provide an additional degree of workload specificity. Participants were run in an adaptive automation condition, in which the system switched between manual and automatic task modes based on the value of each individual's own EEG engagement index; a yoked control condition; or another control group, in which task mode switches followed a random pattern. Adaptive automation improved performance and resulted in lower levels of workload. Further, the P300 component of the ERP paralleled the sensitivity to task demands of the performance and subjective measures across conditions. These results indicate that it is possible to improve performance with a psychophysiological adaptive automation system and that ERPs may provide an alternative means for distinguishing among levels of cognitive task demand in such systems. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved methods for assessing operator workload and performance.

Parallel thereto the event-related potentials (ERP) were derived during the test at the electrode positions Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz with reference to the linked pars. Results: Two components of the contingent negative variation (CNV) with different topography were identified in the ERP fallowing a preparatory stimulus (CNV-1: 600 to 1100 ms and CNV-2: 1000 to 1500 ms after: the stimulus). There were no group differences at the behavioural level (number of correct detected targets number of errors. Significant group differences resulted with regard to the topography of the two CNV components; Children with ADD showed an attenuated frontal CNV-I amplitude and a trend towards increased CNV-I and CNV-2 occipital amplitudes. Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis of impaired frontal inhibitory processes in children and ADD.

Since the EEGs are evoked by the event of visualizing characters, they are considered as one kind of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). The authors measured and analyzed the ERPs, then clarified the changes of EEGs during repetition of visualizing characters through correlations among them. Finally the authors discussed difference among ERPs that were evoked by visualizing different characters, and the possibility about an estimation of the visualized characters.

We studied the relationship between apathetic state after subcortical stroke and neural orienting response to novel events using an event-related evoked potential (ERP) technique. Methods - Twenty-nine patients with subcortical ischemic stroke were grouped according to whether they showed apathy or not. We analyzed apathy state scaled by the modified Starkstein apathy score and auditory P3 ERP components evoked by task-relevant target stimuli ( target P3) and task-irrelevant novel stimuli ( novelty P3). Results - The apathetic group showed a significantly lower score of verbal fluency test and global cognitive function test compared with the nonapathetic group. The novelty P3 latency was significantly prolonged, and its amplitude was reduced over the frontal site in the apathy group. The apathy scale was correlated with the novelty P3 latency and amplitude at the frontal site. The target P3 measures were related to global cognitive function. Conclusions - The present study suggests that apathy after subcortical stroke is associated with impaired neural processing of novel events within the frontal - subcortical system and that the novelty P3 is a useful physiological measure for assessing apathy after stroke.

We first applied independent component analysis to concatenated single-trial EEG data from a fast go-nogo categorization task of natural images and showed that individual independent components might index neural synchrony within and between intracranial brain sources. We used time-frequency decomposition to model their dynamic interactions. In particular, following stimulus presentations, we showed that several independent components were activated and synchronized in the theta frequency range (near 4 Hz). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Like all communication methods, it faces the problem of errors in transmission. In the Wadsworth EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system, subjects learn to use mu or beta rhythm amplitude to move a cursor to targets on a computer screen. While cursor movement is highly accurate in trained subjects, it is not perfect. Methods: In an effort to develop a method for detecting errors, this study compared the EEG immediately after correct target selection to that after incorrect selection. Results: The data showed that a mistake is followed by a positive potential centered at the vertex that peaks about 180 ms after the incorrect selection. Conclusion: The results suggest that this error potential might provide a method for detecting and voiding errors that requires no additional time and could thereby improve the speed and accuracy of EEG-based communication.

Stop signals elicited a sequence of N2/P3 components that partly overlapped with ERP components elicited by the reaction stimulus. N2/P3 components were more pronounced on stop-signal trials than on no-stop-signal trials. At Cz, the stop-signal P3 peaked earlier on successful than on unsuccessful stop trials. This finding extends the horse race model by demonstrating that the internal response to the stop signal (as reflected in stop-signal P3) is not constant, but terminates at different moments in time on successful and unsuccessful stop trials. In addition, topographical distributions and dipole analysis of high density EEG recordings indicated that different cortical generators were involved in Pas elicited on successful and unsuccessful stop-signal trials. The latter results suggest that P3 on successful stop-signal trials not only reflects stop-signal processing per se, but also efficiency of inhibitory control.

Methods: Resting state topographic EEG activity was investigated as a function of CNS arousal in normal right-handed boys. Arousal was defined in terms of electrodermal activity, which has a long history in Psychology as a measure of CNS arousal. Results: Relative delta, theta, and beta power, and the theta/beta ratio, failed to differ significantly between age-matched groups which differed markedly in skin conductance level and non-specific electrodermal fluctuations. The high-arousal group showed significantly lower levels of relative alpha power, particularly in posterior and hemispheric regions, with higher alpha frequencies in these areas. Conclusions: These data fail to support the theoretical linkage between the theta/beta ratio and CNS arousal. Further work is needed to disentangle the different correlates of arousal and task-related activation, particularly in cognitive and attentional-processing terms. Significance: The outcomes of this study, in addition to clarifying the nature of EEG markers of CNS arousal, have important implications for our understanding of AD/HD), as they require re-evaluation of current models of the disorder.

By varying the interstimulus intervals (ISIs), the MMN can be used as an index of auditory sensory memory. This paper focuses on MMN findings in aging and in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). The accumulated data suggest that MMN to duration deviance, unlike MMN to frequency deviance, is reduced in amplitude in aging at short ISIs. The attenuated MMN to frequency deviance observed at long ISIs in elderly subjects seems to be caused by age-related memory trace decay. Existing results suggest that automatic discrimination for the frequency change is not affected in the early phase of AD, whereas the memory trace seems to decay faster in AD patients. The present findings on PD are not as conclusive, although they tentatively suggest deteriorated automatic change detection. The MMN appears to offer an objective tool for studying auditory processing and memory trace decay in different neurological disorders. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

These methods are particularly fruitful when they are strongly correlated with intuitive physical concepts that allow a better understanding of brain dynamics. Here, new method based on orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (ODWT) is applied. It takes as a basic element the ODWT of the EEG signal, and defines the relative wavelet energy, the wavelet entropy (WE) and the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). The relative wavelet energy provides information about the relative energy associated with different frequency bands present in the EEG and their corresponding degree of importance. The WE carries information about the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal response, and the RWE measures the degree of similarity between different segments of the signal. In addition, the time evolution of the WE is calculated to give information about the dynamics in the EEG records. Within this framework, the major objective of the present work was to characterize in a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in short duration EEG signals. For that aim, spontaneous EEG signals under different physiological conditions were analyzed. Further, specific quantifiers were derived to characterize how stimulus affects electrical events in terms of frequency synchronization (tuning) in the event related potentials.

We proceed from the general hypothesis, originally proposed by Erol Basar that ERP's are generated by a super-position of evoked oscillations with different frequencies. Based on findings about event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), we analyze the following specific hypotheses. If evoked theta and alpha oscillations contribute to the generation of ERP components and if their functional role, type of reactivity and frequency specificity are similar to those of event-related oscillations (measured by ERD/ERS), we expect (i) to see the same functional relationship between frequency and cognitive processes, (ii) the same type of "reactivity" and a (iii) dependency of latency measures of evoked components on IAF. By reviewing respective data, we demonstrate that similar to research about event-related oscillations, evoked alpha reflects attention, whereas evoked theta reflects working memory processes. Furthermore, it was found that individual alpha frequency (IAF) has a significant influence on P1 latency in particular. For a better understanding of these findings, we outline a new theoretical framework. We assume that the P1-N1 complex is generated by an interplay between the synchronous activation of three neuronal network systems, a working memory, attentional, and semantic memory system, each operating with a different frequency, the first in the theta (about 6 Hz), the second in the lower alpha (about 8 Hz) and the third in the upper alpha (about 12 Hz) frequency range. The implications of this theoretical framework are discussed by reviewing research using phase sensitive measures to analyze "local" and "large scale" integration processes between different neural networks.

Event-related potentials to non-attended standard and deviant tone stimuli were recorded with EEG electrodes and here the standard tones were analysed. The amplitude of the NI component to standard tones was significantly larger in children with fragile X syndrome than in control children. In addition, the global field power maximum of ERP corresponding to the N2 component was significantly (p<0.05) larger in fragile X children than in controls. The N2 scalp distribution in children with fragile X syndrome appeared more frontal than that in controls. Furthermore, the fragile X children exhibited no habituation of N1 and an absence of N2 sensitization for repeated tones. Increased responsiveness observed in the N1 evoked potential together with abnormal habituation of auditory responses in childhood may indicate increased sensory sensitivity for auditory stimuli in fragile X syndrome. The data, though very limited, suggest that stimulus processing in the auditory afferent pathways and/or in the corresponding cortical receiving areas is abnormal in children with fragile X syndrome.

Qualitative and quantitative electroencephalography	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; electrophysiology; electroencephalography; review	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-NEUROPHYSIOLOGY-SOCIETY; ACADEMY-OF-NEUROLOGY; SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN; EEG POWER SPECTRA; 2 SUBTYPES; DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR; BRAIN-FUNCTION; CO-MORBIDITY	Objective: This article reviews the electroencephalography (EEG) literature in relation to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/ HD). Methods: The review briefly outlines the history of the disorder, focusing on the changing diagnostic systems which both reflect and constrain research into AD/HD. Both qualitative and quantitative EEG studies are examined, and their results are discussed in relation to various models of AD/HD. Implications of these data for future research and development in AD/HD are considered. Results: In terms of resting EEG, elevated relative theta power, and reduced relative alpha and beta, together with elevated theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios, are most reliably associated with AD/HD. Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios also discriminate diagnostic subgroups of AD/ HD. Recent studies of EEG heterogeneity in this disorder indicate the existence of different profiles of cortical anomalies which may cut across diagnostic types. Conclusions: The research to date has identified a substantial number of EEG correlates of AD/HD which hold promise for improving our understanding of the brain dysfunction(s) underlying the disorder. Further work in this field may benefit from a broader conceptual approach, integrating EEG and other measures of brain function. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because categorical variation is less powerful than continuous or parametric variation, a more effective method may be to relate continuous variation in the cognitive process with matching variation in the electrophysiological responses. We assessed continuous variation in the expectancy and meaningfulness of words in different sentence contexts by having subjects rate the words along these two dimensions. ERP averages were then created for each word by averaging the ERP across all subjects responses to that word. A parametric principal components analysis was then conducted by multiplying the factor topographies from the temporal PCA by the parameter correlation maps for each rating parameter. This analysis showed that both expectancy and meaningfulness begin to influence lexical processing around 200 ms. Source localization of the expectancy N2 (recognition potential) pointed to a source in the left fusiform gyrus region (visual word form area). Source localization of the meaningfulness N2 (meaning recognition potential) suggested a right inferior posterior source, such as in the right cerebellum or right fusiform area. Further research with parametric analysis of dense array ERPs may clarify the multiple neural mechanisms of word recognition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Six pianists were asked to learn and memorize a set prelude by J.S. Bach for performance, and to identify bars that they employed for structuring the prelude into component sections. Following performance from memory, the participants took part in a visual recognition memory task, in which single bars from the prelude had to be distinguished from matched new bars. During the recognition task, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, and event-related potentials (ERPs) from correctly identified prelude stimulus trials were averaged according to their hypothesized status into "structural" and "nonstructural" bars. The results showed that correct identification of structural bars was significantly faster (and tended to display higher accuracy) than recognition of non-structural ones. In addition, recognition of structural bars was associated with a significantly greater negative ERP peak of 300-400 ms latency and a right centro-parietal scalp distribution. This mid-latency negativity appears to index processing of stimuli that served as cues for encoding and retrieval of a complex semantic structure, and is qualitatively and conceptually different from other previously identified recognition memory ERPs (such as the "old/new" effect), as well as from the classic N400 ERP. The data support existing theories of expert memory and music cognition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a lexical decision task, response times to words with high-frequency first syllables were longer than those to words with low-frequency first syllables and resulted in more negative event-related potentials (ERPs) in an early time window from 190 ms to 280 ms and in the N400 component. The onset of the observed first syllable-frequency effect was prior to the onset of the effect of lexicality (i.e., the first reliable differentiation in ERP waveforms in response to words and pseudowords, a potential marker of lexical access). The present study's results support Barber et al.'s [Neuroreport 15 (2004) 545] notion of the prelexical nature of the first syllable-frequency effect by (A) providing evidence for electrophysiological correlates of first syllable-frequency in another, non-Romance orthography (i.e., German), (B) relating the onset of the first syllable-frequency effect to the onset of the lexicality effect and (C) strengthening this pattern of results by means of a novel item-based analysis of ERP data. Implications of the prelexical nature of the inhibitory first syllable-frequency effect for computational models of reading, specifically for Ans et al.'s [Psychol.

Even with conventional low density recordings (e.g. 30-channel Electro-Cap), over-application of electrode gel may result in electrolyte leakage and create low impedance bridges, particularly at vertically-aligned sites (e.g. inferior-lateral). The ensuing electrical short produces an artificial similarity of ERPs at neighboring sites that distorts the ERP topography. This artifact is not immediately apparent in group averages, and may even go undetected after visual inspection of the individual ERP waveforms. Besides adding noise variance to the topography, this error source also has the capacity to introduce systematic, localized artifacts (e.g. add or remove evidence of lateralized activity). Electrolyte bridges causing these artifacts can be easily detected by a simple variant of the Hjorth algorithm (intrinsic Hjorth), in which spatial interelectrode distances are replaced by an electrical analog of distance (i.e. the variances of the difference waveforms for all pairwise combinations of electrodes). When a low impedance bridge exists, the Hjorth algorithm identifies all affected sites as hat lines that are readily distinguishable from Hjorth waveforms at unbridged electrodes.

Low voltage alpha (LVA), a heritable resting electroencephalogram (EEG) trait present in 7-14% of the population, has been shown to be associated with alcoholism and anxiety disorders. A few studies have demonstrated a modest correlation between pre-stimulus alpha power and P300 amplitude. We aimed to test this finding in community volunteers, hypothesizing that LVA would be associated with low P300 amplitude. Method: Digitized resting EEG was recorded at the central parietal site (Pz) from 85 male and 113 female community volunteers (120 unrelated). ERPs were elicited at Pz by auditory and visual oddball paradigms. All participants were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders, Lifetime Version (SADS-L) and assigned blind-rated psychiatric diagnoses according to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-III-R criteria. Results: LVA participants (including alcoholics and nonalcoholics) had significantly lower auditory and visual P300 amplitudes. Absolute alpha power was modestly correlated with auditory and visual P300 amplitude and was associated with 9.4% and 4.6% of the variance, respectively Conclusions: The association between LVA and low P300 amplitude, two distinct electrophysiological traits, suggests that, at least in individuals with the LVA trait, some aspects of resting, unstimulated brain activity and activated brain function in the form of attentional response may be fundamentally related.

Our goal is to assess the relationship between P300 and EEG rhythm generation in schizophrenics. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) in resting condition and P300 during auditory oddball paradigm were recorded with 25 unmedicated patients. Additionally, lateral ventricular-brain ratio (LV-BR), which partially reflects thalamic volume, was measured using CT scan. Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS) and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were also rated. P300 amplitudes at Pz positively correlated with theta and slow alpha power before pharmacotherapy, however, the correlation tended to be confined to fast alpha after pharmacotherapy. BPRS and SANS showed no significant correlation with QEEG. High frequency bands such as fast alpha and beta showed trends to correlate negatively to LV-BR. The lack of correlation between P300 amplitudes and fast alpha power before pharmacotherapy, which was restored after pharmacotherapy, might indicate thalamocortical dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Twin and family studies have been used to estimate the genetic contribution to the individual differences in a variety of electrophysiological measures. These studies are briefly reviewed here and published twin correlations from a number of studies with comparable methodology were selected for structural equation meta-analyses. For electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha power (11 twin groups) the heritability estimates in each of the single studies were high (averaged 79%), but it was not possible to equate the twin correlations across studies in the meta-analysis. In contrast, combining the data on alpha peak frequency (five twin groups) revealed a 'meta'-heritability of 81% (95% CI: 76-84%). Aggregating the twin correlations of five twin studies on the P300, the estimated meta-heritability is 60% (95% CI: 54-65%) for P300 amplitude and 51% (95% CI: 43-58%) for P300 latency. It is concluded that genomic variation contributes significantly to individual differences in all EEG and event related potential (ERP) measures studied to date. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study investigated the influence of event-related slow-wave (SW) (0.01-2 Hz) activity in the group differences seen between children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) of different subtypes. Methods: Time-frequency analysis techniques were applied to auditory ERP data derived from children with AD/HD predominantly inattentive type (n = 30), AD/HD combined type (n = 30) and age-matched control subjects (n = 30). Results: Event-related early frontal negative and late posterior positive SW components were reduced in the AD/HD combined type group, but not AD/HD inattentive type group, relative to controls. The RESIDUAL ERPs, which represented event-related 2-12 Hz activity, showed clinical vs. control group differences in components that were similar in both AD/HD subtype groups. Conclusions: The time-frequency results showed that event-related SW (0.1-2 Hz) activity contributes importantly to group differences between AD/HD and control children, and the pattern of group differences from controls for each of the AD/HD subtype groups, which are evident in raw ERPs. These results emphasise both the clinical and developmental importance of this form of analysis.

Most EEG research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes 'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental events. Although these measures are nearly complementary, they do not fully model the event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot isolate the signals of the contributing cortical areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG features are better viewed as time/frequency perturbations of underlying field potential processes. The new approach combines independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, and trial-by-trial visualization that measures EEG source dynamics without requiring an explicit head model.

Methods: Nine right-handed, normal subjects performed right or left thumb extensions in simple, choice and go/no go auditory RT paradigms. Eight subjects had participated in a previous study evaluating changes in corticospinal excitability during the same paradigms. Twenty-nine EEG channels with electrooculogram and bilateral EMG monitoring were collected. ERPs and ERD of 10 and 18-22 Hz bands were obtained with respect to tone administration and EMG onset. Results: Trials with movement showed lateralized ERP components, corresponding to the motor potential (MP), both in the averages on the tone and on EMG. The MP corresponded well in time and location to the rise in corticospinal excitability on the moving side observed in the previous study. Sensorimotor ERD, followed by event-related synchronization (ERS), was present for trials with movements and for the no go. ERD was present contralaterally during movement preparation and in no go trials, while it was bilateral during motor execution. No go ERD was followed more rapidly by ERS than in trials with movement. This finding suggests that in no go trials, there is a brief active process in the sensorimotor areas. ERD and ERS do not correspond, respectively, in time and location to increases and decreases in corticospinal excitability. In fact, ERD is bilateral during movement execution, when corticospinal inhibition of the side at rest is observed. Contralateral no go ERS occurs later than corticospinal inhibition, which is bilateral. Conclusions: These findings may suggest that ERD is compatible with both corticospinal activation and inhibition, ERS indicating the removal of either, resulting in cortical idling.

It is argued that a technique called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) of rhythmic 10-Hz activity is well suited to study the thalamocortical processes that are thought to mediate anticipatory attention, In a series of experiments, ERD was computed on EEG and MEG data, recorded while subjects performed a time estimation task and were informed about the quality of their time estimation by stimuli providing Knowledge of Results (KR). The modality of the KR stimuli (auditory, visual, or somatosensory) was manipulated both within and between experiments. The results indicate to varying degrees that preceding the presentation of the KR stimuli, ERD is present over the sensory cortex, which corresponds to the modality of the KR stimulus. The general pattern of results supports the notion that a thalamocortical gating mechanism forms the neurophysiological basis of anticipatory attention. Furthermore, the results support the notion that Event-Related Potential (ERP) and ERD measures reflect fundamentally different neurophysiological processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This laboratory utilized adolescent rodent models to assess the hypothesis that adolescents are highly susceptible to the effects of alcohol and nicotine. Rats were exposed to ethanol for 10-14 days using an intermittent vapor inhalation paradigm. Rats were continuously exposed to nicotine for 5 days using Nicoderm CQ(TM) transdermal patches. Alcohol or nicotine exposure altered neurobehavioral function when assessed after 3-7 weeks of abstinence. Alcohol-induced changes include increased electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency, decreased amplitude of the cortical N1 and hippocampal P3 event-related potential (ERP) components, enhanced anxiety-like behavior, and enhanced depressive-like behavior. Nicotine-induced changes include decreased slow-wave cortical EEG power, increased cortical N1 ERP amplitude, decreased motor activity, and increased anxiety-like behavior. These findings support the hypothesis that adolescents are uniquely susceptible to the effects of chronic alcohol and nicotine exposure.

We review attention-related brain responses from auditory and visual tasks employing oddball and novelty paradigms. Dipole localization and intracranial recordings as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging reveal multiple areas involved in generating and modulating attentional brain responses. In addition, the influence of brain lesions of circumscribed areas of the human cortex onto attentional mechanisms are reviewed. While it is obvious that damaged brain tissue no longer functions properly, it has also been shown that functions of non-lesioned brain areas are impaired due to loss of modulatory influence of the lesioned area. Both early (P1 and N1) and late (P3) event-related potentials are modulated by excitatatory and inhibitory mechanisms.. Oscillatory EEG-correlates of attention in the alpha and gamma frequency range also show attentional modulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We conducted the present study to elucidate the effects of ischemic stroke on the P300 ERP component. Material and methods - We recorded the P300 wave using an auditory oddball paradigm in 38 consecutive brain infarct patients with mild neurological deficits at 3 and 12 months poststroke, and in 29 healthy control subjects. Results - Brain infarction slightly prolonged the P300 latency, and the observed delay was related to the presence and degree of post-stroke depression evaluated with the Zung Depression Scale and the DSM-III criteria. Infarction did not affect the P300 amplitude or its distribution on the scalp. The results of the patients with hemispheric brain infarction and those of the patients with brainstem infarction were similar, and also the values of the patients with the left- and right-sided lesions. The normal physiological correlation between subject age and the P300 latency was absent at 3 months post-stroke, but was present at 12 months post-stroke. Conclusion - Brain infarction delays the P300 ERP and temporarily distorts its age-related physiology. The increase of the P300 latency seems to be associated with the post-stroke depression.

Methods: Three tasks with identical stimulus material were performed by 9 healthy subjects. The tasks comprised a passive control task, and an easy and a hard visual discrimination task, requiting discrimination of the color of circles. EEG was recorded from 20 electrodes. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the analysis of gamma activity. Results: Evoked EEG gamma activity was enhanced by both discrimination tasks as compared to the passive control task. Within the two discrimination tasks, the latency of the evoked gamma peak was delayed for the harder task. Higher amplitudes of the ERP components N170 and P300 were found in both discrimination tasks as compared to the passive task. The N2b. which,homed a maximum activation at about 260 ms. was increased in the hard discrimination task as compared to the easy discrimination task. Conclusions: Our results indicate that early evoked gamma activity and N2b are related to the difficulty of visual discrimination processes. A delayed gamma activity in the hard task indicated a longer duration of stimulus processing, whereas the amplitude of the N2b directly indicates the level of task difficulty.

J	Ehlers, CL; Somes, C				Ehlers, CL; Somes, C			Long latency event-related potentials in mice: effects of stimulus characteristics and strain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related potential; neocortex; P300; N100; C57BL/6; DBA/2	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; INBRED STRAINS; P300 AMPLITUDE; ERP RESPONSES; HEARING-LOSS; RATS; EEG; ALCOHOL; ETHANOL	The P3, or P300 component of the event-related potentials (ERPs) is a positive going waveform that can be averaged from the EEG approximately 250-500 ms following the presentation of task or context 'relevant' stimuli. This potential has been demonstrated to be a sensitive measure of both normal and abnormal cognitive functioning. P300 models have been developed in monkeys, cats and rats. The aim of the present study was to develop an auditory ERP paradigm suitable for use in mice that resembled those used in humans and other animal models. The results of the studies showed that late positive potentials in the 200-400 ms range could be generated in cortical sites in response to auditory stimuli. Additionally, like passive ERPs recorded in humans, mouse ERPs were sensitive to changes in stimulus characteristics. An earlier negative component designated the N1 was found to be sensitive to tone frequency and loudness but not to stimulus probability, whereas the mouse P300 component was sensitive to probability but not to tone frequency or loudness. C57BL/6 mice, a strain known to have a strong alcohol preference, were found to have significantly lower P300 amplitudes when compared to the DBA/2 strain. These findings also parallel human studies, and studies of selected lines of rats, demonstrating that decrements in P300 amplitude can be associated with a genetic vulnerability to alcoholism/alcohol preference. These studies further suggest that ERPs are an electrophysiological assay suitable for the exploration of the effects of genetic manipulations on neurosensory processing in mice.

Single-trial ERP recordings capture the oscillatory activity that are hypothesized to underlie both communication between brain regions and amplified processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, precise interpretations of ERPs are precluded by uncertainty about their neural mechanisms. One influential theory holds that averaged sensory ERPs are generated by partial phase resetting of ongoing electroencephalographic oscillations, while another states that ERPs result from stimulus-evoked neural responses. We formulated critical predictions of each theory and tested these using direct, intracortical analyses of neural activity in monkeys. Our findings support a predominant role for stimulus-evoked activity in sensory ERP generation, and they outline both logic and methodology necessary for differentiating evoked and phase resetting contributions to cognitive and motor ERPs in future studies.

However. the reliability of the OERP has yet to be established statistically. The present study examined test-retest reliability, of the OERP over a 4-week interval. EEG was recorded from Fz, Cz. and Pz, using a single-stimulus paradigm with amyl acetate. Reliabilities for ERP component latencies and interpeak amplitudes were assessed as intraclass and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Reliabilities were higher for latency than for amplitude. Highest correlation coefficients were observed for P2 latency. specifically at Cz and Pz P3 amplitude and latency exhibited high reliability at Cz and Pz. Fz demonstrated weakest cot-relation coefficients. The data suggest that OERP reliability is comparable to that of auditory and visual ERPs, supporting the use of OERPs in both basic research and clinical assessment.

Few drugs have been reported to be effective for the treatment of vascular dementia. Choto-san is a herbal medicine expected to be effectivein this condition, but it is unclear how this drug modulates brain activities and cognitive functions. P3 event-related brain potentials (ERP) provide reliable electrophysiological indices for some aspects of cognitive functions. Objectives. We measured P3 ERP to assess the effect of Choto-san administration on stroke patients with mild cognitive impairments. Methods. Choto-san was given for 12 weeks to ten chronic stroke patients. P3 ERP were recorded before and after drug administration in a modified auditory oddball paradigm including occasional novel sounds using a high-density array EEG recording system. The reproducibility of ERP was also assessed in other ten stroke patients with a 12-week interval. Cognitive functions were assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency test. Results. Twelve-week administration of Choto-san significantly improved MMSE and verbal fluency test scores. The reproducibility of P3 latency and amplitude to target and novel sounds was excellent. P3 latency to target sounds was shortened in association with reduced reaction time to the sounds after drug administration. Furthermore, P3 amplitude to novel sounds was enlarged and its topography shifted from central to frontal sites. Conclusions. These results indicate that Choto-san improves electrophysiological indices related to attention and decision making, in addition to neuropsychological test scores in stroke patients with mild cognitive impairments.

This amplitude-index has become a standard parameter in electrophysiology. Recently, a robust ERP-parameter (NoGo-anteriorization, NGA) has been introduced, which reflects spatial brain electrical changes in relation to execution and inhibition of a motor response elicited with a Continuous Performance Test (CPT). The current study refers to the stability of this new topographical ERP-parameter compared to thr stability of the classical P300-amplitude. For that purpose, 12 healthy subjects were investigated with both paradigms during recording of a 21-channel EEG. Analysis of the resulting ERPs revealed a very high stability fur both, topographical and amplitude index: In every single subject, the brain electrical fields were characterized by a more anterior location in the NoGo- compared to the Go-condition (=NGA) and by higher amplitudes after target compared to distractor condition. T-tests, analyses of the effect size and of the power revealed equivalent differences between the two contrasting conditions for the topographical compared to the amplitude index. These results indicate that the stability of the topographical ERP-parameters elicited with the CPT is sufficient for an electrophysiological standard-index. The possibility to elicit a robust and specific spatial, brain activation with the CPT is an ideal completion to the classical P300 amplitude effect and, therefore, hopefully will be a useful expansion of the standard paradigms in electrophysiological laboratories.

Both target-P3 and novelty-P3 were internally consistent and test-retest reliable. Interestingly, novelty-P3 amplitude declined from the first to the second half of each recording session, whereas no systematic alteration between both sessions occurred. The target-P3 showed the opposite pattern, i.e. a reduced amplitude from the first to the second session, but no systematic change within each session. These findings suggest that novelty-P3 amplitude changes reflect habituation, whereas target-P3 session effects may indicate the adjusted amount of processing resources invested into the task. In general, the results support the interpretation of the novelty-P3 as indicating automatic, bottom-up related aspects of attention, whereas the target-P3, in the present paradigm, seems to reflect voluntary, top-down related aspects of attention.

The effects of stimulus modality, task difficulty, and gender were assessed with analogous auditory and visual paradigms (tone location/head rotation and tone matching/shape matching). Although task performance was generally comparable across risk groups, LR subjects produced smaller P300 amplitudes than FIR subjects for the visual matching tasks. No consistent risk group P300 latency effects were obtained. Gender, task difficulty, and scalp topography differentially modulated the risk group outcomes across paradigms. These findings suggest that P300 amplitude reflects risk-for-alcoholism in male and female young adults, but the specific task conditions and electrode location affect the strength of risk group differences.

The paradigm provided warning (S I) as to the difficulty level of an upcoming decision task (S2). Participants had to decide the taller of two bars on presentation of S2 but hold their response until S3, to which they indicated their choice motorically. Results revealed age-related differences for ERP measures as older participants showed increased amplitude of the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) prior to S2, and longer latencies and equipotentiality of P3 in response to S2. Fitness effects were also observed for the contingent negative variation (CNV) with decreased amplitude for fit relative to sedentary individuals. Age interacted with fitness for P3 latency to S2 as older sedentary individuals showed the longest latency followed by older fit and both younger groups. No significant group differences were observed for reaction time (RT) to S3. Therefore, physical fitness is associated with attenuation of cognitive decline in older individuals and greater economy of motor preparation for both young and older participants.

Methods: Nineteen children diagnosed with both SRBD and ADHD participated. Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded during a resting period and an auditory oddball task before beginning BiPAP treatment, after 6 months on treatment, and after a subsequent 1 week non-treatment period. Treatment effects on EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) to target stimuli were examined via topographic analysis. Results: Thirteen of the initial 19 children completed 6 months of BiPAP therapy, with six lost mainly due to compliance problems. Children on BiPAP therapy showed a significant decrease in slow-wave (delta and theta) and an increase in fast wave (beta) EEG activity. The P3 component of the ERP showed treatment effects in amplitude and latency. Conclusions: The electrophysiological data suggest that SRBDs may contribute to ADHD symptomatology. Treatment of SRBD with BiPAP therapy in children with concurrent ADHD can lead to significant changes, in the direction of normalization, of the typical electrophysiological features of ADHD.

This served two goals, namely (I) to clarify their possible effects as confounds in ERP experiments employing wordstimuli, and (II) to determine the point in time of lexical access in visual word recognition. Methods: EEG was recorded from 64 scalp sites while subjects (n = 12) performed a lexical decision task. Word length and frequency were orthogonally varied between stimulus groups, whereas variables including regularity of spelling and orthographic tri-gram frequency were kept constant. Results: Long words produced the strongest brain response early on (similar to 100 ms after stimulus onset), whereas those to short words became strongest later (150-360 ms). Lower ERP amplitudes were elicited by words with high frequency compared with low frequency words in the latency ranges 150-190 ms and 320-360 ms. However, we did not find evidence for a robust alteration of peak latencies with word frequency. Conclusions: Length and frequency of word stimuli have independent and additive effects on the amplitude of the ERP. Studies on the precise time course of cognitive processes should consider their potentially confounding character. Our data support the view that lexical access takes place as early as 150 ms after onset of written word stimuli. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: In two sessions separated by 25 days, 10 subjects were presented with tones being of short (200 ms) and long (400 ms) duration equiprobably; tones were of high-probability standard or of low-probability deviant frequency. In Distraction condition, subjects had to behaviorally discriminate short from long tones. In Ignore condition, subjects were reading a book. Behavioral performance and multichannel EEG were recorded. Results: Task-irrelevant frequency deviations prolonged reaction times in the duration discrimination task by more than 35 ms and elicited the MMN and P3a components of the event-related potential. The P3a was followed by a negative deflection called RON (reorienting negativity). P3a and RON were absent in Ignore condition. All effects were found to be highly stable between sessions (product-moment correlations between 0.76 and 0.90). SCD analysis suggested frontal generators for P3a and for RON. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that small frequency deviations may yield distinct distraction effects in a tone duration discrimination task on a behavioral and on an electrophysiological level. Results support the hypothesis that frontal areas are involved in the exogenous orienting of attention (P3a) and in the reorienting of attention (RON). Due to the high stability of the deviance-related behavioral and ERP effects, this distraction paradigm may be utilized for clinical research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

A single dose of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (2 mg) or placebo was given orally to 12 right-handed healthy volunteers 3 hours before measurement. In a dichotic selective attention task, subjects were presented with two trains of standard (700 Hz to the left ear, 1,100 Hz to the right ear) and deviant (770 and 1,210 Hz, respectively) tones. Subjects were instructed to count the tones presented to one ear; whereas, the tones presented to the other ear were to be ignored. Haloperidol significantly attenuated processing negativity (PN), an event-related potential (ERP) component elicited by selectively attended standard tones at 300-500 ins after stimulus presentation. These results, indicating impaired selective attention by a blockade of dopamine D2 receptors, were further accompanied with increased mismatch negativity (MMN), elicited by involuntary detection of task-irrelevant deviants. Taken together, haloperidol seemed to induce functional changes in neural networks accounting for both selective and involuntary attention, suggesting modulation of these functions by dopamine D2 receptors.

"Emitted potentials" generated in the absence of sensory input by unexpected stimulus omissions also exhibit a P300 component and provide another perspective on patterns of brain activity related to the processing of expectancies. The studies described herein extend earlier emitted potential findings in several aspects. First, high-density (128-channel) EEG recordings are used for topographical mapping of emitted potentials. Second, the primary focus is on emitted potential components preceding the P300, i.e. those components that are more Likely to resemble ERP components associated with sensory processing. Third, the dependence of emitted potentials on attention is assessed. Fourth, subjects' knowledge of the structure of an auditory stimulus sequence is modulated so that emitted potentials can be compared between conditions that are identical in physical aspects but differ in terms of subjects' expectations regarding the sequence structure. Finally, a novel task is used to elicit emitted potentials, in which subjects explicitly imagine the continuations of simple melodies. In this task, subjects mentally complete melodic fragments in the appropriate tempo, even though they know with absolute certainty that no sensory stimulus will occur. Emitted potentials were elicited only when subjects actively formed expectations or images. The topographies of the initial portion of the emitted potentials were significantly correlated with the N100 topography elicited by corresponding acoustic stimuli, but uncorrelated with the topographies of corresponding silence control periods.

The main MMN generators are located in the superior temporal cortex, but their number, precise location, and temporal sequence of activation remain unclear. In this study, ERP and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were obtained simultaneously during a passive frequency oddball paradigm. There were three conditions, a STANDARD, a SMALL deviant, and a LARGE deviant. A clustered image acquisition technique was applied to prevent contamination of the fMRI data by the acoustic noise of the scanner and to limit contamination of the electroencephalogram (EEG) by the gradient-switching artifact. The ERP data were used to identify areas in which the blood oxygenation (BOLD) signal varied with the magnitude of the negativity in each condition. A significant ERP MMN was obtained, with larger peaks to LARGE deviants and with frontocentral scalp distribution, consistent with the MMN reported outside the magnetic field. This result validates the experimental procedures for simultaneous ERP/fMRI of the auditory cortex. Main foci of increased BOLD signal were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus [STG; Brodmann area (BA) 22] and right superior temporal plane (STP; BA 41 and 42). The imaging results provide new information supporting the idea that generators in the right lateral aspect of the STG are implicated in processes of frequency deviant detection, in addition to generators in the right and left STP.

It was found that semantic violations elicited the conventional N400, which was distributed in the bilateral occipital and the right temporal regions, and that the syntactic Violations elicited the P600 in a broad area, predominantly in the centroparietal regions. Scalp current density mappings suggested that the right temporal cortex plays a significant role in integrating pieces of contextual information, especially when it is difficult to integrated a word in the context of a sentence, and that the P600 was connected to the syntactic processes conceivably indexed by the left temporal current sink with a relatively early onset.

Within the auditory evoked potential, a positive deflection at approximately 150-250 ms is a ubiquitous feature. Unlike other cognitive components such as N1or the P300, remarkably little has been done to investigate the underlying neurological correlates or significance of this waveform. Indeed until recently, many researchers considered it to be an intrinsic part of the 'vertex potential' complex, involving it and the earlier N1. This review seeks to describe the evidence supportive of P2 being the result of independent processes and highlights several features, such as its persistence from wakefulness into sleep, the general consensus that unlike most other EEG phenomena it increases with age, and the fact that it can be generated using respiratory stimuli.

The usefulness of the extracted component measures can be evaluated by knowledge about the variance distribution of ERPs, which are characterized by the removal of baseline activity. The variance should be small before and at stimulus onset (across and within cases), but large near the end of the recording epoch and at ERP component peaks. These characteristics are preserved with a covariance matrix, but lost with a correlation matrix, which assigns equal weights to each sample point, yielding the possibility that small but systematic variations may form a factor. Methods: Varimax-rotated PCAs were performed on simulated and real ERPs, systematically varying extraction criteria (number of factors) and method (correlation/covariance matrix, using unstandardized/standardized loadings before rotation). Results: Conservative extraction criteria changed the morphology of some components considerably, which had severe implications for inferential statistics. Solutions converged and stabilized with more liberal criteria. Interpretability (more distinctive component waveforms with narrow and unambiguous loading peaks) and statistical conclusions (greater effect stability across extraction criteria) were best for unstandardized covariance-based solutions. In contrast, all standardized covariance- and correlation-based solutions included "high-variance" factors during the baseline, confirming findings for simulated data. Conclusions: Unrestricted, unstandardized covariance-based PCA solutions optimize ERP component identification and measurement. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Could orienting attention to a selective point in time influence the alpha rhythms as a function of the SHORT vs. LONG foreperiod? Stronger selective attentional modulations were predicted for the SHORT than LONG condition. EEG data from 54 channels were "depurated" from phase-locked visual evoked potentials and spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian estimation (i.e., final data analysis was conducted on 16 Subjects having a sufficient number of artifact-free EEG single trials). Low-band alpha rhythms (about 6-10 Hz) were supposed to be related to anticipatory attentional processes, whereas high-band alpha rhythms (10-12 Hz) would indicate task-specific visuo-motor processes. Compared to the LONG condition (foreperiod), the SHORT condition induced a quicker and stronger ERS at low-band alpha rhythm (about 6-8 Hz) over midline and bilateral prefrontal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal areas. In contrast, the concomitant high-band alpha (about 10-12 Hz) ERD/ERS showed no significant difference between the two conditions. In conclusion, temporal attention for a sub-second delay (800 ms) did modulate low-band alpha rhythm over large regions of both cortical hemispheres. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

We manipulated the duration of visual checkerboard stimuli across trials and measured stimulus-duration-related changes in ERP and BOLD activity in three brain regions: peri-calcarine cortex, the fusiform gyrus and lateral temporal-occipital (LTO) cortex. ERPs were recorded from patients who had indwelling subdural electrodes as part of presurgical testing, while BOLD responses were measured in similar brain regions in a second set of subjects. Similar BOLD responses were measured in peri-calcarine and fusiform regions, with both showing monotonic but non-linear increases in hemodynamic amplitude with stimulus duration. In sharp contrast, very different ERP responses were observed in these same regions, such that calcarine electrodes exhibited onset potentials, sustained activity over the course of stimulus duration and prominent offset potentials, while fusiform electrodes only exhibited onset potentials that did not vary with stimulus duration. No duration-related ERP or BOLD changes were observed in LTO. Additional analyses revealed no consistent changes in the EEG spectrum across different brain sites that correlated with duration-related changes in the BOLD response. We conclude that the relation between ERPs and fMRI differs across brain regions.

But the relationship between the indirect hemodynamic fMRI signal and the more direct EEG signal is uncertain. Event-related EEG responses can be analyzed in two different ways, reflecting two different kinds of brain activity: evoked, i.e. phase-locked to the stimulus, such as evoked potentials, or induced, i.e. non phase-locked to the stimulus such as event-related oscillations. In order to determine which kind of EEG activity was more closely related with fMRI, EEG and fMRI signals were acquired together, while subjects were presented with two kinds of rare events intermingled with frequent distractors. Target events had to be signaled by pressing a button and Novel events had to be ignored. Results: Both Targets and Novels triggered a P300, of larger amplitude in the Novel condition. On the opposite, the fMRI BOLD response was stronger in the Target condition. EEG event-related oscillations in the gamma band (32-38 Hz) reacted in a way similar to the BOLD response. Conclusions: The reasons for such opposite differential reactivity between oscillations/fMRI on the one hand, and evoked potentials on the other, are discussed in the paper. Those results provide further arguments for a closer relationship between fast oscillations and the BOLD signal, than between evoked potentials and the BOLD signal.

Brain CTs were normal and spinal fluid examination revealed albuminocytological dissociation. All motor nerves tested were unexcitable, whereas sensory responses were markedly abnormal but present. Sequential EEG recordings revealed normal, partially reactive alpha rhythm in both patients. In one patient, normal auditory event-related potentials (ERPs: peak N1, P2, N2, P3, evoked in an 'odd-ball' paradigm) and CNV-like potentials could be recorded not earlier than the 20th day into the illness. In earlier recordings, N1 and P2 peaks as well as mismatch negativity (MMN) were present over the frontal and central scalp electrodes. This patient has now partially recovered motor functions and no cognitive defects are present, but he has little recollection of the events occurring in the first 2 weeks spent in the ICU, when he was completely paralyzed. The other patient generated normal N1 and P2 ERP peaks, but no N2, P3 and MMN were detected in a series of recordings. He died without having ever regained appropriate behavioral responses. The ERP abnormalities observed raise the matter of the origin of cognitive dysfunction in patients with severe and prolonged de-efferentation/de-afferentation. ERPs allow monitoring the level of alertness and attention and appear more specific than EEG in identifying a state of awareness in patients in which communication is severely impaired as a consequence of neurological disorders.

In this study we measured the effect of stimulants on ADHD children, both in the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sustained attentional tasks and in psychometric performance during selective attentional tasks. These tasks are known to rely on different cortical networks. Our results in children medicated with 10 mg of d-amphetamine administered 60 min before the study indicate (i) a significant increase in amplitude but not latency of the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) during the sustained attentional task and (ii) a significant improvement in the reaction times and correct responses in the selective attentional task. In addition to supporting the use of stimulants in children with attentional deficit/hyperactivity disorder, these results show a multifocal activity improvement of cortical structures linked to dopamine, and interestingly, to attention. All these analyses are framed in a wider study of diverse attentional functions in this syndrome.

A frequency-based analysis differentiated between two apparently identical but functionally distinct N400 effects in terms of activity in separable frequency bands, and whether the activity stemmed from increased power or phase locking. Whereas linguistic problem detection is associated with theta band activity (similar to3.5-75 Hz), conflict resolution correlates with activity in the delta band (1-3 Hz). The data further differentiate between the neuronal processing mechanisms involved in different types of conflict resolution on the basis of frequency characteristics (power vs phase locking).

This phenomenon (inhibition of return) might be due to a mechanism that inhibits irrelevant information. However, with sustained cues no inhibition is observed. It has been hypothesised that in the latter, task inhibition is masked by an excitation process. ERP measures support the inhibition-excitation account: (a) PI suppression, assumed to reflect inhibition, was observed for all targets presented at a cued location. (b) A later negative component (Nd250) was increased with sustained cues, and hence might reflect the excitation process. (c) A negative component at right parietal electrode sites (Nd310) appeared only when inhibition of return was observed. A second study confirmed the link between these ERP components and mechanisms involved in inhibition of return.

The present study explored if the facilitated processing of emotional pictures is sustained while subjects perform an explicit non-emotional attention task. EEG was recorded from 129 channels while subjects viewed a rapid continuous stream of images containing emotional pictures as well as task-related checkerboard images. As expected, explicit selective attention to target images elicited large P3 waves. Interestingly, emotional stimuli guided stimulus-driven selective encoding as reflected by augmented EPN amplitudes to emotional stimuli, in particular to stimuli of evolutionary significance (erotic contents, mutilations, and threat). These data demonstrate the selective encoding of emotional stimuli while top-down attentional control was directed towards non-emotional target stimuli.

In highly intelligent individuals a decrease in the volume of activated cortical gray matter between the P300 onset and the P300 peak amplitude was observed. The EEG of low intelligent individuals showed a reverse pattern of cortical activity. In the auditive oddball task the decrease in the activated cortical volume in high intelligent individuals was accompanied by an increase in current density, and a more left hemispheric source location at maximum current density. The results suggest that high intelligent individuals more efficiently distributed their cognitive resources needed to cope with the oddball tasks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Clinical material comprised 25 patients with depression and an equal number of gender and aged-matched healthy controls. All subjects were evaluated by a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded and digitized from 15 scalp electrodes (leads). Seventeen features related to the shape of the waveform were generated and were employed in the design of an optimum support vector machine (SVM) classifier at each lead. The outcomes of those SVM classifiers were selected by a majority-vote engine (MVE), which assigned each subject to either the normal or depressive classes. MVE classification accuracy was 94% when using all leads and 92% or 82% when using only the right or left scalp leads, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that depression is associated with dysfunction of right hemisphere mechanisms mediating the processing of information that assigns a specific response to a specific stimulus, as those mechanisms are reflected by the P600 component of ERPs.

It is usually evoked with an oddball paradigm. One main reason for its broad application in neurophysiological research is the fact that in several brain/mental diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia, attenuations of the P300 amplitude and latency have been described. However, a precise correlation of the scalp data to the underlying brain regions was not possible, as the correct localization of the generators of scalp-measured electroencephalogram (EEG) data was limited, due to the low spatial resolution of EEG-data. With the availability of modern imaging technologies, Junctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in particular, the underlying brain activations could be detected using an oddball task. Although the spatial resolution of JMRI is excellent, the time resolution is restricted. For a comprehensive understanding of the brain activity underlying the P300 paradigm, we have used a combination of EEG and fMRI to get a precise localization and a high-time resolution of the underlying brain activity.

In a recognition test, subjects indicated whether they consciously recollected the event in which a word was earlier presented (Remembering), or whether they recognized it on the basis that it was familiar in the absence of recollection (Knowing). An early EEG synchronization in the theta band predicted knowing, and a later remembering. Moreover, early and late event-related potentials were also found to predict knowing and remembering, respectively. The results indicate that the temporal dynamics of theta synchronization are related to the particular conscious experiences associated with memory retrieval. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were elicited by an alternating black and white checkerboard, which was presented blockwise outside the static 1.5 T magnetic field and during an echo planar imaging (EPI). An fMRI sequence with a time window for interleaved EEG-measurement and a measurement protocol which reduces pulse artifacts and vibrations was used. Thus, during an EPI sequence, it was possible to detect VEPs which had the same structure and latencies as VEPs outside the magnetic field and which corresponded well with the observed activated areas of the visual cortex.

In particular, we use the two-dimensional wavelet packet transform to obtain estimates of the complexity of two-dimensional images. This allows us to calculate complexity estimates of high-resolution brain potential maps generated from 61 scalp electrode Visual Oddball paradigm, grand-mean data. A significant reduction in the complexity of the surface Laplacian time-slices is observed during and after the Visual Potential 300 (P3) event for the target case, possibly as a result of increased spatial synchrony associated with visual-related tasks. We also present the results of a statistical analysis of the largest principal component of the time-varying complexity curves, for control, high-risk, and alcoholic groups of male subjects. Parametric and non-parametric analyses show differences in the complexity data which are significant between the control group and the alcoholic and high-risk groups.

We recorded 18-channel spontaneous eyes-closed resting EEG and auditory oddball event-related potentials in 29 PD patients and 11 age-matched controls. Combining Mini-Mental State Examination score and oddball P3 counting performance, 15 patients were intellectually normal, 7 moderately, and 7 severely demented. P3 and N1 amplitude and latency, mean amplitude of 1,024 ms post-stimulus (separate after rare and after frequent stimuli), and resting EEG total power for 40 s were computed, a nd linearly regressed for age, sex, and L-dopa dosage. In nondemented PD patients, increased P3 amplitude was confirmed, but N1 amplitude and mean amplitude after rare and frequent stimuli were also increased as well as - most important - resting EEG total power. With increasing dementia, amplitude and power decreased, and P3 latency increased. Task demands cannot explain increased P3 amplitude, since similarly increased EEG total power was found during no-task resting. Prospective studies must determine whether P3 amplitude and EEG power in nondemented PD patients can serve as predictors of dementia. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: We studied Go/NoGo ERPs in 13 healthy subjects during a modified continuous performance test using high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. We measured peak latency. amplitude. and topographic distribution of the components, and analyzed the neural sources using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. Results: There were no differences between the Go and NoGo conditions in the latency, amplitude, scalp topography, or the electrical localization of the P1 and N1 components, The N2 component was seen only in the NoGo ERP, and its source was located in the right lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. The NoGo-P3 component had larger amplitude and longer latency, and was more anteriorly localized than Go-P3 Go-P3 was located mainly in the medial part of the parietal cortex, whereas the NoGo-P3 activity was observed in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that the lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate area,, play critical roles in the inhibitory control of behavior and that both hemispheres are involved in inhibitory cognitive function.

Twenty-four subjects, consisting of equal numbers of dextral and sinistral males and females, performed a mental rotation task under two response conditions (dominant vs non-dominant hand). For males, ERPs showed a right parietal bias regardless of response hand. For females, the parietal ERPs were slightly left-lateralized when making dominant hand responses, but strongly right-lateralized when making non-dominant hand responses. These results support the notion that visuo-spatial processing is more bilaterally organized in females. However, left hemisphere resources may be allocated to response preparation when using the non-dominant hand, forcing visuo-spatial processing to the right hemisphere.

Neurophysiological methods are useful in the diagnosis of dementia because they are non-invasive and functionally diagnostic in demonstrating cortical neuronal activity. Neurophysiological methods can be useful not only in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of syndromes of dementia but also in predicting the most useful therapy and in follow-up monitoring, both of which are highly relevant problems. Several studies have shown that EEG and event-related potential parameters can supply direct pointer to an improvement (or otherwise) of central nervous functions achieved by antidementia drugs. Moreover, we also have initial data on the possibility of predicting therapeutic response to cholinesterase inhibitors. Neurophysiology offers valid methods for diagnosis, follow-up documentations, as well as for research. It is an important additional diagnostic tool in demential disorders, since it involves relatively low cost and has proved helpful alongside structural imaging.

Methods: EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). Results: The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min. Conclusions: The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients. 'Telemonitoring-assisted' BCI training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim is to relate syntactic specificities to the resulting ERP morphologies. Conditions tested required three types of computations: local merge, local merge depending on inheritance of semantic properties from an antecedent and merge performed at distance (WH-displacement). A total of 240 experimental sentences (80 for each condition) and 240 distractor sentences were generated in Brazilian Portuguese. Using a kinetic presentation protocol, sentences were displayed to each of 25 subjects, while the raw EEG was acquired at 20 derivations. Signal processing techniques were used to estimate the individual ERP for each anatomic region. Series 1 involving strictly local computations resulted in classic parietal N400s, whereas the inheritance stimuli elicited two peaks in the parietal and central region ERPs. Series 3-WH-displacement-presented earlier and more salient cortical responses. The different ERP morphologies resulting from each condition are consistent with a model in which language processing results from task-specific computations involving different neurological subsystems.

J	Slawecki, CJ; Thomas, JD; Riley, EP; Ehlers, CL				Slawecki, CJ; Thomas, JD; Riley, EP; Ehlers, CL			Neonatal nicotine exposure alters hippocampal EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) in rats	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						neonatal; nicotine; EEG; event-related potentials; hippocampus; cortex	RADIAL-ARM MAZE; PRENATAL NICOTINE; MATERNAL SMOKING; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; POWER SPECTRA; BRAIN-REGIONS; PERFORMANCE; RECEPTORS; ALTERNATION	A consensus is farming that nicotine can damage the developing rat central nervous system. However, few studies have assessed the electrophysiological effects of neonatal nicotine exposure in rodents in brain regions known to be sensitive to the teratogenic properties of nicotine. In a previous study it was reported that 1.0 and 4.0 mg/kg/day nicotine exposure from postnatal days 4-9, a developmental period corresponding to human third trimester exposure, significantly altered hippocampal event-related potentials (ERPs) but did not effect cortical ERPs, cortical EEG, or hippocampal EEG. Because alterations in behavior and cortical/hippocampal neurochemistry and morphology have been reported following nicotine exposure, the present study used a higher dose of nicotine during the postnatal period (6.0 mg/kg/day) determine if functional changes in the EEG of these regions might contribute to behavioral changes that have been observed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 6.0 mg/kg/day nicotine via gastric infusion using an artificial rearing: "pup-in-the-cup", technique for 6 consecutive days (postnatal days 4-9). At adulthood, EEG and auditory ERPs were recorded from the cortex and hippocampus. There were no significant differences in EEG or ERPs recorded from the cortex between nicotine-treated and control subjects. Examination of the hippocampal EEG revealed significantly decreased power in the 1-2-Hz frequency band of nicotine-treated rats. In addition, there was a significantly attenuated P300 ERP response to a noise tone in the nicotine treated rats compared to controls. These data indicate that neonatal nicotine exposure alters functional activity in the hippocampus of adult rats. These effects are likely to be the result of synaptic disorganization in the hippocampus, and indicate that neonatal nicotine exposure exerts teratogenic effects on the developing central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus, which persist into adulthood.

The aim of this study was to investigate memory encoding- and retrieval-related changes in the frequency domain. In particular, we focused on induced gamma band responses (GBRs), which are a candidate for the establishment and activation of widespread cell assemblies. At encoding, results revealed increased GBRs for subsequently recognised relative to subsequently forgotten items. At retrieval, recognised old stimuli were associated with higher GBRs compared to new stimuli. During encoding and retrieval GBR modulation preceded that of ERPs. Thus, GBRs might be a correlate of processes that onset earlier to those responsible for memory encoding and retrieval ERP effects.

Induced gamma band responses (GBRs), the induced alpha band, and the event-related potential (ERP) were analyzed to uncover neuronal dynamics during selective feature processing. Replicating previous ERP findings, the selection negativity (SN) with a latency of about 160 msec was extracted. Furthermore, and similarly to previous EEG studies, a gamma band peak in a time window between 290 and 380 msec was found. This peak had its major energy in the 55- to 70-Hz range and was significantly larger for the attended color. Contrary to previous human induced gamma band studies, a much earlier 40- to 50-Hz peak in a time window between 160 and 220 msec after stimulus onset and, thus, concurrently to the SN Was prominent with significantly more energy for attended as opposed to unattended color. The induced alpha band (9.8-11.7 Hz), on the other hand, exhibited a marked suppression for attended color in a time window between 450 and 600 msec after stimulus onset. A comparison of the time course of the 40- to 50-Hz and 55- to 70-Hz induced GBR, the induced alpha band, and the ERP revealed temporal coincidences for changes in the morphology of these brain responses. Despite these similarities in the time domain, the cortical source configuration was found to discriminate between induced GBRs and the SN. Our results suggest that large-scale synchronous high-frequency brain activity as measured in the human GBR play a specific role in attentive processing of stimulus features.

Infrequent large checkerboard visual stimuli were randomly interleaved with frequent small ones to elicit P300 event-related potentials (ERPs). Three ERP components, N200, P3a and P3b, were derived from the electroencephalogram (EEC) by computer averaging. The use of 10% contrast and a minimum of four precisely placed scalp electrodes were found to be necessary for optimal separation of ERPs from sensory evoked potentials. Visual ERPs, onset/offset and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs), the spontaneous EEG and the time taken to complete a standard number connection test (NCT) were obtained from 20 normal adult subjects and 19 age-matched patients with histologically-confirmed cirrhosis and no clinical evidence of encephalopathy. The latencies and amplitudes of evoked potentials and the alpha rhythm of the EEG,were determined. In 6 of the 19 patients the latencies of P3a and/or P3b exceeded the corresponding mean for controls + 2 standard deviations of that mean. In 4 other patients the NCT was prolonged. In all of the patients the N200, VEPs and alpha rhythm of the EEG were normal. In conclusion: (i) Optimal isolation of ERPs is critically dependent on stimulus contrast and electrode placement; (ii) ERPs appear to be more sensitive than primary sensory evoked potentials or the EEG in detecting impaired blain neuroetectrophysiological function; and (iii) Cirrhotic patients without overt encephalopathy in whom P3a and/or P3b latencies are prolonged may have subclinical hepatic encephalopathy.

J	Ruijter, J; Lorist, MM; Snel, J; De Ruiter, MB				Ruijter, J; Lorist, MM; Snel, J; De Ruiter, MB			The influence of caffeine on sustained attention: An ERP study	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior	JAN   10, 2000	MORZINE, FRANCE			caffeine; ERP; sustained attention; lapses of attention; concentration; fatigue; Bourdon task	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FATIGUED SUBJECTS; VISUAL VIGILANCE; PERFORMANCE; P300; POTENTIALS; MEMORY; TASK; EEG	The present study investigated the effects of caffeine on sustained attention by measuring concentration and fatigue. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral measures were recorded from 12 participants who worked continuously for approximately 10 min in a self-paced reaction task under conditions of both caffeine (250 mg) and placebo. The ERP data revealed more positive frontal P2 and parietal P3 components in the caffeine condition. However, a combination of different indices of the behavioral data did not reveal any effects of caffeine intake. These results suggest that caffeine increases arousal, thereby reducing fatigue, as was observed in the ERP results. A probable explanation for the absence of any effects of caffeine in the behavioral data can be found in the demanding properties of the task that was used, thereby supporting evidence for more pronounced effects of caffeine in suboptimal conditions. In addition, these results appeal for an increase in the use of ERPs in drug research, in order to discover possible effects on the brain which do not necessarily result in behavioral changes.

All patients were on anti-viral medication for at least 2 months before testing. Auditory stimuli were employed in an easy 2-stimulus oddball discrimination task to obtain a typical P3b (P300) subcomponent. A 3-stimulus distractor paradigm also was employed in which the target/standard discrimination was very difficult, and an infrequent high-pitched tone non-target was presented to elicit the P3a subcomponent. Subjects responded only to the target stimulus in each task. P3a amplitude was significantly smaller for HIV compared to control subjects. No reliable P3b effects were obtained. The findings suggest that P3a rather than P3b may be a more sensitive measure of cognitive impairment in HIV patients on anti-viral medication.

Generic considerations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Editorial Material						electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; statistical parametric mapping	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; WAVELET ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION; FMRI; PET; MEG	In this paper, we frame the strategy and motivations behind developments in statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This work deals specifically with SPM procedures for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). We place these developments in the larger context of integrating electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of evoked brain responses through the fusion of EEG and fMRI data. In this paper, we consider some fundamental issues when selecting an appropriate statistical model that enables diverse questions to be asked of the data and at the same time retains maximum sensitivity. The three key issues addressed in this paper are as follows: (i) should multivariate or mass univariate analyses be adopted, (ii) should time be treated as an experimental factor or as a dimension of the measured response variable, and (iii) how to form appropriate explanatory variables in a hierarchical observation model. We review the relative merits of the different options and explain the rationale for our choices. In brief, we motivate a mass univariate approach in terms of sensitivity to region-specific responses. This involves modeling responses at each voxel or space bin separately. In contradistinction, we treat time as an experimental factor to enable inferences about temporally distributed responses that encompass multiple time bins. In a companion paper, we develop statistical models of ERPs in the time domain that follow from the heuristics established here and illustrate the approach using simulated and real data.

Subjects passively heard particular stimulus combinations interspersed with random combinations. Immediately after this, stimulus combinations were presented which contained violations of the previously learned regular sequences. These violations elicited two frontally distributed negative waves peaked at about 250 ms and 500 ms, respectively. None of the participants could detect any regularity of the stimulation. No significant difference between regular vs random stimulus combinations was found during acquisition. These findings indicate that learning without explicit knowledge does not require motor activity (i.e. is independent of learning response sequences) and does not depend on stimulus probabilities.

Methods: Statistical wavelet thresholding (SWT) performs blind source separation by transforming data to the wavelet domain, and subsequent filtering of wavelet coefficients based on a statistical framework. The observed wavelet coefficients are modelled using a Gaussian distribution, from which low-probability outliers are attenuated based on their z-scores. Results: The technique was applied to both simulated and real event-related potentials (ERP) data. SWT applied to artificial data displayed increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements as noise amplitude increased. ERP averages of filtered experimental data displayed a correlation of 0.93 with operator-filtered data, compared with a correlation of 0.56 for unfiltered data. The energy of operator-designated contaminated trials was attenuated by a factor of 7.46 relative to uncontaminated trials. SNR improvement was observed in simulated tests. Conclusions: Variations of SWT may be useful in situations where one wishes to separate uncommon/uncharacteristic structures from time series data sets. For artefact removal applications, SWT appears to be a valid alternative to expert operator screening. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially. acoustic stimuli of a rich harmonic structure such as square waves (complex tones) elicit a left ear advantage (LEA) under dichotic stimulus application. In order to investigate the timing of early sensory encoding at the level of the supratemporal plane, whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG; 151 channels) recordings were performed in 20 right-handed subjects using an oddball paradigm based on dichotically applied complex tones. In contrast to electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERP), this technique separately measures neuronal activity of left and right auditory cortex. Neuromagnetic responses were obtained both during preattentive stimulus processing, as well as during a pitch detection task. Rare stimuli presented to the left ear elicited a stronger magnetic analogue of mismatch negativity (MMNm) over both hemispheres and gave rise to shorter latencies of the contralateral mismatch fields than right ear deviants. In conclusion, the present data provide first evidence for functional laterality effects even at the level of preattentive pitch processing within the auditory cortex. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Few studies have examined the relationship of increased arousal, anxiety, and P300. In this study,we sought to determine whether P300 group differences could be discerned in well functioning individuals with less severe forms of alcohol use disorders and anxiety disorders. We were particularly interested in looking at the subgroup of alcohol use disorders accompanied by anxiety disorders. This subgroup has previously been found to have diminished a amplitude in the resting EEG. Methods: Male and female community volunteers (99 unrelated index participants and 78 relatives) and 21 unrelated volunteers from an anxiety disorder clinic were interviewed by using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Lifetime version. Blind-rated lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were assigned according to DSM-III-R criteria. Auditory and visual P300 event-related potentials were elicited with an oddball paradigm and were recorded at the midparietal (Pz) site. Results: As expected, auditory P300 amplitudes were significantly reduced in participants with alcohol use disorders and significantly increased in participants with lifetime anxiety disorders. However, more detailed analysis revealed that, in an apparent paradox, auditory P300 amplitudes were lowest in individuals with comorbid alcohol use and anxiety disorders and highest in individuals with anxiety disorders alone. Visual P300 amplitudes followed the same trends but were generally not significant. Conclusions: Even in a sample of largely community-ascertained individuals, auditory P300 amplitude is reduced in alcoholics, particularly those with anxiety disorders, and is highest in nonalcoholics with anxiety disorders.

An EEG and MEG study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mismatch negativity; event-related potential; magnetoencephalography; gamma-aminobutyric acid; benzodiazepine; schizophrenia	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; BRAIN; DYSFUNCTION; GENERATION; CORTEX; HUMANS; PROBABILITY	Objective: Many studies have demonstrated mismatch negativity (MMN) attenuation in schizophrenia. Recently, investigators have shown that GABAergic inhibitory neurons may regulate MMN generation. Considering that a substantial proportion of schizophrenic patients receive anxiolytics and hypnotics that have affinity to GABA(A) receptors to reduce their comorbid symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbances, we need to assess whether anxiolytics/hypnotics might affect their MMN generation. The aim of this study is to assess the possibility that high or low doses of anxiolytics/hypnotics received by schizophrenic subjects affect their mismatch negativity (MMN), using event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods: Twenty-three and 16 patients with schizophrenia participated in the ERP and MEG studies, respectively. Three types of MMN (MMN in response to a duration change of pure-tone stimuli, within-category vowel change (Japanese vowel /a/ with short versus long duration), and across-category vowel change (vowel /a/ versus /o/)) were recorded. Results: High or low doses of benzodiazepine had no significant effects on MMN amplitude/magnetic MMN power, topography/laterality, or latency under any conditions of the ERP or MEG study. Conclusions: These results suggest that chronic administration of anxiolytics/hypnotics does not significantly affect MMN in schizophrenia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the two measures are not identical and reflect different aspects of neuronal function at a physiological level. There is increasing interest in using these methods in combination because of the complementary information they provide about brain activation. ERPs provide more detailed information about the timing of neural activity, while fMRI provides more detailed information about its spatial location. Thus, their combined use may provide more detailed spatio-temporal information than either method alone. In this paper, we review the basic principles of ERP and fMRI and present selected studies from our own work to illustrate their strengths for studies of development. In addition, we discuss the potential benefits and special challenges of the combined use of electrophysiological and functional MRI techniques.

Of the 130 female subjects, 29 met DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for a lifetime history of a Major Depressive Episode. Event-related electroencephalographic potentials were recorded from each subject while she performed a complex visual oddball task. Analyses indicated a decrement in P300 amplitude in the depressed group as compared to girls with no history of depression. No effects of family history of alcoholism or drug dependence were detected. Current source density analyses, utilizing a realistic head-shape boundary element model, indicated that the difference between the depressed and non-depressed groups was maximal in the right prefrontal region. These results provide further support for the notion that the cognitive difficulties associated with depression are subtle and best detected with sensitive neurophysiological indices, such as P300.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the intracerebral origin and distribution of these potentials. Seven intractable epileptic patients participated in the study. A total of 231 sites in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes were investigated by means of depth electrodes. A standard visual oddball paradigm was performed, and electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs with correct and incorrect motor reactions were averaged independently. Prominent, mostly biphasic, ERP complexes resembling scalp Ne/Pe potentials were consistently observed in several cortical locations after incorrect trials. The most consistent findings were obtained from mesiotemporal structures; in addition to P3-like activity found after correct responses, an Ne/Pe complex was generally detected after incorrect trials. The Pe had a longer latency than the P3. Other generators of Ne/Pe-like potentials were located in different regions of the frontal lobe. The latency of the Ne was shortest in parietal, longer in temporal, and longest in frontal regions. Our findings firstly show that multiple cortical structures generate Ne and Pe. In addition to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the mesiotemporal and some prefrontal cortical sites seem to represent integral components of the brain's error-checking system. Secondly, the coupling of Ne and Pe to a complex suggests a common origin of Ne and Pe. Thirdly, the latency differences of the Ne across lobes suggest that the Ne is primarily elicited in posterior and temporal, and only later in frontal regions.

This eye-fixation-related potential (EFRP) is a type of event-related potential. In this paper, the authors introduced two systems developed at their laboratory. The first measured the distribution of EFRPs on the scalp with DC amplifiers in order to nullify eye movement artifacts. Three-dimensional EFRP topographies were obtained. The most prominent component (lambda response) of the waveform appeared at occipital sites. The second system was designed to examine the variation in EFRPs over time, using a sliding average method. The dynamic variation in EFRPs could be observed as an animation. The sequence of variations in amplitude was continuously displayed on a screen. This indicated the process of decrease and recovery of the lambda response generated by changes between periods of brightness and darkness.

The major computational procedures of FD include adaptive segmentation, the frequency domain component identification, and creation of the signal model as a linear aggregation of multiple components, with the generic mass potential (GMP) being the universal component template. This paper presents an improved, high-resolution FD technique which allows the resolution of overlapping sub-components and supports each identified component by an individual model. On the basis of this methodological innovation, we define two fundamental categories of multi-peak component waveforms: complex components (CC), comprised of multiple sub-components (GMPs), versus monolithic components (MC), involving a single GMP. We show that quantification of MCs and CCs from single-trial eyeblink EMG and single-trial ER-P provides a more comprehensive analysis of these signals. Given single-trial eyeblink EMG, we find that the stimulus elicits strong though short-term (phasic) effects on MCs and moderate but long-lasting (tonic) effects on CCs. A new realm of single-trial ERP quantification is possible in that the MC appears as a marker of a single cognitive variable whereas the CC appears as a marker of a series of functionally related cognitive variables. The engagement of the brain in a specific cognitive task is accompanied by an increase of CCs in single-trial ERPs, which is especially informative with respect to the P3 cognitive potential. New methodology provides evidence for the three basic types of single-trial P3 sub-components: monolithic P3a, monolithic P31b, and a complex component, P3ab, which includes both P3a and P3b as sub-components.

There exists a persistent uncertainty regarding the influence of volume conduction effects such as the anisotropy of tissue conductivity of the skull and the white matter layers on the inverse results. In this paper, we will study the sensitivity to anisotropy of the source reconstruction of the Early Left Anterior Negativity (ELAN) component in language processing. For EEG, the presence of tissue anisotropy substantially compromises the restoration ability of an L1-norm current density approach. The centers of activity are strongly shifted along the Sylvian fissure in the anterior direction. In contrast, MEG in combination with the L1 norm approach is able to reconstruct the main features of the ELAN source distribution even in the presence of anisotropic conductivity.

We developed a software routine for analysis and visualization of spatiotemporal patterns of EEG oscillations: event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS). Further, the spatiotemporal representation of task-related coherence (TRC) was also proposed for investigation of interregional neuronal connectivity. As concurrent artifacts and volume conduction effect may result incorrect or spatially blurred estimation of EEG features, we have embedded data preprocessing functions to reduce these effects including: correcting eye movement-related artifact, changing reference methods and spatial filtering undesirable neuronal activity. These functions were subsequently applied to study EEG time-frequency patterns during self-paced movements in normal volunteers.

The new method uses a regression based subtraction procedure as a way to account for latency and amplitude variability within individual trials. It was applied using the oddball paradigm under conditions of active and passive listening and analyzed as spectral correlations (normalized differences) between post-stimulus epochs of standard, target or deviant stimulus conditions and silent prestimulus baseline activity. The regression-subtraction procedure accounted for a greater amount of variance than a method that uses linear subtraction alone. The major component of the response to auditory stimulation was an event-related synchronization in the delta and theta (24 Hz) frequency range. Event-related desynchronizations were also observed in the 10 Hz (alpha/mu) and in the 20-30 Hz (beta) frequency range. The regression based subtraction procedure provides better separation of stimulus-locked and unlocked components of event-related EEG activity then linear subtraction alone. Stimulus-locked and unlocked components show different patterns and topographies of effects related to attention and active discrimination. Studying both stimulus-locked and unlocked components of event-related EEG reactivity in the frequency domain provides a more comprehensive account of dynamic brain activity subserving auditory information processing.

Purpose: This study was conducted to investigate changes in several measures usually viewed as reflecting states of sedation/sleepiness associated with the use of a range of doses of the hypnotic benzodiazepine (BZD) flunitrazepam (FNZ). Methods: This was a double blind, independent group design study of the effects of acute oral doses of FNZ in young healthy volunteers. Forty-eight subjects were randomly allocated to one of four groups-FNZ (0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg) and placebo (PLAC)-and tested prior to treatment and then in a posttreatment session close to the theoretical peak plasma concentration. ERP latencies and amplitudes were measured at midfrontal (Fz), midcentral (Cz), and midparietal (Pz) using a standard auditory oddball paradigm. EEG changes were assessed at Pz. Behavioural measures included the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), a cancellation task (CT), and subjective ratings of alertness and attentiveness by the subjects (SUB) and the experimenter (EXP). Results: FNZ led to psychomotor impairments and decreased alertness and attention; these effects were consistent with previous findings. A progressive, dose-related increase in P3 latency occurred in Fz, Cz, and Pz, and there was an increase in N1 (Fz, Cz) and N2 (Fz). N2-P3 amplitude decreased in Fz. EEG power bands beta 1 increased for the two highest doses, but no significant differences were noted in theta, delta, and alpha bands. P3 latencies, experimenter-rated levels of alertness, and DSST scores differentiated all three doses of FNZ from PLAC. Conclusion: The most sensitive measures used were P3 latencies of the ERPs (which varied with FNZ dose), DSST, and the experimenter-rated levels of alertness. However, we found no evidence for the assumption that one single phenomenon was reflected in all measures and different mechanisms were probably involved. Further experiments will be needed for more in-depth probing of the finer mechanisms underlying sedation/sleepiness and how they affect behavioural and eletrophysiological measures of the central nervous system (CNS) function.

However, it is not known if any component of these waves arises from a common brain system activated by different symbolic forms. Methods: Multichannel EEG recordings were performed in 10 healthy subjects during the presentation of lexical and numerical series with congruent and incongruent endings. EEG was analysed using a combination of independent component and cluster analysis. Results: Contextual integration of semantic stimuli elicited a negative independent component at around 400 ms that shared the same pattern of spatio-temporal covariation across numerical series and sentences within single subjects. This independent component was bigger following incongruent endings. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that one element of the activity contributing to the N400 is common to different symbolic forms. Significance: One component of the brain systems evaluating the semantic inter-relationship of new stimuli with prior context may be common to different symbolic forms.

Methods: ERPs were recorded during passive and active reading of centrally presented alphabetic letters and non alphabetic symbols. EEG was recorded from 10 EEG locations using the 10-20 system. Diagonal FOG from the right eye was also recorded. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied in order to reduce ocular artefacts: the first or the second principal component (PC) was subtracted when the correlation coefficient between the component and FOG was greater or equal to 0.9 or 0.95, respectively. Performance of the method was tested on simulated and real data, on both single and averaged trials, varying FOG amplitude and artefact transmission characteristics. Results: Applying the method to real recordings from normal and dyslexic children, we obtained a significant increase in the number of useful trials. In normal children we retrieved 41.0% of the rejected trials in passive and 39.1% in active reading. In dyslexic children 36.7 and 32.2% of the rejected trials in passive and active reading could be included in the respective averages. Conclusions: The method allows an increase in the number of trials suitable for averaging, a great improvement in ERP quality and a reduction in the recording time.

Acute marijuana smoking can disrupt working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) functions that are known to rely on these regions. However, the effects of marijuana on the brain activity accompanying such cognitive processes remain largely unexplored. Objectives: To examine such effects on performance and neurophysiological signals of these functions, EEG recordings were obtained from ten subjects (5M, 5F) performing cognitive tasks before and after smoking marijuana (3.45% Delta(9)-THC) or a placebo. WM was assessed with a spatial N-back task, and EM was evaluated with a test requiring recognition of words after a 5-10 min delay between study and test. Results: Marijuana increased heart rate and decreased global theta band EEG power, consistent with increased autonomic arousal. Responses in the WM task were slower and less accurate after smoking marijuana, accompanied by reduced alpha band EEG reactivity in response to increased task difficulty. In the EM task, marijuana was associated with an increased tendency to erroneously identify distracter words as having been previously studied. In both tasks, marijuana attenuated stimulus-locked event-related potentials (ERPs). Conclusions: The results suggest that marijuana disrupted both sustained and transient attention processes resulting in impaired memory task performance. In subjects most affected by marijuana a pronounced ERP difference between previously studied words and new distracter words was also reduced, suggesting disruption of neural mechanisms underlying memory for recent study episodes.

Yet, multiple implicit variables maybe involved in limited ERP measures. Special computation techniques are needed to recover these parameters. In the study of attention, we can obtain the ERP in attended (V) and unattended (U) conditions. Usually, the effect of attention is computed as the difference (D) between V and U with the assumption that D and U are independent. Yet, they should be related. Treating V as a function of U, a linear model V = W + GU is assumed, where W and G are implicit in the ERP measures. G is the gain control on the unattended function. Provided G and W are constant over a local brain region, we can use the Total Least Square (TLS) algorithm to compute their values. In the experiment, participants attended to one side of a fixed point, and stimulus of circular checkerboard was flashed either to the attended or the unattended side. The values of W and G as functions of V and U were computed showing that multiple implicit variables are involved in attention. The gain amplification (G) is found to be greater than I before 200 msec and much less than I afterwards. The values of G and W may shed light on the nature of attention.

J	Imas, OA; Ropella, KM; Wood, JD; Hudetz, AG				Imas, OA; Ropella, KM; Wood, JD; Hudetz, AG			Halothane augments event-related gamma oscillations in rat visual cortex	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anesthesia; consciousness; EEG; evoked potential; righting; synchrony	STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; BISPECTRAL INDEX; BAND ACTIVITY; ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; ISOFLURANE; MODULATION; FREQUENCY	Cortical gamma oscillations have been associated with neural processes supporting cognition and the state of consciousness but the effect of general anesthesia on gamma oscillations is controversial. Here we studied the concentration-dependent effect of halothane on gamma (20-60 Hz) power of event-related potentials (ERP) in rat primary visual cortex. ERP to light flashes repeated at 5-s intervals was recorded with chronically implanted, bipolar, intracortical electrodes at selected steady-state halothane concentrations between 0 and 2%. gamma-Band power was calculated for 0-1000, 0-300 and 300-1000 ms post-stimulus periods and corresponding prestimulus (PS) periods. Multitaper power spectral analysis was used to estimate gamma power from both single-trial and average ERP in order to differentiate between phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced) gamma activities. Significant PS gamma power was present at all halothane concentrations. Flash elicited an increase in gamma power that lasted up to 1 s poststimulus at all halothane concentrations. Halothane at intermediate concentrations (0.5-1.2%) augmented both PS and ERP gamma power two to four times relative to the waking baseline. gamma Power was not different between waking and deeply anesthetized (2%) levels. gamma Power reached maximum, as predicted by a Gaussian fit of power-concentration data, at halothane concentration (0.86%) similar to the concentration (0.73%) that abolished the righting reflex, a behavioral index of loss of consciousness. Evoked, i.e. stimulus-locked, gamma power was present during the first 300 ms poststimulus but not later, and was approximately 50% of single-trial ERP gamma power. Single-trial gamma power was present also at 300-1000 ms poststimulus, reflecting ERP not phase-locked to the stimulus. In summary, these observations suggest that (1) gamma activity is present in states ranging from waking to deep halothane anesthesia, (2) halothane does not prevent the transfer of visual input to striate cortex even at surgical plane of anesthesia, and (3) anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness, as reflected by the loss of righting reflex, is not correlated with a reduction in gamma power.

This was studied in 13 healthy subjects (21-30 years old; 6 females) by using a dietary challenge, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), which decreases 5-HT synthesis in the brain. Five hours after ingestion of either ATD or control mixture (randomized, double-blinded, crossover design), brain responses indexing involuntary attention were measured with simultaneous 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and 122-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG). During the measurement, the subjects were instructed to discriminate equiprobable 200- and 400-ms tones by pressing one of two buttons rapidly. Occasionally, the frequency of the tones changed (10% increase/decrease), causing involuntary attention shifting. ATD significantly lowered plasma tryptophan concentrations (total tryptophan decreased by 75%, free tryptophan decreased by 35%). As compared to the control condition, ATD reduced the amplitude of the deviant-tone N2 wave, including the overlapping mismatch negativity (MMN) and N2b subcomponents, which are suggested to reflect change detection in the brain. The EEG results were accompanied by a significant increase in the peak latency of the magnetic counterpart of MMN. However, no ATD effects were observed in P3 to task-irrelevant frequency change. Reaction time (RT) to deviants per se was not significantly affected, but RT in trials succeeding the deviant-frequency tones was increased by ATD, which suggested impaired reorienting to the task-relevant activity. In conclusion, the results suggest that decreased level of central 5-HT function after ATD may decrease involuntary attention shifting to task-irrelevant sound changes and thus modulate resource allocation to the task-relevant activity.

P300 latencies were longer in elderly (vs young) adults and in visual (vs auditory) tasks, and visual tasks elicited larger P300 amplitudes than auditory tasks in both age groups. Neither stimulus modality nor response mode affected P300 differentiation of young and elderly subjects. Steeper P300 anterior-posterior scalp amplitude gradients were seen in the young (vs elderly) adults, regardless of stimulus or response type, Examination of inter-subject variability with the coefficient of variation (CV) statistic found the lowest (i.e., best) CV values to be exhibited in the visual task requiring the counting of target stimuli. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to P300 applications in the clinical assessment of dementia and aging-associated cognitive alterations.

These potentials are described as evoked potentials. There is another type of change in the ongoing EEG, which is time-locked but not phase-locked to an event: the EEG rhythm reactivity, also called "Event-Related Desynchronization and Synchronization" (ERD/ERS) by Pfurtscheller. These changes are often visible to the naked eye but they cannot be extracted by the averaging technique. Their quantification requires another method, which was suggested by Pfurtscheller and Aranibar in 1977. This method consists in measuring the temporal evolution of the power of EEG signal within a given frequency band before, during, and after an event. ERD corresponds to the decrease in power of an EEG rhythm related to an event. Conversely, ERS corresponds to an increase in amplitude of an EEG rhythm related to the event. ERD represents the activation of the subjacent cortical areas. ERS would partly traduce the setting at rest of the cortex; it would also be related to the somesthetics afferents inputs. This method can be applied to the study of cortical activation in many situations: memory tasks, auditory processing, attention, anticipatory behavior, and voluntary movement. Thus, a voluntary self-paced movement of the dominant hand is preceded by an ERD of mu and beta rhythms occurring respectively 2 000 and 1 500 ms before the movement onset. This ERD is recorded over the contralateral central region. It becomes bilateral at the movement onset and reaches its maximum at the movement offset. It is then followed by an ERS of the beta rhythms. We show that ERD/ERS phenomena vary with the type of movement, and that their study allows exploring the modifications of cortical excitability that are observed in Parkinson's disease and in epilepsy with focal motor seizures.

Several requirements have to be met for the successful integration of diverse imaging methods: 1) paradigms have to be developed that can be used with both classes of techniques, 2) a common coordinate system should be employed. We illustrate the possibilities of combined neuroimaging by several recent examples. Moreover, prospective clinical applications are discussed.

The electrical brain activity resulting from the brief electromagnetic pulse was recorded with high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and located using inversion algorithms. Focal magnetic pulses to the left motor cortex were delivered with a figure-of-eight coil at the random interstimulus interval of 1.5-2.5 s. The stimulation intensity was adjusted to the motor threshold of abductor digiti minimi. Two conditions before and after ethanol ingestion (30 in) were applied: (1) real TMS, with the coil pressed against the scalp; and (2) control condition, with the coil separated from the scalp by a 2-cm-thick piece of plastic. A separate EMG control recording of one subject during TMS was made with two bipolar platinum needle electrodes inserted to the left temporal muscle. In each condition, 120 pulses were delivered. The EEG was recorded from 60 scalp electrodes. A peak in the EEG signals was observed at 43 ms after the TMS pulse in the real-TMS condition but not in the control condition or in the control scalp EMG. Potential maps before and after ethanol ingestion were significantly different from each other (P = 0.01), but no differences were found in the control condition. Ethanol changed the TMS-evoked potentials over right frontal and left parietal areas, the underlying effect appearing to be largest in the right prefrontal area. Our findings suggest that ethanol may have changed the functional connectivity between prefrontal and motor cortices. This new noninvasive method provides direct evidence about the modulation of cortical connectivity after ethanol challenge. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Wavelet transformation ( AM analyses were performed on the non-target (P3a) and target (P3b) ERPs to assay how the underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was affected by both the difficulty and novelty factors. When target/standard discrimination was easy, P300 amplitude was higher for the target than the non-target across all electrode sites, and both demonstrated parietal maximums. In contrast, when target/standard discrimination was difficult, non-target amplitude (P3a) was higher and earlier over the frontal/central electrode sites for both levels of novelty, whereas target amplitude (P3b) was greater parietally and occurred later than the non-target components and was generally unaffected by non-target novelty level. The WT analyses indicated that appreciable theta activity was related to the more novel non-target stimuli; primarily target component delta coefficients were affected by the discrimination difficulty variable. The findings suggest that target/standard discrimination difficulty, rather than stimulus novelty, determines P3a generation for visual stimuli but that the underlying theta oscillations are differentially affected by stimulus novelty. WT analysis methods are discussed along with the theoretical and neurophysiological implications of the findings.

Much prior literature supports the view that patients with left TLE are more likely to develop verbal memory deficits, often attributable to left hippocampal sclerosis. Our main objectives were to test if abnormalities of the N400 or Late Positive Component (LPC, P600) were associated with a left temporal seizure focus, or left temporal lobe dysfunction. A minimum of 19 channels of EEG/EOG data were collected while subjects performed a semantic categorization task. Auditory category statements were followed by a visual target word, which were 50% "congruous" (category exemplars) and 50% "incongruous" (non-category exemplars) with the preceding semantic context. These auditory-visual pairings were repeated pseudo-randomly at time intervals ranging from similar to10-140 seconds later. The ERP data were submitted to repeated-measures ANOVAs, which showed the RTE group had generally normal effects of word repetition on the LPC and the N400. Also, the N400 component was larger to incongruous than congruous new words, as is normally the case. In contrast, the LTE group did not have statistically significant effects of either word repetition or congruity on their ERPs (N400 or LPC), suggesting that this ERP semantic categorization paradigm is sensitive to left temporal lobe dysfunction. Further studies are ongoing to determine if these ERP abnormalities predict hippocampal sclerosis on histopathology, or outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy.

In both tasks subjects (N=12) had to detect target letters in picture names, the target letter being positioned either at the beginning or at the end of the picture name. Between tasks, the target letter was shown either before (target-picture, TP) or after (picture-target, PT) the presentation of the object pictures. In both tasks, subjects responded faster, whenever the target letter appeared at the beginning of the picture name than at its end. The EEG, recorded from 64 electrodes, was analyzed in the signal and in the source space (using the Minimum Norm estimate). Differences in the event-related potential (ERP) following the second stimulus became evident earlier in the PT (at 320 ms) than the TP (456 ms) task. This onset of diverging ERPs was called the "point of divergence" (POD). The ERP following the POD was characterized by a positive deflection in the "begin" condition in both tasks. In the "end" condition, the sources of brain activity were focused over the left hemisphere in the TP, while a bilateral distribution characterized the PT task. Performance and electrocortical indices support the hypothesis of serial "left-to-right" processing of a representation of the picture name. The left-hemispheric activity focus in the TP task is assumed to indicate the encoding of the picture name, while frontal symmetrical activity in the PT task might indicate the involvement of working memory processes.

The aim of this study was to determine whether evidence could be found for memory-related changes in the EEG. EEG was recorded from a sample of healthy volunteers while they performed ward and face recognition memory tasks. Data were analyzed using the method of event-related desynchronization. In the theta frequency range there was a short-duration increase in power that occurred in the first 250 ms that was maximal at temporal sites (T5/T6). For words, but not faces, there was a repetition effect in theta such that new words elicited greater synchronization than old words at the midline frontal electrode (Fz). In the alpha frequency range there was a lateralized repetition effect, which occurred from 750 ms. In upper alpha this effect was lateralized in the expected way with greater desynchronization at temporo-parietal sites an the left for words and on the right far faces. For lower alpha, the lateralization was reversed. The meanings of these findings are interpreted in the light of existing models of recognition memory.

Both the ERN and Pe have been source-localized to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-a frontal structure implicated in both cognitive and affective processing, as well as autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation. The current study sought to examine the relationships among the ERN, the Pe, two autonomic measures, and behavior. Electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate (HR), and skin conductance (SC) were recorded while subjects performed a two-choice reaction-time task. In addition to the characteristic ERN-Pe complex, errors were associated with larger SCRs and greater HR deceleration. The ERN correlated with the number of errors, but was unrelated to ANS activity and compensatory behavior. Pe, on the other hand, was correlated significantly with SCR, and both SCR and Pe were significantly correlated with post-error slowing.

In the flanker task, a target stimulus is surrounded by distracting information that can be congruent or incongruent with the correct response. Developmental differences in the time course of brain activations involved in conflict processing were examined for 22 four year old children and 18 adults. Subjects performed a child-friendly flanker task while their brain activity was registered using a high-density electroencephalography system. Results: General differences were found in the amplitude and time course of event-related potentials (ERPs) between children and adults that are consistent with their differences in reaction time. In addition, the congruency of flankers affected both the amplitude and latency of some of the ERP components. These effects were delayed and sustained for longer periods of time in the children compared to the adults. Conclusions: These differences constitute neural correlates of children's greater difficulty in monitoring and resolving conflict in this and similar tasks.

Three special EEG patterns of marginal to slightly abnormal character are discussed: a) rhythmical midfrontal 6-7/sec activity of juveniles, b) rhythmical midfrontal sharp 4-6/sec activity of infancy and early childhood with arousal from sleep, and c) frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA) in waking adults with frontopolar maximum, possibly related to thought processes under abnormal conditions. With extension of the frequency range, ultraslow (DC-like) as well as fast beta (gamma, 40-80/sec) and ultrafast activity (80-1000/sec) are found particularly over the frontal lobes. Ultraslow baseline shifts are arousal-related and mixed with overlying ultrafast waves. Attention control and the "working memory" involve chiefly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, investigated with P300 responses and likely to show ultrafast spectra. Perception -related 40-80/sec gamma activity has been thought to be associated with the entrance into consciousness. Initiation and design of motor activity spreads from prefrontal to the frontomotor cortex, associated with powerful event-related potentials: contingent negative variation (CNV) and "Bereitschafts potential" ("readiness potential," RP). Neuroscientific research of the highest frontal lobe functions has become a very active domain of neuroimaging. With the use of the extended frequency range, EEG and also evoked potential studies could add further information with acquisition in real time.

We provide evidence that using independent component analysis (ICA) as a signal decomposition filter prior to applying the inverse solution reveals sources that cannot be detected by conventional source localisation methods. Five clusters of sources emerged: a single source cluster in caudal cingulate and bilateral sources in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), inferior parietal cortex, premotor cortex and insular cortex. The locations of the source dipoles were consistent with findings using fMRI and PET but have not all been previously detected in a single electrophysiological study. In addition, the time-course of the activation of these dipoles was estimated. The results suggest that using ICA to localise single trial data is a powerful tool for exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of rapid and complex brain processes.

In the present study, we use a component of the event-related brain potential called the error-retated negativity (ERN) to ask whether a high-level, generic error-processing system is compromised in Parkinson's disease. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from nine patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and from nine normal control subjects while they performed a choice reaction time task. We found that the amplitude of the ERN was the same for both populations, indicating that the error-processing system associated with the ERN is not severely compromised in this Parkinson's disease population. These results are discussed in terms of disease progession. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This might be associated with pronounced involuntary attention shifting to task-irrelevant stimulus changes and, thereafter, an impaired reorienting to the relevant task. The neural abnormalities that underlie such deficits in alcoholics were explored with event-related potential (ERP) components that disclosed different phases of detection and orienting to stimulus changes. Methods: Twenty consecutive abstinent male alcoholics (DSM-TV) and 20 age-matched male controls (healthy social drinkers) were instructed to discriminate equiprobable 100 and 200 msec tones in a reaction-time task (RT) and to ignore occasional, either slight (7%) or wide (70%), frequency changes (hypothesized to increase RT) during an ERP measurement. Results: In the alcoholics, we found pronounced distractibility, evidenced by a RT lag (p < 0.01) caused by deviants, that correlated (Spearman <rho> = 0.5) with a significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) amplitude of mismatch negativity (MMN) to deviants. Significantly increased RT lag for trials subsequent to deviants (slight p < 0.001, wide p < 0.05) in the alcoholics suggested impaired reorienting to the relevant task. The MMN enhancement also predicted poorer hit rates in the alcoholics (Spearman <rho> = 0.6-0.7). Both the MMN enhancement and pronounced distractibility correlated (Spearman rho = 0.4) with an early onset of alcoholism. Conclusions: Attentional deficits in the abstinent alcoholics were indicated by the increased distractibility by irrelevant sound changes. The MMN enhancement suggested that this reflects impaired neural inhibition of involuntary attention shifting, being most pronounced in early-onset alcoholics.

In an attempt to resolve this problem we carried out various studies to investigate subjective reactions and late components (N150 and P260) of the event-related potential of the EEG following noxious stimulation. The first study showed that while hypnosis reduced pain, it did not affect the ERP amplitudes. Since some authors suggested that hypnotic analgesia is caused by distraction, we compared in a second study the effects of hypnosis with those of distraction. In a third study we compared highly suggestible with poorly suggestible subjects and found that only the former experienced a reduction in pain perception under hypnosis. Both studies showed that, while ERP-amplitudes were significantly reduced by distraction, they remained unchanged under hypnosis. These results suggest that hypnotic analgesia and distraction represent different mechanisms of pain control based on different electrical processes in the brain. We postulate that hypnosis induces "dissociation" between different brain structures involved in the processing of pain, which, while leaving the activity of the individual structures unimpaired, inhibits communication between them. This breakdown of communication might represent the decisive cortical mechanism responsible for reduction or absence of pain perception under hypnotic suggestion.

In the present study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to investigate the involvement and temporal dynamics of the frontal and parietal regions in the processing of angry facial expressions. Angry, happy and neutral faces were shown to eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers in a passive viewing task. Stimulus-locked ERPs were recorded from the frontal and parietal scalp sites. The P200, N300 and early contingent negativity variation (eCNV) components of the electric brain potentials were investigated. Analyses revealed statistical significant reductions in P200 amplitudes for the angry facial expression on both frontal and parietal electrode sites. Furthermore, apart from being strongly associated with the anterior P200, the N300 showed to be more negative for the angry facial expression in the anterior regions also. Finally, the eCNV was more pronounced over the parietal sites for the angry facial expressions. The present study demonstrated specific electrocortical correlates underlying the processing of angry facial expressions in the anterior and posterior brain sectors. The P200 is argued to indicate valence tagging by a fast and early detection mechanism. The lowered N300 with an anterior distribution for the angry facial expressions indicates more elaborate evaluation of stimulus relevance. The fact that the P200 and the N300 are highly correlated suggests that they reflect different stages of the same anterior evaluation mechanism. The more pronounced posterior eCNV suggests sustained attention to socially threatening information. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The component may often be low-amplitude, compared to other components such as the P300. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques have been successfully applied in ERP processing, in the framework of Blind Source Separation (BSS) for unmixing recorded potentials into a sum of temporally independent and spatially fixed components. In the present work ICA was used for reconstructing averaged ERPs in the time window of the P600 component, selecting a subset of independent components' projections to the original electrode recording positions. The selection is based on two empirical criteria, selecting the projection that reconstructs a P600 nearest temporally to the original P600, or selecting the projection combination - up to a preselected maximum number of combined projections providing maximum reconstructed P600 amplitude. The techniques are tested on ERPs recorded from healthy subjects and psychiatric patients, notably improving the differentiation of the two groups, based on either the amplitude or the latency of the reconstructed P600 component, in comparison to results achieved using the original ERPs.

Promising results from the application of these methods to the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related brain potential (ERP) activity have been reported. Symbolic measures used thus Car have two limitations, however. First, because the value of complexity increases with the length of the message, it is difficult to compare signals of different epoch lengths. Second, these symbolic measures do not generalize easily to the multichannel case. We address these issues in studies in which both single and multichannel EEGs were analyzed using measures of signal complexity and algorithmic redundancy, the latter being defined as a sequence-sensitive generalization of Shannon's redundancy. Using a binary partition of EEG activity about the median, redundancy was shown to be insensitive to the size of the data set while being sensitive to changes in the subject's behavioral state (eyes open vs. eyes closed). The covariance complexity, calculated from the singular value spectrum of a multichannel signal was also found to be sensitive to changes in behavioral state. Statistical separations between the eyes open and eyes closed conditions were found to decrease following removal of the 8- to 12-Hz content in the EEG, but still remained statistically significant. Use of symbolic measures in multivariate signal classification is described.

The amplitude of the P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) has been suggested to be an index of 'vulnerability to alcoholism', especially Mien it is elicited by visual tasks in younger individuals. Visual P3 tasks, however, have not been previously investigated in Native American youth. One hundred and four Mission Indian youth between the ages of 7 and 13 years participated in the study. ERPs were collected using two visual target paradigms: a facial discrimination and an estimation of line orientation task. Analyses of covariance revealed that participants with a first degree family history of alcoholism had lower P3 component amplitudes in frontal leads to the facial discrimination task. Lower P3 amplitudes, in posterior areas, were found in the line discrimination task in children who scored above the 75th percentile in delinquent behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. These findings are consistent with investigations in non-Indian populations demonstrating that the late positive component of the event related potential is sensitive to both familial history of alcohol dependence as well as personal history of externalizing behaviors.

The spatio-temporal dynamics of several ERP components related to attention to color were characterized using topographic profile analysis, topographic mapping of the ERP and associated scalp current density distributions, and spatio-temporal source potential modeling. Boys with ADHD showed a lower target hit rate, a higher false-alarm rate, and a lower perceptual sensitivity than controls. Also, whereas color attention induced in the ER-Ps from controls a characteristic early frontally maximal selection positivity (FSP), ADHD boys displayed little or no FSP. Similarly, ADHD boys manifested P3b amplitude decrements that were partially lateralized (i.e., maximal at left temporal scalp locations) as well as affected by maturation. These results indicate that ADHD boys suffer from deficits at both relatively early (sensory) and late (semantic) levels of visual selective information processing. The data also support the hypothesis that the visual selective processing deficits observed in the ADHD boys originate from deficits in the strength of activation of a neural network comprising prefrontal and occipito-temporal brain regions. This network seems to be actively engaged during attention to color and may contain the major intracerebral generating sources of the associated scalp-recorded ER-P components.

Because this state changes over time and might also be influenced by the VE, itself, we propose an implementation of an electrophysiological brain monitoring system focussing on event-related potentials (ERPs) and conventional EEG signals. ERPs provide information related to the respective cognitive functional state as a reliable method for assessing the underlying brain activity. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 are cognitive event-related potentials that reflect preattentive (MMN) and attention-dependent (P300) information processing. The conventional EEG is capable of detecting the degree of the subjects drowsiness or alertness, such as the involvement of specific cortical areas during the task at hand. The goal of the present work was to establish a neurophysiological monitoring in VE.

Theories explaining the AB assume that processing of T2 is more vulnerable to decay or substitution, as long as attention is allocated to T1. Existing models of the AB, however, do not account for the fact that T2 detection accuracy reaches the minimum when T2 is presented after about 300 ms and not immediately following T1, Therefore, a new, model is suggested, which is based on chronometrical considerations together with recent neurophysiological findings concerning the relation between the P3 event-related potential and the AB the interaction between P3 and gamma oscillations, and the significance of the earls evoked gamma band response, We hypothesize that suppression of the early gamma response to T2. accompanying the P3 related to T1, causes the AB.

Tones: Subjects were instructed to respond to a 2kHz tone, and ignore a 1kHz tone. 2. Phonological: Subjects were instructed to respond only to words that had a specific ending ("f"). 3. Semantic: Subjects were instructed to respond to words that belonged to a specific category (name of alphabetic letters). EEG was recorded from 19 electrode sites. Peak amplitude of the early component (N100) did not differ significantly across the three tasks, while peak latency differed significantly across stimuli. In contrast, the later endogenous component (P300) was stimulus-and task-dependent. P300 latency differed significantly across stimuli and tasks; 327 ms to target tones; 668 ms to the phonological targets; and 706 ms to target words in the semantic task. P300 amplitude was significantly larger to tones than to linguistic stimuli. P300 peak amplitude recorded from electrode sites over the left hemisphere to the tonal target stimuli did not differ significantly from that recorded over the right hemisphere. In contrast, P300 amplitude recorded to both the phonological and semantic targets was significantly larger over the left hemisphere than over the right hemisphere. The present results can aid in our understanding of how humans process linguistic stimuli. These findings emphasize the importance of using similar experimental protocols for a broad comparison of the ERP response to a variety of stimuli and tasks.

It is intended to model the frequent and periodic disruption experienced in common sleep disorders. Sleep fragmentation leads to daytime sleepiness, although evidence of performance impairment has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to investigate brain physiology associated with this level of sleep disruption. Specifically, quantitative analysis of electroencephalography was carried out, and auditory event-related potentials were recorded during daytime performance assessment following sleep fragmentation in good sleepers. Design: Participants spent 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in the laboratory. On nights 2 and 3, sleep was fragmented using auditory stimuli that were delivered with increasing intensity until an arousal was noted. This design aimed to investigate the cumulative effects of sleep fragmentation on daytime functioning. Setting: Data were collected in a sleep research laboratory during a 96-hour protocol. Participants: Eight healthy adults (mean age = 33.25) with no sleep complaints. Measurements and Results: During the day, participants performed a 40-minute computerized test battery at 2-hour intervals (9:00 am -7:00 pm). The battery was presented in a fixed order and included measures of mood, sleepiness, reaction time, and serial addition or subtraction. Results indicated that subjective sleepiness and mood were impaired following sleep-fragmentation nights, compared to both baseline and recovery conditions. No performance deficits were apparent. The alpha:theta ratio, reflecting relative slowing of the electroencephalogram, was dramatically reduced following the second night of sleep fragmentation. Reductions in N1 amplitude of the event-related potentials indicated that attention was impaired with respect to early encoding processes following sleep fragmentation. Conclusions: Electroencephalographic and event-related potentials data illustrate impairment in information-processing capabilities associated with reduced arousal elicited by experimental sleep fragmentation. This subtle degree of sleep disruption, where total sleep time is not reduced, leads to sustained impairment in alertness and attention.

Cortisol administration to healthy subjects impairs episodic memory, though how this is mediated is unknown. Objectives: To examine the effects of I week's administration of cortisol on the neural correlates of episodic memory in healthy subjects. Methods: Fourteen healthy men were treated with oral cortisol (hydrocortisone 20 mg) or placebo twice daily for I week, in a double blind, crossover fashion. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a well-validated source memory task. Subjects listened to words spoken in a male or female voice. At test, old and new words were presented visually; subjects judged whether words were old or new, and if old, the gender of the voice at study. Results: Response times were significantly speeded by cortisol. A significant reduction in recognition accuracy with cortisol was found for the second study occasion. ERP recordings with placebo showed greater positivity over left parietal and right frontal scalp areas for ERPs to items given correct source judgements versus correctly rejected new items. In comparison, cortisol increased ERP voltage between 500 and 1400 ms post-stimulus and this effect interacted with item type and electrode site, being diffusely distributed for correct rejections but of a lesser magnitude frontally for old items accorded a correct source judgement. Conclusions: Repeated cortisol administration leads to a qualitative change in the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in healthy subjects. This change may contribute to cognitive impairments seen in illnesses characterised by hypercortisolaemia.

In addition to P300 latencies, amplitudes and topographies, three-dimensional current density distribution utilizing low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was computed. P300 latency was delayed and P300 amplitude was reduced in both AAMI and older subjects. Topographically this amplitude reduction was most pronounced frontally. LORETA revealed medial (frontal and parietal) and lateral (dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal, middle/superior temporal, posterior superior temporal/inferior parietal) sources. Significant reductions in LORETA source strength in normal aging and in AAMI were found mainly medially frontally, right dorsolaterally prefrontally and right inferiorly parietally. Since these anatomically highly interconnected brain regions in the right hemisphere are part of a network associated with sustained attention, the results speak for a decline in attentional resource capacity in AAMI patients and elderly subjects.

C	Luo, A; Gerson, A; Sajda, P			IEEE	Luo, A; Gerson, A; Sajda, P			Comparison of supervised and unsupervised linear methods for recovering task-relevant activity in EEG	2004 2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING: MACRO TO NANO, VOLS 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	APR 15-18, 2004	Arlington, VA	IEEE			INTEGRATION	In this paper we compare three linear methods, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [1], Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) [2], and Linear Discrimination (LD) [3] for recovering task relevant neural activity from high spatial density electroencephalography (EEG). Each linear method uses a different objective function to recover underlying source components by exploiting statistical structure across a large number of sensors. We test these methods using a dual-task event-related paradigm. While engaged in a primary task, subjects must detect infrequent changes in the visual display, which would be expected to evoke several well-known event-related potentials (ERPs), including the N2 and P3 [4]. We find that though each method utilizes a different objective function, they in fact yield similar components. We note that one advantage of the LD approach is that the recovered component is easily interpretable, namely it represents the component within a given time window which is most discriminating for the task, given a spatial integration of the sensors. Both ICA and CSP return multiple components, of which the most discriminating component may not be the first. Thus, for these methods, visual inspection or additional processing is required to determine the significance of these components for the task.

A new method was used to examine averaged event-related potentials in different frequency bands by calculating correlation coefficients between wavelet curves in distant cortical areas. This method was applied to previous event-related potentials recordings which found successive activation of frontal and left posterior areas [1]. Correlated activity at 17 Hz was observed between frontal and left temporal (Wernicke's) areas prior to full activation of Wernicke's area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, no studies have assessed this possibility. The present study assessed the effects of nicotine patch versus placebo patch on brain event-related potential (ERP) responses to emotion-inducing negative, positive, and neutral color pictures in 16 smokers in a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subjects design. The study included four experimental sessions. After overnight smoking deprivation (12 hr or more), active nicotine patches were applied to participants during one of the first two sessions and during one of the last two sessions. Placebo patches were applied during the other two sessions. Nicotine reduced frontal ERP processing voltage negativity (from 144-488 ms poststimulus onset) evoked by viewing emotionally negative pictures to a greater extent than it did when emotionally neutral pictures were viewed, whereas it had no effect on processing negativity evoked by positive pictures. Nicotine also enhanced P390 amplitudes evoked by emotionally negative pictures more than it did when emotionally neutral and positive pictures were viewed. Across picture types, nicotine (relative to placebo) reduced N300 amplitude (more at anterior and dorsal sites) and increased P390 amplitude. Overall, nicotine influenced ERPs to emotionally neutral and positive pictures less than it did to negative pictures.

The following hypotheses were tested and could be confirmed: (i) theta and alpha show a significant increase in phase locking during the time window of the P1 and N1 as compared to a prestimulus reference, (ii) the dynamics of event-related changes in evoked theta and alpha power obey the same principles as are known from event-related de-/synchronization research, and (iii) latency measures of the P1-N1 complex are negatively correlated with individual alpha frequency. In addition, we have found that theta phase locking is larger during encoding than recognition and that good memory performers show a larger increase in theta and alpha phase locking during recognition in the time window of the N1. Our general conclusion is that the P1-N1 complex is generated primarily by evoked alpha and theta oscillations reflecting the synchronous activation of a working- and semantic memory system.

At present, however, the use of BCIs is severely limited by low bit-transfer rates. We systematically analyze and develop two recent concepts, both capable of enhancing the information gain from multichannel scalp EEG recordings: 1) the combination of classifiers, each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena, e.g., slow cortical potential shifts, such as the premovement Bereitschaftspotential or differences in spatio-spectral distributions of brain activity (i.e., focal event-related desynchronizations) and 2) behavioral paradigms inducing the subjects to generate one out of several brain states (multiclass approach) which all bare a distinctive spatio-temporal signature well discriminable in the standard scalp EEG. We derive information-theoretic predictions and demonstrate their relevance in experimental data. We will show that a suitably arranged interaction between these concepts can significantly boost BCI performances.

Although ethanol and allopregnanolone have similar behavioral effects, their macro-electrophysiological profiles have not been directly compared. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of allopregnanolone and ethanol on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods: Male Wistar rats were implanted with cortical and amygdalar electrodes. The rats were then administered allopregnanolone (0.0-10 mg/kg), ethanol (0.0-1.0 g/kg), or a combination of the two before recording. Results: Allopregnanolone and ethanol had similar effects on ERPs. When administered alone, both decreased cortical P1-N1 ERP amplitude by 25-50% and N1 amplitude in the amygdala by 75-80%. Combined administration of ethanol (0.50 g/kg) and allopregnanolone (5.0 mg/kg), doses which were ineffective alone, decreased N1 amplitude in the amygdala by 60%. Allopregnanolone and ethanol had dissimilar EEC effects. Allopregnanolone increased high frequency power in the cortex and amygdala by 35-30%. Ethanol decreased cortical and amygdalar power in the same high frequency bands by 25-45%. Allopregnanolone, but not ethanol, also shifted cortical frequency in the 32- to 50-Hz band. Combined administration of allopregnanolone and ethanol had no effect on EEG power but enhanced allopregnanolone's effect on cortical frequency. Conclusions: These data suggest that allopregnanolone's macro-electrophysiological profile resembles barbiturates and benzodiazepines more than ethanol. Further, the interactions of allopregnanolone and ethanol appear complex, with multiple effects observed (enhancement or reversal) depending on the neurophysiological variable assessed.

Tomographic and neuropsychological evidence of brain compromise has been included recently. In order to evaluate the neurophysiological counterpart of cerebral involvement, we stud led P300 evoked potential and quantified EEG (qEEG) of 35 patients (26-55 years), and compared to an equal number of control subjects (29-55 years). We have found increased P300 latency compared to the control group (331.24 +/- 24.02 vs 318.86 +/- 23.18) (p = 0.01716). qEEG showed lower relative Beta 1 power in the patients group (p = 1.6E-5), and the principal frequency 1 Hz slower in the same group (p = 0.1077). Multivariate analysis showed three subpopulations: a normal one, pathological one with higher Alpha power and pathological with Alpha decrement and Delta-Theta increment. Pathological findings represented 20% for the qEEG and 11.43% for cognitive potentials. Cardiac and neurologic involvement were not correlated. We conclude that there is clear electrophysiological evidence of cerebral involvement in chronic Chagas disease, thus reinforcing findings obtained by other methods.

The present investigation examined the effects of two tasks to determine whether one task would be more sensitive to a history of depression. We examined 124 female subjects, aged 14-20 years. Each subject was assigned to either a history of depression (DEP-Hx) or control group based on the presence versus absence of a DSM-III-R Major Depressive Episode. ERPs were recorded during two auditory oddball tasks. The first task was a simple two-pitch auditory discrimination and the second task was a three-stimulus auditory discrimination. In both tasks, subjects responded to the same rare target tone. Analysis of P300 amplitudes indicated a significant group by task interaction. Simple effects indicated that control subjects exhibited smaller target P300 amplitudes during the three-stimulus task as compared to the two-stimulus task. In contrast, subjects with a history of depression did not show a significant difference in P300 target amplitude between the two tasks. These results suggest that depression history as well as task difficulty/modality may influence the utility of the P300 in documenting the neurophysiological aspects of depression.

EEG was recorded at 17 sites from AD/HD predominantly inattentive type (n = 50) and AD/HD combined type (n = 50) subjects aged from 8 to 17 years 11 months. ERP components were quantified at each site. Results revealed topographic differences from controls (n = 50) that were common to both subtypes (e.g. target and standard P2 amplitude, and standard P2 latency) or unique to a particular subtype of AD/HD (Inattentive type: target N1, N2, P3b and standard N2 amplitude, target P2 latency; Combined type: target N1, P2, N2 and P3b amplitude, target N2 and standard NI latency). These group differences showed different age effects. The across-region results revealed differing patterns of abnormal component development for each subtype, indicating a qualitative difference in information processing stage deficits in each of these AD/HD subtypes.

Neural correlates of attention can be studied in millisecond resolution with magnetoencephalography(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), which provide complementary views on attentional processing. During "selective attention", a processing negativity (PN) overlaps EEG response to the attended tones. This component can he modulated with drugs affecting dopamine transmission in the brain, such as haloperidol and droperidol, whereas no effects seem to be caused by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), decreasing serotonin synthesis in the brain. Distinct responses are associated with "involuntary attention". Responses reflecting sound-change detection and initiation of involuntary attention, the mismatch negativity and its magnetic counterpart, appear to be modulated by ATD, but not with haloperidol. Subsequent P3a elicited by actual attention shifting, as well as reorienting negativity reflecting orienting back to a relevant task, are in turn decreased by haloperidol, but not affected by ATD or other serotonin modulators. Serotonin may affect the earliest "preattentive" phases on auditory processing, indexed by mid-latency magnetic responses and Nlm, but haloperidol's effects on these parameters are insignificant. Taken together, serotonin and dopamine may have differential effects on attentional processing depending on time after stimulus presentation. (C) 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

It is a current debate in cognitive neuroscience if an error-detection neural system is involved in behavioral control and adaptation. Such a system should generate error-specific signals, but their existence is questioned by observations that correct and incorrect reactions may elicit similar neuroelectric potentials. A new approach based on a time-frequency decomposition of event-related brain potentials was applied to extract covert sub-components from the classical error-related negativity (Ne) and correct-response-related negativity (Nc) in humans. A unique error-specific sub-component from the delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) frequency band was revealed only for Ne, which was associated with error detection at the level of overall performance monitoring. A sub-component from the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) was associated with motor response execution, but this sub-component also differentiated error from correct reactions indicating error detection at the level of movement monitoring. It is demonstrated that error-specific signals do exist in the brain. More importantly, error detection may occur in multiple functional systems operating in parallel at different levels of behavioral control. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

If all channels are required to be artifact free, the number of acceptable trials may be unacceptably low. Precise artifact screening is necessary for accurate spatial mapping, for current density measures, for source analysis, and for accurate temporal analysis based on single-trial methods. Precise screening presents a number of problems given the large datasets. We propose a procedure for statistical correction of artifacts in dense array studies (SCADS), which (1) detects individual channel artifacts using the recording reference, (2) detects global artifacts using the average reference, (3) replaces artifact-contaminated sensors with spherical interpolation statistically weighted on the basis of all sensors, and (4) computes the variance of the signal across trials to document the stability of the averaged waveform. Examples from 128-channel recordings and from numerical simulations illustrate the importance of careful artifact review in the avoidance of analysis errors.

In case artifacts are present in the raw EEG measurement, pre-processing is required to prevent the averaged ERP waveform being interfered by artifacts. The simplest pre-processing approach is by rejecting trials in which presence of artifact is detected. Alternatively artifact correction instead of rejection can be performed by blind source separation, so that waste of ERP trials is avoided. In this paper, we propose a second order statistics based blind source separation approach to ERP artifact correction. Comparing with blind separation using independent component analysis, second order statistics based method does not rely on higher order statistics or signal entropy, and therefore leads to more robust separation even if only short epochs are available.

Knowing the spatiotemporal dynamics of this network would provide further understanding of the neural bases of the encoding process. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with EEG and fMRI techniques to study this network in a task, in which participants had to judge the symmetry in position of two dots, presented either simultaneously ("immediate comparison") or successively ("memorization" of a first dot and "delayed comparison", after 3 s, with a second dot). With EEG, larger amplitude was observed in the parietocentral P3b component (350-500 ms) in the immediate and "delayed comparisons" than in "memorization" condition, where topography at this time was more anterior and right lateralized. MEG provided a more accurate localization and temporal variations of sources, revealing a strong M4 component at 450 ms in the "memorization" condition, with two sources localized in parietal and right premotor regions. These localizations are consistent with both fMRI foci and EEG cortical current source densities (CSD), but only MEG revealed the strong increase in premotor region at 450 ins related to "memorization". These combined results suggest that EEG P3B and MEG M4 components reflect two different dynamics in parietofrontal networks: the parietocentral P3b indexes a decision mechanism during the immediate and "delayed comparisons", whereas the MEG M4 component, with a larger right premotor source, reflects the encoding process in visuospatial short-term memory.

Methods: Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to checkerboards were recorded in 7 right-handed subjects, while single-pulse TMS was applied to the occipital pole either at visual stimulus onset, during the build-up or at the expected peak of the early VEP component P1 (VIS&TMS). Timing of TMS was individually adjusted based on each subject's VEP-latency. A condition of TMS without concurrent visual stimulation (TMSalone) served for subtraction purposes (VIS&TMS minus TMSalone) to partial out TMS-related contaminations of the EEG signal. Results: When TMS was applied at visual stimulus onset, VEPs (as calculated by subtraction) perfectly matched control VEPs to visual stimulation alone. TMS at around P1, in contrast, modified the targeted (P1) and the subsequent VEP component (N1), independently of whether TMS was given at build-up or peak. Conclusions: The retrieval of regular VEPs with concomitant TMS at visual stimulus onset suggests that the employed EEG system and subtraction procedure are suited for combined EEG-TMS studies. The VEP changes following TMS at around P1 provide direct clues on the temporal dynamics of TMS pulse effects on functional activity in the human brain. Our data suggest effects of relatively long duration (similar to 100 ms) when TMS is applied while functional neuronal activity evolves. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants (n = 32) underwent two EEG recordings while they watched silent films and ignored auditory stimuli. Stimuli were a standard (probability = 85%) and two deviant (probability = 7.5% each for high [HD] and low [LD]) eight-tone sequences that differed in the frequency of one tone. Between recordings, subjects practiced discriminating the HD or LD from the standard for 6 min. The amplitude of the LD MMN increased significantly across recordings in both groups, whereas the amplitude of the HD MMN did not. The LD was easier to discriminate than was the HD. Thus, practicing either discrimination increased the MMN for the easier discrimination. Learning and changes in the LD MMN amplitude were highly correlated. Source localizations of event-related potentials (ERPs) to all stimuli revealed bilateral sources in superior temporal regions. Compared with the standard ERP, the LD ERP revealed a stronger source in the left superior temporal region in both recordings, whereas the right-sided source became stronger after learning. Consistent with prior studies of auditory plasticity in animals and humans, tone sequence learning induced rapid neurophysiological plasticity in the human central auditory system. The results also suggest that there is asymmetric hemispheric involvement in tone sequence discrimination learning and that discrimination difficulty influences the time course of learning-related neurophysiological changes.

Active and passive hand movements were investigated as control conditions. Significant EEG changes with respect to a pre-movement period were analyzed by calculating time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS) for 32 EEG channels recorded from sensorimotor and premotor areas. Immediately after the beginning of the FES movement, a prominent ERD was found, followed by a beta ERS similar to that observed after active or passive wrist movements. Both changes were maximal over the contralateral primary hand area. The main difference between active and stimulation-induced movements was that in the latter case no ERD was detectable prior to movement-onset. These findings suggest that the sensorimotor processing during FES involves some of the processes which are also involved in voluntary hand movements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

An efficient method, which compromises between the signal quality after the ocular artifact correction and the computation load, is developed. The method can be applied for the artifact correction of the data containing both DC and AC components, and thus, is convenient for the analysis of electrophysiological signals such as P300, event related synchronisation /desynchronisation, contingent negative variation (CNV) and other slow potentials. A modification of the method can be utilized for online applications such as brain computer interface (BCI).

Twenty-one healthy volunteers received 4 doses (within 24 h) of a fixed combination of cinnarizine 20 mg and dimenhydrinate 40 mg (Arlevert, ARL), dimenhydrinate 50 mg, or a placebo, in randomized order at 1-week intervals. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), reaction time (RT) and psychometric tests were assessed before as well as 60 and 150 minutes after the intake of the 1st (Day 1) and the 4th (Day 2) dose of study medication. The evaluation was primarily based on the difference in the outcomes measured 150 min after the 4th dose 05) and those before the start of medication intake (to). None of the medications affected the latency and amplitude of the sensory ERP component N100, neither under passive listening nor under discrimination task conditions. The latency of P300 in response to the rare target tones (oddball paradigm and binary series), showed significant (p < 0.05) delays after 4 doses of dimenhydrinate (18 - 24 ins), and no significant differences between ARL (3 - 17 ms) and either dimenhydrinate or placebo (4 - 13 ms). Responses to nontarget tones remained almost unaffected after medication intake. The secondary analysis of the P300 amplitude showed the greatest decreases under DH in both active series, with no significant differences between ARL and either DH or placebo. The 3 medications did not significantly prolong RT nor did they impair the performance of psychometric tests, or cause significant shifts of current mood. The combination preparation ARL showed the lowest rate of adverse events (n = 1), followed by dimenhydrinate (n = 3) and placebo (n = 6). Two subjects withdrew because of adverse events, both after the intake of placebo. In conclusion, the results gave no evidence for an impairment of central information processing and psychomotor performance after multiple dosing with the fixed combination ARL in healthy volunteers, which might, when present, represent an adverse reaction limiting its use in antivertiginous therapy. No significant differences were found between ARL and placebo.

Since the peak of the grand averaged P300 waveform is not clear, it is sometimes difficult to detect the amplitude and the latency. The removal of the noisy EEG waveform based on the cross correlation between the grand average waveform and each waveform was found to be effective for making the waveform clear. The parameter extraction methods using a principal component analysis or temporal changes of cross correlation between the grand average and each waveform were used to evaluate mental fatigue. As a result, P300b component and the standard deviation of the time lag that corresponded to the maximum cross correlation between the grand averaged waveform and each waveform were found to reflect some aspects of mental fatigue(the decrease of the cognitive information processing function).

Methods: Tones were presented to 8 subjects at 10 different tempos from 150 to 3125 ms and with random intervals. We quantified time-frequency (TF) power with respect to a pre-tone-onset baseline and the TF phase coherence across trials. Peak-to-peak event-related potential (ERP) amplitude values for the middle and long-latency auditory responses were obtained for comparison. Results: ERP amplitude, size of power modulation, and amount of phase coherence were larger at slower tempos for the long-latency response (LLR) but not for the middle-latency response (MLR). Multiple regression analysis indicated that for MLR and LLR, phase modulation was a better predictor of ERP amplitude than power modulation. Conclusions: Phase modulation is a better predictor of ERP amplitude than power modulation for middle and long-latency auditory responses. Significance: Lack of diminution of the MLR at fast tempos indicates its usefulness for studying early cortical processing of music and speech patterns.

Specifically, the proposal was assessed that enhancement of the low beta components sensorimotor rhythm (SMR: 12-15 Hz) and beta] (15-18 Hz) affect different aspects of attentional processing. Methods: Subjects (n = 25) were randomly allocated to training with either an SMR or betal protocol, or to a non-neurofeedback control group. Subjects were assessed prior and subsequent to the training process on two tests of sustained attention. The neurofeedback participants were also assessed on target P300 event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in a traditional auditory oddball paradigm. Results: Protocol-specific effects were obtained in that SNIR training was associated with increased perceptual sensitivity 'd prime' (d'), and reduced omission errors and reaction time variability. Beta1 training was associated with faster reaction times and increased target P300 amplitudes, whereas no changes were evident in the control group. Conclusions: Neurofeedback training of SMR and betal band components led to significant and protocol-specific effects in healthy subjects. The data can be interpreted as indicating a general attention-enhancing effect of SMR training, and an arousal-enhancing effect of betal training.

Our previous results have shown that enhanced alpha responses to auditory task stimuli can be well synchronized with stimulus until 800-1000 ms. The present study analyzed the effect of perceptual uncertainty and difficulty in decision making on event-related alpha oscillations in single auditory event-related brain potentials (ERPs). EEG was recorded from Fz, Ct and Pt electrodes in 10 subjects participating in two experimental sessions, in which auditory stimuli with equal physical parameters were presented under passive and task instructions. Separate measurements of single alpha response amplitude and phase-locking were performed and statistically analyzed for consecutive time windows in the post-stimulus epoch. Major results show that, during the cognitive task, the phase-locking of alpha oscillations at the frontal site is significantly increased in the time window of 500-1000 ms after stimulation. Thus, the involvement of enhanced and synchronized frontal alpha activity in higher brain processes is strongly emphasized. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We studied 13 healthy volunteers for the main experiment and 7 for the control experiment. The pain-related evoked cerebral potentials (PREP) at Cz and magnetic cortical fields (PRCF) on both hemispheres following painful electrical finger stimulation were simultaneously recorded before and after TENS on the right forearm of the median nerve territory at 50 Hz for 30 min. PREP and PRCF were similarly recorded without TENS in the control experiment. Results: The PREP components, N150 and P220, were significantly attenuated after TENS, compared to those before TENS (P < 0.01, two-way repeated ANOVA). However, there was no consistent change of the PRCF components. Eleven of 13 subjects reported no change of pain sensation after TENS. There was no change of PREP in control experiment without TENS. Conclusions: The results indicated that TENS reduced PREP following painful electrical stimulation, and that the origin of PREP was, at least partially, different from that of PRCF which was not changed after TENS. An after-effect of TENS significantly affected the generation process of PREP, but it was not enough to relieve the subjective painful feeling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

These oscillators are active usually in a random way. However, by application of sensory stimulation these generators are coupled and act together in a coherent way. This synchronization and enhancement of EEG activity gives rise to 'evoked' or 'event-related oscillations'. The compound evoked potential manifests as superimposition of evoked rhythms in the EEG frequencies ranging from delta tio gamma ('natural frequencies of the brain'). The superimposition principle is described with efficient strategies and by utilization of an efficient algorithm. The wavelet analysis confirms the results of the combined analysis procedure obtained by using the amplitude frequency characteristics (AFCs) and digital filtering. The AFC and adapted digital filtering methods are based on the first approach to analyze average evoked potentials. In contrast, the wavelet analysis is based on signal retrieval and selection among a large number of sweeps recorded in a given physiological or psychological experiment. By combining all these results and concepts, it can be stated that the wavelet analysis underlines and extends the expression that alpha-, theta-, delta-, and gamma-responses described In this report are the most important brain responses related to psychophysiological functions. The wavelet analysis confirms once more the expression 'real signals' which we attribute to EEG frequency responses of the brain. It will be demonstrated that the delta, theta, and alpha responses (i.e. the rhythms 'predicted' by digital filtering) are real brain oscillations. The frequency components of the event-related potential vary independently of each other with respect to: (a) their relation to the event; (b) their topographic distribution; and (c) with the mode of the physiological measurements.

First method relies on the single channel data. Second method is extension to multi channel case. It takes the spatial correlation of the channels in to account in the estimation. Methods are compared using simulated data. Simulations are based on combination of real measured background EEG and simulated scalp potentials caused by two time-varying dipoles. Both methods are shown to be quite robust to non optimal selection of the regularization parameter. It Is also shown that the ability of the multi channel method to preserve amplitude differences between channels is not due to selection of the regularization parameter.

J	Rearick, MP; Johnston, JA; Slobounov, SM				Rearick, MP; Johnston, JA; Slobounov, SM			Feedback-dependent modulation of isometric force control: an EEG study in visuomotor integration	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; control-signal gain; visuomotor integration; grasping; force production	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; ARM MOVEMENTS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; VISUAL FEEDBACK; PRECISION GRIP; MOTOR AREAS; ADAPTATION; TASK	The primary purpose of this investigation was to examine the cortical mechanisms underlying visuomotor integration in an experiment directly manipulating visual feedback (control-signal gain) as participants executed a grasping task. This was accomplished by assessing human electroencephalograms in both time and frequency domains and relating these measures to the performance accuracy of isometric force control. The basic experimental manipulation consisted of subjects controlling a grip dynamometer and the subsequent force trace displayed on a computer monitor at various magnitudes of force output and control-signal gain. Several findings from this study were of interest. First, the effects of control-signal gain and its interplay with the magnitude of force were most evident across the parietal and frontocentral electrode locations - areas specifically related to multi-modal sensory evaluation (parietal lobe) and higher-order movement control (supplementary and mesial premotor areas). Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measures in the time domain, i.e., slow-wave potentials, were sensitive to control-signal gain only during the ramp phase of force production (period of reaching the target force), not the static phase (period of maintaining the target force level). Third, EEG measures within the frequency domain (event-related desynchronization), unlike the slow-wave potential measures, were sensitive to control-signal gain during the static phase of force production - a sensitivity that was directly related to improvements in the accuracy of isometric force control. The findings of this investigation are described in relation to the existent literature on human visuomotor integration with special attention paid to the distinct spatial and temporal electrocortical patterns exhibited under varying degrees of visual feedback and magnitudes of force output during grasping.

Five simulation studies were carried to select a sensitive test for comparing two independent groups of ERPs. Methods: Simulated signal and noise waveforms were generated using different combinations of parameters: cases or replications per group, correlation between data points, number of points, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), etc. The false alarm (FA) rate of each method was assessed and their sensitivity compared over sets of 2000 simulated experiments per condition. Results: Study 1 identified the 'Projection onto Centroids Difference Vectors' (PCDV) method of Haig and Gordon (Brain Topogr 1995;8:67) as very good, but its FA rate was erratic under several conditions. The following studies served to shape the implementation parameters of a version of PCDV, termed PCDVp, that assesses significance through random permutations of the case labels. The final form is very sensitive. For instance, with two groups of 48 trials of 30-point EEG-like waveforms, its power for alpha = 0.05 is about 50% at S/N 1.0 and 90% at S/N 1.5 (amplitude). Conclusion: PCDVp requires no a priori knowledge and is sensitive to detect differences between independent sets of waveforms, topographies or spatio-temporal data.

For that purpose, the ERPs in a rare primer (= target) and a frequent distractor condition (= nontarget) of a visually presented Continuous Performance Test (CPT) were analyzed in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n(1) = 49, n(2) = 38). At about 420 ms significantly higher global field power values (GFP) were observed in the target condition as compared to the nontarget condition. For both samples the LORETA source localization revealed significantly higher activation for the target-condition as compared to the nontarget condition in the anterior cingulum, the precuneus and superior-posterior parietal cortex (parietal lobe), the insula, and the fusiform gyrus (temporal lobe). Only in the second sample were widespread areas in the frontal cortex also activated. The results indicate that LORETA localizes widespread cortical areas involved in target processing similar to results of fMRI studies.

Here, we investigate a candidate event-related brain potential representing visuospatial attentional activity in motor areas of the cortex. The investigation aimed to elucidate the neural origin and the functional characteristics of this brain potential, which has been labelled N2cc and is typically observed in spatial stimulus-response compatibility tasks. High-density EEG was recorded in 10 subjects while they performed a Simon-type spatial stimulus-response compatibility task and a control task where the same stimuli were assigned to Go-Nogo response alternatives. The N2cc showed a time course parallel to the posteriorly distributed N2pc, associated with visuospatial selection. Scalp distribution and current source density reconstructions allowed a spatial separation of N2pc and centrally distributed N2cc and were compatible with a source for the N2cc in the lateral premotor cortex. Comparisons across tasks demonstrated that the N2cc depends on bilateral response readiness, ruling out an exclusively attentional interpretation. Instead, the activity appears associated with visuospatial attentional processes that serve the selection and suppression of competing responses, in accord with a function of the dorsal premotor cortex in response selection. Together, the results consolidate the N2cc as a new ERP component relevant to the investigation of visuospatial motor processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shtyrov, Y; Hauk, O; Pulvermuller, F				Shtyrov, Y; Hauk, O; Pulvermuller, F			Distributed neuronal networks for encoding category-specific semantic information: the mismatch negativity to action words	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain; event-related potential (ERP); human; language; memory trace	HUMAN BRAIN; MEMORY TRACES; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; SPEECH; POTENTIALS; MOTOR; INTEGRATION	Mismatch negativity (MMN), an index of experience-dependent memory traces, was used to investigate the processing of action-related words in the human brain. Responses to auditorily presented movement-related English words were recorded in a non-attend odd-ball protocol using a high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) set-up. MMN was calculated using responses to the same words presented as standard and deviant stimuli in different sessions to avoid contamination from phonetic-acoustic differences. The topography of the mismatch negativity to action words revealed an unusual centro-posterior distribution of the responses, suggesting that activity was at least in part generated posterior to usually observed frontal MMNs. Moreover, responses to hand-related word stimulus (pick) had a more widespread lateral distribution, whereas leg-related stimulus (kick) elicited a more focal dorsal negativity. These differences, remarkably reminiscent of sensorimotor cortex topography, were further assessed using distributed source analysis of the EEG signal (L2 minimum-norm current estimates). The source analysis also confirmed differentially distributed activation for the two stimuli. We suggest that these results indicate activation of distributed neuronal assemblies that function as category-specific memory traces for words and may involve sensorimotor cortical structures for encoding action words.

Both the double-blind and the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone odd-ball paradigm in 49 patients aged between 46 and 67 yr with the diagnosis of insomnia (G 47.0) related to postmenopausal syndrome (N 95.1). Climodien reduced standard N1 and target P300 latencies as compared to placebo, while EV did not affect N1 latency but similarly reduced P300 latency. Climodien increased N1, P2 and P300 amplitudes dose-dependently, predominantly at frontal leads. Estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP amplitudes. The shortening of standard N1 latency and enhancement of N1 and P2 amplitudes indicates a positive effect of Climodien on perceptual processing, most likely due to vigilance improvements also observed in EEG mapping. Concerning target P300, it seems that estradiol is responsible for the improvement in stimulus evaluation time, as reflected by the shortening of the peak latency, while dienogest seems to account for the improvement in cognitive information processing capacity, whereby 3 mg induced a more pronounced augmentation of P300 amplitudes than 2 mg. Based on the spatial distribution of this increase, it can be speculated that Climodien mainly affects the more frontally distributed P3a subcomponent, which is associated with attention and orientation. Furthermore, the observed changes in ERP-components are consistent with recent studies showing significant positive effects of hormone replacement therapy on cholinergic functions. Thus, Climodien seems to be of interest in preventing cognitive decline and treating cognitive disorders in postmenopausal women. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects of estrogen in dementia. Our present findings suggest that the estrogen effects may be augmented by dienogest.

Methods: High-resolution EEG was obtained in young adults during two delayed choice reaction time tasks. In the STM condition, a simple cue stimulus (one bit) was memorized along a brief delay period (3.5-5.5 s). The task was visuo-spatial in nature. Results: In the control (NSTM) condition, the cue stimulus remained available along the delay period. Compared to the control condition, the theta power (4-6 Hz) decreased in left frontal and bilateral parietal areas (delay period). Furthermore, low alpha power (6-8 Hz) decreased in bilateral frontal and left parietal areas, while high alpha power (10-12 Hz) decreased in the left fronto-parietal areas. Conclusions: The decrease of the alpha power is as an expression of the efficient information transfer within thalamo-cortical pathways. The significance of the study stands in the fact that even a very simple STM task (only one bit to be memorized) revealed changes in frontoparietal theta and alpha rhythms.

We demonstrate that OT can be used to simultaneously detect and characterize the hemodynamic responses associated with an "oddball" auditory stimulus and that corresponding electrical event related potentials can be acquired simultaneously using conventional scalp recordings. In addition to the measured electrical response, the hemodynamic localization is consistent with fMRI studies, which show significant activation in the temporal and parietal cortical regions. The event-related response of total hemoglobin showed relatively slow peak latencies (5.8 +/- 0.3 s), which were also consistent with fMRI. The current study shows the regions of peak hemodynamic activity that are in closest proximity to areas of peak electrical activity. This is the first demonstration of simultaneous ERP electrical recording and non-invasive optical mapping in human subjects, which promises to be an important tool in the characterization of both normal and abnormal brain function.

It is still unclear whether this difference occurs within the preparation period or the execution period of the movement, or both. In the present study, EEG was used to investigate separately the preparation and the execution periods of overt and covert movements in adults. We designed a paradigm that randomly mixed actual and kinaesthetic imagined trials of an externally paced sequence of finger key presses. Sixty channel event-related potentials were recorded to capture the cerebral activations underlying the preparation for motor execution and motor imagery, as well as cerebral activations implied in motor execution and motor imagery. Classical waveform analysis was combined with data-driven spatiotemporal segmentation analysis. In addition, a LAURA source localization algorithm was applied to functionally define brain related motor areas. Our results showed first that the difference between actual and mental motor acts takes place at the late stage of the preparation period and consists of a quantitative modulation of the activity of common structures in M1. Second, they showed that primary motor structures are involved to the same extent in the actual or imagined execution of a motor act. These findings reinforce and refine the functional equivalence hypothesis between actual and imagined motor acts.

It is meaningful in research and clinical practice involving alcohol dependence to explore ways of measuring alcohol craving. The aim of this study was to measure the P3 event-related potentials induced by alcohol-related pictures in patients with alcohol dependence; these potentials are considered to constitute a neuronal correlate of alcohol craving. Methods: On the basis of our previous study, six alcohol-related pictures and six neutral pictures were chosen as the visual stimuli. Each set of stimuli consisted of alcohol-related or neutral pictures as the target stimuli and same-sized checkerboards as the nontarget stimuli. The stimuli were presented by using the oddball paradigm for 300 msec, with an interstimulus interval of 1000 msec, in 12 controls and 16 abstinent patients with alcohol dependence. Each electroencephalography session consisted of three blocks: a practice block, a neutral block, and an alcohol-craving block. Results: The amplitudes of P3 elicited by the alcohol-related pictures were significantly larger than those elicited by the neutral pictures in the patients with alcohol dependence, whereas there was no significant difference according to the stimuli in the P3 amplitudes of controls. Repeated-measures ANOVA on the amplitudes of P3 revealed that there was a significant interaction effect of block by subject group. Conclusions: These results suggest that event-related potentials can be used as a neuronal correlate of alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent patients. Future investigations will be needed to assess the frequency of relapse in the patients included in this study, to elucidate the meaning of the observed results with regard to the therapeutic outcomes.

The tactile skin stimulation device consisted of a dot matrix printer head. Each stimulus lasted 10 msec with an interstimulus interval of 4 seconds. Tactile stimulation induced beta oscillations, which were largest in the 16 to 20-Hz band, with a maximum centered within 1 second after stimulation. These beta oscillations were found over both hemispheres with a clear dominance over the contralateral hand representation area.

J	Foffani, G; Bianchi, AM; Priori, A; Baselli, G				Foffani, Guglielmo; Bianchi, Anna M.; Priori, Alberto; Baselli, Giuseppe			Adaptive autoregressive identification with spectral power decomposition for studying movement-related activity in scalp EEG signals and basal ganglia local field potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								We propose a method that combines adaptive autoregressive (AAR) identification and spectral power decomposition for the study of movement-related spectral changes in scalp EEG signals and basal ganglia local field potentials (LFPs). This approach introduces the concept of movement-related poles, allowing one to study not only the classical event-related desynchronizations (ERD) and synchronizations (ERS), which correspond to modulations of power, but also event-related modulations of frequency. We applied the method to analyze movement-related EEG signals and LFPs contemporarily recorded from the sensorimotor cortex, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a patient with Parkinson's disease who underwent stereotactic neurosurgery for the implant of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. In the AAR identification we compared the whale and the exponential forgetting factors, showing that the whale forgetting provides a better disturbance rejection and it is therefore more suitable to investigate movement-related brain activity. Movement-related power modulations were consistent with previous studies. In addition, movement-related frequency modulations were observed from both scalp EEG signals and basal ganglia LFPs. The method therefore represents an effective approach to the study of movement-related brain activity.

In recent years, ultrafast activities between 100 and 1000/sec have been the topic of various studies with regard to physiological and paroxysmal conditions. Personal work on ultrafast frequencies in deep structures (elicited with pentylenetetrazol in rats) is mentioned in passing and will be the object of a special study. Other work focusing on the sensorimotor cortex and thalamocortical connections has proved to be seminal for ultrafast EEG research in conjunction with evoked responses (N20 response, SSEP) and experimental neurophysiological studies of afferent volleys, including those causing paroxysmal cortical responses. The well known decremental seizures with initially flat tracings require clarification with ultrafast recordings. In the physiological-neurocognitive domain, Pfurtscheller's event-related desynchronization might also benefit from the use of ultrafast recording. A plea for additional ultraslow recording (DC recording) is also being made, since paroxysmal flattening (electrodecrement) may be associated with an ultraslow negative baseline deflection. The combination of ultrafast (facilitated by digital technique) and ultraslow (technically difficult in patients, easier in experimental animals) would finally denote the frequency-wise complete EEG.

Although originally described in the visual system, corollary discharge may exist in the auditory system, whereby signals from motor speech commands prepare auditory cortex for self-generated speech. While associated with sensorimotor systems, it might also apply to inner speech or thought, regarded as our most complex motor act. We had four aims in the studies summarized in this paper: (1) to demonstrate the corollary discharge phenomenon during talking and inner speech in human volunteers using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), (2) to demonstrate that the corollary discharge is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, (3) to demonstrate the role of frontal speech areas in the corollary discharge during talking, and (4) to relate the dysfunction of the corollary discharge in schizophrenia to auditory hallucinations. Using EEG and ERP measures, we addressed each aim in patients with schizophrenia (DSM IV) and healthy control subjects. The NI component of the ERP reflected dampening of auditory cortex responsivity during talking and inner speech in control subjects but not in patients. EEG measures of coherence indicated inter-dependence of activity in the frontal speech production and temporal speech reception areas during talking in control subjects, but not in patients, especially those who hallucinated. These data suggest that a corollary discharge from frontal areas where thoughts are generated fails to alert auditory cortex that they are self-generated, leading to the misattribution of inner speech to external sources and producing the experience of auditory hallucinations.

The P3 is considered as endogenous information processing component independent from modality. Purpose The aim of this investigation was to study whether the P3 latency elicited by auditory and visual stimuli under different attentional states is influenced by the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Methods The event related P3 component of 10 right handed patients (7 m/3 f, mean age 31.3 years (SD 7.3), median 31.5, range 20-47) with unilateral mTLE were studied and compared with 10 age matched controls (5 m/5 f, mean age 36.6 years (SD 12.6), median 32.1, range 22-48). Diagnosis of mTLE was based on seizure description, clinical history and examination, prolonged video-EEG monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal and ictal SPECT. P3 potentials were elicited with a visual and auditory three stimulus discrimination paradigm. Results The latency of the P3 response to the auditory stimulus under automatic and effortful attention was delayed (423.3 ms (SD 60.4) and 436.9 ms (SD 83.4)) compared with a control group (359 ms (SD 42.4) and 354.2 ms (SD 39.7); P = 0.039 and P = 0.012, ANOVA), while the P3 latencies to visual stimuli under both tested attentional states (407.3 ms (SD 52.9) and 390.6 ms (SD 40.2)) did not differ from controls (378.2 ms (SD 48.6) and 378.2 ms (SD 55.4)). P3 latencies to auditory novel paradigm in patients with right sided mTLE, but not left sided mTLE, differed significantly from controls (P = 0.01). Conclusion The results suggest a modality dependence of the P3 component in patients with mTLE. The novelty processing of auditory stimuli is disturbed in patients with right sided mTLE.

The advent of whole-scalp MEG systems allowing rapid non-invasive recording from the entire cortex and accurate localisation of neural sources, and the development of refined signal analysis methods are important factors that led to an increasing interest in studies of sensorimotor oscillations during the last 10 years. Investigations on healthy subjects revealed frequency-specific localisation and modality-specific reactivity of 10 Hz and 20 Hz sensorimotor oscillations. Task-specific coherence between motor cortical and electromyographic oscillations, reflecting cortico-motoneuronal coupling, point towards a functional role of precentral oscillations in the cortical control of voluntary movements. Furthermore, abnormal cortico-motoneuronal coupling may underlie clinical symptoms of motor disorders, such as tremor. Thus, investigation of oscillatory sensorimotor activity proceeds from phenomenology to function and provides an interesting approach to address questions in human motor physiology and pathophysiology.

Simultaneous electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram were measured during dichotic listening of two concurrent trains of standard and deviant tones, Subjects counted the deviants presented to one car and ignored those presented to the other ear. ATD lowered plasma total tryptophan by 75% and free tryptophan by 39%. ATD suppressed the amplitude enhancement of P50 and NI to selectively attended tones, but did not affect the later aspects of processing negativity. The P50 latencies were increased after ATD, irrespective of attention. In conclusion, serotonin may regulate attentional modulation of early cortical stimulus processing.

Important questions remain, however, as to just how neurological functioning is affected by these predispositions. As a result, the present study assessed the effects of both familiality and personality factors on electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. College students were prescreened for family history (FH) of and personality predisposition (PAP) toward alcoholism, and 60 subjects were assigned to four extreme groups representing the crossover of the familial and personality dimensions. Each participant was exposed to nonverbal positive and negative emotional stimuli. Electroencephalography was recorded at frontal, parietal, and temporal sites in both hemispheres throughout and analyzed to assess response in the fast and slow alpha and beta ranges. Results showed that those with either a positive family history of alcoholism alone or predisposing personality characteristics alone were less aroused than those without predispositions. However, those high on both dimensions had lower arousal than subjects in other cells. Findings were interpreted as supporting the theoretical inverted U-shaped relationship of arousal input to arousal output.

J	Burock, MA; Dale, AM				Burock, MA; Dale, AM			Estimation and detection of event-related fMRI signals with temporally correlated noise: A statistically efficient and unbiased approach	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; hemodynamic response; statistics; system identification; noise estimation; temporal autocorrelation	FUNCTIONAL MRI; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; HUMAN BRAIN; TRIALS; RATES	Recent developments in analysis methods for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has enabled a wide range of novel experimental designs. As with selective averaging methods used in event-related potential (ERP) research, these methods allow for the estimation of the average time-locked response to particular event-types, even when these events occur in rapid succession and in an arbitrary sequence. Here we present a flexible framework for obtaining efficient and unbiased estimates of event-related hemodynamic responses, in the presence of realistic temporally correlated (nonwhite) noise. We further present statistical inference methods based upon the estimated responses, using restriction matrices to formulate temporal hypothesis tests about the shape of the evoked responses. The accuracy of the methods is assessed using synthetic noise, actual fMRI noise, and synthetic activation in actual noise; Actual false-positive rates were compared to nominal false-positive rates assuming white noise, as well as local and global noise estimates in the estimation procedure (assuming white noise resulted in inappropriate inference, while both global and local estimates corrected false-positive rates). Furthermore, both local and global noise estimates were found to increase the statistical power of the hypothesis tests, as measured by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). This approach thus enables appropriate univariate statistical inference with improved statistical power, without requiring a priori assumptions about the shape or timing of the event-related hemodynamic response.

As a novelty, this "multi-modal" EEG analysis was combined with the evaluation of involuntary mirror movements, taken as an index of "bimanual competition." A main issue was whether the decision regarding the hand to be moved ("free" movements) could modulate ERD/ERS or MRPs overlying sensorimotor cortical areas typically involved in bimanual tasks. Compared to "fixed" movements, "free" movements induced the following effects: (1) more involuntary mirror movements discarded from EEG analysis; (2) stronger vertex MRPs (right motor acts); (3) a positive correlation between these potentials and the number of involuntary mirror movements; (4) gamma ERS over central areas; and (5) preponderance of postmovement beta ERS over left central area (dominant hemisphere). These results suggest that ERD/ERS and MRPs provide complementary information on the cortical processes belonging to a lateralized motor act. In this context, the results on vertex MRPs would indicate a key role of supplementary/cingulate motor areas not only for bimanual coordination but also for the control of "bimanual competition" and involuntary mirror movements.

Many of our theories of language processing are based upon reaction time studies and use the new brain based findings sparingly. One reason for this is that much of the results from brain recordings are seen to be primarily recapitulations of reaction time findings. A new approach to analyzing evoked electroencephalographic data, Contrastive Signal Coherence (CSC) assesses the coherence of the evoked signal using the techniques of non-linear systems analysis. This determination of signal quality, combined with the measure of signal quantity as calculated in the standard voltage averaged approach to Evoked Brain Potentials (ERPs), provides a richer reflection of the dynamic properties of language related brain potentials and significantly enhances our view of cognitive cortical events. In this paper, we present the results of an ERP study in which we combined the traditional voltage averaged analysis and CSC to address two competing accounts of Case ambiguity resolution, a data driven, expectation based account following Schlesewsky (1997) and an information driven Diagnosis and Repair account following Fodor and Inoue (1994). Both approaches are considered in the context of Friederici's (1995) three stage description of the ERP correlates of language processing. The basic findings provide evidence in favor of the three stage model and motivate an alternative account of Case ambiguity resolution.

ERPs are low-frequency events that are usually obscured in single trial analysis. To visualize these signals; most of the reliable solutions at the present time use the ensemble averages of many single trials. In this paper, a wavelet-based method called Statistical Coefficient Selection (SCS) is used for the extraction of ERPs from EEG signals. Unlike other wavelet-based denoising methods, the current method does not focus on the wavelet coefficients of the signal itself. Instead, it selects the coefficients based on the statistical study of trials from training data set. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed SCS method in extracting ERPs in comparison with other filtering approaches.

The dominant-tonic progression, known as an authentic cadence, is often used as a marker of the end of a harmonic progression and has been considered a basic syntactic structure of major-minor tonal music by several music theorists and music psychologists. We review data from studies in which brain responses to an authentic cadence were compared to those elicited by music-syntactically inappropriate endings. In event-related electric brain potentials (recorded with EEG), the inappropriate endings elicit early right anterior negativity (ERAN), which is maximal around 200 ms after the presentation of an inappropriate chord. The ERAN is reminiscent of early anterior negativities elicited by syntactic incongruities during the perception of language. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data suggest that the ERAN is generated in the inferior frontolateral cortex, an area known to be crucially involved in the processing of (linguistic) syntax. Interestingly, the ERAN can be recorded in nonmusicians and in children, indicating that the ability to acquire (implicit) knowledge about musical regularities and to process musical information according to this knowledge is a general ability of the human brain. This ability is probably of great importance for the acquisition of language in infants and children.

Conclusion: Similar to the extension of the 10-20 system to the 10-10 system ('10% system'), proposed in 1985, the goal of this new extension to a 10-5 system is to further promote standardization in high-resolution EEG studies.

In recent years, a significant number of scientific works have been published on this subject. However, many technical problems related to the intrinsic incompatibility of EEG And MRI methods are still not fully solved. Furthermore, simultaneous acquisition of EEG and event-related fMRI requires precise synchronization of all devices involved in the experimental setup. Thus, timing issue must be carefully considered in order to avoid significant methodological errors. The aim of the present work is to highlight and discuss some of technical and methodological open issues associated with the combined use of EEG and fMRI. These issues are presented in the context of preliminary data regarding simultaneous acquisition of event-related evoked potentials and BOLD images during a visual odd-ball paradigm.

For a comprehensive understanding of brain activity in target detection, nine healthy subjects (age 24.2 +/- 2.9) were investigated with simultaneous EEG (27 electrodes) and fMRI using an auditory oddball paradigm. As a first step, event-related potentials, measured inside the scanner, have been compared with the potentials recorded in a directly preceding session in front of the scanner. Attenuated amplitudes were found inside the scanner for the earlier N1/P2 component but not for the late P300 component. Second, an independent analysis of the localizations of the fMRI activations and the current source density as revealed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been done. Concordant activations were found in most regions, including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula, and the middle frontal gyrus, with a mean Euclidean distance of 16.0 +/- 6.6 ram between the BOLD centers of gravity and the LORFTA-maxima. Finally, a time-course analysis based on the current source density maxima was done. It revealed different time-course patterns in the left and right hemisphere with earlier activations in frontal and parietal regions in the right hemisphere. The results suggest that the combination of EEG and fMRI permits an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, our software package includes (semi)automatic procedures for (i) EOG artifact detection and correction, (ii) EMG analysis, (iii) EEG artifact analysis, (iv) optimization of the ratio between artifact-free EEG channels and trials to be rejected. The performances of the software package on EOG-EEG-EMG data related to cognitive-motor tasks were evaluated with respect to the preliminary data analysis performed by two expert electroencephalographists (gold standard). Due to its extreme importance for multi-centric EEG studies, we compared the performances of two representative 'regression' methods for the EOG correction in time and frequency domains. The aim was the selection of the most suitable method in the perspective of a multi-centric EEG study. The results showed an acceptable agreement of approximately 95% between the human and software behaviors, for the detection of vertical and horizontal EOG artifacts, the measurement of hand EMG responses for a cognitive-motor paradigm, the detection of involuntary mirror movements, and the detection of EEG artifacts. Furthermore, our results indicated a particular reliability of a 'regression' EOG correction method operating in time domain (i.e. ordinary least squares). These results suggest that such a software package could be used for multi-centric EEG studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The first one, based on matching pursuit approach provided high-resolution distributions of power in time-frequency space. The phenomena of event related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) were investigated without the need of band-pass filtering. Time evolution of mu- and beta -components was observed in a detailed way. The second method was based on a multichannel autoregressive model (MVAR) adapted for investigation of short-time changes in EEG signal. The direction and spectral content of the EEG activity propagation was estimated by means of short-time directed transfer function (SDTF). The evidence of 'cross-talk' between different areas of motor and sensory cortex was found. The earlier known phenomena, connected with voluntary movements, were confirmed and a new evidence concerning focal ERD/surround ERS and beta activity post-movement synchronization was found.

Objectives: We investigated electrical brain activity (QEEG and cognitive event related potentials, ERPs) in healthy subjects who received olanzapine. Methods: Vigilance-controlled, 19-channel EEG and ERP in an auditory odd-ball paradigm were recorded before and 3 h, 6 h and 9 h after administration of either a single dose of placebo or olanzapine (2.5 mg and 5 mg) in ten healthy subjects. QEEG was analysed by spectral analysis and evaluated in nine frequency bands. For the P300 component in the odd-ball ERP, the amplitude and latency was analysed. Statistical effects were tested using a repeated-measurement analysis of variance. Results: For the interaction between time and treatment, significant effects were observed for theta, alpha-2, beta-2 and beta-4 frequency bands. The amplitude of the activity in the theta band increased most significantly 6 li after the 5-mg administration of olanzapine. A pronounced decrease of the alpha-2 activity especially 9 h after 5 mg olanzapine administration could be observed. In most beta frequency bands, and most significantly in the beta-4 band, a dose-dependent decrease of the activity beginning 6 h after drug administration was demonstrated. Topographic effects could be observed for the beta-2 band (occipital decrease) and a tendency for the alpha-2 band (frontal increase and occipital decrease), both indicating a frontal shift of brain electrical activity. There were no significant changes in P300 amplitude or latency after drug administration. Conclusion: QEEG alterations after olanzapine administration were similar to EEG effects gained by other atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine. The increase of theta activity is comparable to the frequency distribution observed for thymoleptics or antipsychotics for which treatment-emergent somnolence is commonly observed, whereas the decrease of beta activity observed after olanzapine administration is not characteristic for these drugs. There were no clear signs for an increased cerebral excitability after a single-dose administration of 2.5 mg and 5 mg olanzapine in healthy controls.

Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in healthy subjects impairs episodic memory, but the mechanism of this is unclear. Objectives: To examine the effects of ATD on the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in healthy subjects. Methods: Fourteen healthy men were given an amino acid cocktail drink with or without tryptophan, in a double blind, crossover design. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a well-validated episodic memory task performed 5 h after drink ingestion. Subjects listened to words spoken in a male or female voice. At test, old and new words were presented visually, subjects judged whether,words were old or new, and if old, the gender of the voice at study. Results: ATD led to an 84+/-5% reduction in plasma flee tryptophan concentrations, and significantly impaired episodic memory recall. ER-P recordings demonstrated previously reported left parietal and right frontal "old/new" differences for ERPs to items associated with accurate episodic memory retrieval versus correctly rejected new items. ATD increased ERP voltage between 500 and 1400 ms post-stimulus particularly over posterior regions of the scalp, but there was no interaction with item type. Topographical analysis of the old/new difference revealed no significant treatment by site interaction. Conclusions: ATD impairs episodic memory recall with no effect on the magnitude or topography of the neural correlates of retrieval in healthy subjects. This suggests that the effects of ATD on recall may reflect an impairment of memory encoding and/or consolidation.

However, there have been few investigations of the effects of exogenously administered cortisol on waking EEG measures. Objectives: To examine the effects of subchronic hydrocortisone administration on auditory evoked potentials and background EEG activity. Methods: Hydrocortisone, 20 mg twice daily, or placebo was administered to 30 normal male volunteers for 7 days in a between-subjects, double-blind trial. Auditory evoked potentials and EEG frequencies were measured on the last day. Results: Hydrocortisone significantly increased the amplitudes of the N1P2 and P-300 components of the auditory evoked response, but there was no change in background EEG, Conclusion: The results indicate that subchronic hydrocortisone treatment in normal subjects increases the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials, possibly reflecting a central alerting effect.

These obscure trial to trial variability. A new analysis technique is presented here which leads to single trial analysis and to insight into the mechanisms of EP generation. Methods: This technique is based on the identification of the EEG deflections recorded on the scalp before (background) and immediately after visual stimuli. A statistical description of the time and amplitude distributions of these deflections is defined and leads to the differentiation between background and evoked activity. Results: In response to stimuli, the time and amplitude of ongoing deflections (background) are re-organized (time locking) and amplified, generating the EP. Not all stimulus trials are accompanied by an appropriate response. Separate analysis of those single trials that do contain a response deflection provides information on the exact timing, variability, amplitude, etc., of those EEG deflections which contribute to the EP. Conclusions: New EEG analysis techniques are described which provide single trial EP analysis and insight into mechanisms of EP generation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The challenge, before such measures can be widely used, is to develop test procedures and analysis strategies that allow for statistically reliable and valid decisions to be made for any particular examinee, despite large individual differences in psychophysiological responding. Focusing on the evaluation of memory in clinical, criminal, and experimental contexts, this paper reviews the rationale for and development of ERP-based memory assessment procedures, with a focus on methods that allow for statistically supported decisions to be made in the case of a single examinee. The application of one such procedure to the study of amnesia in Dissociative Identity Disorder is highlighted. To facilitate the development of other psychophysiological assessment tools, psychophysiological researchers are encouraged to report the sensitivity and specificity of their measures where possible.

We predicted that amplitude would be significantly greater in late compared to early adolescence. Participants consisted of 11 adolescents that were divided into early (age 9-14) and late (age 14-17) adolescence groups. ERPs were recorded during an 840-trial arrow-flanker task and using 128-channel dense array EEG. Results indicated that there were no differences in PE amplitude but that N200 and ERN amplitudes were greater in the late adolescence group. According to the conflict monitoring hypothesis, this suggests that the ability to detect error-related conflict, which is involved in the modulation of cognitive control, appears to be fully developed later in adolescence and may be linked to the maturation of the ACC.

J	Gruber, T; Malinowski, P; Muller, MM				Gruber, T; Malinowski, P; Muller, MM			Modulation of oscillatory brain activity and evoked potentials in a repetition priming task in the human EEG	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						induced gamma band response; phase-locking; repetition priming; repetition suppression; synchrony; vision	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; LEARNING-TASK; MEMORY; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; SURFACE; CORTEX	Cortical object representations seem to require the formation of neural cell assemblies. The physiological correlate of cell assembly activity may be seen in synchronized neural activity in the gamma band range. The improvement in perceiving and identifying an object by experience is commonly referred to as repetition priming. One possible neural mechanism for repetition priming is 'repetition suppression' within a cell assembly coding the stimulus. The present electroencephalogram study was designed to investigate oscillatory brain activity when line drawings of concrete objects were repeated either immediately after a first presentation or after intervening a number of different stimuli. Results showed a broad posterior distribution of induced gamma band responses (GBRs) after the initial picture presentation. Repeated presentations of the same picture led to a significant decrease of induced gamma power Furthermore, repeated presentations of the same object resulted in a decrease in phase synchrony between distant electrode sites. No significant repetition effects were found in the alpha or beta frequency range. The event-related potential (ERP), which was also modulated by priming, showed a different scalp distribution compared with induced GBRs. In addition, ERP repetition effects decayed at larger intervals between initial and repeated presentations, whereas induced GBRs were not modulated as a function of stimulus lag. We concluded that the decrease in amplitude of induced GBRs and the reduction of gamma phase synchrony between pairs of electrodes after repeated picture presentations might be linked to a 'sharpening' mechanism within a cell assembly representing an object.

Human event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect these changes. Short- and mid-latency ERPs are only minimally affected by sleep onset. On the other hand, long-latency ERPs are very much affected. A negative wave, N1, peak-in at approximately 100 ms gradually decreases in amplitude until it reaches baseline level during definitive stage 2 sleep. The changes in NI are especially apparent when the subject no longer signals awareness of the external stimulus or when stage 1 is dominated by theta activity in the EEG. The positive peaks, P1 and P2, peaking at approximately 50 and 180 ms, respectively, may appear to increase in amplitude (i.e. also be less negative). A longlasting processing negativity PN) may overlap and summate with these peaks during the waking state. During sleep onset, the PN dissipates, thus explaining the apparent positive baseline shift in the ERP waveform. In an oddball task, when an alert and awake subject detects a rare, relevant stimulus, a large positive wave, P300, maximum over parietal areas of the scalp, is observed. This P300 is, however, widely dispersed and can be observed over frontal areas of the scalp. When the subject no longer signals detection of this target stimulus, P300 can no longer be recorded. During stage 1, the parietal P300 remains large, providing the subject overtly detects the target. The amplitude of the frontal aspect of P300 is much reduced as response times slow. This may reflect deactivation of the frontal lobes during the sleep onset period. The infrequent change of an otherwise rapidly presented homogenous train of stimuli is associated with another long-lasting negativity, the mismatch negativity (MMN). The MMN also decreases in amplitude during the sleep onset period, reaching baseline level during definitive sleep. The vertex sharp wave (VSW) becomes apparent during the sleep onset period. Associated with the VSW is a late negative ERP, sometimes called the sleep N2 or the N350, peaking between 300 and 350 ms. It is unique to the sleep onset and sleep periods, becoming very large during stage 1-theta or when the subject no longer shows signs of awareness of the external stimulus.

Clinical material comprised twenty-five patients with depression and an equal number of gender and aged-matched healthy controls. All subjects were evaluated by a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded from 15 scalp electrodes and recordings were digitized for further computer processing. Features related to the shape of the waveform were generated using a dedicated custom software interface system developed in C++ for the purposes of this work. A sofhvare classification system was designed, consisting of (a) two classifiers, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) and the support vector machines (SVM), (b) two routines for feature reduction and feature selection, and (c) an overall system evaluation routine, comprising the exhaustive search and the leave-one-out methods. Highest classification accuracies achieved were 92% for the PNN and 96% for the SVM, using the 'latencylamplitude ratio' and 'peak-to-peak slope' two-feature combination, In conclusion, employing computer-based pattern recognition techniques with features not easily evaluated by the clinician, patients with depression could be distinguished from healthy, subjects with high accuracy.

Methods: CO2 laser stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the hand. Reaction-time was used to discriminate between Apartial derivative- and C-fibre mediated detections. Analyses were performed using a method based on the time-frequency wavelet transform of EEG epochs. Results: This study revealed: (1) a novel non-phase-locked component related to the activation of Apartial derivative-fibres occurring at similar latencies as the late LEP; and (2) a widespread post-stimulus event-related desynchronization (ERD) induced by both Apartial derivative- and C-fibres. Conclusions: Apartial derivative- and C-fibre related LEPs could be electrophysiological correlates of similar brain processes, which, when already engaged by Apartial derivative-fibres, cannot or do not need to be reactivated by the later arriving C-fibre afferent volley. Apartial derivative-fibre related ERD could reflect a 41 transient change of state of brain structures generating these responses. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Dale, AM; Halgren, E				Dale, AM; Halgren, E			Spatiotemporal mapping of brain activity by integration of multiple imaging modalities	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; DEPTH-RECORDED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; SENSORY STIMULATION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; AUDITORY ODDBALL; LIGHT-SCATTERING	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography measure local changes in brain hemodynamics induced by cognitive or perceptual tasks. These measures have a uniformly high spatial resolution of millimeters or less, but poor temporal resolution (about 1 s). Conversely, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure instantaneously the current flows induced by synaptic activity, but the accurate localization of these current flows based on EEG and MEG data alone remains an unsolved problem. Recently, techniques have been developed that, in the context of brain anatomy visualized with structural MRI, use both hemodynamic and electromagnetic measures to arrive at estimates of brain activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. These methods range from simple juxtaposition to simultaneous integrated techniques. Their application has already led to advances in our understanding of the neural bases of perception, attention, memory and language. Further advances in multi-modality integration will require an improved understanding of the coupling between the physiological phenomena underlying the different signal modalities.

In a recent EEG study, different event-related brain-potentials have been identified which reflect the underlying pre-attentive and attentive processes. We show that a neural model of texture boundary processing can account for the findings of the EEG study concerning the pre-attentive processes. The model identifies the functional role of these processes as well as their probable cortical origin. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed computational mechanisms can account for the differences between automatic segmentation and visual search.

EEGs were recorded from 20 locations on the scalp including Broca's and Wernicke's areas. EMG of orbicularis oris muscle and subject's voice through a microphone were also monitored during the EEG measurement, and were averaged after rectification. From EEGs averaged before and after vocalizing a Japanese syllable, /u/ or /mu/, we recognized Vocalization-Related Cortical Potential (VRCP) with Bereitschaftpotential (BP) before vocalization contains. Significant difference of BP due to vocalization of a vowel syllable (/u/) was not observed between subject groups. For vocalizing a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable (/u/), however, BP amplitude in Down syndromes was significantly larger than normal adults. Therefore, the increased BP in Down syndromes might be brought by their enhanced effort and expectation to vocalize CV syllable. VRCP after the onset of vocalization may contain not only motor component related to control of vocalization organ but also auditory response to one's own voice as an auditory feedback. As people with Down syndrome vocalize louder voice with longer duration, motor and auditory components might be increased respectively and remain longer. Therefore, enhanced VRCP after the onset of vocalization in Down syndrome might be associated with inflamed cortical activation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of the relatively poor signal to noise ratio, evoked responses potentials (ERPs) were typically measured by averaging over multiple trials. While recent applications of blind source separation (BSS) and independent component analysius (ICA) improved the effective signal to noise ratio (S/N) by separating different brain sources and other extra-cranial sources, variations in the background on-going activity of each brain sources makes it difficult to determine whether and when an evoked response potential has occurred. We introduced and combined several new approaches to improve single-trial ERP detection from a previously reported MEG data set with relatively low S/N. First, new metrics based on multiresolution filtering were introduced to better discriminate a ERP against background oscillatory activity. Second, a novel interactive user interface was implemented to use the new metrics to detect single-trial ERPs from an example. Third, time series of brain source activation recovered using BSS were used as inputs to this multiresolution method. We report sharpened average ERPs after aligment using the detected single-trial ERP onset time and a reduction in false detection from the previously reported 26+/-2% to 13+/-2%.

The basis of evidence for neurofeedback (or EEG-biofeedback) has improved recently. Neurofeedback is aiming at an improvement of ADHD core-symptoms via the voluntary modification of abnormal neurophysiologic parameters, e.g. EEG-frequency spectrum and event-related potentials. Methods:,Our review presents an overview of the current research on neurofeedback for the treatment of ADHD. Results: In three controlled studies short-term effects of feedback matched those of stimulant treatment. Neurofeedback lead to significant improvement of attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, without adversive side effects. Additionally, there was a persistent amelioration of EEG parameters, while stimulants did not lead to a comparable normalization. Results on the stability of feedback effects are encouraging but are based on small numbers of patients. Conclusion: Neurofeedback is a promising approach for the treatment of children with ADHD. However, there is a demand for further controlled studies using standardized diagnostic criteria, sufficient sample sizes and appropriate measures and follow-up.

Behavioral studies have shown that the fine and coarse spatial scales of a face are differentially processed depending on the categorization task performed, thus suggesting that the latter can influence stimulus perception. Here, we investigated the time course of these task influences on perceptual processing by examining the visual N170 face-sensitive Event-Related Potential (ERP), while observers categorized faces for their gender and familiarity. Stimuli were full spectrum, or filtered versions that preserved either coarse or fine scale information of the faces. Behavioral results replicated previous findings of a differential processing of coarse and fine spatial scales across tasks. In addition, the N170 amplitude was larger in the Gender task as compared to the Familiarity task for LSF faces exclusively, thus showing that task demands differentially modulated the spatial scale processing on faces. These results suggest that the diagnosticity of scale-specific cues in categorization tasks can modulate face processing. (C) 2003 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. All rights reserved.

Objective investigations can enhance the accuracy of such predictions and are an important adjuvant when reaching decisions to continue or terminate life support. Of the neurophysiological methods available, electroencephalography and short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials have proved the most useful in the clinical setting. These tests are good predictors of an adverse outcome; however, they tell us only about the ongoing cerebral activity and integrity of the primary somatosensory pathways, respectively. The presence of long-latency event-related potentials has been shown to be a useful predictor of a favourable neurological outcome, and thus their use complements other neurophysiological techniques. Their potential application in clinical practice is reviewed. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

One part of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is based on the recording and classification of circumscribed and transient EEG changes during different types of motor imagery such as, e.g., imagination of left-hand, right-hand, or foot movement. Features such as, e.g., band power or adaptive autoregressive parameters are either extracted in bipolar EEG recordings overlaying sensorimotor areas or from an array of electrodes located over central and neighboring areas. For the classification of the features, linear discrimination analysis and neural networks is used. Characteristic for the Graz BCI is that a classifier is set up in a learning session and updated after one or more sessions with online feedback using the procedure of "rapid prototyping. " As a result, a discrimination of two brain states (e.g., left- versus right-hand movement imagination) can be reached within only a few days of training. At this time, a tetraplegic patient is able to operate an EEG-based control of a hand orthosis with nearly 100% classification accuracy, by mental imagination of specific motor commands.

Both types of responses were recorded with electroencephalography and studied during rest and motor behavior in eight normal subjects. During manipulation of a cube with the fingers of the right hand, the beta ERS around 20 Hz, induced by right hand median nerve stimulation, is significantly suppressed, whereas the long-latency SEP components are significantly enhanced. The results suggest that both phenomena can be interpreted as responses of different neuronal structures in sensorimotor areas. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

BCIs create a new communication channel between the brain and an output device by bypassing conventional motor output pathways of nerves and muscles. These systems use signals recorded from the scalp, the surface of the cortex, or from inside the brain to enable users to control a variety of applications including simple word-processing software and orthotics. BCI technology could therefore provide a new communication and control option for individuals who cannot otherwise express their wishes to the outside world. Signal processing and classification methods are essential tools in the development of improved BCI technology. We organized the BCI Competition 2003 to evaluate the current state of the art of these tools. Four laboratories well versed in EEG-based BCI research provided six data sets in a documented format. We made these data sets (i.e., labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets) and their descriptions available on the Internet. The goal in the competition was to maximize the performance measure for the test labels. Researchers worldwide tested their algorithms and competed for the best classification results. This paper describes the six data sets and the results and function of the most successful algorithms.

We enrolled 23 patients (17-64 years old, mean 38.2) with biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism, with thyroxine less than 4 mu g/dl and thyrotropin above 4.5 mU/ml, and 200 age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Detailed clinical examination and electrophysiological measurements included electromyography, motor conduction velocity,;visual-evoked potentials (VEPs), brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs) and event-related potentials. Determinations of P300, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (IQ) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed. Of the hypothyroid patients 52% had peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement. Entrapment neuropathy was the commonest (35%). Axonal neuropathy was recorded in 9% and myopathy was recorded in another 9%. The central nervous system (CNS) was affected in 78% of the cases. Significant prolongations of P100 latency of VEP, latency and interpeak latency of BAEPs of different waves of hypothyroid patients were compared to the control group. 52% had abnormal VEPs and BAEPs above the mean +/- 2 SD of the normal control group. Six patients (26%) had prolonged P300 latency while 16 patients had an IQ below 90. Eight patients (35%) had EEG changes. Diffuse slowing of background activity was the commonest. No significant correlation was observed between hormonal levels and the different electrophysiological parameters. Thus, the CNS is more vulnerable to the effect of hypothyroidism than the PNS. Therefore, we suggest performing electrophysiological studies in hypothyroid patients, even in the asymptomatic ones, early in the course of disease in order to detect the nervous system involvement.

The subjects were shown biological motion or scrambled motion as a control stimulus. In the scrambled motion, each point had the same velocity vector as in the biological motion, but the initial starting positions were randomized. The perception of both biological and scrambled motion elicited negative peaks at around 200 (N200) and 240 ms (N240). Furthermore, both negative peaks were significantly larger in the biological motion condition than in the scrambled motion condition over the right occipitotemporal region. In light of previous human neuroimaging studies, we speculate that component N200 is generated near the extrastriate cortex area and N240 is generated from the superior temporal sulcus region.

J	Foxe, JJ; Simpson, GV				Foxe, JJ; Simpson, GV			Flow of activation from V1 to frontal cortex in humans - A framework for defining "early" visual processing	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						high-density mapping; event-related potential; C1 component; visual cortex; area V1; frontal cortex; scalp current density; human	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AREAS V1; LAPLACIAN ESTIMATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTION; MACAQUE; STRIATE	This study provides a time frame for the initial trajectory of activation flow along the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams and for the initial activation of prefrontal cortex in the human. We provide evidence that this widespread system of sensory, parietal, and prefrontal areas is activated in less than 30 ms, which is considerably shorter than typically assumed in the human event-related potential (ERP) literature and is consistent with recent intracranial data from macaques. We find a mean onset latency of activity over occipital cortex (C1(e)) at 56 ms, with dorsolateral frontal cortex subsequently active by just 80 ms. Given that activity in visual sensory areas typically continues for 100-400 ms prior to motor output, this rapid system-wide activation provides a time frame for the initiation of feedback processes onto sensory areas. There is clearly sufficient time for multiple iterations of interactive processing between sensory, parietal, and frontal areas during brief (e.g., 200 ms) periods of information processing preceding motor output. High-density electrical mapping also suggested activation in dorsal stream areas preceding ventral stream areas. Our data suggest that multiple visual generators are active in the latency range of the traditional C1 component of the ERP, which has often been taken to represent V1 activity alone. Based on the temporal pattern of activation shown in primate recordings and the evidence from these human recordings, we propose that only the initial portion of the C1 component (approximately the first 10-15 ms; C1(e)) is likely to represent a response that is predominated by V1 activity. These data strongly suggest that activity represented in the "early" ERP components such as P1 and N1 (and possibly even C1) is likely to reflect relatively late processing, after the initial volley of sensory afference through the visual system and involving top-down influences from parietal and frontal regions.

Since language functions are characterized by both distributed network activities and speed of processing within milliseconds, high temporal as well as high spatial resolution of activation profiles are of interest: "where" can dyslexia specific activations be detected and "when" do language processes start to diverge between dyslexics and controls? Due to the network character of language processing, fMRI-constrained distributed source models based on EEG-data were computed for multimodal data integration. First single-case results show that this method could be a promising approach for the understanding of a repeatedly described experimental finding for dyslexia like that of an overactivation in inferior frontal language areas. Multimodal data analysis for the subjects presented here could probably demonstrate that inferior frontal overactivations are the consequence of a phonological deficit and could represent ongoing articulation processes used to solve phonologically challenging tasks.

In the present study, the hypothesis of a temporo-limbic dysfunction in panic disorder (PD) was tested by investigating the topographic descriptors of brain microstates, in particular the one corresponding to the Late Positive Complex (LPC), an event-related potential (ERP) component with generators in these regions. ERPs were recorded in PD patients and matched healthy subjects during a target detection task, in a central (CC) and a lateral condition (LC), In the CC, a leftward shift of the LPC microstate positive centroid was observed in the patients with PD versus the healthy control subjects. In the LC, the topographic descriptor of the first microstate showed a rightward shift, while those of both the second and the fourth microstate, corresponding to the LPC, revealed a leftward shift in the PD patients versus the healthy control subjects. These findings indicate an overactivation of the right hemisphere networks involved in early visual processing and a hypoactivation of the right hemisphere circuits involved in LPC generators in PD, In line with this interpretation, the abnormal topography of the LPC microstate, observed in the CC, was associated with a worse performance on a test exploring right temporo-hippocampal functioning. Topographical abnormalities found for the LPC microstate in the LC were associated with a higher number of panic attacks, suggesting a pathogenetic role of the right temporo-hippocampal dysfunction in PD.

Methods: Olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) were evaluated in 10 patients with unilateral brain tumors of the frontal or temporal lobe in response to linalool and allylcaproate. Both odors were presented monorhinally by a constant-flow olfactometer. In addition, 20 healthy subjects were examined. While sniffing, the subjects were asked to discriminate the two odors. EEG was recorded from 7 electrode positions (Fz, Cz, Pz, 173/4, P3/4). Amplitudes and latencies of 3 peaks (N1, P2, P3) were measured. To control for effects of modality-nonspecific alterations on the olfactory components acoustic event-related potentials (AERPs) were registered by use of an oddball paradigm. Results: Patients with right-sided lesions showed distinct deficits in the discrimination task after stimulation of the right and left nostril. In contrast, patients with left-sided lesions only had an attenuation of correct reactions after left-sided stimulation. In the OERPs, patients with right-sided lesions showed P2- and P3-components with decreased amplitudes at parietal electrode positions. These alterations appeared after ipsi- and contralateral stimulation. Patients with left-sided lesions showed a significant effect of the side of stimulation. Their OERP-amplitudes were decreased after left-sided stimulation but not after right-sided stimulation. After right-sided olfactory stimulation a correlation between the olfactory and the acoustic ERP was seen in patients with right-sided lesions. Conclusions: Olfactory performance of the participating patients was markedly reduced. Patients with right-sided lesions showed bilateral impairment, which would support the importance of the right hemisphere in olfaction. The alteration of the topographic distribution of P2- and P3-amplitudes in patients with right-sided lesions might reflect an impairment of early and late olfactory processing steps.

J	Clementz, BA; Barber, SK; Dzau, JR				Clementz, BA; Barber, SK; Dzau, JR			Knowledge of stimulus repetition affects the magnitude and spatial distribution of low-frequency event-related brain potentials	AUDIOLOGY AND NEURO-OTOLOGY			English	Article						stimulus expectancy; event-related brain potential; sensory gating; P-50 point; gamma band; theta wave; rate effect	AUDITORY-EVOKED RESPONSE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; P50 SUPPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STIMULATION; COMPONENTS; MANIPULATIONS; MULTICHANNEL; LOCALIZATION; INDICATORS	Rate effects are defined as a reduction in amplitude of an evoked brain response with increasing stimulus frequency. In auditory paired-stimulus paradigms, a smaller amplitude evoked response to the second stimulus at a latency of 50 ms has been proposed to index a preattentive sensory gating mechanism. The present study investigated the possibility that expectancy and/or attentional biases could alter evoked potentials associated with rate effects. EEG data were recorded from 30 channels while subjects received 240 trials of 1, 2 or 3 click stimuli (with successive stimuli being separated by 500-ms intervals). Half of the subjects knew (blocked condition) and half of the subjects did not know (mixed condition) how many stimuli they would receive on a given trial. Subjects in the blocked condition had a significantly larger rate effect than subjects in the mixed condition. This effect was present only for low-frequency components of the event-related brain potential (ERP; below 10 Hz) and occurred from 30 to 60, 90 to 160 and 190 to 260 ms after stimulus presentation (P-1-N-1-P-2 complex). Mixed condition subjects also had larger contributions to their ERPs from temporal channels. These results suggest that the rate effect can be significantly altered by expectancy, and they are inconsistent with the thesis that ERPs near 50 ms in a paired-stimulus paradigm solely index a preattentive sensory gating mechanism.

It is generally assumed that this background activity is normal white noise. Another assumption made is that the underlying evoked signals are deterministic and they do not vary from trial to trial. The signal, thus, is modeled as y(i)((j)) = x(i) + sigmaz(i)((j)), where y(i)((j)) is the jth trial ans z(i) is a white noise. The signal x(i) recovered by averaging the observations y(i)((j)). In reality, the background activity is " colored " and not always Gaussian. The time samples of the background activity are generally correlated. In addition, the signal x(i) varies across observations. The purpose of this study is to extract single trial ERPs from the EEG. We are interested in the trial to trial variation of the ERPs and their clinical applicability. We have investigated the wavelet soft-thresholding method to remove the background noise and separate out the single response. The non-white background activity, after wavelet transformation, may concentrate in certain resolution levels. We determined these levels by testing the Gaussianity of the wavelet coefficients, using both the chi (2) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests. In the resolution levels at which the null hypothesis was not rejected, the noise level was estimated. The de-noising threshold was then calculated using a level dependent rule T-j,T-N = root 2log(N).MAD(C-j,C-k)/0.6745, where C-j,C-k are the wavelet coefficients and MAD(C-j,C-k) = Median(\C-j,C-k\) is an estimator of the noise level. The resolution levels at which the null hypothesis was rejected were not thresholded.

Animal models have demonstrated that adolescent nicotine exposure causes cell death and altered neurochemistry in the cortex and hippocampus; however, little is known about the neurophysiological consequences of adolescent nicotine exposure in the adult. The primary objective of this study was to assess the consequences of adolescent nicotine exposure on the adult electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered nicotine (5.0 mg/kg per day) for 5 days between postnatal days 35 and 40 using transdermal nicotine patches. Following 6-7 weeks of. nicotine withdrawal, EEG activity and event related potentials were assessed. Motor activity and sucrose preference were also examined during the nicotine withdrawal period. Additionally, a set of rats was exposed to multiple doses of nicotine for a single day to assess nicotine and cotinine blood levels. Transdermal nicotine produced nicotine (88 +/- 21.5 ng/ml) and cotinine (647.6 +/- 123.2 ng/ml) levels comparable to those previously reported. Reduced motor activity, decreased 1-4 Hz power in the cortical electroencephalogram, and increased cortical N1 amplitude were observed in nicotine-exposed rats compared to controls. These data demonstrate that transdermal nicotine patches provide an effective and non-invasive nicotine delivery system for the adolescent rat. The combined neurophysiological and locomotor activity changes observed in nicotine-exposed rats demonstrate that adolescent nicotine exposure has lasting neurobehavioral consequences. These changes may be indicative of a lasting 'nicotine abstinence syndrome' characterized by increased arousal, anxiety, or emotionality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the language domain, males appear to have greater left hemisphere control than females. Despite some overlap of neural structures and processes for the perception of music and language, gender differences of musical functions have so far not been reported. Data sets of three previous music experiments with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were pooled and re-analyzed. Results demonstrate that an electrophysiological correlate of music-syntactic processing (ERAN, or music-syntactic MMN) is generated bilaterally in females, and with right hemispheric predominance in males. The present findings indicate that gender differences for the analysis of auditory information are not restricted to processes in the linguistic domain such as syntax, semantics, and phonology.

J	Radin, DI				Radin, DI			Event-related electroencephalographic correlations between isolated human subjects	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							QUANTUM NONLOCALITY; ENTANGLEMENT; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS	Objective: To examine electroencephalograms (EEG) in pairs of people to see if event-related potentials evoked in one person's brain are correlated with concurrent responses in the brain of a distant, isolated person. Design: Simultaneously record EEGs using independent physiologic monitoring systems. One person relaxes in a double steel-walled, electromagnetically and acoustically shielded room while a second, located in a dimly fit room 20 meters away, is stimulated at random times by the live video image of the first person. Subjects: Thirteen (13) pairs of volunteers. Eleven (11) pairs of adult friends and 2 mother-daughter pairs. Outcome measures: Epochs of interest were the moments of stimulus onset and offset, +/- 5 seconds, in both participants' EEGs. A positive correlation was postulated to appear between the ensemble variance of the stimulated subjects' EEGs versus an identical measure in the nonstimulated subjects. Control data using the same equipment and test conditions, but without humans present, was collected to check for equipment and analytical artifacts. Nonparametric bootstrap methods were used to assess statistical significance of the observed correlations. Results: The control test resulted in a correlation of r = -0.03, p = 0.61; the experimental test resulted in r = 0.20, p = 0.0005. Three (3) of the 13 pairs of participants showed independently significant correlations. Examination of the stimulated subjects' event-related potentials showed that the stronger their responses, the larger the corresponding responses in the nonstimulated subjects (P = 0.0008). Conclusion: Under certain conditions, the EEG of a sensorially isolated human subject can become correlated with event-related potentials in a distant person's EEG. This suggests the presence of an unknown form of energetic or informational interaction.	Inst Noet Sci, Petaluma, CA USA		Radin, DI (corresponding author), Inst Noet Sci, Petaluma, CA USA.

Methodology and applications	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						alpha; attention; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; temporal spectral evolution; temporal dynamics of the frequency; spectral power	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MOVEMENT; SLEEP	Introduction. The event-related potentials (ERPs) allow to study the evolution of the cerebral electric activity related with the diverse sensorial, motors and cognitive processes. However, the ERPs and the spectral analyses based in Fast Fourier Transform, are notable to show the variations along the time of the spectral content of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Objective. The present work will show the necessary methodology to obtain the temporal dynamics of the frequency (TSE) in the EEG, a technique described by Salmelin and Hari (1994) that allows the analysis of the modulations of any spectral band along the time. Patients and methods. The presented data correspond to the electroencephalographic registration of 20 human subjects during an experiment of visual spatial attention. Results. The modulations of the ERPs differ of the observed by the spectral techniques in latency and topography. Likewise, comparing different spectral techniques is proven that the TSE allows to define with more temporal precision the variations on the spectral content. Conclusion. The application of the TSE technique to the same EEG signal that is used for obtaining the ERPS, allows the inclusion of the variable time in the spectral analysis of the EEG, what can be crucial to understand the physiological bases of some neuropathologies.

During the expectancy of pain, concurrent cognitive demands were superimposed. The aim was to investigate the effects on primary sensorimotor and central midline areas of the competition among concurrent attentional processes related to cognition and pain expectancy, as indexed by behavioral performance and EEG data. A main issue was whether cognitive performance decreases, due to a re-allocation of attentional resources on primary sensorimotor and midline areas for the anticipation of pain. Behavioral results showed no differences in the cognitive (working memory) performance during the expectancy of nonpainful versus painful stimulations. In parallel, anticipatory event-related potentials (ERPs) were negligible in line with a low emotional reactivity/alertness as revealed by heart rate deceleration (HRD), skin conductance response (SCR), and low-band (6-10 Hz) alpha EEG oscillations. In contrast, high-band alpha EEG oscillations (10-12 Hz) over the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex decreased more during the expectancy of painful compared to nonpainful stimuli, in line with an increased anticipatory preparation of the somatosensory channel. These findings provide further evidence on the fact that attentional processes at the basis of cognition can be defended by the anticipation of pain, at least when the incoming painful stimuli are repetitive and predictable. This happens even if the brain increases preparatory processes of the specific sensory channel to be targeted by the painful stimulus. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nine subjects were studied including six temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with confirmed localization indicated by successful seizure control after resection. The remaining three subjects had standard presurgical evaluations with inconsistent results or suspected extratemporal lobe foci. Peaks of activity, presumably epileptic, were detected in all nine subjects, using the resting functional MRI with temporal clustering analysis. In all six patients who underwent resective surgery, the fMRI with temporal clustering analysis accurately determined the epileptogenic hippocampal hemisphere (P = 0.005). In the three subjects without confirmed localization, the technique determined regions of activity consistent with those determined by the presurgical assessments. Though more studies are required to validate this technique, the results demonstrate the potential of the resting fMRI with temporal clustering technique to detect and localize epileptic activity without the need for simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). The greatest potential benefit of this technique will be in the evaluation of patients with suspected extratemporal lobe epilepsy and patients whose standard assessments are discordant.

The predicted wavenumber spectrum has three plateaus separated by regions of monotonic power decrease, which we explain by filtering of the signal through neurons of different type and characteristic range. The predicted spectrum agrees well with EEG, ECoG, and ERP data. We investigate the effect of imposing cortical boundary conditions, by examining the resulting modal structure of the spectrum.

While several studies have reported changes in long latency ERPs (N2, P3) in head injury, the data on early ERP components related to attention selection are inconclusive. The problem may be partly methodological because the standard oddball paradigm does not give an adequate basis for discriminating components contributing to the N1 and P2 waveforms. Following a suggestion by Garcia-Larrea et al. [10: Garcia-Larrea L, Lukasziewicz A-C, Maugiere F. Revisiting the oddball paradigm. Non-target vs neutral stimuli and the evaluation of ERP attention effects. Neuropsychologia 1992;30:723-741] we used an extended oddball paradigm to study measures of early processing (N1-average, P250) as well as conventional cognitive ERPs (N1, P2, N2, P3) in a group of head injured patients and controls. We found evidence of deficits in early processing of neutral and non-target stimuli in the patient group, and interpret the findings as an indication that the patients are less efficient in terminating processing of irrelevant stimuli. The results further indicate that processing deviations affect both target and non-target stimuli in the oddball paradigm and thus the allocation of attention in the task as a whole.

Methods: The EEGs are decomposed into a series of frequency bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelop of oscillatory activity, which forms the spatial patterns for a given electrode montage at a time-frequency gild. Time-frequency weights determined by training process are used to synthesize the contributions from the time-frequency domains. Results: The present method was tested in nine human subjects performing left or right hand movement imagery tasks. The overall classification accuracies for nine human subjects were about 80% in the 10-fold cross-validation, without rejecting any trials from the dataset. The loci of MI activity were shown in the spatial topography of differential-mode patterns over the sensorimotor area. Conclusions: The present method does not contain a priori subject-dependent parameters, and is computationally efficient. The testing results are promising considering the fact that no trials are excluded due to noise or artifact. Significance: The present method promises to provide a useful alternative as a general purpose classification procedure for MI classification.

The predicted wavenumber spectrum has three plateaus separated by regions of monotonic power decrease, which we explain by filtering of the signal through neurons of different type and characteristic range. The predicted spectrum agrees well with EEG, ECoG, and ERP data. We investigate the effect of imposing cortical boundary conditions, by examining the resulting modal structure of the spectrum. We deduce that boundary conditions do not affect the main spectral features of our model under most circumstances, and can thus be ignored. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To study this effect, we used an original three-dimensional (3-D) resistor mesh model described in spherical coordinates, consisting of 67,464 elements and 22,105 nodes arranged in 36 different concentric layers. After validation of the model by comparison with the analytic solution, potential variations induced by geometric and electrical skull modifications were investigated at the surface in the dipole plane and along the dipole axis, for several eccentricities and bone thicknesses. The resistor mesh pen-nits one to obtain various configurations, as local modifications are introduced very easily. This has allowed several head models to be designed to study the effects of skull properties (thickness, anisotropy, and heterogeneity) on scalp surface potentials. Results show a decrease of potentials in bone, depending on bone thickness, and a very small decrease through the scalp layer. Nevertheless, similar scalp potentials can be obtained using either a thick scalp layer and a thin skull layer, and vice versa. It is thus important to take into account skull and scalp thicknesses, because the drop of potential in bone depends on both. The use of three different layers for skull instead of one leads to small differences in potential values and patterns. In contrast, the introduction of a hole in the skull highly increases the maximum potential value (by a factor of 11.5 in our case), because of the absence of potential drop in the corresponding volume. The inverse solution without any a priori knowledge indicates that the model with the hole gives the largest errors in both position and dipolar moment. Our results indicate that the resistor mesh model can be used as a robust and user-friendly simulation tool in EEG or event-related potentials. It makes it possible to build up real head models directly from anatomic magnetic resonance imaging without tessellation, and is able to take into account head heterogeneities very simply by changing volume elements conductivity.

We also examined whether a small set of stimuli was sufficient to study the phonological encoding, and to what extent the complexity of the produced message affects the EEG responses. Methods: Event-related electrical brain activity during the covert and overt production of names and nominal phrases derived from 16 Variants from 3 different pictures was compared with that during passive viewing of the same pictures. Results: Topographical and source analyses of the differential EEG activity (naming versus passive viewing) indicated that the N1 and P2 components of the visual evoked potential resulted from the same brain areas, but were activated stronger during naming as compared to passive viewing. In contrast, the differential EEG activity from 275 to 400 ms suggested the involvement of additional brain areas during naming with more pronounced left- than right-hemispheric activation in middle and posterior temporal regions for both overt and covert naming. Conclusions: Results suggest the involvement of Wernicke's area in the phonological encoding of a message during speech production, which can even be obtained with a small set of pictures and a large number of repetitions.

A time-frequency analysis of non-phase-locked activity in the 7-47 Hz range was performed on movement-centred EEG sweeps using wavelet filters and Gabor transforms. All three movements were accompanied by a decrease in beta activity that began contralaterally about 1.5 s prior to the onset of movement but that extended to both sides near the beginning of the movement. This decrease was followed by a rebound after the end of the movement in the ballistic and negative movements. A decrease was also seen in the alpha band during the three paradigms, which began later (I s before movement) and lasted longer. An increase in gamma activity was only seen during ballistic and sustained movements, while a decrease in gamma energy was observed during negative movements. It was concluded that changes in the beta band of the EEG before movement are related to the preparation for the movement, but an important afferent component may be present in the later changes. Gamma band activity may be just involved in the execution of the movement, related to muscle contraction.

Methods: Resting EEG, simple oddball paradigm and novel task event-related potentials (ERPs) topography were measured in early-stage nondemented PDPs (MMSE>26), and age-matched normal controls (NCs). The new modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT) was used to evaluate the frontal lobe function. Results and interpretation: There were no natural novelty Pas to be found in PDPs. P3b latency did not differ between PDPs and controls. In addition, increased P3b amplitude for the target stimulus was found in nondemented PDPs. Moreover, the nondemented PDPs showed increased amplitude of resting EEG. PDPs showed significant decreasing of the achieved categories and increasing of perseverative errors in WSCT. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that higher brain function disturbance such as the central executive of working memory impairment in nondemented PDPs may be based on the disturbance of mental set change, parallel processing and inhibition of the cortical function due to dysfunction of basal ganglia.

Neuronal compartiments involved in object discrimination allow interaction between data-driven and endogeneous top-down processes resulting in selective resource allocation. Goal directed behavior sometimes needs both, changes in resource allocation and concentration of mental activity. Attentional shift could be understood as a two-stage process consisting of broad mobilization of memory resources (indicated by EEG-theta) followed by a re-organizing concentration of neuronal activity (indicated by slow EEG-alpha). This paper puts forward the thesis that a key to understand attentional shifts is the analysis of joined changes of mobilization and concentration in several parts of posterior and anterior cortical areas.

Such analyses capture EEG phenomena that are not part of traditional event-related potential measures. The present study investigated whether IBP changes in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges are sensitive to syntactic violations in sentences. Subjects read sentences that either were correct or contained a syntactic violation. The violations were either grammatical gender agreement violations, where a prenominal adjective was not appropriately inflected for the head noun's gender, or number agreement violations, in which a plural quantifier was combined with a singular head noun. IBP changes of the concurrently measured EEG were computed in five frequency bands of 2-Hz width, individually adjusted on the basis of subjects' a peak, ranging approximately from 2 to 12 Hz. Words constituting a syntactic violation elicited larger increases in theta power than the same words in a correct sentence context, in an interval of 300-500 ms after word onset. Of all the frequency bands studied, this was true for the theta frequency band only. The scalp topography of this effect was different for different violations: following number violations a left-hemispheric dominance was found, whereas gender violations elicited a right-hemisphere dominance of the theta power increase. Possible interpretations of this effect are considered in closing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Subjects decided which of the superimposed images in both hemi-fields appeared more "face-like" and during this task, the EEG was recorded from 30 channels. VEPs were analysed topographically according to the influence of the different experimental conditions (defined by presentation form, emotional expression, and location). Behavioural responses to the ambiguous dichoptic stimuli demonstrated a functional eye dominance not related to visual acuity and conventional eye preference. Electrophysiological data revealed three components with mean latencies of 85, 160, and 310 ms. Topography of the second component (equivalent to the face-related N170) differed in left-right and anterior-posterior direction compared with simple checkerboard stimuli. Dichoptic presentation caused reduced field strength of all three, and increased latency of the first component. Faces with negative expression yielded largest field strength of the second and third components. Besides that, emotional expression affected topography not only of late, but also the first component. This provides new evidence about the timing of perceptual processes related to facial expression, indicating that already VEP components occurring at 80-90 ms are sensitive to emotional content.

For the two types of experimental manipulation distinct effects in overall synchronization are found; for one of them they can also be localized. The synchronization effects occur earlier than those found by the conventional analysis method, indicating that the new approach provides additional information on the underlying neuronal process.

Design: Participants napped for two hours on two separate days. Two types of vibratory stimuli were randomly presented to one hand: a short and more intense vibration (rare stimulus) and a long and less intense vibration (frequent stimulus). The vibratory stimuli were presented to participants once in SWS in alternating periods of stimulation and no stimulation. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were obtained from homologous electrode sites and analyzed for asymmetry. Setting: State University of New York at Stony Brook. Participants: Eight right-handed college students (ages 18 to 24). Measurements & Results: Delta band activity (>0-3.906 Hz) at homologous electrode sites was obtained and an asymmetry index (Al) was derived. The Al varied as a function of Stimulus Type (rare, frequent, no stimulus). Less asymmetry was observed after rare stimuli than after frequent or no stimuli. There was no difference in Al between right and left hand stimulation. Absolute delta power was greater to rare stimuli than to frequent or no stimuli. Amplitude of ERP (event-related potential) components during wakefulness and sleep were also examined. Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the idea that vibratory stimulation of a given hand will disrupt sleep in the contralateral hemisphere. However, the results do support the idea that the human brain is capable of monitoring the environment without compromising slow wave sleep.

Methods: Electrophysiological and behavioral methods were used to assess the effects of dopamine D2-receptor antagonist haloperidol on involuntary attention shifting using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design. Eleven subjects were instructed to discriminate equiprobable 200 and 400 ms tones in a forced-choice reaction-time (RT) task during simultaneous measurement of whole-head magnetoencephalography and high-resolution electroencephalography. Results: Occasional changes in task-irrelevant tone frequency (10% increase or decrease) caused marked distraction on behavioral performance, as shown by significant RT increases to deviant stimuli and subsequent standard tones. Furthermore, while the standard tones elicited distinct P1-N1-P2-N2-P3 waveforms, deviant tones elicited additional mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and reorienting negativity (RON) responses, indexing brain events associated with involuntary attention shifting. While haloperidol did not affect the source loci of the responses of magnetic N1 and MMN, the amplitude of the electric P3a and that of RON were significantly reduced and the latency of magnetic RON were delayed following haloperidol administration. Conclusions: The present results suggest that dopamine modulates involuntary attention shifting to task-irrelevant deviant events. It appears that dopamine may disrupt the subsequent re-orienting efforts to the relevant task after distraction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysis of evoked potentials in EEG recordings is important approach to reveal the relation between brain functions and structures. In this paper, we present a new approach for evoked potentials extraction and localization, suggesting to explore the high order statistics and temporal structures of the evoked potentials. Efficient learning algorithm is developed for training the demixing model and temporal filters. Theoretic analysis and computer simulations are given to show performance and efficiency of the proposed temporal independent component analysis.

Recently, it has been shown that this NoGo anteriorization effect during a response control paradigm can be measured quantitatively with the electrophysiologic centroid method. The objective of the current study, therefore, was to determine the long-term reliability of the topographic measures of cognitive response control (i.e., location of the Go and the NoGo centroid and the NoGo anteriorization). For this purpose, a 21-channel EEG was recorded twice from 13 healthy volunteers during their execution of a cued CPT (O-X version). The time interval between test and retest was 2.74 years (range, 2.41 to 2.97 years). Statistical analysis of the event-related Go and NoGo potentials revealed an excellent test-retest reliability, as expressed by Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients of more than 0.85 (P less than or equal to 0.0005) and intraclass correlation coefficients of more than 0.90 (P less than or equal to 0.0005) for all three topographic measures. These results indicate that these electrophysiologic parameters present with superior long-term reliability and that they may be applied as electrophysiologic trait markers of response control mechanisms in the human brain.

Methods: EEG was recorded in 7 healthy right-handed men using a 59-channel whole-head EEG system while subjects performed self-paced movements. Results: The amplitude of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) was greater over the central midline area and smaller over the contralateral sensorimotor hand area in shoulder than in finger movements. The maximal alpha- and beta-ERD was localized at parietal electrodes in shoulder movements and over the left and right sensorimotor hand area in finger movements. The post-movement beta-ERS was greater in shoulder than in finger movements, especially at the electrode located 3.5 cm left of the central midline electrode, A significant correlation between the slope of the terminal portion of the BP (negative slope) and amplitude of the post-movement beta-synchronization was observed in shoulder but not in finger movements. Conclusions: Enhancement of BP over the central midline electrode suggests increased activation of the supplementary motor area in proximal movements. The spatial distribution of the alpha- and beta-ERD and of the post-movement beta-ERS shows topographic differences which may refer to the somatotopic organization of the:primary sensorimotor cortex with shoulder representation medial to hand and fingers. The correlation between the negative slope and the post-movement beta-ERS in proximal movements supports the view that the brid post-movement inhibition over the motor cortical area is related to the pre-movement activation of that area.

It is thus difficult, especially if brainstem functions are intact, to give early, accurate prognostic information on comatose patients. Neurochemical tests and imaging have not been validated and have significant limitations. Electrophysiologic investigations provide a window into cerebral function and are tested, clinically useful, safe, available, and inexpensive. Persistent abnormalities of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials reliably indicate the likelihood permanent vegetative state or death. Conversely, the presence of "cognitive" event-related brain potentials (e.g., P300 and mismatch negativity) reflects the functional integrity of higher-level information processing and, therefore, the likelihood of capacity for cognition. A combined clinical and electrophysiologic approach provides optimal prediction of outcome and level of disability.

Twenty-six patients were examined where migraine was diagnosed (5 with aura and 21 without aura), and as a control group 27 healthy volunteers. The patients were examined during the intervals between attacks, at least 72 hours after an attack. In addition to standard pattern-reversal VEPs the authors used also two variants of motion-onset VEPs and cognitive stimulation. Visually evoked cognitive potentials were tested either by using the "oddball" paradigm - differentiation of coherent and non-coherent motion signalized by pressing a button or by so-called emotional passive event-related potentials were involved (passive follow up of alternate projection of pictures of the normal and electronically destroyed face in a pseudorandom order). The investigation revealed a normal reaction of the patients during stimulation of primary (striate) and associative extrastriate areas of the visual cerebral cortex (pattern reversal and motion-onset VEPs resp.). On examination of cognitive potentials significant changes were found only when so-called passive cognitive potentials were used, i.e. the reactions of the migraine patients did not have a smaller amplitude of the reaction to frequent (non-target) stimuli as compared with rare (target) stimuli, as it is usually the case in cognitive evoked potentials. The authors evaluated also the frequency spectrum of the EEG at rest, the parameters of which were normal in patients with migraine. The same reaction to a rare and frequent stimulus in the patients can be interpreted as defective inhibition of attention (habituation) during stimulation by an insignificant stimulus in a migrainous brain which supports some already existing data of this type recorded in the literature.

These effects in some cases showed aspects of a probable diaschisis-like phenomenon, due to resections of extensive frontal association cortex or of primary and secondary sensory parieto-temporal areas damaged by differing pathological processes. Using a standard CNV paradigm, 21/19 EEG electrodes connected with three different references, and scalp-topographic bidimensional mapping analysis, the S1 auditory binaural/monaural clicks N1a,b,c, P2, N2, P3 and CNV waves were recorded in 10 normal subjects and 11 patients. Nine of the latter had been submitted to unilateral frontal dorsolateral cortex ablation, one to bihemispheric dorsomedial cortex ablation, and one to unilateral ablation of sensory parieto-temporal cortex and underlying white matter, verified through CT/MRI examinations. No true S1ERP/CNV components were recordable over the ablated cortical areas, whereas normal ERP/CNV complexes were observable on the intact hemispheres. In five patients, four of whom with frontocortical ablations, the S1 ERP/CNV complexes appeared severely diminished or disrupted, in two cases in a slow, partially-reversible manner, also in the neuroradiologically normal ipsilateral functionally-connected post-rolandic sensory and association areas. Similar deactivation of some ERP components was observed in reverse on the unilateral dorsolateral frontocortical region in the fifth patient with parieto-temporal cortex ablation. Even when they are partially reversible, these ipsilateral remote ERP changes in apparently intact brain regions, due to ablations of functionally-interconnected cortical formations, probably reflect cortical deactivation or simply dysfacilitation deriving from functional unilateral diaschisis. If these changes are instead irreversible they may probably be interpreted as transneuronal degeneration phenomena, though they are not at present easy to document either neuroradiologically or electroclinically.

J	Luu, P; Tucker, DM				Luu, P; Tucker, DM			Regulating action: alternating activation of midline frontal and motor cortical networks	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; supplementary motor area; error-related negativity; motor potentials; event-related potentials; theta; oscillations	REPETITIVE FINGER MOVEMENTS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-DETECTION; BASAL GANGLIA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; THETA RHYTHM; PERFORMANCE; HUMANS	Objectives: Focal electrical fields recorded over the midline prefrontal cortex have been found to index rapid evaluative decisions, including the recognition of having made an error in a speeded response task. The nature of these electrical fields and how they are related to cortical areas involved in response execution remains to be clarified. Methods: As subjects performed a speeded response task the EEG was recorded with a 128-channel sensor array. By filtering out the large slow waves of the event-related potential, we found that the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) arises from a midline frontal oscillation that alternates with oscillations over lateral sensorimotor cortex. Electrical source analyses were used to determine the brain sources involved in the generation of these oscillations. Results: The results show that the midline and lateral oscillations have a period of about 200 ms (theta), and they are present for both correct and error responses. When an error is made, the midline error oscillation is recruited strongly, and it becomes correlated with the motor oscillation. Source analyses localized the midline error oscillation to centromedial frontal cortex and the lateral oscillation to sensorimotor cortices. Conclusions: Because of the similarity between the midline oscillation observed in the present study and frontal midline theta, the nature of the Ne/ERN may be clarified by the frontal midline theta literature. The correlation between the midline and sensorimotor oscillations suggests a possible mechanism for how midline frontal evaluative and monitoring networks contribute to action regulation.

J	Stivelman, JC				Stivelman, JC			Benefits of anaemia treatment on cognitive function	NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Benefits of Early Anaemia Treatment in Patients with Renal Insufficiency	NOV 04, 1999	MIAMI, FL			anaemia; cognitive function; dialysis; haematocrit	DIALYSIS PATIENTS; IMPROVES BRAIN; ERYTHROPOIETIN; HEMODIALYSIS; INDEXES; UREMIA; RHUEPO	The role of anaemia in the pathogenesis of abnormal cognitive function in haemodialysis patients is only partly understood. Several contemporary studies have assessed cognitive function in haemodialysis patients using neuropsychological and neurophysiological tests, comparing the results obtained over a wide range of haematocrits before and after treatment with epoetin. Of the neurophysiological tests, which measure electrical impulses from the brain in the presence or absence of specific stimuli, the cognitive event-related potential (ERP) has been particularly useful in evaluating this issue. Changes in amplitude (increase) and latency (decrease) of a specific wave form (P300) seen in the ERP correlate with improved cognitive function in haemodialysis patients following initiation of dialysis therapy. Similar effects are also evident when haematocrit is increased. Marsh et al. (Kidney Int 1991; 39: 155-163) examined the effect of increasing haematocrit with epoetin therapy on the P300 amplitude and latency, and noted that after increasing haematocrit to 23.7-36% over 12 months with epoetin, P300 amplitude increased (P<0.025), and several neuropsychological test scores were significantly improved. Grimm et al. (Kidney Int 1990, 38: 480-486) found a significant decrease in P300 latency and statistically nonsignificant improvements in P300 amplitude when haematocrit was increased to 22.7-30.6%. Improvement in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and P300 latency has also been reported by others, including Sagales et al. (Kidney Int 1993; 44. 1109-1115). The effect of complete reversal of anaemia (haematocrits 31.6-42.9%) on cognitive function was recently revealed by Pickett et al. (Am J Kidney Dis 1999; 33: 1122-1130), who found improvement in several cognitive ERP manoeuvres and a significant decrease in EEG slowing (P<0.02) at higher haematocrits. Taken together, these various studies suggest that graded increments in haematocrit following epoetin therapy have a progressive effect on improving cognitive function in haemodialysis patients.

Scalp event related potentials elicited by auditory stimuli were recorded in 10 male subjects. Thirty auditory stimuli were presented binaurally over headphones to every subject with a duration of 1000 ms, each with a constant ISI of 1500 ms. No task relevance was given to the stimuli. Wave-forms were collected using a Pentium 100 computer. All analyses were carried out over the 30 trials. In each single trial event related potentials, latencies and amplitudes of N1-P2 components were analyzed separately for four frequency bands (0.3-70, 0.3-4, 4-7, 7-13 Hz). Trend effects were tested with linear-regression analyses (N1-P2 amplitude x stimuli number). We found that the amplitude from the first stimulus decreased reliably across trial blocks of the N1-P2 components and that it was directly affected by ISI. The relevance of these results for the habituation is discussed.

The present study aims to identify topographic location of the underlying neural generators, and correlate their activities with the subsequent memory effect, using electrophysiological neuroimaging of the event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from 11 healthy subjects participating in word encoding tasks. Cortical potentials were imaged noninvasively from scalp ERPs. Different levels of brain activation were found in the left inferior prefrontal, left temporal and left parietal lobes with different latencies after onset of event. It is concluded that these regions work jointly across both spatial and temporal domains to promote verbal memory formation.

We presented probe beats on seven positions within a test bar. Two bars of either a duple- or triple meter rhythm preceded probe beats. We hypothesised that sequential processing would lead to meter effects at the 1/3 and 1/2 bar positions, whereas hierarchical processing would lead to context effects on the 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 bar positions. We found that metric contexts affected behavioural ratings. This effect was more pronounced for rhythmic experts. In addition, both the AEP P3a and P3b component could be identified. Though metric context affected the P3a amplitudes, group effects were less clear. We found that the AEP P3a component is sensitive to violation of temporal expectancies. In addition, behavioural data and P3a correlation coefficients (CCs) suggest that temporal patterns are processed sequentially in nonmusicians but are processed in a hierarchical way in rhythmic experts.

Nineteen-channel vigilance-controlled EEG recordings were carried out in 20 healthy subjects before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug intake. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Key Institute for Brain-Mind Research, software: http://www.keyinst.unizh.ch) was computed from spectrally analyzed EEG data, and differences between drug- and placebo-induced changes were displayed as statistical parametric maps. Data were registered to the Talairach-Tournoux human brain atlas available as a digitized MRI (McConnell Brain Imaging Centre: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca). At the pharmacodynamic peak (Ist hour), buspirone increased theta and decreased fast alpha and beta sources. Areas of theta increase were mainly the left temporo-occipito-parietal and left prefrontal cortices, which is consistent with PET studies on buspirone-induced decreases in regional cerebral blood flow and fenfluramine-induced serotonin activation demonstrated by changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. In later hours (8th hour) with lower buspirone plasma levels, delta, theta, slow alpha and fast beta decreased, predominantly in the prefrontal and anterior limbic lobe. Whereas the results of the Ist hour speak for a slight CNS sedation (more in the sense of relaxation), those obtained in the 8th hour indicate activation. Thus, LORETA may provide useful and direct information on drug-induced changes in central nervous system function in man. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a preliminary experiment, intense CO2 laser stimuli were delivered to the hand dorsum of five volunteers. The average amplitude of EEG epochs was estimated in the time-frequency (TF) domain using the continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMT). The result was used as a TF filter enhancing Adelta-nociceptor induced EEG responses. In a second experiment, eight other subjects were delivered laser stimuli with six intensities. The CMT of each EEG epoch was Computed. After applying the TF filter, amplitudes within a predefined interval were summed. Whether this sum predicted the occurrence of Adelta-nociceptor activation was tested using the reaction-time to discriminate between Adelta- or C-fibre mediated detection. Results showed that this method accurately identified single-trial EEG responses to Adelta-nociceptor activation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The changes in EEG oscillations were measured in predefined frequency bands (8-10, 10-12, 12-20, and 20-30 Hz) by using the event-related desynchronization technique. Movements of the affected and unaffected hand in patients with writer's cramp showed significantly less reduction in 20- to 30-Hz power compared with controls. The differences in movement-related EEG power decline were apparent over the contralateral central and midline regions before and after electromyographic onset. Because EEG beta rhythm in the sensorimotor region likely emanates from the motor cortex and is related to ongoing muscle activity, this abnormality could be a manifestation of the abnormal motor command at the cortical level.

In this study, the influence of the ability to detect one's heartbeats based on the HEP was examined. According to their results in a heartbeat perception task, subjects were classified as good (n = 18) or poor (n = 26) heartbeat perceivers. EEG, FOG, and ECG were recorded while participants attended to their heartbeats. The R-wave of the ECG served as a trigger for EEG averaging. In the latency range of 250-350 ms after the ECG R-wave, the HEP amplitude at the right central location was significantly higher in good heartbeat perceivers. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the heartbeat perception score and the mean HEP amplitude. Our results confirm that the accuracy of heartbeat perception is reflected in the amplitude of the HEP.

J	Gallinat, J; Winterer, G; Herrmann, CS; Senkowski, D				Gallinat, J; Winterer, G; Herrmann, CS; Senkowski, D			Reduced oscillatory gamma-band responses in unmedicated schizophrenic patients indicate impaired frontal network processing	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; gamma; EEG; event-related potential; frontal lobe; binding	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL PARADIGM; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; GENETIC RISK; FRONTOTEMPORAL CONNECTIVITY; TEMPORAL BINDING; PARIETAL CORTEX; REACTION-TIME; EEG ACTIVITY	Objective: Integration of sensory information by cortical network binding appears to be crucially involved in target detection. Studies in schizophrenia using functional and diffusion tensor neuroimaging, event-related potentials and EEG coherence indicate an impairment of cortical network coupling in this disorder. Previous electrophysiological investigations in animals and humans suggested that gamma activity (oscillations at around 40 Hz) is essential for cortical network binding. Studies in medicated schizophrenia provide evidence for a reduced gamma activity in the context of auditory stimulus processing. This is the first investigation of oscillatory activations in the gamma-band in an auditory oddball paradigm in unmedicated schizophrenic patients. Methods: EEG gamma-band responses (GBRs) of 15 drug-free schizophrenic patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were compared. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the calculation of oscillatory GBRs. Results: In response to standard stimuli, early evoked GBRs (20-100 ms), which are supposed to reflect auditory cortex activation, did not show significant group differences. However, schizophrenic patients showed reduced evoked GBRs in a late latency range (220-350 ms), particularly after target stimuli. This deficit occurred over right frontal scalp regions. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between oscillatory GBRs and clinical parameters in schizophrenic patients. Conclusions: The results are consistent with a relative preserved stimulus processing in the auditory cortex as reflected by the early GBR. The reduced late GBR is compatible with an abnormal interaction within a frontal lobe network, as was postulated by previous neuroimaging studies. Significance: The present study provides evidence for disturbed processing within frontal cortical regions in unmedicated schizophrenic patients as indicated by reduced evoked EEG GBRs.

By using a novel method, the application of a low intensity CO2 laser beam to a tiny area of skin using a very thin aluminum plate with numerous tiny holes as a spatial filter, we succeeded in selectively stimulating unmyelinated C fibers of the skin in humans, and could record consistent and clear brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The conduction velocity (CV) of the C fibers of the peripheral nerve and spinal cord, probably spinothalamic tract (STT), is approximately 1-4 m/s, which is significantly slower than that of Adelta (approximately 10-15 m/s) and Abeta fibers (approximately 50-70 m/s). This method should be very useful for clinical application. Following C fiber stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII) are simultaneously activated in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation, and then, SII in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation is activated. These early responses are easily detected by MEG. Then, probably limbic systems such as insula and cingulate cortex are activated, and those activities reflected in EEG components. Investigations of the cortical processing in pain perception including both first and second pain should provide a better understanding of pain perception and, therefore, contribute to pain relief in clinical medicine.

Patients learn to regulate slow cortical potentials (SCPs) voluntarily with feedback training to select letters. This study reports the comparison of different methods of electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis to improve spelling accuracy with the TTD on a data set of 6650 trials of a severely paralyzed patient. Methods: Selections of letters occurred by exceeding a certain SCP amplitude threshold. To enhance the patient's control of an additional event-related cortical potential, a filter with two filter characteristics ('mixed filter') was developed and applied on-line. To improve performance off-line the criterion for threshold-related decisions was varied. Different types of discriminant analysis were applied to the EEG data set as well as on wavelet transformed EEG data. Results: The mixed filter condition increased the patients' performance on-line compared to the SCP filter alone. A threshold, based on the ratio between required selections and rejections, resulted in a further improvement off-line. Discriminant analysis of both time-series SCP data and wavelet transformed data increased the patient's correct response rate off-line. Conclusions: It is possible to communicate with event-related potentials using the mixed filter feedback method. As wavelet transformed data cannot be fed back on-line before the end of a trial, they are applicable only if immediate feedback is not necessary for a brain-computer interface (BCI). For future BCIs, wavelet transformed data should serve for BCIs without immediate feedback. A stepwise wavelet transformation would even allow immediate feedback.

Methods Nineteen intensive care unit patients received a propofol infusion in accordance with a sedation protocol. The EEG signal and the ERPs were measured at the frontal region (Fz) and central region (Cz), both during propofol sedation and after cessation of infusion when the sedative effects had subsided. The EEG signal was subjected to power spectral estimation, and the total root mean squared power and spectral edge frequency 95% were computed. For ERPs, we used an oddball paradigm to obtain the N100 and the mismatch negativity components. Results Despite considerable individual variability, the root mean squared power at Cz and Fz ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively) and the amplitude of the N100 component in response to the standard stimulus at Fz ( P = 0.022) increased significantly after interruption to sedation. The amplitude of the N100 component ( at Cz and Fz) was the only parameter that differed between sedation levels during propofol sedation ( deep versus moderate versus light sedation: P = 0.016 and P = 0.008 for Cz and Fz, respectively). None of the computed parameters correlated with duration of propofol infusion. Conclusion Our findings suggest that use of ERPs, especially the N100 potential, may help to differentiate between levels of sedation. Thus, they may represent a useful complement to clinical sedation scales in the monitoring of sedation status over time in a heterogeneous group of neurologically intact intensive care patients.

Here two simple delayed choice reaction time tasks were used to unveil event-related desynchronization (ERD) of theta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (6-12 Hz) electroencephalographic rhythms across normal aging. In the first condition, a cue stimulus (one bit) was memorized along a brief delay period (3.5-5.5 s). The explicit demand was visuo-spatial, but the retention could be also based on phonological and somatomotor coding. In the second condition, the cue stimulus remained available along the delay period. Correct performances were higher than 95% in both groups and tasks, although they were significantly better in young than elderly subjects (P < 0.03). During the delay period, theta and alpha ERD accompanying correct responses were recognized in the two groups, the alpha ERD being stronger and prolonged during the memory than non-memory task. On the other hand, the fronto-parietal theta and parietal alpha ERD were stronger in young than elderly subjects during both tasks. Notably, the frontal alpha ERD was negligible in elderly subjects. In conclusion, the present simple tasks unveiled in elderly compared to young subjects (i) a weaker involvement of (para)hippocampal-cortical circuits as revealed by theta ERD and (ii) a weaker involvement of "executive" thalamo-cortical circuits as revealed by frontal alpha ERD. These effects might worsen behavioral performances to the simple cognitive tasks with age. The present protocol is promising for the neuroimaging study of pathological aging. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Nonhypnotic pain research suggests that in terms of temporal processing early EEG components are more sensory in nature, and later components are of a more emotional or evaluative nature. In the present work, the authors report that the influence of hypnosis is less on the EEG components associated with the initial sensory experience itself and more on the later components that carry with them rich cognitive/emotional information. The research reviewed in this paper clearly suggests an inhibitory process for the high susceptible individuals associated with the hypnotic analgesia.

To determine the effect of neuroleptic challenge on transient auditory evoked 40-Hz response, simultaneous measurement of 122-channel magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was used. Either 2 mg of dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist haloperidol or a placebo was administered orally to 11 healthy subjects in a double-blind randomized crossover design in two separate sessions. The subjects attended to tones presented to one ear and ignored those presented to the other ear. Haloperidol significantly suppressed the transient 40-Hz electric response to the attended stimuli, while no significant effect was observed in the electric responses to the unattended tones or in the magnetic responses. The present result suggests that dopamine Dp receptors modulate selective attention. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland ltd.

Recordings of the change-specific mismatch negativity component of event-related brain potentials have shown that temporally and spectrally complex sounds as well as their relations are automatically processed by human auditory cortex. Furthermore, recent magnetoencephalographic and positron emission topographic investigations indicate that this processing differs between phonetic and musical sounds within and between the cerebral hemispheres. These data thus suggest that despite the focus of listeners' conscious attention, relatively complex sound phenomena can be encoded by neural mechanisms that are specialized for musical sounds.

The techniques include measurements of spectral power, interelectrode coherence, event-related potential components such as the P300, slow potentials, and the method of cognitive inference. The advantages offered by EEG-based approaches lies in their spatiotemporal resolution (potentially 1 mm and less than 1 millisecond, respectively) and the potential to preserve ecological validity, i.e., to obtain measurements of cortical function under the same conditions that the task is normally performed. These studies indicate that activity is reduced in specific regions of the cerebral cortex of experts relative to that observed in novices. These changes occur over time as a result of practice. The authors argue that such cortical change results in less attentional demand and less cognitive interference with motor planning and execution. The findings attest to the plasticity of the central nervous system when one is engaged in goal-directed learning, and hold implications for understanding how the nervous system acquires voluntary skills, whether in the context of the training of an athlete or the rehabilitation of a patient who has lost motor skills due to a disease of the nervous system.

Methods: In an experimental study (15 subjects) we compared auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to bimodal evoked potentials (BEPs; simultaneous auditory and visual stimulation). BEPs were assumed to be brain responses to complex stimuli as a marker for intermodal associative functioning. Results: Frequency domain analysis of these EPs showed marked theta-range components in response to bimodal stimulation. These theta components could not be explained by linear addition of the unimodal responses in the time domain. Considering topography the increased theta-response showed a remarkable frontality in proximity to multimodal association cortices. Referring to methodology we try to demonstrate that, even if various behavioral correlates of brain oscillations exist, common patterns can be extracted by means of a systems-theoretical approach. Conclusions: Serving as an example of functionally relevant brain oscillations, theta responses could be interpreted as an indicator of associative information processing.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings during performance of the tasks revealed similar event-related potentials during the presentation of faces at 120 and 170 ms after stimulus onset in both of the tasks but significant differences in amplitudes between 180 and 300 ms. Whereas faces in the emotion recognition task produced high amplitudes in that latency range, potentials in response to faces in the blurred object condition were virtually absent. These data point to the assumption that decoding of facial expressions starts early in the brain and might be processed separately from basic stages of face perception.

(2001) in a PET study investigating the cerebral areas involved in the retrieval of face-name associations. Three learning sessions served to familiarize the participants with 24 face-name associations grouped in 12 male/female couples. During EEG recording, participants were confronted with four experimental conditions, requiring the retrieval of previously learned couples on the basis of the presentation of name-name (NN), face-face (FF), name-face (NF), or face-name (FN) pairs of stimuli. The main analysis of this experiment consisted in the subtraction of the nonmixed conditions (NN and FF) from the mixed conditions (NF and FN). It revealed two main ERP components: a negative wave peaking at left parieto-occipital sites around 285 ins and its positive counterpart recorded at left centro-frontal electrodes around 300ms. Moreover, a dipole modeling using three dipoles whose localization corresponded to the three cerebral areas observed in the PET study (left inferior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe) explained more than 90% of the variance of the results. The complementarity between anatomical and neurophysiological techniques allowed us to discuss the temporal course of these cerebral activities and to propose an interactive and original anatomo-temporal model of the retrieval of face-name associations.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is an effective method for removing artifacts and separating sources of the brain signals from these recordings. A similar approach is proving useful for analyzing functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) data. In this paper, we outline the assumptions underlying ICA and demonstrate its application to a variety of electrical and hemodynamic recordings from the human brain.

Ambiguous figures provide a fascinating exception: On prolonged inspection. the "Necker cube" undergoes a sudden, unavoidable reversal of its perceived front-back orientation. What happens in the brain when spontaneously switching between these equally likely interpretations? Does neural processing differ between an endogenously perceived reversal of a physically unchanged ambiguous stimulus and an exogenously caused reversal of an unambiguous stimulus? A refined EEG paradigm to measure such endogenous events uncovered an early electrophysiological correlate of this spontaneous reversal, a negativity beginning at 160 ms. Comparing across nine electrode locations suggests that this component originates in early visual areas. An EEG component of similar shape and scalp distribution, but 50 ms earlier, was evoked by an external reversal of unambiguous figures. Perceptual disambiguation seems to be accomplished by the same structures that represent objects per se, and to occur early in the visual stream. This suggests that low-level mechanisms play a crucial role in resolving perceptual ambiguity.

At 340 ins a lateralised positivity (P340) is linked to the tonic accent of the word. At 400 ins a negative wave (N400) reaches its peak during semantic processing. These recent methods were applied to patients suffering from different kinds of aphasia. Two young patients suffering from expressive aphasia failed to show the P340. The N400 appeared of long latency and long duration in a patient. suffering from primary progressive aphasia (PPS). Another patient suffering from the same impairment lacked that potential. The results indicate the utility of event related potentials in studying language processing. Digitized spoken words appear to be an appropriate tool, because they permit the study of EEG changes on a millisecond-to-millisecond basis.

In developing our BCI, our goal was to minimize the need for subject training and to impose the major learning load on the computer. To this end, we use behavioral paradigms that exploit single-trial EEG potentials preceding voluntary finger movements. Here, we report recent results on the basic physiology of such premovement event-related potentials (ERP). 1) We predict the laterality of imminent left- versus right-hand finger movements in a natural keyboard typing condition and demonstrate that a single-trial classification based on the lateralized Bereitschaftspotential (BP) achieves good accuracies even at a pace as fast as 2 taps/s. Results for four out of eight subjects reached a peak information transfer rate of more than 15 b/min; the four other subjects reached 6-10 b/min. 2) We detect cerebral error potentials from single false-response trials in a forced-choice task, reflecting the subject's recognition of an erroneous response. Based on a specifically tailored classification procedure that limits the rate of false positives at, e.g., 2%, the algorithm manages to detect 85% of error trials in seven out of eight subjects. Thus, concatenating a primary single-trial BP-paradigm involving finger classification feedback with such secondary error detection could serve as an efficient online confirmation/correction tool for improvement of bit rates in a future BCI setting. As the present variant of the Berlin BCI is designed to achieve fast classifications in normally behaving subjects, it opens a new perspective for assistance of action control in time-critical behavioral contexts; the potential transfer to paralyzed patients will require further study.

The present study investigated whether this is related to the peripheral or central nervous nociceptive system. EEG-derived potentials and the negative mucosal potential (NMP) from the respiratory epithelium were recorded in response to painful intranasal stimulation with gaseous CO2. Differences between groups (12 RA patients, 12 controls) were found when stimuli were presented at short intervals. While the NMP did not differ between groups, patients had larger cortical responses to the first stimuli of a series of painful stimuli. This may indicate that in RA central nervous changes of nociceptive processing are present. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We study its performance in simulated data as well as in visual and auditory ERPs. For the simulated data, the method gives a significantly better reconstruction of the single-trial event-related responses in comparison with the original data and also in comparison with a reconstruction based on conventional Wiener filtering. Moreover, with wavelet denoising we obtain a significantly better estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of the simulated ERPs. For the real data, the method clearly improves the visualization of both visual and auditory single-trial ERPs. This allows the calculation of better averages as well as the study of systematic or unsystematic variations between trials. Since the method is fast and parameter free, it could complement the conventional analysis of ERPs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multi-modal integration is one of advantaged approach tp clarify in both physiological behavior and metabolic functions in the human brain. In this paper, the potentials' of non-linear analysis based EEG acquisition was referred for the basic idea for multi-modal integration. Non-linear analysis in term of "1/ffluctuations" using zero-crossing method as for the self organized criticality detection in time is able to fit cross over the different modality in the temporal resolution. And also this method will show the brain dynamics in term of 4D- brain mapping.

Fifteen subjects performed a primed lexical decision task with verb/verb and noun/noun pairs. The relatedness between prime and target items was varied in three steps (unrelated, moderately, and strongly related) and the EEG was recorded from 124 scalp electrodes. The topography of cortical sources of the N400 effect was evaluated by standardized differences scores and by cortical current source estimates which were constrained by the individual MRI-determined cortex anatomy. A behavioral priming effect and a substantial N400 effect was found for both word categories. However, the topography of the grand average N400 effect of verbs and nouns did not differ, neither for raw nor for standardized amplitudes. Cortical current source estimates of the N400 effect revealed a very broad and scattered distribution of active locations with pronounced interindividual differences. Cortical current source estimates obtained with the L1-norm and L2-norm model, respectively, differed in the distribution of sources over the cortex but converged on the same "hot spots." The data give no indication that the N400 effect is generated by word category-specific networks which have a different topography. The marked individual differences are discussed with respect to the involved precesses and the current source estimation procedures. Hum. Brain Mapping 11:178-192, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

To clarify the role of gender differences in the MMN, we compared the amplitude, latency, and topography of tonal and phonetic MMN between healthy males and females, using a high-density (128 channel) electroencephalography montage. The MMN was evaluated in 18 right-handed male and ten age-matched female adults. The MMN in response to a duration change of pure tone and that in response to a phonetic change (Japanese vowel /a/ versus /o/ with 150-ms duration) were recorded. There were no significant differences in amplitude, latency, or laterality for either tonal or phonetic MMN between male and female subjects, This lack of evidence for effects of gender on MMN in response to duration change of tones or that in response to changes of phonemes with a short duration in normal adults may be of relevance to a growing number of researchers who are studying the MMN in healthy individuals and various clinical groups, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We also examined the P50, N100, and P200-waves, elicited during the same task. Methods: We investigated 42 schizophrenic patients, 62 of their healthy siblings, and 34 unrelated normal control subjects with a standard auditory oddball paradigm and 16 electroencephalogram electrodes. Amplitudes and latencies of the ERPs P50, N100, P200, and P300 were topographically analyzed. Results: In the patients, P300 amplitude was significantly decreased in the range of 54%-58% over the left parietotemporal area. Siblings did not show decreased P300 amplitudes when compared with normal subjects. P300 latencies were unchanged in both groups. No significant group differences were observed for the other event-related potentials. Conclusions: In line with previous studies, the P300 amplitude in schizophrenic patients was decreased over the left temporoparietal area; however, we found no evidence for a genetic trait effect in the event-related potential abnormality. Possible reasons for these largely negative findings are discussed. Biol Psychiatry 2001; 50:407-417 (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Compared to younger adults, high and moderate active older adults exhibited increased event-related potentials component P3 amplitude for the incompatible condition at the frontal electrode site. For the neutral condition, only low active older adults exhibited decreased amplitude at the central-parietal site, compared to younger adults. P3 latency revealed the longest latencies for low active older adults, followed by moderate active, high active, and younger adults, respectively. Reaction time (RT) data revealed that younger adults exhibited faster RT compared to all three older groups. Results suggest that physical activity may improve executive control function in older adults by affecting the distribution of P3 amplitude, which has been related to memory and attentional processes, and by decreasing P3 latency, which relates to the speed of cognitive processing.

We studied the categorical matching of familiar faces and compared it to the matching of abstract patterns. Nineteen healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each trial began with one of the two cues (S1) followed by consecutive pictures (S2 and S3). Each picture was a photograph of a familiar face with a superimposed abstract dot pattern. One cue directed attention to compare faces and another to compare patterns. Participants were asked to respond by pressing different buttons. A 128-channel EEG was recorded. Analysis was done for the 600-ms window from the S3 onset, for correct performance. The face comparison was better and faster than the pattern comparison. In the Face task, match/mismatch differences were local in 200-250 ms and large and widespread in 270-550 ms. In the Pattern task, differences were found in 30-270 ms, while on longer latencies they were lesser than those in the Face task. Priming was observed in the Face task as shorter reaction times and reduced N400-like components (both in prefrontal and parietal regions) for the same items as compared to the different ones. In the Pattern task, the results were more controversial. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ART algorithms specifically designed to compensate for noisy data perform similarly with TRT, but require the prior knowledge of the characteristic of the noise affecting the data, The empirical composite residual and smoothing operator (CRESO) criterion provides an approximation to the optimal regularization parameter of the TRT, without requiring any prior knowledge about the noise in measured potentials, Therefore, when the CRESO criterion is successful in providing a t value, TRT may be used in real EEG data inversions for the creation of brain electrical activity tomographic images.

The recordings were obtained using an auditory oddball paradigm, during pain and no-pain conditions. Group eigenfunctions were calculated from the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses of twelve subjects. The individual data for pain and no-pain conditions, respectively, were fitted with these group eigenfunctions across the conditions. In seven of the twelve subjects, the resulting fitting error was larger when pain eigenfunctions were fitted to control data rather than to pain data. This suggests that spatial features of the potential maps might be used as a means for differentiating between pain and no-pain conditions.

The EEG may therefore be a sensitive marker of 5-HT function in bipolar disorder. We examined the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) on EEG activity in bipolar patients. Methods: Fourteen patients with DSM IV Bipolar 1 disorder participated in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-order crossover study. Following ATD quantitative power spectrum brain mapping and measurement of auditory evoked potentials were carried out. Results: ATD produced a significant fall in the amplitude of N1P2 and P-300 components of the auditory evoked potential, but no significant changes in the power spectrum. There was an 83% reduction in plasma tryptophan after the depleting but not the control drink. Limitations: The effect of ATD on brain 5-HT levels was not directly measured. The number of patients is relatively small. The control condition may alter these electrophysiological measures. Conclusions: ATD attenuates auditory evoked potentials in bipolar disorder with the distribution of this effect being towards the front of the brain. These changes are not related to any change in mood. This is a potential trait marker of bipolar disorder, however there needs to be further exploration of this paradigm in controls and other patient groups. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ERP in an auditory oddball task and five min of the resting spontaneous EEG were recorded at P4 site in 16 early AD patients and 16 age-matched controls. EEG and ERP were analyzed to compute their 28 statistical and 2 nonlinear features as well as 88 spectral features, to make a feature pool. The combined GA/ANN was applied to find the minimal set of the dominant features that are most efficient to classify two groups automatically from the feature pool. The effective 35 features were found and used as inputs of artificial neural network. The recognition rate of ANN fed by these input was 81.9% for untrained data set. These results suggest that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for early detection of AD and that single channel EEG data might be enough to recognize AD. This approach could be extended to a reliable classification system using EEG recording that can discriminate between groups.

LORETA, using a realistic head model of the boundary element method derived from the individual anatomy, estimated the current density maps from the scalp topography of the 128-channel EEG. From the current density maps that covered the whole cortical gray matter (up to 20,000 points), volumetric current density images were reconstructed. Intensity normalization of the smoothed current density images was used to reduce the confounding effect of subject specific global activity. After transforming each image into a standard stereotaxic space, we carried out statistical parametric mapping of the normalized current density images. We applied this method to the source localization of MMN in schizophrenia. The MMN generators, produced by a deviant tone of 1,200 Hz (5%% of 1,600 trials) under the standard tone of 1,000 Hz, 80 dB binaural stimuli with 300 msec of inter-stimulus interval, were measured in 14 right-handed schizophrenic subjects and 14 age-, gender-, and handedness-matched controls. We found that the schizophrenic group exhibited significant current density reductions of MMN in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus (P < 0.0005). This study is the first voxel-by-voxel statistical mapping of current density using individual MRI and high-density EEG. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In past decades, various qEEG methods have been extensively studied. This article provides a detailed review of the advances in this field. qEEG methods are generally classified into linear and nonlinear approaches. The traditional qEEG approach is based on spectrum analysis, which hypothesizes that the EEG is a stationary process. EEG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear, especially in some pathological conditions. Various time-frequency representations and time-dependent measures have been proposed to address those transient and irregular events in EEG. With regard to the nonlinearity of EEG, higher order statistics and chaotic measures have been put forward. In characterizing the interactions across the cerebral cortex, an information theory-based measure such as mutual information is applied. To improve the spatial resolution, qEEG analysis has also been combined with medical imaging technology (e.g., CT, MR, and PET). With these advances, qEEG plays a very important role in basic research and clinical studies of brain injury, neurological disorders, epilepsy, sleep studies and consciousness, and brain function.

To assess the contribution of hand-motor preparation to overall CNV, three S1-S2 experiments were performed. Replicating earlier results that have been interpreted as demonstrating hand-motor preparation, experiment 1 showed that CNV gets larger centro-parietally under speed instruction. Experiments 2 and 3 compared preparation for hand responses (key-press) to preparation for ocular responses (saccades) varying the effector system either between blocks terp. 2) or between trials terp. 3) and also comparing these preparation situations to no preparation (exp. 3). Hand-motor preparation was reflected in CNV getting larger fronto-centrally, with this topography being significantly different from the effect in experiment 1. Thus, two different kinds of motor preparation appear to be reflected by CNV. One kind may consist of assembling and maintaining the stimulus-response links appropriate to the expected S2 patterns, the other is for activating the hand-motor area. These two motor contributions to CNV might reflect the two aspects of the parieto-frontal motor system.

Methods: The scalp topographies of the potentials associated with saccades and blinks were recorded in 60 subjects. The topographies were analyzed using both source components and attenuation factors, with each factor representing the fraction of the potential recorded in peri-ocular electrodes that contributes to the EEG recorded from a particular scalp location. Results: Blinks and upward saccades generated potentials with very different topographies. Left and right saccades and up and down saccades generated equal but inverted fields except at peri-ocular locations where subtle inequalities occurred. The potentials associated with lateral saccades were consistently larger in female subjects than in male subjects. Conclusions: The differences in the scalp topographies between blinks and vertical saccades can be explained by the different ways in which they are generated. Blink potentials are caused by the eyelids sliding down over the positively charged cornea, whereas saccade potentials are caused by changes in the orientation of the corneoretinal dipole. Any compensation procedure for ocular artifacts must take into account the topographic differences between blinks and upward saccades. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consistent with this finding, neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggest major functional distinctions within the human object recognition system, particularly in hemispheric advantage, between the processing of words (left), faces (right), and objects (bilateral). Given these observations, our aim was to (1) characterize the differential response properties of the N170 to pictures of faces, objects, and words across hemispheres; and (2) test whether an effect of inversion for highly familiar and monooriented nonface stimuli such as printed words can be observed at the level of the N170. Scalp EEG (53 channels) was recorded in 15 subjects performing an orientation decision task with pictures of faces, words, and cars presented upright or inverted. All three categories elicited at the same latency a robust N170 component associated with a positive counterpart at centro-frontal sites (vertex-positive potential, VPP). While there were minor amplitude differences at the level of the occipital medial PI between linguistic and nonlinguistic categories, scalp topographies and source analyses indicated strong hemispheric and orientation effects starting at the level of the N170, which was right lateralized for faces, smaller and bilateral for cars, and as large for printed words in the left hemisphere as for faces. The entire N170/VPP complex was accounted for by two dipolar sources located in the lateral inferior occipital cortex/posterior fusiform gyrus. These two locations were roughly equivalent across conditions but differed in strength and lateralization. Inversion delayed the N170 (and VPP) response for all categories, with an increasing delay for cars, words, and faces, respectively, as suggested by source modeling analysis. Such results show that early processes in object recognition respond to category-specific visual information, and are associated with strong lateralization and orientation bias.

Besides reaction time (RT) and accuracy, we measured response force and derived two measures from the event-related EEG potential to form an index for attentional orienting (posterior contralateral negativity: PCN) and the start of motor activation (the lateralized readiness potential: LRP). For the choice-by-location task and the Simon task, effects of time pressure were found on the response-locked LRP, but not on the onset of the PCN and the stimulus-locked LRP. Thus, strategy influences processing after the start of motor activation in choice tasks. A small effect of time pressure was found on the peak latency of the PCN in the Simon task, which suggests that time pressure may affect attentional orienting. In the simple response task, time pressure reduced the amplitude of the PCN. This finding suggests that strategy affects attentional orienting to stimuli when these stimuli are not highly relevant. Finally, the effect of time pressure on RT was much larger in the simple response task than in the other tasks, which may be ascribed to the possibility of preparing the required response in the simple response task.

In children, a clear occipito-temporal magnetic field activity (Plm, around 140 ms) was observed bilaterally, and the right Plm amplitude was increased when viewing a face with averted gaze compared with that when viewing a face with forward gaze. This effect was not observed in adults. Furthermore, the source for the right Plm in children in the gaze task was mainly located around the putative human MT/V5 area. These data suggest that the early occipito-temporal brain response observed as the Plm is a gaze-sensitive component in children.

We applied two quantifiers based on the Wavelet Transform to evaluate 20 seizures from eight consecutive patients admitted for video-EEG monitoring. We studied the relative wavelet energy and the wavelet entropy over time. In 16/20 events we found significant decremental activity in the relative wavelet energy associated with frequency band 0.8-3.2 Hz (delta activity) at the seizure onset, indicating that the seizure is dominated by medium frequency bands 3.2-12.8 Hz (theta and alpha bands). In 19/20 events the mean wavelet entropy presents lower values during the ictal period compared to the pre-ictal period, indicating that the associated dynamic is more ordered and simple. Thus the employed tools show good accuracy for detecting changes in the system dynamic. We conclude that this behavior could be induced by frequency tuning in the neuronal activity triggered by an hypothetic epileptic focus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Fourteen subjects were each presented with 600 auditory stimuli in a two-tone auditory oddball paradigm which required a button-press to targets, presented with 50% probability. Pre-stimulus alpha activity at Pt was assessed for each trial by digital filtering from 8 to 13 Hz, and alpha RMS amplitude was used to sort the ERPs at Pz and Cz. A direct relationship was obtained between component amplitudes at both Pz and Cz and pre-stimulus alpha level at Pt. Component latencies were strongly related to post-stimulus alpha peaks and troughs. These data confirm the intimate relationship between central nervous system activation, as evidenced by spontaneous EEG in the pre-stimulus period, and the ERP resulting from stimulus presentation.

Classical event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) calculation approach was utilized to extraxt ERD features from the raw scalp EEG signal. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used for feature extraction and applied on spatial, as well as temporal dimensions in two consecutive steps.

However, single-trial responses are buried into the more prominent ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, and thus advanced procedures are needed to obtain the activity only of the cortical generators that are activated by the experimental task under study. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of two methods at removing extraneous activity from single-trial EPs, namely, a recently-proposed iterative procedure based on independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet denoising, using simulated data and actual EP recordings from normal subjects, more specifically the auditory N100-P200 complex.

Sensorimotor expectancy processes to painful stimulation and motor go/no-go demands were indexed over primary sensorimotor and midline cortical areas by contingent negative variation (CNV). Before the sensorimotor interaction, CNV was observed over midline posterior and bilateral central areas. Early expectancy of painful stimulation and the go/no-go task induced an evident midline posterior CNV. During the late expectancy period, CNV extended to the right central area contralateral to the stimulation. These findings suggest a sequential activation of midline posterior and primary sensorimotor areas contralateral to the painful stimulation as a reflection of the enhanced nociceptive processes preceding painful sensorimotor interactions.

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, or delta responses to events are strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha, and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in relation with memory and integrative functions. A new 'neurons-brain' doctrine is also proposed to extend the neuron doctrine of Sherrington.

We hypothesized that the ERN only occurs with slips, that is unwilled action errors, but not if an error is committed willingly and intentionally. We investigated the occurrence of the ERN in a choice reaction time task that has been shown to produce an ERN and in an error simulation task where subjects had to fake errors while the EEG was recorded. We observed a loss of the ERN when errors were committed in willed actions but not in unwilled actions thus supporting the idea that the production of the ERN is tied to slips in unwilled actions but not mistakes in willed actions.

Sixty-six residential treatment program patients, characterized by a history of either cocaine (n = 37) or opioid (n = 29) dependence, and 18 non-drug-dependent community volunteers were evaluated. The task involved the execution of right- or left-hand button press responses that were either spatially-compatible or incompatible with a directional cue. Performance and event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were recorded throughout the task. Analyses revealed that button press responses were significantly slower and less accurate for all of the groups when spatial conflict was introduced. The amplitude of a slow EEG potential (SP), emerging approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset, showed the normal effect of spatial conflict for the opioid-dependent and non-dependent groups, but not for subjects in the cocaine-dependent group. Correlational analyses restricted to data from the cocaine-dependent group showed that this abnormal SP amplitude was not related to the quantity, frequency, or recency of their cocaine use; it only correlated with their comorbid alcohol use. The results of the major analyses, in combination with the results of a neuroanatomical localization algorithm applied to the SP data, suggest that comorbid alcohol use disrupts normal task-related activation of the anterior cingulate, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex. The present results have implications for the assessment of specific cognitive problems which could foster drug abuse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous event-related potential studies have documented error negativity or error-related negativity after incorrect responses, with a suggested source in the anterior cingulate cortex or supplementary motor area. We compared activation elicited by correct and incorrect trials using auditory and visual choice-reaction time tasks. Source areas showing different activation patterns in correct and error conditions were mainly located in sensorimotor areas, both ipsi- and contralateral to the response, suggesting that activation of sensorimotor circuits accompanies error processing. Additional activation at various other locations suggests a distributed network of brain regions active during error-related processing. Activation specific to incorrect trials tended to occur later in MEG than EEG data, possibly indicating that EEG and MEG detect different neural networks involved in error-related processes.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						theta oscillations; event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization; emotion; hemispheric asymmetry	DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; EMOTION; POTENTIALS; AROUSAL; EEG	Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) in the theta frequency band was measured while subjects viewed stimuli with differing emotional content (from the International Affective Picture System). A significant valence by hemisphere interaction emerged only in the anterior temporal regions, showing relatively greater right hemisphere ERS for negative and left hemisphere ERS for positive stimuli. In turn, in the posterior brain regions affectively valenced vs neutral stimuli prompted larger extent of ERS against the background of the overall right hemisphere dominance in theta synchronization. The findings document that valence discrimination is associated with the early (200-500 ms poststimulus) time-locked synchronized theta activity as well as hemispheric asymmetries in anterior-posterior direction.

However, in few studies has adult neurophysiologic function been assessed in rats exposed to ethanol during this key developmental period. In the current study, the effects of neonatal ethanol exposure on adult electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were examined in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to ethanol at 6.0 g/kg/day between postnatal days 4 through 9 by using an artificial-rearing procedure. Two control groups were used: a suckle control (SC) group and a gastrostomized control (GC) group. After reaching adulthood (i.e., at 3.5-4 months old), recording electrodes were implanted into the brain of each rat, so that EEG activity and auditory ERPs from the cortex and hippocampus could be assessed. Rats exposed to ethanol during the neonatal period were hyperactive as adults. Assessment of the EEG activity revealed that ethanol exposure increased peak frequency in the frontal cortical and parietal cortical 16-32 Hz frequency bands. Assessment of ERIs revealed that parietal cortical N1 amplitude was reduced in ethanol-exposed rats. Furthermore, parietal cortical N1 latency was increased in the GC group. These findings demonstrate that enhanced motor activity in rats exposed to ethanol during neonatal development occurs in combination with EEG indices of enhanced cortical and hippocampal arousal. Furthermore, a deficiency in cortical N1 amplitude indicates adult rats may have attention deficits. Overall, these results indicate that neonatal ethanol exposure has enduring neurobehavioral consequences, which persist into adulthood. This neurobehavioral profile in the rat is consistent with clinical observations of attention deficits and hyperactivity in children exposed to ethanol during prenatal development.

The present article reports an experiment similar to a pioneering study in this area, published in Phys. Lett. A 169 (1992) 134-144, which focused on tempo-induced transitions from syncopation to synchronization in a unimanual tapping task. In line with the original study, such transitions were found to be a consistent feature of the data and accompanying analyses of the MEG and EEG patterns revealed both in-phase and anti-phase frequency locking between the events, i.e., taps and acoustic stimuli and the corresponding brain activities. In contrast with the original study, however, no transitions were observed from the basic frequency to twice the basic frequency in the MEG and EEG recordings during synchronization. This discrepancy motivated a discussion of some potential problems in the spectral analysis of event-related encephalographic signals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We found that presentation of auditory stimuli produces bilateral activation in auditory cortex, thalamus, and caudate during both wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, the left parietal and, bilaterally, the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and the thalamus were less activated during NREM sleep compared to wakefulness. These areas may play a role in the further processing of sensory information required to achieve conscious perception during wakefulness. Finally, during NREM sleep, the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex were more activated by stimuli having special affective significance than by neutral stimuli. These data suggests that the sleeping brain can process auditory stimuli and detect meaningful events.

Subsequently, the patients were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized 3-arm trial phase - Climodien 2/3 [ estradiol valerate (EV) 2 mg + the progestin dienogest 3 mg] was compared with EV 2 mg and placebo - followed by an open-label phase in which all of them received Climodien 2/2 ( EV 2 mg + dienogest 2 mg). The double-blind and the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone oddball paradigm and electrical sources of standard N1 and P2 as well as target N2 and P300 components were estimated. In both patients and controls, LORETA revealed an activation of the superior temporal gyrus [ auditory cortex, Brodmann areas ( BA) 41, 42, 22] for all four components. For standard P2, an additional activation was observed medially parietally in the precuneus (BA 7, 5). For target N2, also a medial frontal source ( BA 9, 10, 32) was identified. Finally, for the target P300 component - in addition to the aforementioned sources - activations in the prefrontal cortex ( BA 9, 10, 46, 47), the inferior parietal cortex ( supramarginal gyrus, BA 40, 39) and the posterior cingulum ( BA 31) were found. Thus, patients and controls did not differ in the structural processes engaged in these fundamental aspects of information processing. However, patients demonstrated significantly reduced source strength for standard ERP components predominantly in the temporal lobe and for target components predominantly in the frontal lobe, indicating reduced energetic resources available for perceptual and cognitive demands of the discrimination task. While, as compared with placebo, estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP source strength, Climodien generally increased the impressed current density at the ERP peak latencies, predominantly in the temporal lobe, indicating an increased stimulus-induced cortical arousal in the primary and higher-order auditory cortex. Specifically, Climodien enhanced P300 source strength in the left middle temporal gyrus and in the left superior frontal gyrus, brain regions that on the one hand have been shown to be affected by hormone therapy in positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies and that on the other hand are among those critical for encoding and memory processes.

For example, while sensory gating differences frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia in the P50 paired-click gating paradigm are typically interpreted as reflecting group differences in generator source strength, differences in the latency and/or orientation of P50 generators may also account for observed group differences. The present study examined how variability in source strength, amplitude, or orientation affects the P50 component of the scalp-recorded ERR In Experiment 1, simulations examined the effect of changes in source strength, orientation, or latency in superior temporal gyrus (STG) dipoles on P50 recorded at Cz. In Experiment 2, within- and between-subject variability in left and right M50 STG dipole source strength, latency, and orientation was examined in 19 subjects. Given the frequently reported differences in left and right STG anatomy and function, substantial inter-subject and inter-hemi spheric variability in these parameters were expected, with important consequences for how P50 at Cz reflects brain activity from relevant generators. In Experiment 1, simulated P50 responses were computed from hypothetical left- and right-hemi sphere STG generators, with latency, amplitude, and orientation of the generators varied systematically. In Experiment 2, electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were collected from 19 subjects. Generators were modeled from the MEG data to assess and illustrate the generator variability evaluated parametrically in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, realistic amounts of variability in generator latency, amplitude, and orientation produced ERPs in which P50 scoring was compromised and interpretation complicated. In Experiment 2, significant within and between subject variability was observed in the left and right hemisphere STG M50 sources. Given the variability in M50 source strength, orientation, and amplitude observed here in nonpatient subjects, future studies should examine whether group differences in P50 gating ratios typically observed for patient vs. control groups are specific to a particular hemisphere, as well as whether the group differences are due to differences in dipole source strength, latency, orientation, or a combination of these parameters. Present analyses focused on P50/M50 merely as an example of the broader need to evaluate scalp phenomena in light of underlying generators. The development and widespread use of EEG/MEG source localization methods will greatly enhance the interpretation and value of EEG/MEG data. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Clementz, BA; Keil, A; Kissler, J				Clementz, BA; Keil, A; Kissler, J			Aberrant brain dynamics in schizophrenia: delayed buildup and prolonged decay of the visual steady-state response	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; visual; steady-state; event-related potentials; coherence	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; ABNORMALITIES; DYSFUNCTION; ATTENTION; CORTEX	In schizophrenia, aberrant brain activity has been reported both during stimulus processing and at rest. Evoked response amplitude is a function of both the number and synchronization of neurons firing in relation to a stimulus. It is at present unclear whether schizophrenia patients have normal synchronization of neural activity in relation to stimulus processing, and whether the amount and time course of synchronization is related to their evoked response amplitudes. EEG brain dynamics in response to visual steady-state stimulation were assessed in 12 schizophrenia and 12 healthy subjects at three stimulation durations (2, 4, and 6 s). Group differences in the visual evoked potential, the visual steady-state response, and the local coherence of the visual steady-state response were evaluated over time. Schizophrenia patients had smaller and delayed event-related potentials. Moreover, they had a slower buildup of steady-state amplitude following stimulation onset and a prolonged decrease after stimulation offset. Groups did not differ during mid-segments of steady-state stimulation. Increase in coherence to stimulation onset did not differ between-groups, but coherence decay of the visual steady-state response following stimulus offset was delayed in schizophrenia patients. The initial response to visual stimulation among schizophrenia subjects, therefore, may be reduced in amplitude due to weak signal strength, not poor coordination between distant cortical regions. The prolonged recovery function of schizophrenia patients' visual system may indicate abnormal nonlinearity in neural response. These findings have implications understanding the nature of evoked response differences between schizophrenia and normal groups especially in repetitive stimulus paradigms.

We investigated to what degree these components are specific to saccade preparation. EEG lateralization was examined within the interval (1 s) between a first (S1) and a second (S2) stimulus, after which a response had to be made (look left or right, or press a button with the left or right index finger). The visual S1 indicated either the direction (left vs right) and/or the effector (eye vs finger), and S2 (visual/auditory in different blocks) added the information not given by S1. An occipital component (220 ms after S1) was effector-independent, probably reflecting processing of the direction code. The following parietotemporal component (320 ms after S1) was specific for direction information. This component seems more relevant for finger movements than for saccades and may reflect a link between visual perception to action. A later frontal component (480 ms after S1) was specific for direction information and may be related to the planning of a lateral movement. One component was entirely specific for the preparation of a finger movement (the lateralized readiness potential before S2). Thus, several different lateralized processes in the S1-S2 interval could be delineated, reflecting hand-specific preparation, processing of the direction code, and the coordination of perception and action, but no components were observed as being specific for saccade preparation.

J	Cote, KA; Epps, TM; Campbell, KB				Cote, KA; Epps, TM; Campbell, KB			The role of the spindle in human information processing of high-intensity stimuli during sleep	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related potentials; information processing; sleep spindles	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSES; BINAURAL INTERACTION; BRAIN; ONSET; WAVE	Sleep spindles are 12-14 Hz oscillations in EEG, which are thought to inhibit or 'gate' information processing. Event-related potentials may be employed to probe the extent of information processing during sleep. Previous research indicates that event-related potentials elicited by moderate intensity stimuli show increased positivity (or further removal of negativity) when stimuli are presented concurrent with spindles. However, the effectiveness of spindles to inhibit the processing of much louder stimuli remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the extent of this gating, by using a range of stimuli including those that are loud and intrusive. Eight good sleepers were recorded during a single night. Auditory stimuli were delivered randomly at 0, 60, 80 or 100 dB SPL. Trials were sorted off-line by sleep stage, stimulus intensity and spindle characteristic (i.e. spindle absent, spindle present). During the sleep-onset period, the often-reported changes in event-related potentials were observed - N1 decreased and P2 increased in amplitude. In Stage 2 sleep, P2 was affected by the presence of spindles, particularly when stimulus intensity was loud. Its amplitude was greatest when spindles occurred following the onset of the stimulus. Scalp-recorded spindles might, therefore, be a consequence of the prior thalamic inhibition of information processing, especially when confronted by loud, intrusive external stimuli.

Subjects were seated in front of the observed person and looked at both their own and the observer's hand to receive similar visual feedback during the two conditions. hi a visual control condition, a diode light moved at the observed person's hand. A first potential accompanying the movement execution peaked at about +110 msec over the contralateral somatomotor areas. It was followed by a potential (P300) peaking at about +350 msec over the central midline. ha contrast, the potentials accompanying the movement observation peaked later over parietal-occipital other than somatomotor areas (N200 peak, +200 msec; P300 peak, +400 msec). Notably, the N200 was maximum in left parietal area whereas the P300 was maximum in right parietal area regardless the side of the movement. They markedly differed by the potentials following the displacement of the diode light. These results suggest a rapid time evolution (similar to200-400 msec) of the cortical responses characterizing the observation of aimless movements (as opposite to grasping or handling). The execution of these movements would mainly involve somatomotor cortical responses and would be scarcely founded on the visual feedback. In contrast, the observation of the same movements carried out by others would require dynamical responses of somatomotor and parietal-occipital areas (especially of the right hemisphere), possibly for a stringent visuospatial analysis of the motor event.

This didactic lecture will focus on our various attempts to identify and understand the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological substrates involved in cognitive information processing followed by the conception and execution of sensory-motor and behavioural responses evoked by significant acoustic stimuli, in both pathological situations and normal control subjects. Great interest was, e.g. aroused in the early 1970s by the rare, fortunately unrepeatable, opportunity of examining the CNV patterns in various psychiatric patients treated with psychosurgical Freeman-Watts bilateral prefrontal 'radical' lobotomy, also with repeated recordings (The Responsive Brain (1976) 158; Multidisciplinary Perspectives in Event-Related Brain-Potentials Research (1978) 376) or bimedial bifrontal cingulotomy (Multidisciplinary Perspectives in Event-Related Brain Potential Research (1978) 383). In the same period, investigations into CNV activity recorded in patients submitted to complete callosotomy ('split brain': Attention and Performance, vol. IV (1972) 221; Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol. Suppl. 33 (1973) 161) were also begun and were continued into the 1980s, also with regard to other types of ERP (Brain 111 (1988) 553: J. Cog. Neurosci. 2 (1990) 258). All these data furnished unique information about the sub-second dynamics of unilateral or bihemispheric cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical interconnections in humans. In recent years, with a classic method of analysis based on sequential scalp-topographic bidimensional neuroelectric mapping and 21/19 electrodes connected to three different references, and binaural/monaural clicks as warning signals (S1), we have repeatedly examined the CNV activity of l I selected patients submitted to complete ablation of the damaged cortical areas. with uni- or bilateral lesions restricted to the prefrontal or associative parieto-temporal areas. We have always used the standard CNV paradigm (S1-S2 motor-response) which evokes a complex of neurocognitive potentials, including the P300 from S1, which are well-known, since they are certainly among the most studied ERPs in the various ages and races of normal subjects, psychiatric patients and subjects with different brain diseases. The most important results have been, (1) In normal subjects the MRI and the latency differences of CNV component measurements along the bidirectional pathways functionally interconnecting ipsilateral distant associative cortical areas (e.g. the arcuate-superior longitudinal complex bundle) were accounted for by the transcortical conduction time, which varies in our scalp recordings from 1 cm/0.74 to 1.28 ins (similar to9.8 m/s). (2) Constantly, no true auditory S1-elicited N1a, b, c, P2, N2, P300 components or CNV slow waves (O- and E-wave) were recordable over the whole of the ablated cortical areas, but only clearly identifiable volume-conducted EP/ERPs generated in other hemispheric structures. (3) The post-S1 ERP/CNV complexes on the intact hemisphere were found to be within the normal limits. (4) Effects of severe disruption on the S1 ERP/CNV complexes evocable on the site and on remote ipsilateral apparently normal anatomo-functionally interconnected brain regions were observed in 5 patients, 4 of whom had extensive frontocortical ablations. In two of the latter the distant disruptive action on the CNV components over the neuroradiologically normal ipsilateral two-way connected post-rolandic sensory and association areas was seen to be partially reversible, showing aspects of a probable slowly evolving diaschisis-like effect. Similar deactivation of some ERP components was observed in reverse on the ipsilateral dorsolateral frontocortical region in the fifth patient with a large parieto-temporal cortex ablation. These data require confirmation, and when this phenomenon is observable, it must be appropriately monitored with different methods of functional neuroimaging. This will serve not only for medical and neuropsychophysiological diagnosis purposes, but also particularly for a correct and really useful planning of neuro-rehabilitation activities in selected cases.

In different blocks, cued spatial locations (left or right) were in either the upper or lower visual field, and attended stimuli were either oriented Ts or moving dots. Distractor stimuli were equally likely in the uncued hemifield. Sustained focal increases of alpha-band activity were seen over occipital cortex contralateral to the direction of the to-be-ignored location (ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention) before onset of the to-be-attended stimulus. The focus of alpha-band activity also moved depending on whether cued locations were in the upper or lower field. Results are consistent with active gating of uncued spatial locations.

To further illuminate the relationship of gamma-band activity and selective somatic attention, we have studied the effects of direction of attention on the stimuli of somatosensory evoked potentials. Responses during focused attention to stimulation of the right median nerve and ignored stimulation at the right tibial nerve were compared with responses of ignored stimulation of the right median nerve but focused attention to stimulation at the right tibial nerve. Subtraction of the data demonstrated a significant predominantly right hemispheric event-related synchronization in the gamma-band by attention to the right median nerve in the time period between 280 and 325 ms post-stimulus. This finding implicates the involvement of a right temporoparietal network in selective spatial attention. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study included 30 consecutive patients with SLE and 25 age- and sex-matched volunteers as a control group. They were subjected to neurological and rheumatological tests and an extensive battery of neurophysiological tests, besides Wechsler adult intelligence scale. Overt neurological manifestations were observed in 14 patients (46.7%). Neurophysiological data revealed that 25 patients (83%) had at least 2 abnormal tests; 11 (68.8%) patients of the asymptomatic group and 14 patients (100%) of the symptomatic group with no significant differences between them. Seventeen patients (56.7%) had evidence of PNS dysfunction either in nerves (46.7%) or muscles (10%); 7 of them in the asymptomatic group. Twenty four patients (80%) had evidence of CNS dysfunction. Twenty-two patients (73%) had abnormalities recorded on electroencephalography; 9 patients in the asymptomatic group and 13 patients in the symptomatic group. Eleven patients (37%) had abnormal values of P100 of visual evoked potential; 5 patients in the asymptomatic group and 6 in the symptomatic group. Eight patients (26.7%) had abnormal latency of wave I of brain stem response; 3 of them in the asymptomatic group. Abnormal prolongation of the P300 component of event-related potentials was recorded in 2 patients (12.5%) of the asymptomatic group, while low IQ was observed in 8 patients of each group. Neurophysiological abnormalities are fairly common in SLE patients whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. The use of such tests favors a true incidence of nervous system involvement, more accurate diagnosis, and may lead to better clinical care before the development of debilitating CNS and PNS changes.

Two rTMS trains were delivered over the left frontal area, with 30 pulses in each train. ERPs were recorded at 14 electrode sites on the scalp using a typical oddball protocol before and after rTMS. Tone stimuli (20% target and 80% standard) were delivered through earphones. Latency and amplitude of N-100, P-200, N-200 and P-300 were measured and compared during the study. To observe information flow between two electrode sites, directed coherence (DCOH) was calculated on the ERPs. Our results show that the effect of rTMS differs in the various ERPs components (P < 0.001). The latency of P-300 significantly increased after stimulation, and the increase was more obvious in the frontal (18.6 ms) and central (15.8 ms) areas. The latency of P-200 decreased in all areas. The amplitude of component N-100 in the frontal and central areas decreased after rTMS. DCOH from the central area to the temporal area and DCOH from the parietal area to the temporal area were significantly higher than the DCOH between other areas (P < 0.01), and these properties were not affected by rTMS (P > 0.05). Information flow was driven from the frontal area to the parietal area after stimulation. Our results suggest that rTMS can suppress cognitive activities, showing an inhibitory effect on neurophysiological processes in the human brain. Since the temporal area is located at the terminus of the propagation pathways, it plays important roles in processing information in cognitive activities.

Spontaneous EEG and auditory ERP data recorded from a single site in 16 early AD patients and 16 age-matched normal subjects were used. We made a feature pool including 88 spectral, 28 statistical and 2 nonlinear characteristics of EEG and 10 features of ERP. The combined GA/ANN was applied to find the dominant features automatically from the feature pool, and the selected features were used as a network input. The recognition rate of the ANN fed by this input was 81.9% for the untrained data set. These results lead to the conclusion that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for an early detection of the AD. This approach could be extended to a reliable classification system using EEG recording that can discriminate between groups.

Different emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgust) and neutral faces were presented to 17 healthy, right-handed volunteers on a computer screen while 25-channel EEG data were recorded. Subjects were instructed to generate the same emotion as shown in the presented faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were computed for each emotion and neutral condition, and analyzed as sequences of potential distribution maps. Paired topographic analysis of variance tests of the ERP maps identified time segments of significant differences between responses to emotional and neutral faces. For these significant segments, statistical analyses of functional LORETA images were performed to identify active brain regions for the different emotions. Significant differences occurred in different time segments within the first 500 ins after stimulus onset. Each emotional condition showed specific activation patterns in different brain regions, changing over time. In the majority of significant time segments, activation was bigest in the right frontal areas. Strongest activation was found in the happy, sad, and disgust conditions in extended fronto-temporal areas. Happy, sad, and disgust conditions also produced earlier and more widely distributed differences than anger and fear. Our findings are in good agreement with other brain-imaging studies (PET/fMRI). But unlike other imaging techniques, LORETA allows to follow the time sequence in the millisecond-range resolution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) of 13 subjects in a visual classification task. We used four different stimuli which were all composed of four identical elements. One of the stimuli constituted an illusory Kanizsa square, another was composed of the same number of collinear line segments but the elements did not form a Gestalt. In addition, a target and a control stimulus were used which were arranged differently. These stimuli allow us to differentiate the processing of colinear line elements (stimulus features) and illusory figures (perceptual properties). The visual N170 in response to the illusory figure was significantly larger as compared to the other collinear stimulus. This is taken to indicate that the visual N170 reflects cognitive processes of Gestalt perception in addition to attentional processes and physical stimulus properties.

J	Sabri, M; Campbell, KB				Sabri, M; Campbell, KB			The effects of digital filtering on mismatch negativity in wakefulness and slow-wave sleep	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related potentials; filter settings; mismatch negativity; unconsciousness; slow-wave sleep	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVIANT STIMULI; SENSORY MEMORY; NATURAL SLEEP; STAGE-2 SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; TRANSITION	The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a response to a deviant auditory stimulus that occurs infrequently in a sequence of otherwise repetitive, homogeneous standard auditory stimuli. The MMN is presumed automatic and independent of conscious awareness. Recording of the MMN during unconscious states may be problematic. The frequency content of the long-lasting MMN may overlap and summate with other event-related slow potentials and low-frequency background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal filter settings for recording the MMN during unconscious states. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from eight subjects in an oddball paradigm during wakefulness and Stages 3 and 4 of sleep [slow-wave sleep (SWS)] using a 0.16-35 Hz analogue bandpass. Deviant probability was 0.033. Stimulus-onset asynchrony was 150 ms. The EEG data were subsequently digitally filtered in the frequency domain. The low-pass filter was set at either 24, 12 or 6 Hz, and the high-pass filter at either 1, 2, 3 or 4 Hz. Applying a low-pass filter down to 12 Hz had a minimal impact on the waking or sleeping MMN amplitude. On the other hand, increasing the high-pass setting from 2 to 3 Hz permitted the visualization of the MMN recorded during sleep. The 4 Hz filter showed a similar trend but also markedly attenuated the amplitude of the waking MMN. A high-pass setting of 3 Hz provides a reasonable compromise. It has only a slight effect on the MMN when the subject is conscious, but still attenuates most of the unwanted slow potential activity when the subject enters SWS.

Controversy remains whether MMN can be generated in the frontal as well as the temporal cortex. Our aim was to see if frontal as well as temporal lobe dipoles could explain MMN recorded after pitch-deviants (Pd-MMN) and duration deviants (Dd-MMN). EEG recordings were taken from 32 sites in 14 healthy subjects during a passive 3-tone oddball presented during a simple visual discrimination and an active auditory discrimination condition. Both conditions were repeated after one month, The Pd-MMN was larger, peaked earlier and correlated better between sessions than the Dd-MMN. Two dipoles in the auditory cortex and two in the frontal lobe (left cingulate and right inferior frontal cortex) were found to be similarly placed for Pd- and Dd-MMN, and were well replicated on retest. This study confirms interactions between activity generated in the frontal and auditory temporal cortices in automatic attention-like processes that resemble initial brain imaging reports of unconscious visual change detection, The lack of interference between sessions shows that the situation is likely to be sensitive to treatment or illness effects on fronto-temporal interactions involving repeated measures.

Objective: In the present study, EEGs and event-related potentials (ERPs) of high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) rats from replicate line 2 (HAD-2 and LAD-2) were assessed to determine if their neurophysiological profiles are similar to selected lines previously evaluated. Methods: Rats obtained from Indiana University were implanted with cortical and amygdalar recording electrodes. Baseline EEG and ERPs were assessed in ethanol-naive HAD-2 and LAD-2 rats. Animals subsequently were trained to self-administer ethanol by using a sucrose-substitution procedure. Results: Compared with LAD-2 rats, HAD-2 rats displayed greater parietal cortical power in the 6 to 32 Hz frequency range of the EEG. Greater parietal cortical peak frequency in the 2 to 4 Hz range and decreased frontal, parietal, and amygdalar peak frequencies in the 16 to 32 Hz frequency range were also seen. Compared with LAD-2 rats, HAD-2 rats had decreased P2 latency of ERPs recorded in the parietal cortex. HAD-2 rats also had greater frontal, parietal, and amygdalar P2 amplitudes, greater frontal and parietal cortical P1 amplitudes, and greater parietal cortical P3 amplitudes compared with LAD-2 rats. As anticipated, HAD-2 rats consumed significantly greater levels of sucrose, sucrose-ethanol, and ethanol over the course of the sucrose-substitution procedure compared with LAD-2 rats. Conclusions: These data suggest that increased cortical power is associated with high ethanol preference in a number of selectively bred rat lines. However, unique electrophysiological characteristics may index alcohol preference in each line.

Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were compared with bisensory evoked potentials (BEPs; simultaneous auditory and visual stimulation) in 15 subjects. Gamma responses in AEPs, VEPs and BEPs were assessed by means of wavelet decomposition. Overall maximum gamma-components post-stimulus were highest in BEPs (P<0.01). Bisensory evoked gamma-responses also showed significant central, parietal and occipital amplitude-increases (P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively; prestimulus interval as baseline). These were of greater magnitude when compared with the unisensory responses. As a correlate of the marked gamma responses to bimodal stimulation we suggest a process of 'intersensory association', i.e. one of the steps between sensory transmission and perception. Our data may be interpreted as a further example of function-related gamma responses in the EEG. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bresnahan, SM; Barry, RJ				Bresnahan, SM; Barry, RJ			Specificity of quantitative EEG analysis in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); theta power; specificity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; 2 SUBTYPES; NORMAL-CHILDREN; AGE; BOYS; GENE	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents is characterised by excessive restlessness and an extremely poor concentration span, resulting in impulsive and disruptive behaviour. Clinical observation of ADHD in adults suggests that the early hyperactivity is diminished in terms of its impact on social and academic function, while impulsive-type behaviours remain unchanged. EEG studies in children and adolescents with ADHD have reported significantly more low-frequency power (predominantly theta) and less high-frequency power (predominantly beta) than in normal subjects. In normal children and adolescents, a decrease in theta power and an increase in beta power are found with increasing age, leading some researchers to interpret the EEG anomalies in ADHD as evidence of developmental delay. Studies of adults with ADHD compared with normal adult control subjects have found a reduction in the difference between the two groups, suggesting that the reduced beta activity apparent in ADHD children and adolescents changes with age. Adults with ADHD thus appear to have elevated low-frequency power as their predominant EEG difference from normal control subjects. The present study examined whether this EEG profile was specific to adult ADHD patients. Quantitative EEGs were recorded at rest in an eyesopen condition and used to compare 50 adult patients diagnosed with ADHD with 50 non-ADHD subjects (who presented for ADHD assessment but failed to meet the diagnostic criteria) and 50 control subjects. The ADHD group differed from both the non-ADHD and the control groups on the basis of elevated theta activity. The ADHD and control groups did not differ in beta activity, but relative theta was reduced and relative beta power was elevated in the non-ADHD group compared with both the ADHD and control groups. These results suggest that quantitative EEG may be used to differentiate ADHD adults from both normal adults and adults who display some of the symptoms of ADHD, but fail to meet the diagnostic criteria of ADHD.

CRITICAL CARE			English	Editorial Material						auditory event-related potentials; coma; electroencephalogram; evoked potentials; intensive care	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; SEDATION	Changes in electroencephalogram parameters and auditory event-related potentials, induced by interruption to propofol sedation in intensive care patients, provide a number of electrophysiological measures that can be used to assess neurological function accurately. Studies of electroencephalogram parameters suggest that power spectral estimation, as root mean square power, is more useful and precise than spectral edge frequency 95% in evaluating the functional integrity of the brain. When such parameters are used to evaluate neurological function, in particular the N100 and mismatch negativity components, a precise assessment of a patient's readiness to awaken from a pharmacologically induced coma ( such as sedation) can be obtained. In terms of ease of use, however, it is more difficult to establish whether N100 or mismatch negativity is superior.

In a human visual selective attention task, we show that nontarget event-related potentials were mainly generated by partial stimulus-Induced phase resetting of multiple electroencephalographic processes. Independent component analysis applied to the single-trial data identified at least eight classes of contributing components, including those producing central and lateral posterior alpha, left and right mu, and frontal midline theta rhythms. Scalp topographies of these components were consistent with their generation in compact cortical domains.

Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in such patients found involvement of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected hand related to movements of this hand. To understand the function of this ipsilateral activation, the present study investigated movement-related electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials in patients and healthy control subjects to measure timing of ipsi- and contralateral activation relative to movement onset. Methods: Thirteen patients were investigated in their chronic stage. Their pyramidal tracts were affected by infarctions of the middle cerebral artery at striatocapsular level. EEG potentials were recorded from 26 scalp electrodes while patients were pressing a key with their right or left index finger within a warned choice-response task. Results: Beginning 200 ms before responses of the affected hand, there was normal contralateral preponderance of EEG negativity. Briefly after response onset, however, the other unaffected hemisphere, ipsilateral to the responding hand, became additionally active. This pattern did not occur with responses made by the unaffected hand nor in healthy participants. Conclusions: The timing of the onset of ipsilateral activity precludes its role in response initiation. Rather, this activity may indicate reflex-like activation of the unaffected motor system to compensate for possible failure of the affected hand.

A new adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique will attempt to estimate movement-related potentials within multi-channel EEG recordings, enabling this method to completely adapt to each input sweep without system training procedures. We assume that one of the sensors is corrupted by noise deriving from other sensors via an unknown function that will be estimated. We will approach this problem by: (1) spatially decorrelating the sensors in the preprocessing phase, (2) choosing the most informative of the filtered channels that will permit the best MRP estimation (input-selection phase) and (3) training the neuro-fuzzy model to fit the noise over the chosen sensor and therefore estimating the buried MRP. We tested this framework with simulations to validate the analytical results before applying them to the real biological data. Whenever it is applied to biological data, this method improves the SNR by more than 12dB, even to very low SNRs. The processing method proposed here is likely to complement other estimation techniques and can be useful to process, enhance and analyse single-trial MRPs.

We used electroencephalography to investigate the dynamics of temporo-parietal networks during working memory for moving sounds. A delayed matching-to-sample task required a decision on the identity of positions and trajectories of two moving sounds S I and S2 presented with delays of 927 or 1427 ms. Moving sounds consisted of noise bursts positioned at successive angles to create the impression of one of six possible trajectories at variable spatial positions. Stimuli in the equally difficult control condition were identical to the memory task up to S2, which was replaced by a spatial displacement in the otherwise stationary background sound whose direction had to be detected. Event-related potentials were recorded from 31 scalp electrodes in 15 subjects. Scalp current density estimates allowed to identify the following components. The fronto-central negative variation preceding S2 did not differ between tasks. In contrast, the sustained negative current during the presentation of S I originating from superior temporal cortex was more pronounced for the memory task, probably reflecting enhanced attention allocation and foreground-background discrimination. Most importantly, the memory task activated current sources over bilateral posterior parietal regions between the middle of S I and the end of the delay phase. This component was completely absent in the control condition. In summary, the present study disclosed varying degrees of memorization-related, top-down driven influences on the processing of moving sounds at different stages of an auditory network involving temporal and parietal regions.

Our principal objective was to determine if the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol on spontaneous EEG activity could be discriminated from those of other sedative/hypnotics. We employed ERI to combine and integrate standard analysis methods to learn multiple signal features of time-varying EEG signals. We recorded cortical EEG, electromyographic activity. and motor activity during intravenous administration of saline, ethanol (1.0 g/kg), chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), pentobarbital (6 mg/kg), heroin (0.3 mg/kg), and methamphetamine (2 mg/kg) administered on separate days in six rats. A blind treatment of one of the drugs was readministered to validate the efficacy of ERI analysis. Significant changes in spontaneous EEG activity produced by all Five drugs were detected by ERI analysis with a time resolution of 5-10 s. ERI analysis of spontaneous EEG activity also discriminated. with 90-95% accuracy, an ataxic dose of ethanol versus equivalent ataxic doses of chlordiazepoxide or pentobarbital, as well as the effects of saline, a reinforcing dose of heroin, or a locomotor activating dose of methamphetamine. ERI correctly matched the 'blind drug' as ethanol. These findings indicate that ERI analysis can detect the central nervous system effects of various psychoactive drugs and accurately discriminate the electrocortical effects of select sedative/hypnotics, with similar behavioral endpoints, but with dissimilar mechanisms of action.

The event-related desynchronization (ERD) was quantified in the 8-10 and 10-12 Hz bands. Results: Both frequency components are blocked prior to and during movement and therefore, they have to be considered as mu rhythms. The lower frequency component results in a widespread movement-type non-specific ERD pattern, whereas the upper frequency component shows a more focused and movement-type specific pattern, clearly different with finger and foot movement. Conclusions: The distinct reactivity patterns provide evidence for the existence of two types of mu rhythms, a somatotopically non-specific lower frequency mu rhythm and a somatotopically specific mu rhythm characteristically found in the upper alpha frequency band.

J	Wascher, E; Wolber, M				Wascher, E; Wolber, M			Attentional and intentional cueing in a Simon task: An EEG-based approach	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article						Simon effect; spatial attention; ERP; LRP; N1; N2pc; response preparation	STIMULUS-RESPONSE COMPATIBILITY; S-R COMPATIBILITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL STIMULUS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; DIMENSIONAL OVERLAP; VISUAL-SEARCH; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION	Advance information about the location of a stimulus (attentional cueing) does not affect the Simon effect (a shortening of manual response times whenever the position of a stimulus that is irrelevant for the task corresponds to the side of the response). However, advance information about the side of a response (intentional cueing) enhances the Simon effect. At first sight, these well-established results contradict two important assumptions about the origin of the Simon effect: (a) the effect originates at least in part in a covert shift of visual attention that forces the preparation of a response towards the location of the attentional shift and (b) interference between stimulus location and response side takes place within a response selection stage. We replicated the behavioral finding in a study that measured event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. ERPs indicated that the mechanisms causing the Simon effect remain widely unaffected by advance information. Clear evidence for both response preparation and attentional shifts in the cue-target interval was found. Additionally, ERPs suggested that the increment of the Simon effect by intentional cueing might be due to perceptual factors rather than to an alteration in the mechanisms involved in the generation of a regular Simon effect. The implications of these data for the role of attention and of response selection in Simon tasks are discussed.

Resting EEG was recorded on 19 scalp leads and auditory P300 was obtained by an oddball paradigm task. Spectral analysis of EEG (absolute and relative power, mean frequency), latency and amplitude of auditory P300 were considered for statistical analysis. EEG changes were not significant during free smoking but were significant during smoking abstinence. Theta absolute power increased by +57% (P<.001), whereas alpha and delta absolute power increased by +26% (P<.01) and + 19% (P<.01), respectively; theta absolute power change was delayed and prolonged. Alpha mean frequency reduced by -0.31 Hz (P<.001), whereas delta, theta and betal mean frequency increased by +0.13 Hz (P<.05), +0.09 Hz (P<.05) and +0.23 Hz (P<.01), respectively. Auditory P300 amplitude and latency were unaffected by smoking abstinence. Resting EEG, but not auditory P300, was sufficiently sensitive to detect changes during enforced smoking abstinence, and EEG bands had different temporal changes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Use of low contrast (10%) stimuli and four midline scalp electrodes, facilitated separation of cognitive and sensory components and enabled the P300 complex to be resolved into three distinct components-N200, P3a, and P3b. In 20 healthy adult subjects normative data were established and the P3a and P3b components were shown to depend on cognitive function. In 19 age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) the EEG and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were normal, but latencies of P3a and/or P3b were prolonged in 9. Prolonged latencies were not associated with an abnormal number connection test. Ten additional age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt HE, who were alcohol, drug, and caffeine free, were randomized to receive flumazenil (1 mg) and placebo intravenously, double-blind. After flumazenil or placebo, latencies of P3a and P3b and psychometric test results did not change significantly. These findings suggest that in cirrhotic patients without overt HE (i) impaired cognitive sensory function may occur in the absence of abnormalities of a standard psychometric test, the EEG, or VEPs. and (ii) increased latencies of P3a and P3b may constitute a component of subclinical HE, which is not mediated by increased brain levels of central benzodiazepine receptor agonist ligands.

Methods: A two stimulus reaction time paradigm was used. Stimulus pairs presented one-by-one with 2 s inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) had to be matched with respect to lexical identity (word-picture) in a word comprehension task or with respect: to the phonological representative of objects in a rhyming task. A semantic categorization task was added for the Italian sample. In both studies, the EEG was recorded from 26 scalp electrodes according to the 10-20 system. The slow negative potential during the ISI (CNV) was determined as the electrocortical correlate of preparation for and activation of the specific language-related task. Results: In both samples phonological encoding (rhyming) evoked a more pronounced CNV over the left- compared with the right-frontal area, while less lateralized central dominance of the CNV was found in the word comprehension task. Semantic categorization was accompanied by the least asymmetry of activity. Conclusions: Results indicate that the different degree of asymmetry induced by phonological and semantic processing may be determined from the scalp distribution of slow cortical potentials with cross-lingual reliability.

There is, however, a considerable variability in recovery among patients receiving the Arm Ability Training. The study investigated whether intersubject differences in movement-related electric brain activity explain the variability in motor recovery. Methods: In a sample of 9 patients receiving the Arm Ability Training both motor performance using a standardised arm function test (TEMPA) and movement-related electric brain activity, i.e. slow cortical potentials (DC) as well as event-related desynchronisation of alpha (alpha-ERD) and beta activity (beta-ERD), were assessed before the Arm Ability Training was started. Stepwise multiple regression was used to establish the best predictive model for motor improvement scores (TEMPA difference from pre to post test three weeks later). Results: Stepwise multiple regression indicated that electric brain activity during movement preparation explained the variance of motor improvement scores completely. Further, electric brain activity during movement as well as baseline motor performance accounted each for 50% of the variance of motor improvement scores. Conclusions: Activation of sensorimotor areas during movement preparation and deactivation of other cortical areas during movement execution seem to be factors that predict a favourable outcome after training.

The distinct non-phase-locked gamma response was obtained in characteristic time window (200-400 ms) with clear-cut centro-parietal location. The strong coincidence between induced gamma oscillations and saccadic eye movements was revealed. We suggest that saccade-related gamma increase is another manifestation of the phenomenon known as presaccadic spike potential, which is commonly registered over parietal scalp leads at 10-20 ms prior to saccade onset. It is hypothesized that late non-phase-locked gamma synchronization mainly reflects activity of a system responsible for attentional tuning and motor planning/execution of saccadic eye movements.

However, this kind of analysis does not allow observation of differences in the spectral content taking place during a sensory, cognitive or motor task. The coal of the present work was to compute the temporal dynamics of EEG oscillations using a technique called temporal spectral evolution (TSE). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the presentation of flashed stimuli that were randomly presented to the left or right visual field. Subjects were asked to pay attention, alternately in different blocks of trials, to the left or to the right to detect an infrequent target. The results showed a decrease in the a. band in a time window of 375-500 ms and an increase in the P band at 500-875 ms after stimulus onset, for both attended and unattended stimuli. Statistical analysis showed that the decrease in alpha and the increase in beta were more marked during the attentional. condition. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the decrease in alpha band and the increase in beta band are electrophysiological markers of visual spatial attention.

We sought to determine whether abnormalities of frontotemporal connectivity are trait markers of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Methods: We investigated 64 schizophrenia patients, 79 of their clinically unaffected siblings, and 88 unrelated normal controls with an auditory oddball electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked potential paradigm. We measured: 1) frontotemporal event-related EEG-coherence (i.e. a measure of functional connectivity); and 2) we performed structural equation modeling of the effective connectivity between the frontal P300 and temporoparietal P300-amplitude. Results: Schizophrenic patients and their siblings showed a reduction of frontotemporal coherence. At peak activation during the P300 time-window, a negative ("inhibitory") frontotemporal path coefficient was found in normal controls, whereas a positive coefficient was seen in schizophrenic patients with siblings being intermediate. Intra-class correlations between sib-pairs and relative risk estimates of the applied connectivity measures were non-significant. Topographic correlation matrix analyses suggested that the altered functional and effective frontotemporal connectivity indirectly reflect regional abnormalities of increased activation variance. Conclusions: Impaired interaction of the frontotemporal macro-circuit indirectly reflects genetically determined abnormalities of frontal and temporoparietal microcircuits. The reasons why frontotemporal connectivity appears to be a poor predictor of genetic risk for schizophrenia are discussed.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						alpha; event-related potential; event related decrease; induced oscillations; evoked oscillations; induced band power; event related band power	OSCILLATIONS; BAND; EEG	This study aims to resolve a paradox. Experiments measuring alpha band power report an event related decrease (desynchronization) in alpha activity, whereas those measuring evoked alpha report synchronization. During a recognition memory task with human subjects, we measured the evoked (phase locked) and induced (not phase locked) alpha response. The findings reveal that evoked alpha is due to a transient phase locking (at about 100-200 ms poststimulus) of three alpha sub-bands which can be observed only at parieto-occipital sites. In contrast, induced alpha shows a widespread pattern of desynchronization at most recording sites. Thus, opposite alpha responses occur within similar time windows. Evoked alpha synchronization may reflect cortical inhibition which serves to increase the signal to noise ratio for activation processes following immediately later.

Work has already begun on studying a host of spontaneous EEG phenomena ranging from alpha rhythm and sleep patterns to epileptiform discharges and seizures, with far reaching clinical implications. However, the transformation of EEG data into linear models suitable for voxel-based statistical hypothesis testing is central to the endeavour. This in turn is predicated upon a number of assumptions regarding the manner in which the generators of EEG phenomena may engender changes in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Furthermore, important limitations are posed by a set of considerations quite unique to 'paradigmless fMRI'. Here, these issues are assembled and explored to provide an overview of progress made and unresolved questions, with an emphasis on applications in epilepsy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, ICA has not been used for the analysis of ictal EEGs in partial seizures, In this study, we applied ICA to the ictal EEGs of patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and investigated whether ictal components can be separated and whether they indicate correct lateralization. Methods: Twenty-four EEGs from medial TLE patients were analyzed with the extended ICA algorithm. Among the resultant 20 components in each EEG, we selected components with an ictal nature and reviewed their corresponding topographic maps for the lateralization. We then applied quantitative methods for the verification of increased quality of the reconstructed EEGs. Results: All ictal EEGs were successfully decomposed into one or more ictal components and nonictal components. After EEG reconstruction with exclusion of artifacts, the lateralizing power of the ictal EEG was increased from 75 to 96%. Conclusions: ICA can separate successfully the manifold components of ictal rhythms and can improve EEG quality.

Depletion of tryptophan (TRP), a precursor for serotonin has been described to reduce serotonin content in brain of animals and humans. Objective: We investigated the intensity dependence of magnetic and electric N1/P2 components in ten subjects in a double-blind, controlled, cross-over design study after oral mixture of amino-acids leading to acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and control. Methods: Auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEF) and potentials (AEP) were recorded with 122-channel magnetoencephalography simultaneously with 64-channel EEG 5 h after ingestion of mixtures. The AEF sources and strength were estimated by a least-squares fit of a single equivalent current dipole. The amplitudes and latencies of N1 and P2 recorded with EEG were analyzed at frontal electrode site. Results: TRP depletion decreased the total and free TRP levels by 76 and 45% and control mixture increased it by 48 and 28%. ANOVA showed that ATD had a significant main effect on the N1m/P2m dipole moments at the contralateral (P=0.02), but failed significantly to influence the ipsilateral responses. A significant mixture ingestion-by-stimulus intensity interaction was observed on the N1m/P2m dipole moments at the contralateral hemisphere (P=0.01). The N1/P2 slope for intensity dependence function was decreased following ATD compared with the control experiment (P=0.01) at the contralateral hemisphere. For EEG, a significant mixture ingestion-by-stimulus intensity interaction on the N1 latencies at the Fz electrode position was observed (P=0.01). Conclusion: ATD decreased the intensity dependence of N1m/P2m source dipole moments in the primary auditory cortex at the hemisphere contralateral to the ear stimulated. These results suggest that serotonin participates in the regulation of intensity of auditory stimulation.

J	Dien, J; Spencer, KM; Donchin, E				Dien, J; Spencer, KM; Donchin, E			Localization of the event-related potential novelty response as defined by principal components analysis	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						P300; novelty P3; inverse problem; event related potential; electroencephalography	FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; TARGET DETECTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; TASK RELEVANCE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; STIMULI; P300; FMRI; MISALLOCATION; VARIANCE	Recent research indicates that novel stimuli elicit at least two distinct components, the Novelty P3 and the P300. The P300 is thought to be elicited when a context updating mechanism is activated by a wide class of deviant events. The functional significance of the Novelty P3 is uncertain. Identification of the generator sources of the two components could provide additional information about their functional significance. Previous localization efforts have yielded conflicting results. The present report demonstrates that the use of principal components analysis (PCA) results in better convergence with knowledge about functional neuroanatomy than did previous localization efforts. The results are also more convincing than that obtained by two alternative methods, MUSIC-RAP and the Minimum Norm. Source modeling on 129-channel data with BESA and BrainVoyager suggests the P300 has sources in the temporal-parietal junction whereas the Novelty P3 has sources in the anterior cingulate.

These methods range from indirect means of measuring changes in cerebral blood flow in local regions of the human cortex (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI), or changes in the electrical activity of the human brain with EEG-recording with topological distributed macroelectrodes, to the use of chronically implanted multiple microelectrodes in primates. fMRI has the disadvantage of low temporal resolution and with multiple microelectrodes long distance measurements cannot yet be properly performed. Accordingly, recording of macro-activity (EEG/ERP or MEG) with a time resolution of millisecond-range is the most possibly adequate method to measure the dynamic properties of memory and the integrative brain function. Since neuroscientists have come to the general conclusion that large numbers of different brain regions have to cooperate for any brain function, the analysis of relationships between different regions of the brain is becoming more and more important. Before new progresses and importance of EEG studies research became clear, scientists working with macrodynamics of the brain had a long way to go, in order to elucidate brain functioning. In this tutorial report we explain in a narrative way the developments leading to the concept of Macrodynamics in search of an integrative brain function. Moreover, elements of a brain theory, which we call neurons-brain theory describing the dynamics of electrical activity in the whole brain, are introduced. The concept of superbinding in integrative brain function, which emerged from experimental data, is a consequence of this theory.

Preliminary surface Laplacian transformation of EEG data (31 channels) reduced head volume conductor effects. EEG phase values were computed by FFT analysis and the statistical evaluation of these values was performed by Rayleigh test (P < 0.05). About 50% of the EEG single trials presented statistically the same FFT phase value of the evoked EEG oscillations (phase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant phase-locked compared to nonphase-locked component. The remaining single trials showed random FFT phase values (nonphase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant nonphase-locked compared to phase-locked component. Compared to nonpainful stimulation, painful stimulation increased phase-locked theta to gamma band responses in the contralateral hemisphere and decreased the phase-locked beta band response in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, nonphase-locked alpha band response decreased in the ipsilateral Pronto-central area. In conclusion, both decreased and increased EEG oscillatory responses to galvanic painful stimulation would occur in parallel in different cortical regions and in the phase- and nonphase-locked EEG data sets. This enriches the actual debate on the mapping of event-related oscillatory activity of human brain. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Information from both techniques may complement each other. However, this combination is fraught with difficulty because of a possible interference of the skull or the scalp with scalp-recorded EP. The aim of the present study was to investigate this influence of skull and scalp thicknesses on event-related P300 potentials. Methods: Thirty healthy controls were examined using an auditory evoked P300 elicited by a standard oddball paradigm. Skull and scalp thicknesses were determined using coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: P3b-amplitudes were significantly correlated with temporo-parietal skull thickness (r = -0.42; P = 0.021; regression slope of - 1.14 muV/mm skull thickness), whereas scalp had no influence on P300. The amplitude of the more frontal subcomponent P3a was not related to frontal skull thickness. Conclusions: Therefore, the utility of P300 as a research tool can be enhanced when adjustment for skull thickness is made. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A series of frequent standard and rare deviant auditory stimuli were presented to 20 healthy subjects in two recording sessions about five weeks apart. Deviant stimuli were either low or highly deviant as compared to the standard stimulus. While MMN was recorded, subjects were performing a visual and, subsequently, an auditory discrimination task. Directing attention towards the auditory task was associated with increased MMN amplitude only in response to low deviant stimuli and only in the first recording session. No change of MMN amplitude was found when directing attention towards the visual task or when MMN was recorded in response to highly deviant auditory stimuli. The latter may trigger an involuntary switch of attention, thereby overwriting the effect of task-directed attention. Conversely, the effects of attention on the processing of low deviant stimuli appear to be fragile and diminish with increasing automaticity of task execution.

Compared to the 60degrees rotation, the 180degrees rotation was associated with increased synchronization between bilateral prefrontal and parieto-occipital sites, between left frontal and right parietal sites and between bilateral parietal and occipital sites. We suggest that the increased synchronization between prefrontal and parieto-occipital regions may be associated with the working memory components of the task, while the left frontal to right parietal synchronization may represent the increased interaction between these regions thought to occur in a variety of visuo-motor tasks.

EEGs were recorded during performance of the tasks and event-related potentials were compared between groups. Patients performed worse than healthy volunteers in recognition of facial affect but not in categorisation of blurred faces. Furthermore, within a 180-250 ms latency range patients showed reduced amplitudes during affect recognition compared with controls but not during categorisation of blurred faces. Amplitudes recorded at frontal electrode sites were associated with performance in facial affect recognition. These results provide a first clue to the neurophysiological basis of the widely reported facial affect recognition deficit in schizophrenic patients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Surface Laplacian estimate of the potential reduced the head-volume conductor effects and annulled electrode reference variations. Results showed that EEG reactivity (i.e., ERD/ERS) of modeled contralateral rolandic cortex and motor performance were preserved in mild to moderate AD. In contrast, modeled activity (i.e., ERD/ERS) of frontolateral, centromedial, and ipsilateral rolandic areas was abnormal. Furthermore, interrelatedness of cortical response and movement timing was abnormal in AD patients. These results would support the working hypothesis that mild to moderate AD is a global brain network disease, including processing of sensorimotor information (despite no overt movement disorder). Further investigations will ascertain the clinical relevance of these results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Episodes of high EtOH drinking, lasting from hours to days (i.e. binges), are not uncommon. Thus, adolescent EtOH drinking has become a significant health concern due to the possible protracted effects of high doses of EtOH on behavior and the developing brain. This study assessed the effects of brief high levels of EtOH during periadolescence on subsequent behavior and electrophysiology in adult rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 5 days (i.e. postnatal days 35-40) or 10 days (i.e. postnatal days 30-40) for 12 h/day, Locomotor activity, EEG activity, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were then assessed at 1 and 6-7 weeks post EtOH exposure. Significant differences in locomotor activity were not observed at 1 week or 6-7 weeks post-ethanol exposure. However, EtOH exposure did have long-term electrophysiological effects. EtOH exposure increased the frequency of the EEG in the 1-2 Hz range in the parietal cortex and the 16-32 Hz range in the hippocampus. EtOH exposure also increased hippocampal N2 amplitude, decreased hippocampal P3 amplitude, and decreased cortical and hippocampal P2 amplitudes. While these findings are generally similar to those reported following long-term ethanol exposure during adulthood, alcohol exposure during adolescence appears to produce more robust hippocampal effects following shorter periods of exposure. In addition, these data indicate that, in the absence of overt behavioral differences, there are long-lasting changes in the functional brain activity of adult rats briefly exposed to high levels of EtOH during the periadolescent period.

Neurological patients with single focal lesions in their left or right hemisphere and healthy control Subjects made lexical decisions on written words and pseudo-words while EEG responses were recorded. At the time of testing, patients did not show clinically apparent language dysfunction, although h those with left-hemisphere lesions had Suffered from aphasia in the first months after their stroke. A P3-like positive deflection of the event-related potential (ERP) was reduced in the patients relative to healthy controls, this reduction being most pronounced over the hemisphere affected by stroke. Consistent with earlier research, healthy control Subjects showed more positive ERPs to words than to pseudo-words. This pattern was reversed in both patient groups, where words elicited more negative-going ERPs than pseudo-words already 160-320ms after stimulus onset. Because ERPs showed between-group differences only for words, these word-specific neurophysiological signatures altered in stroke patients with well-recovered language functions may be a correlate of cortical lesions or an index of reorganization of lanuage after stroke.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were first obtained in waking, while participants performed a target detection auditory task. Subjects were then allowed to take a nap with lights off and sleep latency was calculated. After 3 min of continuous sleep, frequent and rare tones were suddenly presented again (and ERPs recorded) in a forced awakening condition, which was repeated a second time if patients fell asleep. ERPs in pre-nap wakefulness did not differ in patients and controls. On forced awakening, almost half (48%) of EDS patients retained morphologically normal ERPs, but showed a significant delay of P300 relative to waking. In the other half of the patients (and none of the controls), the N200/P300 complex to targets was replaced on forced awakening by high-amplitude negative waves ('sleep negativities'). Single subject analysis showed that 65% of patients had abnormal responses during forced awakening (significant P3 delay or sleep negativities), while only three of them (7%) had abnormal ERPs on wakefulness. The presence of sleep negativities was associated with shorter sleep latencies and increased target detection errors on forced awakening. Sleep negativities were more prevalent in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia than in EDS associated to psychiatric disorders. By combining sleep latency and ERP measures, the forced awakening test provided a robust and relatively rapid tool (45-60 min) to evaluate both sleep propensity and sleep inertia within a single recording session. The test allows each subject to act as his/her own control, thus increasing sensitivity. In the present series, it proved to be much more discriminative than waking ERPs alone to demonstrate specific abnormalities in patients complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness.

The internal consistency analysis revealed only weak correlations for linear regression slopes based on high intensity levels when compared to slopes based on low intensity levels. For base-to-peak and peak-to-peak ERP component measurements, acceptable internal consistency and temporal stability were confirmed for the N1/P2-based slope, and partly for the P2 slope, whereas pi, NI, and P1/N1 slopes were not reliable. After submitting auditory evoked potentials to a covariance-based principal component analysis (PCA), followed by unsealed varimax rotation, temporal stability of slope measures for the corresponding factor scores substantially increased. The findings suggest that at least five to six intensity-levels are required over a relatively broad range to yield a reliable measure of auditory evoked augmenting/reducing. If measured reliably, P2 slopes may reflect stimulus intensity changes more precisely than N1/P2 slopes, and should therefore be evaluated in future studies of individual differences in augmenting/reducing.

Patients and methods: From a randomized study in high-risk breast cancer patients on the efficacy of high-dose versus standard-dose adjuvant chemotherapy, late effects on cognitive functioning were analyzed by neuropsychological tests. Cognitive impairment was found in 32% of the HD group, 17% of the SD group and in 9% of a control group of stage I breast cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients in the HD group and 16 consecutive patients in the SD group neurophysiological tests were performed, consisting of P300 and qEEG. Results of patients treated with chemotherapy were compared with results of 14 control patients not treated with chemotherapy. All patients were tested two years after treatment. Results: Asymmetry of the alpha rhythm of greater than or equal to0.5 Hz was found in 7 HD patients, 2 SD patients and in none of the control patients (p = 0.01). No differences were found between the groups with regard to frequency of alpha rhythm, alpha blocking and latency of P300. No correlation was found between neurophysiological parameters and neuropsychological performance, except for an overall relation between the P300 latencies and the total number of deviant test scores. Conclusion: Although the neurophysiological differences are subtle and the relation with the cognitive functioning in individual patients as measured by the neuropsychological examination is equivocal, the results suggest that there is neurophysiological support for cognitive dysfunction as a late complication of high-dose systemic chemotherapy in breast cancer.

Hemodynamic measures (WRI and PET) indicate their location, and electromagnetic measures (magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography) reveal the timing of brain activity during language processing. Their combination can show the spatiotemporal characteristics (where and when) of the underlying neural network. Activity to written and spoken words starts in sensory-specific areas and progresses anteriorly via respective ventral ("what") processing streams toward the simultaneously active supramodal regions. The process of understanding a word in its current context peaks about 400 ms after word onset. It is carried out mainly through interactions of the temporal and inferior prefrontal areas on the left during word reading and bilateral temporo-prefrontal areas during speech processing. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that lexical access, semantic associations, and contextual integration may be simultaneous as the brain uses available information in a concurrent manner, with the final goal of rapidly comprehending verbal input. Because the same areas may participate in multiple stages of semantic or syntactic processing, it is crucial to consider both spatial and temporal aspects of their interactions to appreciate how the brain understands words.

BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS & COMPUTERS			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SPEECH STIMULI; REPLICABILITY; CHILDREN; REPRESENTATION; STABILITY; DURATION	To make the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording procedure more tolerable, listeners have been allowed in some experiments to watch an audible video while their auditory P1, N1, P2, and mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potentials (ERPs) to experimental sounds have been measured. However, video sounds may degrade auditory ERPs to experimental sounds. This concern was tested with 19 adults who were instructed to ignore standard and deviant tones presented through headphones while they watched a video with the soundtrack audible in one condition and silent in the other. Video sound impaired the size, latency, and split-half reliability of the MMN, and it decreased the size of the P2. However, it had little effect on the P1 or N1 or on the split-half reliability of the P1-N1-P2 waveform, which was significantly more reliable than the MMN waveform. regardless of whether the video sound was on or off. The impressive reliability of the P1 and N1 components allows for the use of video sound during EEG recording, and they may prove useful for assessing auditory processing in listeners who cannot tolerate long testing sessions.

Method: Visual identification (digits) and classification (dot-enumeration) tasks were presented to 18 drug-naive, first-onset schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. It is assumed that enumeration of more than three dots requires additional cognitive processes as, buffering and re-focusing of attention. Reaction-times and 21-channel-EEG were measured. For eye-movement artefact-elimination a new non-parametric regression approach was applied. Results: Reaction-times revealed that in the patient group response selection is lengthened in both tasks. Perception of dot numbers is not affected. Bioelectrical data depicted a left-lateralization of posterior P100 and N100 in the patient group as well as an enhanced fronto-central P200. Conclusion: Whereas in reaction-times of patients only a disturbance of selection is discernible, bioelectrical measurements also point to an altered organization of perceptive processes.

The second group showed an alpha peak at a higher frequency and an evoked potential closer to normality. The decrease in the voltage of the P300 wave in group I was especially significant. The cognitive evoked potentials were also different between the two groups.

A group of 10 normal young volunteers underwent the experiment. The EEG signal was recorded through the 10-20 acquisition system during the execution of a task after a visual input. Each subject repeated the movement several times in three different conditions: i) without knowledge of the performance; ii) with visual feedback; iii) with knowledge of the result. The signal was transformed through Laplacian operator in order to eliminate the spurious coherence and then time-variant coherence was calculated. Different trends of the coherence function have been evidenced in subjects learning and not learning the better movement strategy. In particular, relations have been found between frontal, central and occipital electrodes in medium and high frequency ranges.

One main goal of research is to help patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities by substituting normal motor outputs. Various cortical processes were identified which are suitable for implementing such a system on basis of scalp recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), e.g., slow cortical potentials (SCP) and event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of 10-20 Hz brain rhythms. Until quite recently BCI systems used only few EEG channels but by use of advanced machine learning techniques it became possible to exploit the spatial information provided by multi-channel EEG. While the use of such high density spatial sampling increases the accuracy of the system it may-depending on the computational effort of the signal processing-pose a problem for the implementation of the feedback in real-time. Here we propose a method that offers a substantial speed-up for classification of SCP features as used in the Berlin Brain computer interface (BBCI) [1]. Instead of applying the time consuming low-pass filtering to all, say 120, EEG channels a suitable spatial projection extracts only 2 or 4 new channels which can be used without any loss of classification accuracy in our experiments. Our approach is based on the technique of common spatial patterns (CSP) which were suggested in [2] to extract ERD features from EEG. While in its original form CSP is only applicable to oscillatory features we present a new variant which allows to use CSP for SCP features without regularisation even in case of large channel numbers or few training samples.

Methods: In order to avoid a confounding on the measurement level, induced band power (IBP) was used as a measure that is devoid of the influence of evoked components. The EEG was recorded during a recognition memory task. Results: The results show that compared to correctly rejected words, targets (remembered words) elicit a significantly larger P300. An oscillatory old/new effect was found for the delta and theta but not for the alpha band. It is manifested by an increase in delta and theta IBP which is significantly larger for targets than for correctly rejected words. It can be observed during the same time interval and shows the same topographic distribution as the ERP old/new effect. Most importantly, however, the ERP old/new effect (as well as the P300 itself) is generated by very slow frequencies which Lie below the delta band. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the two types of old/new effects are functionally related. Possible physiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are discussed in terms of a threshold change in the cortex (generating the P300) that occurs during an increase in hippocampal theta activity (generating an increase in induced theta power).

Likewise, deficits in rapid auditory processing of both verbal and nonverbal stimuli are characteristic of individuals with developmental language disorders such as Specific Language Impairment. Auditory processing abilities are well developed in infancy; and thus such deficits should be detectable in infants. In tire studies presented here, converging methodologies are used to examine such abilities in infants with and without a family history, of language disorder. Behavioral measures, including assessments of infant information processing, and an EEG/event-related potential (ERP) paradigm are used concurrently. Results suggest that rapid auditory, processing skills differ as a function of family history and are predictive of later language outcome. Further, these paradigms may prove to be sensitive tools for identifying children with poor processing skills in infancy and thus at a higher risk for developing a language disorder.

Six healthy subjects performed single self-paced extensions of the right index finger at about 15-s intervals during EEG and event-related fMRI acquisitions. EEG was recorded from 58 scalp electrodes, and fMRI of the entire brain was obtained every 2.6 s. Coordinates of the two methods were coregistered using anatomical landmarks. During dipole source modeling, a realistic three-layer head model was used as a volume conductor. To identify the number of uncorrelated sources in the MRCP, principal component (PC) analysis was performed, which was consistent with the existence of six sources in the left (Lt SM1) and right (Rt SM1) sensorimotor and medial frontocentral (WC) areas. After dipoles were seeded at the activated spots revealed by fMRI, dipole orientations were fixed based on the interpretation of the topography of distribution of the PC. The strength of the six dipoles (three dipoles in Lt SM1, two in Rt SM1, and one in MFC) was then computed over time. Within the bilateral SM1, activation of the precentral gyrus occurs bilaterally with similar strength from -1.2 s, followed by that of the precentral bank from -0.5 s with contralateral preponderance. Subsequently, the postcentral bank becomes active only on the contralateral side at 0.1 s after movement. Activation of the MFC shows timing similar to that of the bilateral precentral gyri. These deduced patterns of activation are consistent with previous studies of electrocorticography in humans.

Brain activity was mapped during the performance of a somatosensory single reaction and a choice reaction task at high spatiotemporal resolution in six healthy subjects. The choice reaction task required a categorization of two different stimulus intensities, whereas for the single reaction task merely the perception of a tactile stimulus had to be confirmed by the subjects. An offline artifact correction algorithm was applied to 32-channel EEG data that were acquired between subsequent MRI scans. Using a multiple dipole approach, five distinct dipole sources were identified within areas of the somatosensory system. Coregistration of fMRI and DSL showed consistent spatial activation patterns with a mean distance of 9.2 +/- 6.8 mm between dipole sources and fMRI activation maxima. However, since the number of fMRI activation sites exceeded the number of cerebral dipole sources, it was not possible to assign a dipole source to each fMRI activation site. Dipole moment time courses were consistent with previously reported results of similar experiments. A comparison of brain activation patterns during the two tasks with both fMRI and DSL indicated an involvement of the contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex in somatosensory categorization.

Background.-The term posttraumatic syndrome defines a stereotypic set of symptoms following traumatic brain injury that are subjective and varied. A deficit of cognitive function and impairment of the rapid processes of learning, attention, and short-term memory have frequently been identified. Moreover, headache is the most frequent symptom reported by the patients. Due to the nature of the symptoms, a great limitation in defining the posttraumatic syndrome is represented by the lack of methods and diagnostic tools that allow quantification of the subjective disturbances and evidence of the signs indicative of central nervous system involvement in this pathological condition. Methods.-Twenty-five subjects (16 women, 9 men; mean age, 28 +/- 9 years) were examined between 3 and 6 months after the traumatic event. The P300 event-related potential was recorded by an odd-ball paradigm with an acoustic modality. The patients underwent electroencephalography and brain stem auditory evoked potentials; magnetic resonance imaging was performed to exclude the presence of cerebral lesions. Results.-The mean latency of P300 was increased in both central electrodes (Cz and Pt) in patients with posttraumatic syndrome compared with controls (P < .001); assuming the value of mean +/- 2 SD was the cutoff point between normal and abnormal results, the P300 latency results were altered in 13 patients (52%). In the patient group, a significant correlation was demonstrated between Zung Depression Scale score and P3 and N2 wave latencies (r = 0.54, P < .004; r = 0.56, P < .003) and between Zung Anxiety Scale scores and P3 wave latencies (r = 0.46, P < .02). Conclusions.-These data suggest the usefulness of the P300 event-related potential in evaluating cognitive disturbances in patients affected by posttraumatic syndrome. Alteration of cognitive potential in such patients, even in the absence of lesions detectable by neuroimaging, indicate the functional impairment of specific cerebral areas that can occur after a traumatic event.

Results: Alcohol dependence was associated with a significant P300 amplitude at anterior electrode sites only Antisocial personality disorder was also associated with reduced P300 amplitudes at anterior electrode sites: however, the effects were only significant among subjects 30 years of age or younger To validate this association between ASPD and P300 amplitude a correlational analysis was performed, the Correlation between anterior P300 amplitude and the total number of childhood conduct disorder and adult ASPD symptoms was significant. Conclusions: The P300 amplitude decrement found at anterior electrode sites among subjects with ASPD is consistent with the results of numerous ERP, neuroimaging, or neuropsychologic studies of anterior brain function. Our study is unique in suggesting that the effects of ASPD on anterior brain function are best detected during early adulthood. The study also suggests that the detrimental neurotphysiologic effects of alcohol dependence predominantly involve the anterior brain, (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 11 participants under conditions of caffeine (250 mg) and placebo. Results: Spatial-selective attention effects were reflected in the ERPs as more positive going occipital P1 and broadly distributed P2 components, and more negative going occipital-temporal N1 and broadly distributed N2 components. A treatment effect was found as a more positive going frontal P2 component in the caffeine condition, whereas interactions between treatment and attention were observed for P2 and N2 components, but not for P1 and N1 components. Conclusions: This pattern of results suggests that caffeine has no specific influence on spatial-selective attention, but rather, has a more general facilitating effect on perceptual processing, as well as a possible effect on the frontal control mechanisms, i.e. focusing attention and increasing selectivity.

The present study examined whether modest changes in end-ddal PCO2 (PETCO2; a noninvasive measure of PaCO2) affect electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, cognitive function, and vigilance. Nine adults were ventilated mechanically using a mouthpiece; respiratory rate and breath size were held constant while PETCO2 was set to levels that produced minimal discomfort. Despite discrete changes in EEG, neither acute PETCO2 increases (mean = 47 mmHg) nor decreases (mean = 30 mmHg) from resting levels (mean = 38 mmHg) affected performance on cognitive tasks, latency or amplitude of the N1, P2, or P3 event-related potential, or alertness. Modest changes in PETCO2 may cause significant alterations in the EEG without disturbing cognitive function.

J	Robinson, DL				Robinson, DL			The technical, neurological, and psychological significance of 'alpha', 'delta' and 'theta' waves confounded in EEG evoked potentials: a study of peak amplitudes	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						age; amplitude; arousal; EEG; evoked-potentials; intelligence; personality; sex	CEREBRAL AROUSABILITY; INTELLIGENCE; EXTRAVERSION	In a complementary report, the analysis of peak latencies provided evidence that EEG averaged evoked potentials (AEPs) and event related potentials (ERPs) confound 'delta', 'theta', and 'alpha' frequency responses thought to be generated by the 'brain-stem', 'limbic', and 'thalamic' cortical activating systems, respectively. The present report deals with amplitude data obtained from the same sample of 93 adults by recording EEG responses to auditory tones and using narrow-band filters to distinguish '4 Hz','7 Hz', and '10 Hz' component waves that constitute the unfiltered AEP. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses of peak amplitudes provide additional evidence of the distinct and unitary nature of these component waves. Correlations with age, sex, and wakefulness variables confirm that the component waves are associated with systems that maintain behavioural arousal. The amplitude results extend the latency findings by revealing the functional organisation of the three arousal systems in terms of excitatory and inhibitory projections. It is suggested that there are implications for future research on the physiology of brain arousal systems, and for the study of normal personality and temperament, as well as for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the monitoring of drug effects and therapies.

Functional brain imaging (fMRI), perfusion measurements and electrophysiological investigations such as EEG and MEG, multimodal evoked potentials, event-related potentials and reflex measurements have revealed many abnormal and even contradictory findings. These depend on the investigation time within the migraine cycle (interictual, aura and acute headache) and partly on the migraine subtype (migraine with or without aura). Dysfunctions of filter mechanisms protecting the brain from an overflow of sensory input might play a crucial role in inducing migraine attacks. Competing pathophysiological models suggest neuronal hyperexcitability within the CNS, but also hypoexcitability of the cerebral cortex as predisposing factors in migraine.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of treatment with donepezil 5 mg daily for 1 month on quantitative EEG (QEEG) in patients with AD. Treatment was associated with no significant differences between the pre-and post-treatment QEEGs for (1) absolute power (all four frequency bands), (2) percent relative power (all four frequency bands), (3) total mean frequency, (4) mean frequency for theta and beta, (5) absolute power asymmetry across homologous electrode pairs (all four frequency bands), and (6) interhemispheric coherence across homologous electrode pairs (all four frequency bands). There were significant decreases in mean alpha and delta frequencies that were consistent across broad electrode arrays except for an increase in the delta frequency at T3. The implications of these changes are not yet clear, Studies of QEEG changes With higher doses of donepezil over longer periods of time may yield a better understanding of the neurophysiological effects of the medication.

Using a small subset of QEEG and SEP baseline features, three subtypes (CLUS) were identified. CLUS 2 (n=25) and CLUS3 (n=23) replicated the published subtypes, while CLUS 1 (n=9) was previously undescribed. Cluster membership was significantly associated with length of stay in treatment (chi(2)=13.789, P<0.001), but not with length of exposure to crack cocaine or to any demographic or clinical features. Seventy-eight percent of CLUS 1 and 65% of CLUS 3 left treatment less than or equal to 25 weeks, whereas 80% of CLUS 2 remained in treatment> 25 weeks. The existence of outcome related subtypes may reflect: [1] differential neurophysiological vulnerability, "traits," predisposing individuals to cocaine addiction; or [2] differential neurosensitivity, "states," due to the effects of chronic cocaine exposure, and associated differences in treatment outcome. Using Variable Resolution Electrical Tomographic Analysis (VARETA), the mathematically most probable neuroanatomical source of the scalp recorded EEG data was localized. Computation of VARETA on the baseline Cluster profiles suggest significant differences in the underlying pathophysiology of these subtypes.

Thirteen patients, 6 currently receiving treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine; THA) and the remaining being medication free, were administered 2 mg of nicotine polacrilex under double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled conditions. Prior to nicotine administration, THA-treated patients exhibited shorter auditory P300 latencies than non-treated patients. Acutely administered nicotine failed to alter auditory P300, but increased the amplitudes of visual P300s in both DAT patient groups. Neither THA treatment nor single-dose nicotine altered behavioural performance in the visual and auditory task paradigms. The results are discussed in relation to nicotinic cholinergic, attentional and cognitive processes in DAT. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

On each trial, the subject decided whether to make manual response (Go) or not (NoGo). ERSP increased on both Go and NoGo trials in peri-Rolandic regions of all subjects with a peak latency of similar to 330-ms poststimulus and duration of 260 ms during the DR task. The peak of this ERSP increase preceded movement by similar to 300 ms. All subjects produced a subsequent movement specific ERSP decrease of peri-Rolandic mu rhythms (starting similar to 90 ms before the average reaction time) with an peak latency of similar to 800 ms and duration of similar to 520 ms. The LVD task produced bilateral movement-selective readiness potentials and reproduced the movement-specific late ERSP decreases seen in the DR task (strongest from 7-24 Hz). Furthermore, the LVD task demonstrated that the late movement-related ERSP decrease is larger for the contralateral hand. However, the LVD task did not consistently reproduce the early ERSP increase seen in the DR task. Movement-related ERSP decreases were widespread, occurring in pre- and post-Rolandic as well as primary-motor, supplemental motor, and cingulate cortical regions. Other cortical areas including frontal, temporal, and occipital regions did not show movement-related ERSP changes. Peri-Rolandic ERSP decreases in mu rhythms correlate with the generation of a motor command. The early increases in mu. may reflect a transient state of motor inhibition just prior to motor execution. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Methods: EEG was recorded during word and figure categorization of animals or non-animals in a-group of 28 children 8-10 years old. Computation of EEG sources in the frequency domain using variable resolution electrical tomography (VARETA) and their statistical evaluation by statistical parametric mapping were carried out. Results: At all frequencies, there were significant changes between EEG segments prior to the presentation of the stimuli and EEG segments recorded after the stimuli. Post-segments showed more power from 1.56 to 7.02 Hz, and less power than pre-segments from 8 to 12.48 Hz. EEG changes were only observed in the word task at: 3.9 (left occipital), 4.68, 5.46, and 6.24 Hz (temporo-occipital regions). These changes may be associated with visual encoding of words. Frequencies 7.8 and 17.94 Hz increased in prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal regions only during figure categorization. The prefrontal region may be related to object working memory. Thus, these frequencies might be related to figure codification. No significant differences between tasks were observed at 3.12 and 7.02 Hz in very wide brain areas (all lobes except occipital), suggesting that the amodal semantic system storage could be the model compatible with figure and word categorization. Conclusions: Thus, our results support the modified amodal semantic hypothesis, which advocates that the meanings of both kinds of stimuli are represented in a conceptual memory that receives input from the logogen and iconogen systems.

Changes in cortical oscillatory activity were assessed by recording the event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S) of mu and beta rhythms. Young and elderly subjects performed a distal movement, a proximal movement and a visuo-guided targeting movement. Our results demonstrated an increase in mu ERD over ipsilateral regions and showed the spatial extent of mu ERD over parietocentral and parietal regions during motor planning in elderly subjects compared to young ones. After the movement, the beta ERS was significantly modified (a decrease in slope and amplitude) in elderly subjects. The most pronounced age-related changes in ERD/S pattern were observed for the targeting movement. Our results suggest that motor planning is less efficient in elderly subjects. This deficit might result from impaired parietal integrative function and/or changes in inputs from subcortical structures. Subsequently, the changes observed in the post-movement phase might reflect a decrease in (reafferent) sensory inputs and hence impaired their input processing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

There is indeed a discrepancy between these two systems, because the brain is a highly complex nonlinear system, analyzed by a linear system (FFT). We present in this work some inaccuracies that occurred when EPs are subjected to spectral analysis, using a model signal. First of all, the EP power spectra depended upon the number of samples used for averaging; the input EP (model signal) and the output EP (from the system) seemed to be similar in forms, but they exhibited completely different spectral power curves. It was concluded that the spectral analysis of evoked responses by using FFT (linear system analysis) in relation to brain (highly complex nonlinear system) may mislead neuroscientists.

Event-related brain potentials and spectral power data were recorded from eight TBI participants and eight matched controls while they completed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task. The TBI group was found to be significantly impaired at the task compared to controls, and exhibited abnormal N2 and P3 waveform components in response to NoGo stimuli relative to controls. Significant correlations were also found between alpha power, Go-trial RT and errors. We conclude that abnormal activity in the structures damaged in this group may render such patients less capable of maintaining a state of alpha desynchronisation compared to controls, resulting in poorer performance on the task.

Measuring-off of Time Intervals: Correlations Between Peculiarities of Their Estimation and Parameters of EEG Phenomena, and Influence of the Subjects' Personality Features	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						measuring-off of time intervals; electroencephalogram; event-related EEG potentials; psychological features of personality		In 76 healthy persons (right-handed men and women), we recorded background EEG and event-related potentials from the C3 and C4 sites; tests were performed within the framework of an experimental situation requiring internal measuring-off of the time intervals. To limit the interval, the tested person had to push a button; he/she did not know the precise value of the interval, which was preset by the experimenter, and was informed only of the lower and upper limits of this interval, 17 to 23 sec. The person obtained information about the coincidence/noncoincidence of the measured-off and preset intervals via visual feedback; the respective signal was presented 2 sec after measuring-off had been completed. In the case where the intervals coincided with each other, the person should confirm this by pushing the button next time (confirming push). We characterized the parameters of the measured-off time interval by the following indices: (i) measuring-off efficacy (accuracy of fitting the preset interval), (ii) estimation tendency (measured-off interval/preset standard interval ratio), and (iii) coefficient of variation (CV) of the measured-off interval. Features of the subject's personality were estimated using Eysenck's (PEN) and Cattell's (16PF) questionnaires. We found correlations of the powers of the background EEG rhythms (beta1, beta2, and alpha/theta ratio) and characteristics of the measured-off time interval. In addition, we observed significant positive correlations between the estimation tendency and "extraversion" index and between CV of the interval and "urge toward domination" and "protension" indices. Negative correlations were observed between the measuring-off efficacy and "protension" (suspiciousness), between the estimation tendency and "anxiety, " and between the CV of the interval and age of the subjects. We support the conclusion that correlations between the patterns of EEG potentials, peculiarities of measuring-off of the time interval, and psychological features of the personality are to a noticeable extent mediated by the individual specificity of the neurodynamics.

EEGs were recorded while subjects performed easy and difficult versions of a spatial WM task. Groups were matched for IQ (mean = 123; WAIS-R) and practiced in task performance. Responses slowed with age, particularly in the more difficult task. Advanced age was associated with decreased amplitude and increased latency of the parietal P300 component of the event-related potential and an increase in the amplitude of a frontal P200 component. Spectral features of the EEG also differed between groups. Younger subjects displayed an increase in the frontal midline a rhythm with increased task difficulty, a result not observed in older subjects. Age-related changes were also observed in the task-related a signal, the amplitude of which decreases as more neurons become involved in task-related processing. Young adults showed a decrease in (rv power with increased task difficulty over parietal regions but not over frontal regions. Middle-aged and older adults showed decreased a power with increased task difficulty over both frontal and parietal regions. This suggests that normal aging may be associated with changes in the fronto-parietal networks involved with spatial WM processes. Younger subjects appear to use a strategy that relies on parietal areas involved with spatial processing, whereas older subjects appear to use a strategy that relies more on frontal areas.

Induced gamma band responses (GBRs) and phase synchrony between electrode sites are discussed as a signature of activity within a cell assembly. To examine the activation of this network due to memory recall, a paired associate learning paradigm was used. EEG was analyzed in the frequency domain. Results showed a significant increase of induced GBRs at posterior and anterior electrode sites in the recall sequence of the learning condition. Furthermore, phase synchrony revealed a broad distribution pattern of phase synchrony between posterior and frontal electrode sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An important part of ensemble averaging is to know the time reference that the signals should be averaged. In able-bodied individuals the muscle activity or switch activation is used to time-lock the averages. In people with spinal cord injuries who lack the ability to produce muscle activity, the expected time of the attempted movement based on an external cue can be used. This time is not accurate and can result in poor ensemble Averages. A method that automatically detects the onset of the movement related potentials and use this knowledge to time-lock the averages is introduced. This method is based on the estimation of the probability density distribution of the feature vectors related to spontaneous EEG. To estimate the probability density function Parzen's method is used which is known to be as the most accurate method when large population of data is available. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and show that the proposed-method could generate ensemble averages closer to the averages with muscle activity knowledge than the method based on an external cue.

Twelve normal subjects participated in the study. After encoding words from a study list presented in the first phase they had to discriminate old from new words mixed together in a test list presented during the second phase. All subjects performed two experimental sessions, one with exposure to EMF during the study phase, and one without. Exposure to EMF changed an early (350-400 ms) task-specific component of the ERMF indicating an interference of EMF and item encoding. Behavioural measures were not significantly affected. Adverse health effects cannot be derived from these data.

Previous studies have shown that in an auditive three-choice reaction-time task the discrimination is accomplished as a two-stage process, with the more frequently occurring stimulus discriminated at an earlier point than the rarer stimulus and the subjects could be classified as fast and slow responders in function of their response to the most frequent of the three tones. We continuously recorded the electrocerebral activity (EEG) from the scalp and the electromyographic activity (EMG) from the responding muscles in a visual three-choice reaction-time task in 10 strictly right-handed subjects. EEG and EMG responses were subsequently analyzed off-line by aligning them by the onset of either the stimulus (stimulus-synchronized) or the response (response-synchronized). The results suggest that processes of visual stimuli evaluation and response execution are continuously integrated. The discrimination and response systems to visual stimuli is accomplished as a three-stage process, one to frequent tone, another for rare 1, and the last for rare 2. The subjects were classified as fast and slow responders in function of their response to the most frequent of the three tones. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

Datasets of EEG segments were generated that contained cortical sources that were temporally overlapping or non-overlapping, and dipole sources with varying degree of spatial orthogonality. For temporal overlapping sources, both PCA and ICA resulted in components that required multiple-source equivalent current dipole models. The spatially overlapping sources affected the PCA method more than ICA, resulting in single PCA components in which all non-orthogonal sources were represented. For both PCA and ICA, dipole models with fixed-location dipoles successfully accounted for most of the variance in the component weights, even when the spatial or temporal overlap of the generating sources required multiple-dipole models.

We measured blood oxygenation level-dependent contrasts derived from the comparison of blocks of stimuli presented as a series of standard tones (50 ms duration) alone versus blocks that contained rare duration-deviant tones (100 ms) that were interspersed among a series of frequent standard tones while subjects were watching a silent movie. Possible effects of scanner noise were assessed by a "no tone" condition. In line with previous positron emission tomography and EEG source modeling studies, we found temporal lobe and prefrontal cortical activation that was associated with auditory duration mismatch processing. Data were also analyzed employing an event-related hemodynamic response model, which confirmed activation in response to duration-deviant tones bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus and prefrontally in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri. In line with previous electrophysiological reports, mismatch activation of these brain regions was significantly correlated with age. These findings suggest a close relationship of the event-related hemodynamic response pattern with the corresponding electrophysiological activity underlying the event-related "mismatch negativity" potential, a putative measure of auditory sensory memory.

Twenty-five inpatients were investigated after admission to the psychiatric clinic. Fifteen of them participated a second time, shortly before their discharge from the hospital. A group of healthy subjects, matched according to age and sex, served as a control. Chemsosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs) were recorded using the constant flow method. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs), in response to colors and emotional slides, were obtained to control modality and emotion-specific effects. The subjects' task was to discriminate the colors (red/yellow) and odors (phenyl-ethylalcohol = rose/isobutyraldehyde = rotten butter) according to their quality and to judge the valence of the emotional slides (IAPS slides). The EEG was recorded from 32 scalp locations. At the beginning of the therapy, visual stimulus processing was attenuated in depressive subjects at a relatively late processing level (reduced amplitudes of the P3 and pSW in response to colors and emotional slides), whereas olfactory stimulus processing had already been affected at an early level (reduced amplitudes of the P2 and P3-1 peaks in MDD patients). However, after successful medical treatment, ERPs did not differentiate between depressive patients and healthy controls. We discuss whether functional deviations within the primary olfactory cortex are responsible for the lower olfactory sensitivity, as well as for the altered emotional stimulus processing in MDD patients.

Using dipole source localization, we showed that the anatomical location of the grand mean equivalent dipole of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and the center of gravity of fMRI activity were in good agreement in the horizontal plane. However, the grand mean equivalent dipole was located significantly superior in the cortex compared to fMRI activity. Interhemispheric asymmetry was exhibited by fMRI, whereas neither the AEP dipole moments nor the mean global field power (MGFP) of the AEPs showed significant asymmetry. Increasing the number of recording electrodes from 64 to 128 improved the accuracy of the equivalent dipole source localization but decreased the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MR images. This suggests that 64 electrodes may be optimal for use in simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We addressed this issue using multi-channel EEG and beam-former estimates of distributed current sources within the head. The categories of leg-, arm-, and face-related words were carefully matched for important psycholinguistic factors, including word frequency, imageability, valence, and arousal, and evaluated in a behavioral study for their semantic associations. EEG was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes while stimuli were presented visually in a reading task. We applied a linear beam-former technique to obtain optimal estimates of the sources underlying the word-evoked potentials. These suggested differential activation in frontal areas of the cortex, including primary motor, pre-motor, and pre-frontal sites. Leg words activated dorsal fronto-parietal areas more strongly than face- or arm-related words, whereas face-words produced more activity at left inferior-frontal sites. In the right hemisphere, arm-words activated lateral-frontal areas. We interpret the findings in the framework of a neurobiological model of language and discuss the possible role of mirror neurons in the premotor cortex in language processing.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the frequency of the beta response is related to specific regions within the sensorimotor strip. Methods: Self-paced movement and electrical stimulation of the dominant hand and foot/leg was investigated in 10 right-handed volunteers. The electroencephalogram was recorded from closely spaced electrodes over central areas and processed time-locked to movement-offset or stimulation. In order to identify the dominant frequency of the induced beta oscillations. time-frequency maps were calculated using the continuous wavelet transformation. For the specific beta frequency bands. the band power time courses were analyzed by quantifying the event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). Results: Both limb movement and somatosensory stimulation induced bursts of beta oscillations appearing within I s after movement/ stimulation with a clear focus close to the corresponding sensorimotor representation area. The peak frequency was significantly lower over the hand area (below similar to 20 Hz) than at mid-central sites overlying the foot representation area (above similar to 20 Hz). But no difference was found between movement and stimulation of the respective limb. Conclusions: Analyzing the frequency of induced beta activity revealed concomitant oscillations at slightly different frequencies over neighboring cortical areas. These oscillations might be indicative for a resonance-like behavior of connected sub-networks in sensorimotor areas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

The observed changes were different in the anterior (decrease in the degree of coherence) and posterior (increase in coherence) areas of the cortex. Context-related increase in the local coherence was more pronounced in the temporal, parietal, and occipital areas of the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere.

The method makes use of an empirically derived beam-forming filter (derived from a sequence of calibrated eye movements) to isolate eye motion from other electrophysiological and ambient electrical signals. Electrophysiological researchers may find this method a simple and inexpensive means of tracking eye movements and a useful complement to scalp recordings in studies of cognitive phenomena. The resolution is comparable to that of many commercial systems; the method can be implemented with as few as four electrodes around the eyes to complement the EEG electrodes already in use. This method may also find some specialized applications such as studying eye movements during sleep and in human-machine interfaces that make use of gaze information.

EEG signals, however, especially those recorded from frontal channels, often contain strong electro-oculogram (EOG) artifacts produced by eye movements. Existing regression-based Methods for removing EOG artifacts require various procedures for preprocessing and calibration that are inconvenient and time-consuming. The paper describes a method for removing ocular artifacts based on adaptive filtering. The method uses separately recorded vertical EOG and horizontal EOG signals as two reference inputs. Each reference input is first processed by a finite impulse response filter of length M (M=3 in this application) and then subtracted from the original EEG. The method is implemented by a recursive least-squares algorithm that includes a forgetting factor (lambda = 0.9999 in this application) to track the non-stationary portion of the EOG signals. Results from experimental data demonstrate that the method is easy to implement and stable, converges fast and is suitable for on-line removal of EOG artifacts. The first three coefficients (up to M = 3) were significantly larger than any remaining coefficients.

J	Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ				Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ			Removal of ocular artifact from the EEG: a review	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						AAA; artifact; correction; EEG; EOG; ocular; RAAA	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; EOG ARTIFACTS; BLINK; TIME; P300	Eye movements cause changes to the electric fields around the eyes, and consequently over the scalp. As a result, EEG recordings are often significantly distorted, and their interpretation problematic. A number of methods have been proposed to overcome this problem, ranging from the rejection of data corresponding temporally to large eye movements, to the removal of the estimated effect of ocular activity from the EEG (EOG correction). This paper reviews a number of such methods of dealing with ocular artifact in the EEG, focusing on the relative merits of a variety of EOG correction procedures. Issues discussed include the distinction between frequency and time domain approaches, the number of EOG channels required for adequate correction, estimating correction coefficients from raw versus averaged data, differential correction of different types of eye movement, the most suitable statistical procedure for estimating correction coefficients, the use of calibration trials for the estimation of correction coefficients, and the distinction between 'coefficient estimation' and 'correction phase' error. A suggested EOG correction algorithm is also described. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) reduces brain serotonin and allows the study of this neurotransmitter in patient groups. Serotonin modulates electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, which is abnormal in bipolar disorder, and EEG abnormalities persist in euthymic bipolar patients. The EEG may therefore be a sensitive marker of 5-HT function in bipolar disorder. Aims: This study examined the effects of ATD on mood, suicidal ideation and EEG activity in bipolar patients who were symptomatically stable on lithium. Methods: 19 subjects satisfying DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder participated in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled random-order crossover study Following acute tryptophan depletion (induced by a 100g amino acid drink following an overnight fast) symptoms were evaluated, quantitative power spectrum brain mapping and measurement of auditory evoked potentials were carried out. Results: ATD produced a significant fall in the amplitude of N1P2 and P-300 components of the auditory evoked potential, but no significant changes in the power spectrum. There was an 83% reduction in plasma tryptophan (p<0.05, paired t-test) after the depleting but not the control drink. No significant changes in mood or suicidality scores were recorded after ATD. Conclusions: ATD attenuates auditory evoked potentials in bipolar disorder but does not reverse lithium's effects on mood and suicidality in bipolar disorder.

One of the fundamental problems encountered in memory research is how specific and complementary cortical structures interact with each other during episodic encoding and retrieval. A key aspect of the research described below was estimating the coupling of rapid transition processes (in terms of EEG description) which occur in separate cortical areas rather than estimating the routine phase-frequency synchrony in terms of correlation and coherency. It is assumed that these rapid transition processes in the EEG amplitude correspond to the "switching on/off" of brain elemental operations. By making a quantitative estimate of the EEG structural synchrony of alpha-band power between different EEG channels, it was shown that short-term memory has the emergent property of a multiregional neuronal network, and is not the product of strictly hierarchical processing based on convergence through association regions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the dynamic temporal structure of alpha activity is strongly correlated to the dynamic structure of working memory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, the origin of these changes is still unclear. The present study investigated the effect of a family history (FH) of psychotic disorders in first-degree relatives on computed tomographic (CT) measures (ventricular, cerebral and Sylvian fissure size) and auditory event-related potentials (amplitudes and latencies of peak components in oddball paradigms) in 30 schizophrenic patients and 24 bipolar type I patients. We found a significant correlation between FH and the size of the right Sylvian fissure, and between FH and auditory P200 amplitude. More specifically, the schizophrenic and bipolar patients with negative FH (n = 36) had larger right Sylvian fissures and smaller P200 amplitude than patients with positive FH (n = 18). These findings were independent of the specific diagnosis, gender, and age of subjects. Our results suggest some underlying process common to schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, and they provide support for the continuum view of the nosologic structure of psychotic illness.

The first step is to assess any remaining function. There are six inflexion points in the decision-making process. These depend on the functional status of the patient: 1) some residual movement; 2) no movement, but some residual electromyographic (EMG) activity; 3) fully locked-in with no EMG activity or movements but with conjugate eye movements; 4) same as 3 but with disconjugate eye movements; 5) same as 4 but with inadequate assistance from the available EEG-based systems; 6) same as 5 and accepting of an invasive system.

During all stages of registration, Taylor Manifest Anxiety and Spielberger state anxiety (SA) and trait anxiety (TA) scores were positively related to alpha and negatively to delta relative power with these relations being independent of cortical site. Within-subject estimate of the strength of reciprocal relationship between alpha and delta oscillations (alpha-delta anticorrelation, or ADA) was positively related to trait anxiety and depression. Three minutes after an alarming event (unexpected loud sound), a further increase of alpha power was observed. In low-anxiety subjects, this increase was mostly associated with fast alpha (alpha 3), whereas in high-anxiety ones, it was mainly linked to slow alpha (alpha 2). SA mediated relationship between TA and EEG power, while ADA and alpha band reactivity showed trait-like features being associated with TA even after accounting for SA. These findings are interpreted as an indication of higher vigilance and higher reactivity of alpha system in anxious individuals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BLIND SEPARATION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; POWER	For forty years, much human electrophysiologic thinking has been based on the concept that EEG data recorded from the scalp following sensory stimulation are dominated by successive far-field correlates of bottom-up brain sensory processing, as represented in evoked potential (EP) averages. I will present evidence for an alternate view that human EEG data are dominated by by oscillatory processes relating to time-varying, top-down control of cortical dynamics and attention. This view suggests a reorientation of scientific and engineering focus towards modeling brain dynamics of humans as active operators rather than as passive perceivers and programmed responders. Such research presents new engineering challenges. There is a need, first, to understand and model the process of partial phase resetting of ongoing and intermittent nonlinear oscillatory processes, and more generally, of inter-process synchronization. It is probable that real time signal processing capable of separating EEG processes from nonbrain signals and of monitoring brain synchronization events may allow high-level cognitive monitoring that could be used in man-machine interfaces and for neuropsychological training.

Although this early activity embodies features of visual responses (short latency. stimulus-dependency). its sensory nature has been questioned. We investigated neural correlates of visuomotor performance in human motor areas using scalp and intracranial event-related potential measures. A simple visuomanual reaction-time task evoked early potentials at 133-145 ms post-stimulus which occurred much earlier than the motor potentials of the same region. The amplitude of the early potentials covaried with stimulus location and was independent of parameters of the motor response. Because of their timing, stimulus-dependency and characteristics of our behavioral task, the early potentials are suggested to reflect neuronal responses of sensory nature rather than processing related to pure motor aspects of the task.

Methods: Subject, consisted of 184 boys with ADHD and 40 age-matched controls. EEG was recorded from 21 sites during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to provide estimates for total power, and relative power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. and for the theta/beta ratio. Factor analysis was used to group sites into 3 regions, covering frontal. central and posterior regions. These data were subjected to cluster analysis. Results: Three distinct EEG clusters of children with ADHD were found. These were characterized by (a) increased slow wave activity and deficiencies of fast wave. (b) increased high amplitude theta with deficiencies of beta activity, and (c) an excess beta group. Conclusions: These results indicate that children with ADHD do not constitute a homogenous group in EEG profile terms. This has important implications for studies of the utility of EEG in the diagnosis of ADHD. Efforts aimed at using EEG as a tool to discriminate ADHD children from normals must recognize the variability within the ADHD population if such a tool is to be valid and reliable in clinical practice.

Effects of caffeine on human cognition are diverse. Behavioural measurements indicate a general improvement in the efficiency of information processing after caffeine, while the EEG data support the general belief that caffeine acts as a stimulant. Studies using ERP measures indicate that caffeine has an effect on attention, which is independent of specific stimulus characteristics. Behavioural effects on response related processes turned out to be mainly related to more peripheral motor processes. Recent insights in adenosine and dopamine physiology and functionality and their relationships with fatigue point to a possible modulation by caffeine of mechanisms involved in the regulation of behavioural energy expenditure.

It is widely accepted that this increase in time reflects the mental rotation of the stimulus to the upright orientation in order to determine the mirror-normal status of the stimulus. Although response times tend to be longer for mirrored stimuli than for normal stimuli, the difference is constant across orientation. Little work has been focused on why mirror-image stimuli produce longer response times than normal stimuli. This study examines the question of whether or not mirrored stimuli are rotated in the picture plane at the same time as normal stimuli, and if so, why response times to mirrored stimuli are longer than that for normal stimuli. Both the behavioural and electrophysiological findings suggest that the mirrored stimuli are not only rotated in the picture plane, but that they are subsequently rotated to the normal view. It is this additional rotation that produces, at least in part, the delayed response times for mirror-image stimuli. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main issue under investigation was whether anticipatory processes impinged upon cortical areas in sequential or parallel mode. Compared with the control condition, in the experimental condition there was an Alpha 1 desynchronization over the central midline, an Alpha 2 desynchronization increasing over primary sensorimotor areas, and an Alpha 3 desynchronization increasing in parallel over bilateral primary sensorimotor areas. These processes had different temporal features. Results disclose an anticipatory activity of central midline areas and primary sensorimotor areas in both parallel and sequential modes. This reflects an adaptive, energy-consuming strategy rather than an economic waiting for the go stimulus.

Auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 11 right-handed females using a passive oddball paradigm, with /pemu/ and /pomu/ as standard stimuli, differing only with respect to the first syllable. Topographic differences in the N100 were observed between the standards: /pemu/ had larger amplitudes than /pomu/ at more posterior electrode sites whereas a reverse pattern was found at more anterior positions along the midline. This topographic difference can be explained by different generators for the two stimuli. Different vowels and/or the initial formant transition possibly activate different neural populations in the auditory cortex, also when the vowels are embedded in pseudo-words.

These tasks were used earlier in PET and high density ERP recordings studies (Posner and Raichle, 1997; Abdullaev and Posner, 1998), in which both the functional anatomy and the time course of cortical areas involved in word processing were described. The wavelet transforms of ERP records and the calculation of correlations between wavelet curves were used to reveal connections between cortical areas. Three stages of intracortical communications while task performance were found. These were: (1) the connections between right and left frontal and central areas which preceded stimulus delivery and persisted up to 180 ms after it; (2) the network connecting right and left frontal with left posterior temporal-parietal junction at 280-450 ms; and (3) communications between left and right temporal zones in 550-800 ms. The data are in good agreement with results of previous PET and ERP studies and supply the earlier findings with circuitry of cortical information transfer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These enhancements are generally attributed to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, while there is some debate whether the effects of smoking/nicotine are a result of recovery from abstinence. Evoked potentials (EPs) and event related potentials (ERPs) of the brain have been applied as an index of information processing in a wide variety of normal and cognitive impaired subjects. This study, was carried out on 20 health students (23 +/- 2.3 years old) from the medical faculty of 007 University. Study population. comprised ten chronic cigarette smokers consuming an average of 14 +/- 4.2 cigarettes per day, with a history of smoking for more than one year. Ten non-smokers served as control. Standard oddball paradigm was presented, and EEG activity was recorded at the F-z, C-z, P-z electrode sites. Twenty responses to target stimuli were averaged at each location. N1, P2, N2, and P300 components were evaluated in these recordings. Amplitudes were measured relative to prestimulus baseline, and peak latencies were defined as the time point of maximum amplitude. It was found that there were no significant differences between either N1, P2, N2, P300 amplitudes or peak latency values of cigarette smokers and non smokers. As a result, chronic cigarette smoking generally does not improve cognitive processing.

When oscillatory activities are going to be studied, the time-domain EEG signal can be analyzed via Fourier or wavelet transform. However the loss of temporal information after Fourier transform and the unavailability of phase information in wavelet transform limit their applicability in EEG analysis. In this paper, multi-channel Fourier packet transform is introduced. The algorithm resembles the wavelet packet transform by its binary tree search for an optimal selection of orthogonal basic, but extends the application to the multi-channel scenario. It aims to provide a sparse signal representation to localize features in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain. Since the decomposed atoms are spatially coherent components, analysis of time-varying synchrony across scalp locations is then possible.

The manifestation of the N2pc at central electrode sites is commonly attributed to electric volume conduction effects, assuming the N2pc to be generated in occipito-temporal brain areas. We evaluated this explanation in a simulation study. Methods: Using a forward modeling approach with a realistically shaped volume conduction model, we calculated the range of amplitude ratios between occipital and central electrode sites when a single source is assumed in area V4 or in area TO, at the temporo-occipital convexity. Results: A comparison of the simulated amplitude ratios with reported data indicates that volume conduction effects from the investigated source origins in the occipito-temporal region are insufficient to explain the experimental data. Conclusions: We conclude that the anterior spread of the N2pc from its occipito-temporal maximum to central electrode sites is probably due to simultaneous attention-related activity in posterior and central brain areas.

To evaluate age-related electrophysiological changes in working memory processing, we applied the same neuropsychological paradigm and compared densities of the PNwm component in 17 young (mean age: 26) and 17 healthy elderly individuals (mean age: 75). Both age groups displayed a PNwm component during the two working memory tasks. For the 1-back task, densities were similar in both young and elderly individuals. In contrast, PNwm densities increased with higher memory load (2-back>1-back) in the younger but not in the older group. This difference was mainly observed over parietal electrodes suggesting an impaired activation of neural generators within this brain region. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis of decreased brain reserve in the elderly and provide evidence for age-related deficits in the recruitment of posterior cortical neurons with increasing working memory load.

An opportunity to test this hypothesis was provided by the recent discovery of 4, 7, and 10 Hz response waves confounded in EEG averaged evoked potentials [Robinson, D. L. (1999b). The technical, neurological, and psychological significance of 'alpha' 'theta' and 'delta' waves confounded in EEG evoked potentials: 1. A study of peak latencies. Eleetroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 110, 1427-1434; (2000). The technical neurological, and psychological significance of 'alpha', 'delta', and 'theta' waves confounded in EEG evoked potentials: A study of peak amplitudes. Personality and Individual Differences, 28, 673-6931. These responses are attributed to the brain-stem, limbic, and thalamocortical arousal systems, respectively, and in the cited reports principal components analysis of data obtained from 93 participants confirmed the existence of predicted excitatory and inhibitory relationships. ANOVA was used in the present study to test the further prediction that there should be strong inhibition of the 4 Hz system by the 10 Hz system in melancholics (E-N+) and weak inhibition of the 4 Hz system in cholerics (E+N+), with median inhibition predicted for the other temperament types. There was a large and statistically significant difference between the mean scores on the PCA inhibition factor obtained for the temperament groups, with temperament defined in terms of high and low EPQ extraversion (E) and neuroticism (N) scores. The significance of these results is discussed with reference to fundamental questions raised by Pavlov's pioneering research but left unanswered for the best part of a century. Implications for the future conduct of personality research are also considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the typical finding in the present study was a high number of correlations involving the frontal lobes, mainly the prefrontal portions, which is at variance with the patterns of normal subjects. Frontal lobes, especially the prefrontal regions, seem to be affected, regardless of its aetiology, in subjects with intellectual disability.

J	Wang, LW; Hari, C; Chen, LX; Jacob, T				Wang, LW; Hari, C; Chen, LX; Jacob, T			A new non-invasive method for recording the electro-olfactogram using external electrodes	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electro-olfactogram; EEG; evoked potential; event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULATION; EPITHELIUM; OLFACTION; RESPONSES; MUCOSA; ODOR; AGE	Objective: The aim of this investigation was to explore the possibility of recording the electro-olfactogram (EOG) using external electrodes placed on the root of the nose on either side of the bridge and at the medial termination of the eyebrows. The EOG is considered to be the summated generator potential of olfactory receptor cells and therefore represents peripheral olfactory events. Recording of human EOG is technically difficult due to poor access to the olfactory mucosa and the nasal irritation is tolerated by few subjects. Methods: The evoked potentials at these sites in response to two odourants, n-amyl acetate and benzaldchyde, were recorded simultaneously with the EOG, recorded conventionally with an intranasal electrode, and the olfactory event-related potential (OERP) recorded using scalp electrodes. Results: The extranasal potential recorded at the root of the nose, 0.5-1 cm below the nasion, 1 cm from the ridge and ipsilateral with the stimulus, had the highest degree of correlation with the intranasal EOG. We refer to this site as NI (left side) and N2 (right side). Further analysis demonstrated that the latency, the time constant of the rising phase and the amplitude of the evoked potential recorded at N1 also had a higher correlation coefficient with the EOG than did those potentials recorded at other sites. Statistical analysis indicated that the latency and time constant of the response recorded externally at N1 were the same as those of the EOG recorded intranasally. Conclusions: We conclude that an olfactory evoked potential, with many of the characteristics of the EOG recorded from the olfactory mucosa, can be recorded externally at a site close to the bridge of the nose. Significance: This non-invasive method of recording the EOG will have benefits for the objective assessment of olfactory function. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

One possible neuronal mechanism for repetition printing is 'repetition suppression' within a cell assembly coding the stimulus. Recently, induced gamma band responses (GBRs) were discussed as a possible physiological correlate of activity in such a cell assembly. The present EEG study was designed to investigate the modulation of induced GBRs when line drawings were presented either once or consecutively two or three times. Results showed a broad distribution of spectral gamma power and synchrony after initial picture presentation, Repeated presentations of the same picture led to a decrease of induced gamma power and less synchronized activity between distant electrode sites. The decrease of induced GBRs and synchrony after repeated picture presentations may be linked to a,neural savings' mechanism within a cell assembly representing an object. Furthermore, the visual evoked potential, which was modulated by priming, showed a topographically different distribution compared to induced GBRs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been suspected to be clinically useful in cognitive abnormalities and a correlation with attentional and memory functions has been found. The present study tries to validate the translation and adaptation of the English paradigm to the Catalan and Spanish languages. Method: The study was performed on 16 healthy volunteers with Catalan native language and 16 volunteers with Spanish native language. Three blocks of 50 sentences (4-9 words) were administered using headphones. The last word of 50 % of the sentences was incongruent. The beginning of this word was the trigger for the EEG average. EEG leads used were: Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, C4, T3, T4 with biauricular reference. The measures were amplitude and latency of the potential obtained after the subtraction of the EEG average of congruent and incongruent sentences. A t-test for one sample (the original potential) was applied. Results: Amplitude and latency of the potential obtained by the Catalan and Spanish languages were. not result statistically different from the original potential. The major amplitude was obtained in Cz. Mean amplitudes: Catalan language: 5.3 +/- 2.3 muV (95 % CI for the difference: -0.39 +/- 2.12 muV); Spanish language: 5.2 +/- 2.3 muN (95 % CI for the difference: -0.43 +/-2.32 muV). Conclusions: The Catalan and Spanish version of the N400 evoked potential offer the possibility to use an objective instrument for the study of language in neuroscience.

Short durations were used ranging from 500 to 900 ms, among which participants had to discriminate a previously memorized 700-ms "standard" duration. Behavioral results show accurate but variable performance within and between participants with expected modality effects: the percentage of responses was greater and the mean response time was shorter for auditory than for visual signals. Sustained electric and magnetic activities were obtained correlatively to duration estimation, but with distinct spatiotemporal properties. Electric CNV-Iike potentials showed fronto-central negativity in both modalities, whereas magnetic sustained fields were distributed with respect to the modality of the interval to be timed. Time courses of these slow brain activities were found to be dependent on stimulus duration but not on its modality nor on the recording signal (EEG or MEG). Source reconstruction demonstrated that these sustained potentials/fields were generated by superimposed contributions from visual and auditory cortices (sustained sensory responses, SSR) and from prefrontal and parietal regions. By using these two complementary techniques, we thus demonstrated the involvement of frontal and parietal cerebral cortex in human timing. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

It is natural in the sense of that the desired movement is what the subject intends to do. The motor tasks to be intended are the imagination of hand grasping and opening. For prosthetic hand grasp control, the discrimination of the resting state and the imagined voluntary movement is important that has been disregarded in the research area of BCI. This work provides a design for discriminating the resting state and the motor task imagery. To date most researchers have designed and test BCI system on normal subjects. In this work, the experiments were conducted on people with severe physical disabilities. One of the major problem in developing real-time BCI is the eye blink suppression. In this work, the eye blink artifact is suppressed by a neural adaptive noise canceller. This is a concern in real time application. We employ the multilayer perceptron with back-propagation learning rule for EEG classification. Preliminary results indicate that the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns at primary motor cortex and occipito-temporal recording sites is higher than that at other sites. An average correct classification rate of 83% is achieved using samples of the single-channel EEG signal.

Methods For 65 aluminum welders and 25 current mild steel welders body burden was estimated, and the aluminum concentrations in serum (S-AI) and urine (U-AI) were analyzed with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman background correction. Referents and low-exposure and high-exposure groups were defined according to an aggregated measure of aluminum body burden, the group median S-Al levels being 0.08, 0.14, and 0.46 mu mol/l, respectively, and the corresponding values for U-Al being 0.4, 1.8, and 7.1 mu mol/l. Central nervous system functions were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery, symptom and mood questionnaires, a visual and quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG), and P3 event-related potentials with pitch and duration paradigms. Results Subjective symptoms showed exposure-related increases in fatigue, mild depression, and memory and concentration problems. Neuropsychological testing revealed a circumscribed effect of aluminum, mainly in tasks demanding complex attention and the processing of information in the working memory system and in the analysis and recall of abstract visual patterns. The visual EEG analysis revealed pathological findings only for aluminum welders. Mild, diffuse abnormalities were found in 17% of the low-exposure group and 27% of the high-exposure group, and mild to moderate epileptiform abnormalities at a frequency of 7% and 17%, respectively. Conclusions Both objective neurophysiological and neuropsychological measures and subjective symptomatology indicated mild but unequivocal findings dose-dependently associated with increased aluminum body burden. The study indicates that the body burden threshold for adverse effect approximates an U-Al value of 4-6 mu mol/l and an S-Al value of 0.25-0.35 mu mol/l among aluminum welders.

Some state- and trait-related issues of theta power increases in the EEG of alcoholics were also examined. Methods: Absolute theta (3-7 Hz) power in eyes-closed EEGs of 307 alcohol-dependent subjects and 307 age- and gender-matched unaffected controls were compared by using a repeated-measures ANOVA for the entire region and three subregions (frontal, central, and parietal) separately. Supplementary to the main analysis, the effect of three clinical variables on absolute theta power was examined separately for each gender by using correlation and regression analyses. Gender differences in the theta log power difference between alcoholics and controls were explored by using regional repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: Increased absolute theta power was seen in alcohol-dependent subjects at all scalp locations. The theta log power increase in male alcoholics was prominent at the central and parietal regions and in female alcoholics at the parietal region when compared with the respective matched controls. Correlation of drinking variables with log theta power exhibited no group-specific differences. Conclusions: Increased tonic theta power in the EEG may reflect a deficiency in the information-processing capacity of the central nervous system in alcoholics. The theta power increase may also be an electrophysiological index of the imbalance in the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cortex. It is likely that the theta power increase is a trait-related phenomenon and is expressed to differing degrees in the two genders.

However, this invasive method is not adequate for usage in healthy volunteers or psychiatric patients and not all brain regions can be covered well with this approach. With functional MRI, a non-invasive method with high spatial resolution, most of these locations could be found again. However, the time-course of these activations can only be roughly determined with this method, even if an event-related fMRI design has been chosen. Therefore, we have now tried to analyse the time-course of the activations using EEG data providing a better time resolution. We have used Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) in the analysis of P300 data (27 electrodes) of healthy volunteers (n = 50) in the time frame 230-480ms and found mainly the same activations that have been described using intracranial recordings or fMRI, i. e. the inferior patrietal lobe/temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In these selected regions, an analysis of the activation time-courses has been performed.

This may be important if QEEG is to have a role in distinguishing between normal and pathological aging associated with this sensory system. Seventeen healthy elderly subjects (mean age 79.00 +/-3.54 years) and 16 young adult controls (mean age 22.60 +/-2.00 years) participated in the study. As reported in previous studies, beta1 and 2 activity was significantly greater in elderly subjects compared to young adults, thus confirming the reliability and validity of this study's quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) methodology. More alpha activity was evident in young adults compared with the elderly, whilst theta activity was distributed differently in the two age groups. These findings support previous literature suggesting EEG bandwidth activity reflect greater attentional capacity in young adults and EEG desynchronization in older people. Elderly subjects who identified two or fewer odors were found to have more beta activity in the olfaction condition compared to resting eyes closed, which may reflect cognitive impairment. These findings stress the importance of distinguishing subgroups of healthy elderly adults when examining the electroencephalographic profile. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

J	Delorme, A; Makeig, S				Delorme, A; Makeig, S			EEGLAB: an open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; ICA; ERP; spectral decomposition; single-trial; Matlab; software	BLIND SEPARATION; ALGORITHM; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TIME	We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment(The Math-works, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.

Participants were instructed to remember noun pairs embedded in sentences, with sentences grouped into two temporally distinct lists. At test, in response to noun probes, participants made old/new, followed by source (i.e., list) judgments. Lower band alpha electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during recognition and source retrieval epochs was analyzed using spatial covariance analysis [Hum. Brain Mapp. 2 (1994) 79; J.R. Moeller, C. Ghez, A. Antonini, M.F. Ghilardi, V Dhawan, K. Kazumata, D. Eidelberg, Brain networks of motor behavior assessed by principal component analysis, in: R.E. Carson, M.E. Daube-Witherspoon, P. Herscovitch (Eds.), Quantitative Functional Brain Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography, Academic, San Diego, 1998]: significant activation patterns were found in source retrieval epochs. For young subjects, the regional covariance pattern involved coactivation of right anterior and left posterior electrode sites. Source retrieval performance was predicted by the subject difference in pattern expression between epochs involving correct and incorrect source attribution. The older adults also exhibited significant coactivation of the right anterior and left posterior electrode sites. However, no compensatory activation sites were identified for these elders who performed near chance in source retrieval. In this regard, we replicated the main functional difference between good and poor performing elders reported in a recent O-15 PET study of source retrieval in young and older subjects [Neuroimage 17 (2002) 1394]. These alpha band and O-15 PET findings complement the age group differences found in the time-domain (ERP) analysis of our EEG data [Psychol. Aging 14 (1999) 390]. We suggest that spatial covariance analyses of spectral EEG and MEG data will reveal new information about functional brain activity relevant to normal aging. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

As yet, there is no established means to integrate the analysis of the combined data set. Recognizing that the hemodynamically convolved time-varying EEG spectrum, S, is intrinsically multidimensional in space, frequency, and time motivated us to use multiway Partial Least-Squares (N-PLS) analysis to decompose EEG (independent variable) and fMRI (dependent variable) data uniquely as a sum of "atoms". Each EEG atom is the outer product of spatial, spectral, and temporal signatures and each fMRI atom the product of spatial and temporal signatures. The decomposition was constrained to maximize the covariance between corresponding temporal signatures of the EEG and fMRI. On all data sets, three components whose spectral peaks were in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands appeared; only the alpha atom had a significant temporal correlation with the fMRI signal. The spatial distribution of the alpha-band atom included parieto-occipital cortex, thalamus, and insula, and corresponded closely to that reported by Goldman et al. [NeuroReport 13(18) (2002) 2487] using a more conventional analysis. The source reconstruction from EEG spatial signature showed only the parieto-occipital sources. We interpret these results to indicate that some electrical sources may be intrinsically invisible to scalp EEG, yet may be revealed through conjoint analysis of EEG and fMRI data. These results may also expose brain regions that participate in the control of brain rhythms but may not themselves be generators. As of yet, no single neuroimaging method offers the optimal combination of spatial and temporal resolution; fusing fMRI and EEG meaningfully extends the spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity of each method.

These beta bursts are dominant over the contralateral hand representation area, but also appear over the midcentral area overlaying the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the foot representation area. We show that the induced midcentral beta oscillations following movement-offset display not only slightly higher frequency components, but have also a significantly earlier onset. These beta oscillations arise likely from the SMA. Assuming that the short-lasting beta synchronizations at frequencies below 35 Hz after termination of a movement reflect a state of localized cortical inhibition, we propose that the induced midcentral oscillations reflect the inhibition of networks within the SMA. This assumed resetting or inhibitory process within the SMA precedes that of the networks within the primary motor hand area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods This was an open, non randomised study in which 18 volunteers (9 male and 9 female) were studied on 1 study day, over a 24 h period. Volunteers had a cortical EEG recording taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 h. Each recording lasted for 6 min (3 min eyes open, 3 min eyes closed). All EEG recordings were taken in a quietened ward environment with the curtains drawn round the bed and the volunteer supine. During the 3 min eyes open, volunteers were asked to look at a red circle on a screen at the foot of the bed, and refrain from talking. Results Plots produced of geometric mean power by time of the standard wave band frequencies gave some indication of a circadian rhythm over the 24 h period for theta (4.75-6.75 Hz), alpha 1 (7.0-9.5 Hz) and beta 1 (12.75-18.50 Hz) wavebands. Mixed models were fitted to both the eyes open and eyes closed data which confirmed a change in mean waveband power with time with statistical significance at the conventional 5% level (P < 0.05). Conclusions These data indicate the presence of a diurnal variation in the cortical quantitative EEG. They support the use of a placebo control group when designing clinical trials which utilize quantitative EEG to screen for central nervous system (CNS) activity of pharmaceutical agents, to control for the confounding variable of time of day at which the EEG recordings were made.

Given the obvious limitations of traditional neuropsychological testing in this clinical context, the use of neurophysiological tools such as bedside auditory cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs), recently proven to be relevant to evaluate comatose and vegetative patients [Clin. Neurophysiol. 110 (9) (1999) 1601; News Physiol. Sci. 17 (2002) 38], may constitute an interesting alternative. Here, we present the ERPs of a 38-year-old right-handed woman with severe akinetic mutism recorded in a passive auditory odd-ball paradigm. In spite of this severe clinical state, we could observe the presence of a "Mismatch Negativity", and of a larger P300 in rare trials than in frequent ones. By revealing a high level of cognitive integration of environmental auditory information, our study emphasizes the potential clinical relevance of MMN and P300 recordings in akinetic mutism to assess patient cognitive functioning.

Little work has been done on the effect of GH and IGF-1 on a crucial aspect of cognition, selective attention. This study investigated the effect of GH/IGF-1 on performance and brain potentials (EEG) during a selective-attention task in patients with low levels of GH and IGF-1 (childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency) compared to healthy controls. Detection of occasional visual target patterns was impaired in patients. This was paralleled by a reduction in an attention-related brain potential, which has been associated previously with anterior cingulate cortex functioning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of the current study was to assess whether top-down processes could influence the stimulus-driven processes in determining what constitutes an auditory event. Methods: Electroencepholagram (EEG) was recorded from 11 scalp electrodes to frequently occurring standard and infrequently occurring deviant sounds. Within the stimulus blocks, deviants either occurred only in pairs (successive feature changes) or both singly and in pairs. Event-related potential indices of change and target detection, the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the N2b component, respectively, were compared with the simultaneously measured performance in discriminating the deviants. Results: Even though subjects could voluntarily distinguish the two successive auditory feature changes from each other, which was also indicated by the elicitation of the N2b target-detection response, top-down processes did not modify the event organization reflected by the MMN response. Conclusions: Top-down processes can extract elemental auditory information from a single integrated acoustic event, but the extraction occurs at a later processing stage than the one whose outcome is indexed by MMN. Significance: Initial processes of auditory event-formation are fully governed by the context within which the sounds occur. Perception of the deviants as two separate sound events (the top-down effects) did not change the initial neural representation of the same deviants as one event (indexed by the MMN), without a corresponding change in the stimulus-driven sound organization.

J	Cobianchi, A; Giaquinto, S				Cobianchi, A; Giaquinto, S			Can we exploit event-related potentials for retraining language after stroke?	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; HANDEDNESS; ASYMMETRY; CORTEX; WORDS; P3	Purpose: To ascertain the utility of event-related potentials in studying language processing in patients suffering from aphasia. Methods: Recent methods to evaluate event related potentials in response to spoken words were applied in two young patients suffering from a recent aphasia in whom expressive deficits were particularly marked. Recordings were made on three occasions for each patient at the same time of the day. The second recording session took place after six months and the final one after one year. Eighteen right-handed subjects in normal health (10 women, 8 men) were enrolled as controls. Results: Three kinds of potential were obtained over time, P300, P340 and N400. P300 was useful to monitor attention and discrimination. It improved over time. Both of our patients lacked a defined P340 potential, but longitudinal recordings could show a very slow reappearance over time although with a frequently inverted polarity. Apparently, the expressive aphasia did not improve over a one year interval. In contrast to P340, N400 was relatively preserved. This potential is linked to semantic judgement. The patients with relatively preserved comprehension were able to exhibit a N400 soon after stroke. The bilateral representation indicated that the right hemisphere was involved in some kind of language processing. Conclusion: The results indicate that digitized spoken words appear to be an appropriate tool because they permit the study of EEG changes on a millisecond-to-millisecond basis. Apparently, ERPs. enable us to study receptive processes in patients with expressive aphasia. Moreover, they appear to be particularly suitable for monitoring the recovery of neural mechanisms responsible for language.

A parallel process that detects salient features and a following serial process for higher order vision. However, this separation is still under dispute. The current study investigated whether event-related lateralizations (ERLs) of the electroencephalogram are a useful tool to examine these two processes. In a visual search for a colour- or form singleton or a conjunction target, reaction time (RT), P3 amplitudes and ERLs served as dependent variables. RT replicated earlier results for colour and conjunction targets. P3 amplitudes decreased and ERL latencies increased for these conditions. However, form singletons showed RT-, P3- and ERL-results comparable to conjunction targets. ERL-results differed in some conditions from RTs. The results suggest that target attributes alone cannot dissociate between different search strategies but showed that efficient as well as less efficient processes can be utilised for the same targets proposing that processing demands are determined by the inter-relation of target and the distractors.

However, it has been proved difficult because there logically exist an infinite number of other models and interpretations that could account for the same data and phenomena (i.e. the problem of underdetermination). Therefore, I suggest that applying biologically realistic multiple constraints from ion-channel level to system level (e.g. cognitive neuroscience and human brain disorders) can only solve the problem of underdetermination. Here I have explored whether the noise shaping/predictive neural coding hypothesis can provide a unified view on following realistic multiple constraints: (1) cortical gain control mechanisms in vivo; (2) the relationships between acetylcholine, nicotine, dopamine, calcium-activated potassium ion-channel, and cognitive functions; (3) oscillations and synchrony; (4) why should spontaneous activity be irregular; (5) whether the cortical neurons in vivo are coincidence detectors or integrators; and (6) the causal relationship between theta oscillation, gamma band fluctuation, and P3 (or P300) ERP responses. Finally, recent experimental results supporting the unified view shall be discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain event-related potentials (ERPs) during a complex auditory selective attention task were recorded from 21 cannabis users divided into two groups according to age of onset and from 13 controls comparable with respect to age, IQ and educational background. Participants were instructed to detect target tones of a particular location, pitch and duration from a total sample of random frequencies. The study reveals that the latency of the greatest negative peak of ERPs (200 and 300 ms) to target tones was shorter in controls, while there was no clear difference between target and non-target within cannabis users. In addition, users displayed a reduced P-3 to target tones. This was more pronounced in early-onset cannabis users. These data suggest that chronic cannabis use relates to different types of information processing under conditions of selective attention. There is some evidence that users employed different strategies of attention allocation. The results are discussed with respect to possible underlying mechanisms and clinical implications.

Severity of sleep disturbance in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is correlated with level of executive impairment, with some residual impairment despite treatment (continuous positive airway pressure - CPAP). Executive impairment appears to be more closely related to hypoxaemic events rather than daytime sleepiness. Studies of electroencephalographic (EEG) changes throughout the course of sleep and following sleep deprivation as well as functional neuroimaging and psychophysiological changes (event-related potentials - ERPs) following sleep deprivation provide further indication of the relative importance of the frontal regions of the brain to sleep. However, neurocognitive studies present many inconsistencies, task classification is often ambiguous and, in the absence of any unifying explanation at the level of cognitive mechanisms, the overall picture is one of a disparate range of impairment following sleep loss and sleep fragmentation. Poorly defined concepts of frontal lobe function, executive function, memory and attention, using tasks largely developed with more severe deficit levels in mind, create further difficulties in interpreting current findings.

Finding unknown sources of BEG, the so-called "inverse problem", is discussed in general terms, with emphasis on the fundamental non-uniqueness of inverse solutions. Hemodynamic signatures, measured with fMRI, are expressed as voxel integrals to facilitate comparisons with EEG. Two generally distinct cell groups (1 and 2), generating EEG and fMRI signals respectively, are embedded within the much broader class of synaptic action fields. Cell groups 1 and 2 may or may not overlap in specific experiments. Implications of this incomplete overlap for co-registration studies art considered. Each experimental measure of brain function is generally sensitive to a different kind of source activity and to different spatial and temporal stales. Failure to appreciate such distinctions can exacerbate conflicting views of brain function that emphasize either global integration or functional localization.

By the use of temporal spectral evolution (TSE) analysis, the change in background cortical activity in relation to self-paced finger/wrist extension was compared among the SMA proper, S1 and M1, All three areas showed a decrease in the amount of activity for the frequency range between 10 and 40 Hz before the onset of movement [event-related desynchronization (ERD)]. The SMA proper showed earlier onset of ERD for 18-22 Hz activity (-3.4 +/- 0.5 s, mean +/- standard deviation) than M1 (-1.7 +/- 0.7 s) and S1 (-1.4 +/- 0.5 s), The degree of ERD in S1 was greatest for 10-14 Hz and that in M1 for 18-22 Hz, whereas in the SMA proper ERD was observed throughout the frequency bands from 10 to 40 Hz, Neither the degree nor the onset time of ERD in the SMA proper was lateralized to either the ipsilateral or the contralateral side with respect to the movement. A transient increase in activity after movement [event-related synchronization (ERS)] was observed in all three areas. In the SMA proper, two out of four subjects showed ERS for frequency bands below 40 Hz with both ipsilateral and contralateral movements. By contrast, in S1 and M1, ERS was recorded for frequency bands between 20 and 90 Hz, and was predominantly associated with the contralateral movement. The present study suggests that the background cortical activity in the SMA proper has a specific temporal pattern with respect to self-paced movement, and that the SMA proper is involved in motor preparation earlier than S1-M1 in a bilaterally organized manner.

The stroke patients suffered from central arm paresis (n = 8), somatosensory deficits (n = 3) or ideomotor apraxia(n = 2). The multimodal EEG analysis suggested impairment-specific changes in the movement-related electrical activity of the brain. The readiness potential of paretic subjects was centred more anteriorly and laterally; during movement, they showed increased beta-ERD at left lateral frontal recording sites. Patients with somatosensory deficits showed reduced alpha-ERD and beta-ERD during both movement preparation and actual performance. Patients with ideomotor apraxia showed more lateralized frontal movement-related slow cortical potentials during both movement preparation and performance, and reduced left parietal beta-ERD during movement preparation. We conclude that (i) disturbed motor efference is associated with an increased need for excitatory drive of pyramidal cells in motor and premotor areas or an attempt to drive movements through projections from these areas to brainstem motor systems during movement preparation; (ii) an undisturbed somatosensory afference might contribute to the release of relevant cortical areas from their 'idling' state when movements are prepared and performed; and (iii) apraxic patients have a relative lack of activity of the mesial frontal motor system and the left parietal cortex, which is believed to be part of a network subserving ideomotor praxis.

Methods: Electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings were made in 4 clinical subjects during auditory tone and phoneme discrimination tasks, and event-related changes in the ECoG band power were calculated. The topography and temporal sequence of event-related power changes in different gamma bands were contrasted with those of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), and with those of event-related power changes in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). Results: Auditory stimuli induced a broadband power augmentation that included 40 Hz, as well as higher (80-100 Hz) gamma frequencies. The topography of gamma augmentation was similar, but not identical, to that of the AEP, and was more focused than that of alpha power suppression. Its temporal onset coincided with the N100. but outlasted it. Phonemes produced greater gamma augmentation than tones, while a similar difference was not observed in the N100. Conclusions: Auditory perception induces ECoG gamma activity not only at 40 Hz, but also in higher gamma frequencies. This activity appears to be an index of cortical activation that reflects task-specific processing in the human auditory cortex more closely than the AEP or alpha power suppression.

It is already known that healthy adults and infants display electroencephalographic (EEG) gamma -band bursts (around 40 Hz) when the brain is required to achieve such binding. Here we explore gamma -band EEG in autism and Williams Syndrome and demonstrate differential abnormalities in the two phenotypes. We show that despite putative processing similarities at the cognitive level, binding in Williams syndrome and autism can be dissociated at the neurophysiological level by different abnormalities in underlying brain oscillatory activity. Our study is the first to identify that binding-related gamma EEG can be disordered in humans. NeuroReport 12:2697-2700 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In consequence, the presence of this condition, unless floridly overt, is often missed. As a result, the majority of patients are denied the benefits of treatment. There are a number of individual techniques, which access different aspects of cerebral function that can be used, singly or in combination, to provide diagnostic information in this condition, including mental state assessment, psychometric testing, electroencephalography, sensory and cognitive evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. These have been variously applied to the study of hepatic encephalopathy but fundamental differences in the essential aims of the studies, as well as differences in the patient populations and the acquisition and analysis of the data, have made comparisons difficult. Thus, there is no clear consensus as to the sensitivity, specificity, or validity of these tests when used alone or in combination. There are, however, a number of additional methods that could be used to analyze the electrophysiological data, and a number of alternative evoked potentials that could be measured to provide better diagnostic information. In addition, there are a number of techniques, such as critical flicker frequency and smooth pursuit eye movements, which have not yet been applied systematically in this condition and which may provide useful diagnostic information. Clearly the methods for assessing hepatic encephalopathy need to be reviewed, newer methods for analyzing the electrophysiological data and newer techniques for assessing alternative aspects of cerebral function need to be explored for their diagnostic utility. This process should aim at developing a multidimensional diagnostic tool.

In response to visual stimuli, event-related alpha oscillations were observed. Such alpha responses were found not only in a specific sensory (visual) pathway but also in the hippocampus, hinting at a possible distributed alpha response system.

Methods: Task-related power (TRPow) analysis of multichannel surface EEG was used to examine the regional oscillatory brain activity in the lower (7.8-9.8 Hz) and upper (10.8-11.8 Hz) alpha band. Unimanual to bimanual, bimanual to unimanual, and unimanual to unimanual transitions, prompted by visual cues, were studied in 10 right handed subjects. Results: (1) Execution of unimanual and bimanual movements was accompanied by a bilateral activation over the central regions. (2) The 7.8-9.8 Hz TRPow decrease was more prominent for left and bimanual movements, suggesting sensitivity of the lower alpha band to task difficulty. (3) No difference in alpha oscillatory activity was found between bimanual synchronous and asynchronous sequences. (4) Transitions between motor sequences were invariably accompanied by a mesioparietal TRPow decrease in the lower alpha band. (5) This mesioparietal activation was contingent to the change of motor pro-ram, and could not be accounted for by the change of visual cue, or related attentional processes. Conclusion: The 7.8-9.8 Hz mesioparietal activation most likely reflects a posterior parietal motor command initiating transition between motor pro.-rams. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Self-report and event-related potential measures of six high and six low hypnotic susceptible individuals in response to pain were examined during an initial baseline condition and following a standard hypnotic induction under suggestions to either increase (hyperalgesia) or decrease (hypoalgesia) the painful stimulation. Our results show that high and low hypnotically susceptible individuals: (1) show few self-report or psychophysiological differences in response to baseline pain stimuli (2) report differential pain experiences depending on hypnotic suggestions and (3) display differential psychophysiological indicators following an hypnotic induction with a suggestion of hypoalgesia. Overall, the findings suggest that hypnotic suggestions with high susceptible individuals modulate the later components of the evoked potential in a global manner and point up the importance of using both high and low hypnotically susceptible, individuals preceding and following an hypnotic induction.

In the self-awakening condition, participants were instructed to wake up by themselves 15 min. after the experimenter turned the lights off. In the forced-awakening condition, the experimenter awakened them 20 min. after the lights were turned off. To control the maximum sleep time for the two conditions, we used different instructions in each condition. Participants were 10 healthy college students. Their physiological arousal and subjective sleepiness were evaluated using the P300 amplitude of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) and the visual analog scale previously described by Monk and Kathryn, et al. For evaluating sleep structure during the nap, Hori's 1994 hypnagogic EEG stages were used. P300 amplitude was significantly lower, and subjective sleepiness was significantly higher after forced-awakening than self-awakening, indicating that arousal was higher after self-awakening, The EEGs during napping in the forced-awakening condition indicated deeper sleep. Given this deeper sleep, severe sleep inertia occurred after the forced-awakening condition. In conclusion, it appeared a short nap with self-awakening was more effective in reducing a post-lunch dip than one with forced-awakening.

The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) is a Federally funded effort to identify and characterize those genetic factors. The study involves more than 1,000 alcoholic subjects and their families, with researchers conducting comprehensive psychological, physiological, electrophysiological, and genetic analyses of the participants. These analyses have identified several traits, or phenotypes, that appear to be genetically determined, such as the presence of alcohol dependence, the level of response to alcohol, the presence of coexisting depression, or the maximum number of drinks a person consumes per occasion. Genetic analyses have identified regions on several chromosomes that are associated with these phenotypes and need to be studied further.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						gamma; schizophrenia; binding; EEC; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 COMPONENT; BRAIN; MODEL; HYPOTHESIS; SYMPTOMS; SCALP	Objectives: Gamma ('40 Hz') rhythms may play a role in the integration of sensory processing activity. Impaired temporal integration may be a key feature of the associated disturbances in schizophrenia. This is the first study to examine the time course of Gamma activity induced in response to stimuli in this disorder. Methods: Gamma activity induced in response to task-relevant and irrelevant auditory oddball stimuli was examined in 35 medicated schizophrenics and 35 age- and gender-matched normal controls. We employed a moving Welch window with short time FFT to examine the time course of Gamma amplitude. The amplitude spectrum for each time point was de-trended to eliminate any contribution of broad spectrum activity (EEG or EMG) to Gamma amplitude. Results: For targets, schizophrenics showed a significant decrease in post-stimulus Gamma response amplitude in left hemisphere and frontal sites and an increase in right hemisphere and parieto-occipital sites (P < 0.0009). The abnormalities correlated with PANSS general symptom scores. In the non-targets (at a different latency), schizophrenics showed a widespread Gamma decrease (P < 0.0005). Conclusions: The Gamma findings in non-targets may reflect an abnormality in appropriately processing irrelevant stimuli. This could result in defective processing of the context (integration) of relevant target information. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT				McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT			Electrophysiological evidence of intuition: Part 2. A system-wide process?	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; HEART; PSI	Objectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the body's psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical reports (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a forthcoming publication (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception. Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of "normal" psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials (ERP) and heartbeat-evoked potentials (HBEP) were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/ accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed. Results: The main findings presented here are: (1) surprisingly, both the heart and brain appear to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) even more surprisingly, there is compelling evidence that the heart appears to receive intuitive information before the brain; (3) there were significant differences in prestimulus ERPs for calm versus emotional stimuli; (4) the frontal cortex, temporal, occipital, and parietal areas appear to be involved in the processing of prestimulus information; (5) there were significant differences in prestimulus calm/emotional HBEPs, primarily in the coherent mode; (6) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Especially noteworthy is the apparent interaction between the HBEPs and ERPs in the females, which suggests that the heart modulates the ERP and that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that the heart and brain, together, are involved in receiving, processing, and decoding intuitive information. On the basis of these results and those of other research, it would thus appear that intuitive perception is a system-wide process in which both the heart and brain (and possibly other bodily systems) play a critical role. To account for the study's results, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about "future" events is spectrally enfolded.

Four types of eye movements were elicited: pure saccades, convergence, divergence, and combined (divergent saccades). EEG activity was recorded from 62 electrodes and was aligned to stimulus onset. A negativity peaked after 140 ms and was modulated according to the location of the stimulus in space and the type of movement prepared, mainly in central and posterior cortex. For saccade targets, we confirmed a stimulus-related negativity in the posterior and central cortical area, contralateral to target direction. For convergence and divergence targets, this negativity was bilaterally distributed; convergence targets activated a rather extended cortical network in the central and posterior area, while divergence targets activated a more confined posterior area, spreading ventrally from the occipital cortex. Cortical activity for combined targets was lateralised contralaterally to stimulus direction but its topography resembled more closely that after the divergence stimulus. When observers suppressed the relevant eye movement to the stimulus, EEG activity was enhanced on the right hemisphere, showing the more pronounced effect on the right occipital-temporal and central-parietal electrode sites.

In this paper, changes of the EEG DC potential were analyzed in two computerized tasks (correcting typing errors, performing Excel) and two paper/pencil tasks'(correcting typing errors, a cognitive test) to assess mental load related to ergonomical and task characteristics. DC recordings were analyzed for the mean Values of baseline and the first and the second 4 min of each task from 24 persons. A 2 (computer usage experience low vs. high) X 4 (Task) X 3 (Time: baseline, first half of task, second half) X 6 (Lead) MANOVA of DC potential changes (DCPCs) showed at F3, F4 and C3 positive DCPCs for paper/pencil tasks and negative DCPCs for computerized tasks. Ratings of task difficulty were related to high vs, low task demands, whereas DCPCs were related to task medium, time on task and lead. Highly experienced persons showed a pronounced left-right difference at parietal locations and at frontal and central locations related to task medium by trend. Results were interpreted as higher cortical activation associated with mental load caused by additional attentional/controlling demands of computerized tasks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Anemuller, J; Sejnowski, TJ; Makeig, S				Anemuller, J; Sejnowski, TJ; Makeig, S			Complex independent component analysis of frequency-domain electroencephalographic data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						complex independent component analysis; frequency-domain; convolutive mixing; biomedical signal analysis; electroencephalogram; event-related potential; visual selective attention	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SEPARATION; RESPONSES; TASK	Independent component analysis (ICA) has proven useful for modeling brain and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Here, we present a new, generalized method to better capture the dynamics of brain signals than previous ICA algorithms. We regard EEG sources as eliciting spatio-temporal activity patterns, corresponding to, e.g. trajectories of activation propagating across cortex. This leads to a model of convolutive signal superposition, in contrast with the commonly used instantaneous mixing model. In the frequency-domain, convolutive mixing is equivalent to multiplicative mixing of complex signal sources within distinct spectral bands. We decompose the recorded spectral-domain signals into independent components by a complex infomax ICA algorithm. First results from a visual attention EEG experiment exhibit: (1) sources of spatio-temporal dynamics in the data, (2) links to subject behavior, (3) sources with a limited spectral extent, and (4) a higher degree of independence compared to sources derived by standard ICA.

However, EEGs can only provide limited information about the intracerebral sources from where the OEPs are generated. By contrast, intracerebral EEG recordings enable direct examination of the electrophysiological activity from a given cerebral area. In the present study, neural activity was recorded from the amygdala of seven epileptic patients undergoing intracerebral EEG recordings prior to surgical treatment for relief of intractable seizures. Two olfactory tests were used: a passive-stimulation test consisting of the successive presentation of 12 common odorants and a suprathreshold detection test including both odorant and non-odorant stimulations, Recordings from the amygdala revealed that all odorant stimulations induced large and reproducible OEPs, whereas the non-odorant stimulations did not. It was also found that repetition of the same odorant stimulation led to a decrease in the latency of the first OEP component. This modulation, which corresponds to a faster olfactory processing, strongly suggests that the amygdala is involved in early olfactory attentional processes. In conclusion, it appears that the human amygdala discriminates the incoming information from the nasal airflow as being odorant or not and, additionally, that its speed of processing is sensitive to recent experience with an odor.

By knowing the temporal relationship between focal increases in neuronal firing rates and the provoked focal increase in blood flow, investigators are able to maximize the fMR-linked images that show where the activity originates. Our mastery of recording EEG inside the bore of a MR scanner has also allowed us to develop cognitive paradigms that record not only the fMR BOLD images, but also the evoked potentials (EPs). The EPs can subsequently be subjected to localization paradigms that can be compared to the localization seen on the BOLD images. These two techniques will most probably be complimentary. BOLD responses are dependent on a focal increase in metabolic demand while the EPs may or may not be related to energy demand increases. Additionally, recording EPs require that the source or sources of that potential come from an area that is able to generate far-field potentials. These potentials are related to the laminar organization of the neuronal population generating that potential. As best we know the BOLD response does not depend on any inherent laminar neuronal organization. Therefore, by merging these two recording methods, it is likely that we will gain a more detailed understanding of not only the areas involved in certain physiologic events, e,g, focal epilepsy or cognitive processing, but also on the sequencing of the activation of the various participating regions.

The aim of this study was to explore the sensitivity of auditory event-related potentials to electromagnetic emissions. Methods: Twelve participants attended two sessions, 1 week apart. Participants performed an auditory oddball task while they were exposed to an active MP during one session and sham exposure during the other. Each condition lasted I h and order was counterbalanced. N100 and P200 latencies and amplitudes were analysed for non-target waveforms, and N200 and P300 latencies and amplitudes were analysed for target waveforms. Results: In real relative to sham exposure N100 amplitude and latency to non-targets were reduced, with the reduction larger over midline and right hemisphere sites. P300 latency to targets was delayed in the real exposure condition, however as this difference was greatest at left frontal and left central sites the interpretation of this result is unclear. Reaction time increased in the real relative to sham condition. No difference in accuracy was found. Conclusions: The results suggest that MP exposure may affect neural activity, particularly in proximity to the phone, however caution should be applied due to the small sample size.

Therefore, the concomitant studies require methods capable of describing the qualitative variation of the signal in both time and frequency. The present work complements the efforts described in Rosso et al. (Physica A 313 (2002) 587), devoted to non-extensive information measures A In Tsallis. Here we show that the notion of complexity, using (1) appropriate information-theory tools (adapted to a non-extensive scenario) and (2) scalp EEG data, provides one with valuable insights into the dynamics of neural activity. In particular, using different complexity measures we detect the presence of states characterized by both order and maximal complexity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten participants were presented with an auditory oddball task during repeated sleep onset periods. The EEG was recorded from 29 different scalp sites. A 1500-Hz tone pip was presented infrequently (p = .04) within a series of lower pitch 1000-Hz "standard" stimuli (p = .96). Participants were required to button press upon detection of the rare "target" stimulus. During wakefulness, almost all targets were detected. A large amplitude P300 was observed to these detected targets. This P300 was maximum over parietal areas of the scalp. During stage 1 sleep, subjects continued to respond on 47% of trials. The parietal P300 amplitude remained large to these detected targets. It was, however, much attenuated at frontal sites. When the participant failed to detect the target in either stage 1 or 2, no P300 was visible. P300 is thus associated with behavioral detection of the target stimulus, whether in wakefulness or stage 1 "sleep." Trials were also sorted by reaction time (RT), in which bins 1-3 represented increasingly long RT. In the waking state, P300 amplitude did not significantly vary across the different bins. Although mean RT latency varied by 512 ms from bin 1 to bin 3, P300 latency varied by only 25 ms. Differences in RT are thus probably due to response-related processes rather than stimulus classification time.

Four types of stimuli were analyzed: meaningful environmental sounds, meaningless sounds, words and non-words. We report many similarities in the ERDs and ERSs (event-related synchronizations) patterns among all stimuli, with: (i) similar time-course of ERDs and ERSs between meaningful environmental sounds and words, and between meaningless sounds and non-words; (ii) similar topography of the maximal ERDs for meaningful environmental sounds, words and non-words; and (iii) same right posterior ERSs for all four stimuli. However, differences were also observed: (i) in time-course, with earlier ERSs for meaningless than meaningful stimuli, whether environmental or verbal; and (ii) in topography, with ERDs predominating in left and right hemisphere channels for meaningful and meaningless environmental sounds, respectively; (iii) ERSs predominating in the left temporal channel for non-words and in the left posterior and right frontal channels for meaningless sounds. The results of this study suggest that meaningful stimuli involve greater and longer-lasting semantic processes than meaningless stimuli, while the occurrence of ERSs for the latter points to the possible involvement of an inhibitory processing of semantic representations. Finally, the findings concerning the comparison between verbal and non verbal stimuli suggest the involvement of left-lateralized phonological and semantic processes for the former, and more distributed neurocognitive processes in both hemispheres for the latter although with predominant left laterality for their semantic processing.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of the topographic P300-features in relation to methylphenidate-medication and to different attentional processes in primer- and distractor-condition;; Methods: Twenty-one-channel-ERPs of 17 ADHD-boys were analyzed with reference-independent methods. Four quasi stable microstates within the time frames of conventional P100, P200, P3a and P3b components were identified by means of a data-driven segmentation procedure. Results: In segment 3 topographical assessment yielded a significant occipital and right-shift of the positive centroid, longer centroid distance and higher amplitudes in primer- than in distracter conditions. MPH increased the amplitude and distance in primer and distractor-condition, without changing the topography. In segment 4 the electric fieldstrength of distractor-conditions collapsed, whereas the primer condition showed a strong fronto-parietallly oriented potential-field. There was a tendency to higher amplitudes due to MPH-medication. Conclusions: These results indicate a robust neurophysiologic differentiation of cognitive processes. MPH activates an early (P3a) covert attention process indicated by increased amplitudes and centroid. No effects were seen in later processes. Based on these effects, we propose to use the amplitude- and distance-increase in microstate 3 as an indicator of MPH efficacy in ADHD-boys. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This deficit could be reflected in an abnormal P300 component of the event-related potential. The improvement in cognitive processing due to pharmacological treatment would modify the P300 component, bringing it close to that of normal controls. Nineteen patients suffering from OCD and 19 normal controls were recorded. We used a computerized version of the auditory 'odd-ball paradigm' to obtain the P300 component at the Pt electrode. Patients were tested twice, drug-free and under treatment with clomipramine in 250-300 mg doses. We observed the P300 component to have lower amplitude and longer latency in drug-free OCD patients when compared with controls. P300 amplitude in OCD increased after treatment, although this was supported only by a statistical trend. There was no modification in P300 latency after treatment. It is possible that inhibitory activity improves with treatment and allows patients to answer with more confidence, which results in an increase in P300 amplitude. This study suggests that cognitive dysfunction in OCD fluctuates with changes in the clinical associated with treatment, probably in relationship to central serotoninergic transmission.

However the attribution of these potentials to sensorimotor areas is still unclear. The present magnetoencephalography study assessed movement preparation processes to auditory spatial precues. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was measured to test the hypothesis that lateralized sounds would give rise to a fast, stimulus-driven activation of motor networks independent of the precued response side. The lateralized vowels /a/ and /e/ served as precues for either ipsi- or contralateral responses, respectively, which had to be executed when an imperative stimulus was presented 1 s after precue onset. Two separate experiments were conducted with either blocked or mixed presentation of ipsi- and contralateral precues. Beta ERD over sensorimotor regions representing the stimulus side was elicited by both types of precues similar to200 ms after their onset. For contralateral precues, a switch of beta ERD to the response hemisphere took place similar to400 ms after trial-onset, peaking prior to the imperative stimulus (similar to800 ms post trial-onset). Signal subspace projection demonstrated a high topographical correspondence between the early precue-related ERD and the pattern immediately preceding the response, suggesting that both were Generated in similar motor networks. Apparently lateralized sounds give rise to an early activation of contralateral motor networks independent of the preened response. This suggests strong associations between space processing and action preparation networks, with fast activations preceding a detailed cortical analysis of stimulus meaning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Participants completed a sequential priming task that induced race-biased responses on certain trials while electroencephalography was recorded. The error-related negativity (ERN) wave, a component of the event-related potential with an anterior cingulate generator, was assessed to index neural signals detecting the need for control. Responses attributed to race bias produced larger ERNs than responses not attributed to race bias. Although race-biased responses were prevalent across participants, those with larger ERNs to race-biased responses showed higher levels of control throughout the task (e.g., greater accuracy and slowed responding following errors). The results indicate that race-biased responses may be made despite the activation of neural systems designed to detect bias and to recruit controlled processing.

We describe these assumptions and demonstrate several alternative computational methods. Methods: Using analytical methods and forward simulations, we computed the error in the ERL topography that results from deviations in symmetry between homologous brain areas. Based on analytical considerations we show that, for source analysis, the ERL derivation provides no benefits compared to a single subtraction of the two (left-lateralized and right-lateralized) conditions underlying the ERL. Results: Relative errors of 10% in the ERL topography are found if the location of an active region in one hemisphere differs by 10 mm from the symmetric location as compared to the other hemisphere A difference of 30degrees in orientation results in a relative error of the ERL of 40%. Differences in source strength between hemispheres result in an ERL error that is half the size of the relative strength difference. Conclusions: We estimate that, due to violations of the symmetry assumption underlying the ERL, errors in the ERL topography of 10-40% can be expected. Source analysis does not benefit from the ERL. In topographic mapping and source analysis, the double subtraction of the ERL should be approached with caution and the single subtraction of the ERPs of two lateralized conditions should be first analyzed whenever possible. We suggest that analyses based on the topography of the ERL should only be performed after the assumption of symmetry has been validated.

The objective of this study is to examine the complex signal produced by coupled chaotic attractors, to discuss their potential relevance to distributed processes in the brain, and to illustrate a method of detecting their contribution to human EEG morphology. Two measures of quantifying the behavior of coupled nonlinear systems are presented: a measure of phase synchrony and a novel measure of intermittent phase desynchronization. These are used to quantify the behavior of numerical examples of coupled chaotic attractors. Experimental evidence of their contribution to the morphology of the human alpha rhythm is then illustrated in a study of EEG recordings from 40 healthy human subjects. Amplitude-adjusted phase-randomized surrogate data is used to test the null hypothesis that the observed patterns of phase coherence can be described by purely linear methods. Statistical analysis reveals that this null hypothesis can be robustly rejected in a small number (similar to4%) of EEG epochs. These findings are discussed with reference to the adaptive function and complex dynamics of the brain. Hum. Brain Mapping 15: 175-198,2002. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A brain-computer interface using electrocorticographic signals in humans	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							EEG-BASED COMMUNICATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PATTERNS; PATIENT; DEVICE	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to control devices with electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the scalp or with single-neuron activity from within the brain. Both methods have disadvantages: EEG has limited resolution and requires extensive training, while single-neuron recording entails significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3-24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74-100% in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain.

Broadly defined, these classes include brain neurotransmitter systems and neuroelectric potentials. Evidence is presented concerning genotypic variation in alcoholics and high-risk relatives suggesting that the etiology of alcoholism and other addictive diseases is mediated in part through sub-optimal neurotransmitter functioning. Research opportunities are offered with respect to specific candidate genes that have been cloned from these neurotransmitter systems that could be most fully utilized in family-based genetic analyses. Additional evidence is offered, suggesting that characteristics of particular neuroelectric potentials (e.g. the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related potential) may provide another dimension of potential markers that could be used to identify children at risk. Finally, methodological considerations specific to high risk studies are discussed. Among these are the need to include a plan for studying more severe cases of alcohol dependence that are relatively uncomplicated by other major psychiatric disorders. Plans for long-term follow-up of children at highest risk for developing the disorder should also be included. Multiple domains of inquiry should nor be viewed as "unfocused" but rather as an economical means for utilizing highly characterized samples of individuals meeting rigorous research criteria.

Psychophysiological studies of the correlates of the go/nogo decision have almost exclusively been concerned with N2 and P3 potentials of the event-related potentials (ERPs). However, in studies where the EMG onset latency was available, it was obvious that this latency was shorter than or at least equal to the latencies of the studied cerebral potentials. In this study, by concurrent recording of the EEG and EMG activity we aimed to better define the temporal relationship between cortical activity and motor response. Particularly, we wanted to identify the early (i.e. pre EMG-onset) electrophysiological correlates of the nogo decision. We used a modified S1-S2 paradigm that involved a two-stage go/nogo decision. In this task both S1 and S2 were informative and required the subject to make a decision, but the nature of the decision differed. The decision at SI involved whether to prepare a movement, whereas the decision at S2 involved whether to initiate or inhibit an already prepared response. To better visualise the nogo decision related components of the ERPs, the go ERPs were subtracted from the corresponding nogo ERPs and difference ERPs were formed. Before EMG onset, a small negative component common to both go/nogo difference traces and corresponding roughly with the N1 wave was detected. It is suggested that this early negativity may be a more specific electrophysiological reflection of the nogo decision proper.

Starting 240 ms after word onset, topographies of event-related potentials distinguished between verbs referring to different action types. Current source density estimates revealed that verbs referring to actions executed with the legs (to kick) produced an activity focus close to the vertex, above motor areas involved in the programming of leg movements, whereas face-related verbs (to speak) produced a focus at left-lateral recordings, above perisylvian areas and the cortical representation of the face and articulators. This is evidence that brain mechanisms involved in word processing can differ even between fine-grained lexico-semantic subcategories and already within the first quarter of a second after word onset. We offer an explanation of the data in neurobiological terms. NeuroReport 11:2789-2793 (C) Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Without medication the power within the STN and the coherence between the STN and the GPi were dominated by activity with a frequency of <30 Hz. This coupling was attenuated by movement. In the presence of exogenous dopaminergic stimulation, power within the STN and coherence between the STN and the GPi was dominated by activity at 70-85 Hz, which increased with movement. The movement-related changes in coherence between the STN and EEG showed a similar pattern of pharmacological dependence, as seen subcortically. Movement-related frequency-specific changes in synchronization occur in the basal ganglia and extend to involve subcortico-cortical motor loops. The dynamic organization of activities in the frequency domain might provide a means for temporal co-ordination within and across different processing streams in the basal ganglia. This organization is critically dependent on the level of dopaminergic activity.

Methods: EEG was recorded using 82 closely spaced electrodes in 13 right-handed subjects. The subjects received 650 brief electrical stimuli to the right index finger at irregular intervals (6-12 s) in 5 blocks. The intensities of the stimuli varied randomly at 20, 30, 50, 65 and 80% of pain threshold. Results: Mu- and beta-ERD of 0.3-0.6 s latency over the contra- and ipsilateral S1/M1 area was observed in all subjects. Post-stimulus beta-ERS over the contra- and ipsilateral frontal cortices with a peak latency of 0.6-0.8 s was found in 9 subjects. Stimuli presented in the second half of the experiment were followed by a smaller ipsilateral mu-ERD and smaller contra- and ipsilateral beta-ERD than stimuli applied in the first block. Mu- and beta-ERD and beta-ERS distinguished weak (20%) from intermediate and strong stimuli (> 35%) but not the intermediate from strong stimuli. The amplitude of ipsilateral beta-ERS correlated positively with the size of intermediate truncus of CC (r(9) = 0.71, P < 0.05). In contrast, ipsilateral ERD showed no significant correlations with the size of CC. Conclusions: Habituation of ipsilateral mu-ERD and bilateral beta-ERD and beta-ERS suggests that these cortical responses are parts of the orienting response, and fail to disentangle fine intensity gradations. Ipsilateral beta-ERS appears to be mediated by the transcallosal fiber system. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

During these conditions, subjects received a suggestion of Focused Analgesia to produce an obstructive hallucination of stimulus perception; a No-Analgesia treatment served as a control. After hypnosis, a post-hypnotic suggestion was given to draw waking subjects into a deep hypnosis with opened eyes. High hypnotizables, compared to medium and low ones, experienced significant pain and distress reductions for Focused Analgesia during hypnosis and, to a greater extent, during post-hypnosis condition. Correlational analysis of EEG sweeps of each individual revealed brief intervals of phase ordering of gamma patterns, preceding and following stimulus onset, lasting approximately six periods. High and medium hypnotizable subjects showed significant reductions in phase-ordered gamma patterns for Focused Analgesia during hypnosis and post-hypnosis conditions; this effect was found, however, more pronounced in high hypnotizable subjects. Phaseordered gamma scores over central scalp site predicted subject pain ratings across Waking-Pain and Waking-Analgesia conditions, while phase-ordered prnma scores over frontal scalp site predicted pain ratings during post-hypnosis analgesia condition. During waking conditions, this relationship was present in high, low and medium hypnotizable subjects and was independent of stimulus intensity measures. This relationship was unchanged by hypnosis induction in the low hypnotizable subjects, but not present in the high and medium ones during hypnosis, suggesting that hypnosis interferes with phase-ordered gamma and pain relationship.

The aim of the present study was to compare the dependency of the AMFR-amplitude from the state of sleep for 40 Hz and 80 Hz modulation frequency. Eight normal hearing adults were investigated during natural and drug-induced sleep. The stimuli used were sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones of 1 kHz carried frequency and 40 or 80 Hz modulation frequency at 60 dB nH stimulation level. For 40 Hz modulation frequency an increase of EEG-activity in the Delta-and Theta-band during periods of sleep correlates significantly with a decreased AMFR-amplitude whereas for 80 Hz no significant relation between stage of sleep and AMFR-amplitude could be found. The results suggest that in audiological use of 40 Hz-AMFR the state of vigilance should be monitored and stabilized at a high level.

A time-frequency analysis was performed for standard and target stimuli. The study revealed an early (26-59 ms) phase-locked oscillation. Around 200 ms, a non-phase locked response was found for standard and target stimuli in temporal posterior electrodes. At about 360 ms, a phase-locked oscillation was observed only after target stimuli in the "counting targets" condition. During the "reading" task this late activity was not found, and energy increases were lower than during "counting" task. The early oscillation may be related to the sensory processing of the stimuli. The response around 200 ms may be involved in auditory mismatch and/or memory retrieval, and late activity is probably a P300-related response. Attention enhances all these activities.

During retrieval extensive areas over left frontal scalp exhibited marked negative dc shifts and a similar though smaller effect was also observed over right frontal regions. As a memory was formed and then held in mind, electrodes located over posterior temporal and occipital regions exhibited marked negative shifts. It is proposed that the left frontal negativity primarily reflects cortical activation associated with the operation of a complex retrieval process, whereas the later temporal and occipital negativity (the result of the retrieval process) reflects activation corresponding to the formation and maintenance of a detailed memory.

In our study, we apply these estimators to a set of human intracranial auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in response to amplitude modulated signals, recorded on epileptic patients. After showing that these AEPs present a frequency peak at the modulation frequency (MF), we present the results obtained for a set of three time series recorded in the primary auditory cortex of one patient. From these results, we establish graphs representing causal relations at the modulation frequency for each method and show that these graphs are similar.

Each group consisted of 20 males. All subjects were between the ages of 8 and 12 years, and groups were matched on age. EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition from 21 monopolar derivations, which were clustered into nine regions for analysis. The EEGs were Fourier transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. Values were also calculated for the theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios. The ADHD groups had more absolute and relative theta than the control group. Regionally, the ADHD groups had less relative alpha and more relative delta in posterior regions, and less relative beta in the frontal regions, than the control group. These differences were also apparent in both ratio measures. Only two significant topographic differences were found between the ADHD groups, with both of these being less deviant from normality in the ADHD + ODD group than the ADHD group. These results indicate that EEG correlates of ADHD are not clouded by the presence of comorbid ODD, which suggests possible applications in clinical practice. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Assessment of periodicity in wide-band time series	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						power spectrum; theta wave; alpha wave; intracranial EEG; epilepsy; cognitive task	OMITTED STIMULUS POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLOW POTENTIALS; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN; RESPONSES; COHERENCE; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS	To test the hypotheses that (i) electroencephalograms (EEGs) are largely made up of oscillations at many frequencies and (ii) that the peaks in the power spectra represent oscillations, we applied a new method, called the period specific average (PSA) to a wide sample of EEGs. Both hypotheses can be rejected. Although the principal peaks in the two spectra agree most of the time, quite often a peak in the power spectrum accompanies no periodicity peak and some periodicity peaks have no power spectral peak. The Fourier spectrum is not a reliable indication of rhythms. EEG samples from patients during waking, sleeping and seizure states, and volunteer healthy subjects doing cognitive tasks quite often show no significant rhythms, on an arbitrary, common sense definition. When clear rhythms are seen, they involve one or two, rarely up to four or five simultaneous non-harmonically related frequencies. Rhythms are special cases; most of the power spectrum most of the time is nonrhythmic. "Good" rhythms usually have quite narrow peaks, with frequency modulation of <5%, strengths of >2.5 up to >10 times the expectation from chance, and they often show fine structure by being quite local and brief. Most rhythms are quasisinusoidal but others are sharp-cornered recurrent events with <50% duty cycle. In the face of wide variability, we do not report any systematic differences in periodicity among EEGs from different parts of the brain or different brain states or species; it will take many more exemplars of each state, species or brain part to establish characteristic features. The PSA method may be the best so far proposed to demonstrate and quantify periodicity in wide-band time series with noise, but it has serious limitations. Discussion leads to the conclusion that it is time for a new paradigm or metaphor for brain waves. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evidence from contra-ipsilateral differences in EEG potentials	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						dimensional overlap; manual responses; saccades; LRP; premotor cortex	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; COMPATIBILITY; READINESS; SYSTEM; TIME	In the S1-S2 interval, 400 ms after an arrow as S1, an EEG-potential difference occurs between scalp sites contralateral and ipsilateral to arrow direction. Eimer [J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 21 (1995) 837-854] interpreted this difference as a sign of automatic activation of the manual response, due to dimensional overlap of arrows and responses. However, according to Kornblum et al.'s [Psychol. Rev. 97 (1990) 253-270] notion of dimensional overlap, responses can only be automatically primed if they are included in the response set. Therefore, participants of the present study had to respond to S2 in separate blocks either by key-press, as in Eimer [J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 21 (1995) 837-854], or by making saccades. In addition, contra-ipsilateral differences were recorded not only from central positions, overlying the hand-motor area, but across the whole scalp. Contralateral negativity at 400 ms after S1 was indeed found over the hand-motor area in the 'hand blocks'. However, this 'L-400' (=lateralization at 400 ms) was generally as large in the 'eye' blocks as in the 'hand' blocks. Therefore, L-400 does not reflect automatic activation of manual responses in the sense of Kornblum et al. [Psychol. Rev. 97 (1990) 253-270]. Further, its topographical maximum was more anterior than the hand-motor-related negativity that preceded the manual response ('LRP') with its maximum at central sites. Therefore, L-400 probably does not originate in the hand-motor cortex. Rather, it may be related to activity of the lateral premotor cortex found in fMRI studies of spatial orienting. The present EEG study extends these studies by delimiting the time period of this activity, suggesting that it reflects encoding of the spatial properties of the arrow for action.

Event-related magnetic fields and potentials were recorded from the right hemisphere in eight healthy subjects. Three types of stimulus, i.e., facial image (Face), letters of the alphabet (Letters) and random patterns of dots (Dots), with different presentation periods, subthreshold (16 ins), intermediate (32 ms) and suprathreshold (48 ms) were visually presented in a random order. A psychological discrimination task using the same stimuli was also employed. Clear MEG and EEG responses were recorded for all the stimuli, but the amplitude of the responses was largest for Face and smallest for Dots even in the subthreshold stimulation. The equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) for Face were located around the fusiform gyrus, although the correlation coefficients for ECDs were low under subthreshold and intermediate conditions. The ECDs for Letters and Dots were not estimated with reliable correlation coefficients. The results from the psychological task correlated with the dominancy of face recognition. Face perception was processed differently in the subthreshold condition as well as suprathreshold condition. The subconscious recognition of face might be processed around the fusiform gyrus.

We investigated their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio: how well individual ERP trials correlate with their overall averaged ERP. High correlations indicate minimal noise or individual trial variability while low correlations reflect greater trial variability. Continuous EEG activity was recorded from 57 university students during single- and dual-task conditions in a within-subjects paradigm (easy and difficult tone discrimination; with and without verbal working memory task). For early components, the addition of the second task increased the correlations between the individual trials and the averaged ERPs. For the late components, both the addition of the second task and an increase in stimulus diffi- culty decreased individual trial correlations. Results suggest that the S/N ratio analysis is a useful method fur highlighting differences between early and late components associated with stimulus processing manipulations.

A decrease in slow electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and an increase in fast frequencies were observed after the administration of Cerebrolysin. This EEG-activating effect was not influenced by TBI time course or severity, nor by the chronic treatment with nootropic compounds. Cognitive performance, evaluated with the Syndrome Kurztest test, improved in TBI patients after Cerebrolysin treatment, independent of disease severity, time course or disability. A significant improvement in the patients' clinical outcome, only evident during the first year after brain trauma, was also found following Cerebrolysin infusions. No relevant changes in biological parameters nor drug-related adverse events were observed. These promising preliminary results suggest that Cerebrolysin might be a useful treatment to improve the recovery of patients with traumatic brain damage, and encourage the conduction of confirmatory clinical trials.

Methods: Twelve de novo parkinsonian patients were recorded. ERD/ERS in mu and beta frequency bands was computed from 21 source derivations. Results: When the index finger extension was performed with the less akinetic limb, mu ERD focused over contralateral central region appeared 2 s before movement. With the targeting movement, additional pre-movement mu ERD was observed over the parietal region, as well as earlier ipsilateral mu ERD. When the same movements were performed with the more akinetic limb, we observed delayed mu ERD over contralateral regions, earlier ipsilateral mu ERD and a lack of contralateral parietal mu ERD before the targeting movement. Following index finger extension for the less akinetic limb, a focused contralateral central beta ERS was recorded, increasing and spreading after the targeting movement. In contrast, for the more akinetic limb, beta ERS was dramatically attenuated and remained unchanged after the targeting movement. Conclusions: These results confirm the fact that motor programming is delayed, and provide some insight into what may well be impaired sensorimotor integration in Parkinson's disease.

The rationale was that ipsilateral and contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex can be involved in a nonstationary way in the control of unilateral voluntary movements. The movement-related potentials were surface Laplacian-transformed (SL) to reduce head volume conductor effects and to model the response of the primary sensorimotor cortex. The ANN sampled the SL from four or two central channels overlying the primary motor area of both sides in the period of 80 ms preceding the electromyographic response onset in the active muscle. The performance of the ANN was evaluated statistically by calculating the percentage value of agreement between the STs classified by the ANN and those of two investigators (used as a reference). The results showed that both investigator and ANN were capable of selecting STs with the SL maximum in the central area contralateral to the movement (contralateral STs, about 25%), STs with considerable SL values also in the ipsilateral central area (bilateral STs, about 50%), and STs with neither the contralateral nor bilateral pattern ("spatially incoherent" single trials; about 25%). The maximum agreement (64-84%) between the ANN and the investigator was obtained when the ANN used four spatial inputs (P < 0.0000001). Importantly, the common means of all single trials showed a weak or absent ipsilateral response. These results may suggest that a back-propagation ANN could select EEG single trials showing stationary and nonstationary responses of the primary sensorimotor cortex, based on the same spatial criteria as the experimenter.

Effects of stimulus degradation	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						SPN; slow potentials; event-related desynchronization; stimulus degradation; anticipatory attention; affective-motivational	SLOW BRAIN POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; MOTOR PREPARATION; FEEDBACK STIMULI; PRECEDING NEGATIVITY; 10-HZ RHYTHM; EEG; MOVEMENT	Previous research has suggested that the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) is largely independent of stimulus modality. In contrast, the scalp topography of the event-related desynchronization (ERD) related to the anticipation of stimuli providing knowledge of results (KR) is modality dependent. These findings, combined with functional SPN research, lead to the hypothesis that anticipatory ERD reflects anticipatory attention, whereas the SPN mainly depends on the affective-motivational properties of the anticipated stimulus. To further investigate the prestimulus ERD, and compare this measure with the SPN, 12 participants performed a time-estimation task, and were informed about the quality of their time estimation by an auditory or a visual stimulus providing KR. The KR stimuli could be either intact or degraded. Auditory degraded KR stimuli were less effective than other KR stimuli in guiding subsequent behavior, and were preceded by a larger SPN, There were no effects of degradation on the SPN in the visual modality. Preceding auditory KR stimuli no ERD was present, whereas preceding visual stimuli an occipital ERD was found. However, contrary to expectation, the latter was larger preceding intact than preceding degraded stimuli. It is concluded that the data largely agree with an interpretation of the pre-KR SPN as a reflection of the anticipation of the affective-motivational value of KR stimuli, and of the prestimulus ERD as a perceptual anticipatory attention process.

Method: Thirty-one adult subjects with pseudoseizures and 32 subjects with intractable epilepsy (confirmed by video-EEG) were recruited from the epilepsy unit of a tertiary care hospital. Each participant completed the Impact of Event Scale, the Davidson Trauma Scale, the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the Dissociative Experience Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, as well as demographic, seizure history, and family functioning measures. Results: Subjects with pseudoseizures had significantly higher mean scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale, Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD, Impact of Event Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index than subjects with epilepsy. in addition, a significantly higher percentage of subjects with pseudoseizures had scores above the clinical cutoff level of 30 on the Dissociative Experience Scale. Conclusions: Subjects with pseudoseizures exhibited trauma-related profiles that differed significantly from those of epileptic comparison subjects and closely resembled those of individuals with a history of traumatic experiences. Interventions aimed at trauma-related issues may be beneficial for patients with pseudoseizures.

Methods: We examined the time-course of alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) as an indicator for primary motor cortex activation in an auditory contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with an interstimulus interval of 3 s in healthy subjects between 6 and 18 years using a 64 channel high-density sensor array. Results: We replicated a wide frontal distribution for the initial CNV component (iCNV), while only during late CNV (lCNV) a centro-parietal negativity resembling the 'Bereitschaftspotential' occurred. However, an early alpha-ERD over the central area contralateral to the side of the response movement followed the imperative stimulus already during the iCNV-interval. This early alpha-ERD was highly significantly lateralised and was even more prominent during iCNV than during lCNV indicating an activation of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex already during iCNV. Conclusions: We conclude that early task specific preparatory motor processes (which might reflect the retrieval of a motor program from memory) were elicited by the warning stimulus. These preparatory processes clearly exceeded an unspecific orienting reaction as early alpha-ERD was influenced by the side of the anticipated movement.

These processes can be monitored in real-time by recordings from depth electrodes implanted in the MTL of patients with epilepsy who undergo presurgical evaluation. In our studies, patients performed a word memorization task during depth EEG recording. Afterwards, the difference between event-related potentials (ERPs) corresponding to subsequently remembered versus forgotten words was analyzed. These kind of studies revealed that successful memory encoding is characterized by an early process generated by the rhinal cortex within 300 ms following stimulus onset. This rhinal process precedes a hippocampal process, which starts about 200 ms later. Further investigation revealed that the rhinal process seems to be a correlate of semantic preprocessing which supports memory formation, whereas the hippocampal process appears to be a correlate of an exclusively mnemonic operation. These studies yielded only indirect evidence for an interaction of rhinal cortex and hippocampus. Direct evidence for a memory related cooperation between both structures, however, has been found in a study analyzing so called gamma activity, EEG oscillations of around 40 Hz. This investigation showed that successful as opposed to unsuccessful memory formation is accompanied by an initial enhancement of rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization, which is followed by a later desynchronization. Present knowledge about the function of phase synchronized gamma activity suggests that this phase coupling and decoupling initiates and later terminates communication between the two MTL structures. Phase synchronized rhinal-hippocampal gamma activity may, moreover, accomplish Hebbian synaptic modifications and thus provide an initial step of declarative memory formation on the synaptic level.

It is difficult enough in adult patients and even more difficult in children. Part I of this review considers some of the methodological problems and caveats besetting clinical research in this field: the very definition of coma, definition of the study population and outcome variables, study design, the fallacy of self-fulfilling prophecy, early death rate from nonneurologic causes resulting in low statistical power, and invalid attempts to compensate for that by combining outcome categories, lumping together age groups, short and inhomogeneous follow-up, and failure to provide confidence intervals. Part II reviews the clinical pediatric coma-prognosis literature, first according to etiology and then according to electrodiagnostic tests.

We investigated the error-related negativity (ERN)/error negativity (N-e), an electrophysiological correlate of response monitoring, using a 64-channel EEG. Sixteen patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder and 16 matched controls participated in an Eriksen flanker task with continuous performance feedback that signaled monetary reward. Compared to controls, patients with major depressive disorder showed a less negative ERN/N-e in error trials following error trials. This result might reflect impaired response monitoring processes in major depressive disorder resulting from an underactivity in a central reward pathway and/or a deficit in strategic reasoning.

A single respiratory stimulus paradigm was employed where normal breaths served as standard stimuli and occluded breaths presented at various probability levels served as target stimuli. EEG was recorded from 29 channels in young adults in two conditions. In Condition 1, occlusions were presented at target probabilities of 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05, that is, every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th, and 20th breath. Order of target probability presentation varied randomly. Condition 2 used the same target probabilities, but held breathing rate constant by using a paced respiration task, Results indicated that P3 amplitude was significantly affected by stimulus probability, such that the component showed an inverse relationship with probability. This effect was similar between conditions. However, P3 amplitude reduced and latency increased when the secondary task of paced respiration was introduced. These data suggest that models developed to describe the effect of stimulus probability on the amplitude of visual and auditory P3 components are applicable to the respiratory somatosensory modality.

Specifically, we wanted to find out, whether it is reduced activation and/or synchronization (phase-locking) in specific frequency bands of the ongoing EEG which is related to the decreased signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio in schizophrenics. Methods: We investigated 41 unmedicated schizophrenics (10 of them drug-naive) and compared them with healthy control subjects (n = 233) as well as unmedicated subjects with schizotypal personality (n = 21), who were considered to be high-risk subjects for schizophrenia, and unmedicated depressive patients (n = 71). We measured event-related activity during an acoustical choice reaction paradigm and calculated the signal-to-noise ratio, signal power and noise for a time interval of 50-200 ms after stimulus presentation. Signal-to-noise ratio was calculated from the power of the averaged trials (signal power) divided by the mean power of the single trials minus the power of the average (noise power). Also, we performed a frequency analysis of the pre- and poststimulus EEG based on a factor analytical approach. Group comparisons were performed with ANCOVA. Results: As expected, a decreased signal-to-noise ratio of evoked activity was found in the schizophrenic and a non-significant trend in the schizotypal subjects and the depressive patients. We were able to show that the observed decrease is due to a reduced signal power and an increase of absolute noise power. Frequency analysis of the evoked activity revealed that normals, schizophrenics schizotypal subjects and depressive patients increased theta/delta activity between pre- and poststimulus interval to a similar extend. However, this theta/delta-augmentation does not correlate with signal power in schizophrenics. Also, normals and depressive subjects augment coherence between both temporal lobes during information processing, which is not found in schizophrenics and schizotypal subjects. In contrast, these two groups augment frontal lobe coherence, which goes along with an increase of noise. Conclusions: Reduced stimulus-induced phase-locking and bitemporal coherence of cortically evoked activity but not a failure to activate the cortex may be responsible for the observed low signal-to-noise ratio during information processing in schizophrenics. Accordingly, schizophrenics increase noise after stimulus presentation instead of building up a signal. This is discussed in the framework of the theory of stochastic resonance.

The subgroups of explicit memory, episodic and semantic memory, are looked at separately. Methods: A word-learning task was used, which has been shown to activate hippocampus in (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography studies. Subjects had to study and remember word pairs using different learning strategies: (i) associative word learning (AWL), which activates the episodic memory, (ii) deep single word encoding (DSWE), which activates the semantic memory, and (iii) shallow single word encoding (SSWE), which activates the implicit memory and serves as a baseline. The test included the 'remember/know' paradigm as a behavioural learning control. During the task condition, a 10-20 scalp EEG with additional electrodes in both temporal lobes regions was recorded from I I healthy volunteers. In one patient with mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy, the EEG was recorded from bilateral foramen ovale electrodes directly from mesial temporal lobe structures. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated off-line and visual and statistical analyses were made. Results: Associative learning strategy produced the best memory performance and the best noetic awareness experience, whereas shallow single word encoding produced the worst performance and the smallest noetic awareness. Deep single word encoding performance was in between. ERPs differed according to the test condition, during both encoding and retrieval, from both the scalp EEG and the foramen ovale electrode recordings. Encoding showed significant differences between the shallow single word encoding (SSWE), which is mainly a function of graphical characteristics, and the other two strategies, deep single word (DSWE) and associative learning (AWL), in which there is a semantic processing of the meaning. ERPs generated by these two categories, which are both functions of explicit memory, differed as well, indicating the presence or the absence of associative binding. Retrieval showed a significant test effect between the word pairs learned by association (AWL) and the ones learned by encoding the words in isolation of each other (DSWE and SSWE). The comparison of the ERPs generated by autonoetic awareness ('remember') and noetic awareness ('know') exhibited a significant test effect as well. Conclusions: The results of behavioural data, in particular that of the 'remember/know' procedure, are evidence that the task paradigm was efficient in activating different kinds of memory. Associative word learning generated a high degree of autonoetic awareness, which is a result of the episodic memory, whereas both kinds of single word learning generated less. AWL, DSWE and SSWE resulted in different electrophysiological correlates, both for encoding as well as retrieval, indicating that different brain structures were activated in different temporal sequence.

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the I,rain in relation to memory and integrative functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A new method of examining phase synchronicity across multiple electrode sites in specific EEG frequency bands as a function of time was employed, in a conventional cognitive ERP paradigm in 40 normal subjects. A significant late post-stimulus gamma synchronicity response occurred for task-relevant stimuli, whereas for task-irrelevant stimuli no such response was evident. However, an early response was seen for both task-relevant and irrelevant stimuli. This is the first empirical demonstration that widespread synchronous high frequency oscillations occur in humans in relation to cognition.

Performance and EEG recordings during continuous performance test (CPT-AX) were obtained from a male child suffering from ADHD when he was 9.6 years old with and without psychostimulant (methylpbenidate). Follow-up examinations were done when he was 10.6 and 11.6 years old. Hit rate of CPT-AX under non-medicated condition remained low, while hit rate under medication improved significantly. However, bit rate under non-medicated condition in third recording reached the behavioral level as that of the control. Longitudinal improvement in CPT-AX was also observed in ERP data. That is, P2/N2 and P3 in the first recording maintained a lower intensity with short duration. However, intensity levels in the third recording improved in comparison with control data, and the longitudinal change of ERP corresponded with intra-individual change of behavioral performance. Therefore, longitudinal examination of ERP might complement and extend the findings obtained from cross-sectional data, but also reveal a developmental course of an individual with ADHD.

Rumination is a reflection of the Self that is not directly driven by sensory stimuli. When we record from single neurons in the brain, we discover that even in the absence of sensory stimulation, neurons are continuously active. This is called maintained, or spontaneous, activity, and although it is well documented, it has not been as well studied. Most experiments are designed to look for signals that are elicited by sensory stimuli above the background, without mentioning whether the background has changed too, as it often does. New methods have been developed recently that allow us to study the brain's spontaneous activity and to explore how it might provide clues to the origin and nature of the Self.

Normal refixation saccade characteristics and BOLD signal change among schizophrenia subjects suggest that basic saccade generating circuitry is functionally intact among these subjects. Schizophrenia patients and their relatives, however, demonstrate difficulty with saccadic inhibition, a function ostensibly mediated by DLPFC circuitry. We review additional evidence for saccadic inhibition being associated with prefrontal circuitry provided by EEG and fMRI data. Minimum norm analysis of EEG data suggests that dipolar activity preceding correct antisaccades occurred preferentially in prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, there is an indication from the fMRI data that prefrontal activity may be increased in normal, but not in schizophrenia, subjects during antisaccade tasks. These data suggest that a research program relying on multiple functional imaging technologies may be helpful for furthering our understanding of schizophrenia's essential neuropathology.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	53rd Annual Meeting of the German-Council-for-Psychosomatic-Medicine	MAR 06-09, 2002	Ulm, GERMANY	German Council Psychosomat Med			POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; GENERAL-POPULATION; SCALE; HYPOTHESIS; RESPONSES; RECOGNITION; REACTIVITY; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; VALIDITY	Objective: A modified autonomous response (e.g., electrodermal activity) in subjects with alexithymia (a reduced ability to identify and communicate emotions) while processing emotional information is well known. However, the functional and neurobiological bases of this impairment are unclear. Do subjects with alexithymia suffer from a primary lack of perception ("emotional blindness"), or is alexithymia based on incomplete information processing due to immature undifferentiated cognitive schemes? The study investigates if subjects with alexithymia show a modified central response as a correlate of classifying emotional aversive stimuli. Method: Twenty subjects with high alexithymia and 20 with low alexithymia (selected by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale) were investigated within a modified odd-ball paradigm. Three different stimulus categories were presented: aversive (probes) and affective neutral pictures (nontargets and instructed targets). Visual event-related EEG potentials and subjective data were recorded. Results: All subjects showed elevated positive amplitudes or mean activity after probe presentation in the latency range: 150-260, 280-450, and 600-1500 msec. Subjects with alexithymia displayed increased positive components (especially P2) of visual event-related potentials after probe presentation than subjects without alexithymia. Subjects without alexithymia more frequently verbalized the emotional impact of these aversive pictures than subjects with alexithymia. Conclusions: These findings do not support the assumption of a primary lack of perception in alexithymia. Subjects with alexithymia show central correlates of perception and classification of aversive pictures. They may need more effort and cognitive recourses to process emotional information. Nevertheless, spontaneous verbal reference to emotional stimulus aspects is reduced.

The current study was conducted to determine whether identification of P300 (P3A and P3B) components using source analysis techniques can reduce variability in P300 parameters. Data were recorded with a 128-channel EEG system in 18 healthy subjects. The authors used a standard, auditory two-tone oddball paradigm with targets of 2,000 Hz and standards of 1,000 Hz. Two simple source analysis models with one or two rotating dipoles were applied to grand average data and individual data. Dipole time courses were combined with mapping results to extract P3A and P3B component latencies. Latencies obtained with conventional P300 analysis were compared with source analysis results. The source analysis method identified both P3A and P313 components in a substantially larger percentage of subjects (88% vs. 33%) than the conventional method. The source analysis method yielded a later mean P313 latency (357 msec vs. 323 msec, P < 0,001) with a smaller standard deviation (9 msec vs. 23 msec, P = 0,003) than the conventional P300 method. The relative contribution of the temporally separate P3A and P313 components to the P300 complex amplitude is highly variable. This explains the larger latency standard deviation in conventional P300 analysis. The source analysis method was able to identify P300 components in a large percentage of the cases. The result is a considerable reduction of P300 latency variability in normal subjects. This could have important consequences for clinical event-related potential research, because diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of P300 latency may improve with this method.

In two sessions a month apart (T1 and T2),14 subjects were presented with a 3-tone oddball passively, then as a discrimination task. In EEG recordings (32 sites), Nd was calculated by subtraction of the event-related potential elicited by a non-attended stimulus from that after the same frequency-deviant as target. Putative generators in the 180-228 ms latency-range were modelled with brain electrical source analysis and mapped to the modified Montreal brain-atlas. Initial T1-analyses located bilateral Nd dipoles in the superior temporal gyrus (BA22) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA8). Re-test allowed estimates of the temporal and spatial extension of activity. Peak activity occurred 14 ms later. Step-by-step analysis showed that the best spatial fit for the inverse-solutions extended 3-6 mm from the point sources, but for temporal lobe sources this increased 15 mm caudally. The right mid-frontal source (BA10) was rostral and ventral from that in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA8). T1 and T2 dipole strengths were well correlated. Nd measures of controlled attention localised to areas associated with sustained attention, problem-solving and working-memory. Temporal lobe sources were later and more posterior and medial than for automatic change-detection. Frontal Nd sources were more dorsal on the right and more rostral on the left than MMN dipoles reported for the right inferior frontal and left anterior cingulate. The sequence of information processing is reviewed.

This study evaluates the differences in dipole solutions between individual and group-average data sets using a standard realistic head model. Methods: Auditory evoked potentials were recorded from 14 right-handed healthy subjects using a 64 electrode montage. Inverse dipole solutions were obtained for each individual data set, as well as for all individual responses averaged together (grand-average). Differences in dipole solutions between individual and grand-average responses are reported. Simulations using a two dipole model with 15 different electrode sets are then used to investigate the effects of electrode misplacement and random noise on dipole localization. These effects are compared to those due to grand-averaging. Results: The average differences in dipole locations between the individual and grand-averaged data sets were approximately 1.1 cm (SD = 0.7 cm). This difference is larger than typical localization errors due to electrode misplacement and typical noise. Conclusions: Using a standard realistic head model, it is concluded that dipole solutions based on group-averaged EEG datasets are significantly different than those obtained using subject-specific data.

In the first paradigm (S2-centered), the initial tone (S1) was constant (warning), and the second tone (S2) indicated the subject whether to move or not. In the second paradigm (S1-centered), S1 indicated whether to move or not, while S2 just indicated the timing of the movement. A medial frontal beta energy increase was found in all conditions after the stimulus that forces the subject to decide whether to move or not (S1 or S2 depending on the paradigm). In both go conditions, a central alpha and beta energy decrease began after the go decision, reaching minimum values during the movement; it was followed by a beta post-movement increase, limited to the central contralateral area. In the no-go conditions, a marked fronto-central beta synchronization appeared after the decision not to move. In conclusion, our study was able to dissociate the beta oscillatory changes related to movement preparation and execution (central decrease/increase) from those associated with decision-making (medial frontal increase) and motor inhibition (fronto-central increase).

Methods: Two rTMS trains (10 Hz, 3 s, 100% motor threshold and 5 min interval) were delivered over the left frontal area in healthy subjects. P-300-ERPs were recorded at 14 electrode sites on the scalp using a typical oddball paradigm before and after rTMS. The latencies and amplitudes of N-100, P-200, N-200(X) and P-300 were measured and compared. The directed coherence (DCOH) was estimated to demonstrate information Row between different cortical areas. Results: rTMS significantly influenced P-300-ERPs. The effects differed on the different components (P < 0.001). The latency of P-300 significantly increased after stimulation, which was more obvious in the frontal and central areas. The changes in P-300 amplitude were not significant (P > 0.05). The DCOH from the frontal. central, parietal and occipital areas to the temporal area was significantly higher than the DCOH from the temporal area to the former 4 areas (P < 0.01). Conclusions: rTMS with the present parameters can affect P-300-ERPs, leading to a delayed P-300 component and changes in information connections around the stimulated site. Our data suggest that rTMS may postpone neuronal activities related to cognitive processing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: A time-frequency analysis method was applied to an auditory oddball paradigm in 7 healthy subjects. This method combines a multiresolution wavelet algorithm for signal extraction and the Gabor transform to represent the temporal evolution of the selected frequency components. Phase-locked or evoked activity and also non-phase-locked activity were computed for both standard and target stimuli. Results: The gamma band frequency components differed between target and non-target stimuli processing. The study showed an early and mainly phase-locked oscillatory response appearing around 26-28 ms after both standard and target stimuli onset, This response showed a spectral peak around 44 Hz for both stimuli. A late oscillatory activity peaking at 37 Hz with a latency around 360 ms was observed appearing only fur target stimuli. The latency of this late oscillatory activity had a high correlation (P = 0.002) to the latency of the P300 wave. Conclusions: EEC signal analysis with wavelet transform allows the identification of an early oscillatory cortical response in the gamma frequency range, as well as a late P300-related response.

Using olfactory threshold testing, intranasal electrophysiology and EEG we show for the first time that: (1) the subjects' detection threshold is proportional to the amplitude of the olfactory evoked potential (EOG) recorded inside the nose; (2) the EOG amplitude is correlated with the amplitude of the olfactory event-related potential (OERP) recorded on the scalp; and (3) with repetitive exposure, human subjects acquire a reduced threshold for androstenone and, as they do so, their EOG and OERP increase. These observations support the existence of odourant-specific plasticity in the peripheral olfactory system.

Its clinical significance with regards to progression to overt encephalopathy has however, not been established. Aims: The present study was conducted (i) to compare the diagnostic usefulness of neuropsychological tests with that of electrophysiological (EP) tests in detection of SHE, and (ii) to examine the natural course of SHE. Methods: Seventy-five-nonencephalopathic cirrhotics (11 females, 64 males; mean (+/- SD) age 43.6 (+/- 11.7) years; mean (+/- SD) education 11(+/- 3) years) were studied using a battery of tests for intelligence and memory, the number connection test (NCT), and EP tests viz. electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory P300 event related potentials (P3ERP). All the patients were followed up for a period of 6 months to 2 years for development of overt encephalopathy. Results: Thirty-five out of 75(47%) patients were diagnosed to have SHE based on at least one abnormal test result. The P3ERP latencies detected SHE in maximum number of patients (23%) followed by EEG (21%). Nearly 59% of patients with SHE progressed to overt encephalopathy within a mean duration of 4 months. Multivariate analysis showed that prior episode of encephalopathy (RR = 6.3; 95% CI = 2.0-19.7), abnormality on EEG (RR = 7.5; 95% CI = 2.2-25.3), abnormal performance on psychometric battery of tests (RR = 35.2; 95% CI = 4.3-287.3), occurrence of gastrointestinal bleed (RR = 19.3; 95% CI = 4.1-88.9), occurrence of dehydration (RR = 10.7; 95% CI = 2.5-45.4) and infection (RR = 11.4; 95% CI = 2.0-64.4) had significantly higher risk for development of overt encephalopathy. Conclusions: EP methods were more sensitive in detection of SHE. Amongst all the tests used, presence of only an abnormal EEG was significantly associated with development of overt encephalopathy along with the precipitating factors.

While the neurophysiological mechanisms of spindle generation, that involves thalamic and corticothalamic networks, have been recently delineated and are briefly reviewed, their definitive functional meaning still remains to be elucidated. This review summarizes the present knowledge on visually scored and automatically detected spindles, as well as the literature on EEG power in the sigma band. Among the factors their time-course across sleep cycles, the reciprocal relationship with delta activity, the effects of sleep deprivation, of circadian factors and of ageing, and their role in information processing have been discussed. Moreover, specific attention has been paid to the existence of functionally and topographically distinct slow- and fast-spindles, also taking into account the presence of large inter-individual differences. Nevertheless, several fundamental issues remain to be elucidated: the physiological mechanisms controlling age-related changes in spindle parameters; the role of melatonin as a spindle-promoting agent; the relationships between plastic mechanisms (after stroke, or as a consequence of learning) and modifications in spindle activity; the possibility of using some spindle parameters as an index of the severity of developmental disorders in abnormal maturational processes.

We applied a wavelet time-frequency analysis to differentiate the brain dynamics between painful and non-painful somatosensory stimulation. The observed pattern to pain-induced effects exhibited a stepwise decrease of frequencies over time, starting around 26 ms over somatosensory cortex at 80 Hz, intermediate oscillations at 40 and 20 Hz around 40 ms, and reaching down to 10 Hz after 160 ms. This step-wise frequency decrease of ERO, coincident with spatial shift from the contralateral somatosensory area at 80 Hz to the centro-frontal brain at 40/20 Hz and final spatial expansion to the large region of centro-parietal areas at 10 Hz, may represent the cortical processes necessary to transfer sensory information from perceptual stages to subsequent cognitive stages in consciousness.

The N200 obtained using an auditory oddball paradigm had lower amplitude in alcoholics than in controls. A significant amplitude decrease Of Visual P300 was also observed in alcoholic male subjects. There was however no difference in auditory P300 between alcoholics and control subjects. Using a Go/Nogo paradigm, a significant difference on the final part of the VCN appears between alcoholic and pilot subjects. In addition, the longitudinal follow-up of the same alcoholic patients showed an electrophysiological profile that allowed dividing them into two different groups. On the initial recording (17 days after weaning), the auditory oddball P300 amplitude was significantly higher at Cz and Pz among patients who relapsed during the 3 months follow-up. The same effect appeared on the CNV protocol, where the amplitude of P300 was hi.-her in patients who subsequently relapsed than for those who remained abstemious. Cognitive ERPs may be clinically useful to improve the prediction of risk of relapse among alcoholic patients. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. Tons droits reserves.

ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone oddball paradigm in medication-free patients with DSM-IV social phobia (n = 25) and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Neuropsychological test performance was administered. Compared with the HC group, patients with social phobia showed reductions in N1 at temporal leads, N2 and P300 amplitudes, predominantly centroparietally, and longer P300 latencies. The observed P300 latency prolongation was associated with reduced Non-Verbal Learning Test (NVLT) but not the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) scores. The reduction in N1 amplitude indicates an impairment in perceptual processing. The reduced P300 amplitudes may reflect reduced cognitive resources for the evaluation of relevant information. The increased P300 latency, indicating longer stimulus evaluation time, was correlated to deficits in learning processes as measured by the Non-Verbal Learning Test but not to executive function as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. It may therefore be concluded that social phobia patients show deficits in cognitive information processing as reflected by ERPs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ERP activity was obtained from a single subject using a 124-channel sensor array during a task requiring the monitoring of imageable words for occasional targets. Distributed cortical activity was estimated every 2.5 ms with high spatial resolution using real head, boundary element modelling of non-target activity. High-resolution structural MRI was used for segmentation of tissue boundaries and co-registration to the scalp electrode array. The inverse solution was constrained to the cortical surface. Cortical activity was observed in regions commonly associated with verbal working memory function. This included: the occipital pole (early visual processing); the superior temporal and inferior parietal gyrus bilaterally and the left angular gyrus (visual and phonological word processing); the dorsal lateral occipital gyrus (spatial processing); and aspects of the bilateral superior parietal lobe (imagery and episodic verbal memory). Activity was also observed in lateral and superior prefrontal. regions associated with working memory control of sensorimotor processes. The pattern of cortical activity was relatively stable over time, with variations in the extent and amplitude of contributing local source activations. By contrast, the pattern of concomitant scalp topography varied considerably over time, reflecting the linear summation effects of volume conduction that often confound dipolar source modelling.

The neural substrates and the behavioral correlates of the protracted N1 maturation, as well as of the 10-year long predominance of the N2 are unclear. The present study utilized high-resolution electroencephalography to study the maturation of auditory ERPs from age 4 to adulthood and to compare the sources of the N1 and the N2 peaks in 9-year-old children and adults. Methods: Three partial harmonic tones were delivered with short (700 ms) and long (mean of 5 s) stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), with only 700 ms SOA used with 4-year-olds. Results: With a short SOA, 4- and 9-year-old children displayed P1 and N2 peaks. whereas adults showed P1, N1, P2, and N2 waves. With a long SOA, 9-year-olds also displayed an NI peak, which was frontal in scalp distribution to that in adults who showed P1, N1, and P2 peaks. After filtering out the slow N2 activity, the N1 wave was also revealed in the short-SOA data in 9-year-old but not in 4-year-old children. In adults and in 9-year-olds, the neural sources of the N2 and N1 mapped onto the superior aspects of the temporal lobes. the sources of the N2 being anterior to those of the N1. Conclusions: The results indicated that children's N1 is composed of differently weighted components as that in adults, and that in both children and adults the N1 and N2 are generated by anatomically distinct generators. A protracted ontogeny of the N1 could be linked with that of auditory sensitivity and orienting, whereas the P I and N2 peaks are suggested to reflect auditory sensory processes.

In the present study, we intended to determine whether these slow potentials would indicate some abnormality (topographic) in schizophrenic patients, and thus serve as an indication of abnormal association cortex activity. We recorded slow potentials while subjects performed a paired-associates memory task. A 123-channel EEG montage and common average reference were used for 20 unmedicated schizophrenic (mean duration of illness: 11.3 +/- 9.2 years; mean number of previous hospitalizations: 1.2 +/- 1.9) and 22 healthy control subjects during a visual paired-associates matching task. For the topographic analysis, we used a simple index of individual topographic deviation from normality, corrected for absolute potential intensities. Slow potentials were observed in all subjects. Control subjects showed a simple spatial pattern of voltage extrema (left central positive and right prefrontal negative), whereas schizophrenic patients presented a more complex, fragmented pattern. Topographic deviation was significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The increased topographic complexity in schizophrenics could be visualized in grand averages computed across subjects. Increased topographic complexity could also be seen when grand averages were computed for subgroups of patients assembled either according to task-performance (high versus low) or by their scores on psychopathological scales. There was no significant correlation between topographic deviation and psychopathology scores. We conclude that the slow potential topographic abnormalities of schizophrenia indicate an abnormality in the configuration of large-scale electrical activity in association cortices.

The N400 component of the EEG event-related potentials was used as a probe of semantic processes. Method: Word pairs were presented with short and long stimulus-onset asynchronies to investigate, respectively, early and late semantic processes in 16 women with schizotypal personality disorder and 15 normal female comparison subjects. Event-related potentials were recorded in response to the last words in a pair. Results: With the short stimulus-onset asynchrony, the N400 amplitude was less negative in the schizotypal personality disorder group than in the normal comparison group. No group differences were found with the long stimulus-onset asynchrony. Conclusions: The finding of a less negative than normal N400 amplitude with the short stimulus-onset asynchrony in women with schizotypal personality disorder supports the hypothesis that persons with this disorder evince an overactivation of semantic networks. The absence of group differences with the long stimulus-onset asynchrony, which is,primarily sensitive to processes involved in context integration, suggests that in this group of schizotypal personality disorder subjects, additional demands on working memory may be necessary to bring out the semantic dysfunction.

One hundred and one healthy children (dextrals) took part in the tests. Among them, 26 and 30 children were 5 to 7 and 10 to 12 years old, while the third age group included 45 teenagers (15 to 16 years old). We recorded EP and measured the time of a sensorimotor reaction in the following experimental paradigm. Its program provided automated presentation of a pair of acoustic signals, preliminary and imperative; the subject had to perform a motor reaction, pushing a button with the right thumb, with a minimum delay after the second stimulus. Visual feedback signals informed the subject about the successful or inadequate performance of the reaction (time of reaction was shorter than or exceeded a limit value). Indices characterizing the level of attention were estimated using "Find and delete" and "Schulte's tables" techniques. A well-manifested N2 component of the EP related to the preliminary signal was a specific feature in the group of 5- to 7-year-old children, while the contingent negative variation (CNV) preceding the motor reaction was poorly developed in this group. The best characteristics of attention in these and older (10 to 12 years old) children were typical of subjects with maximally expressed N1-P2 waves. In teenagers, the best attention was typical of subjects with the highest-amplitude P1 and P2 components, CNV, and P300 wave and with the lowest amplitude of the N1 component.	[Pavlenko, V.

P300 components were measured in 12 well-trained cyclists and blood glucose, cortisol, insulin, glycerol, and free fatty acids (FFAs) epinephrine and norepinephrine were analyzed. Results indicated that P300 components were affected by exercise with a temporary increase in amplitude between the 1st and the 2nd hour and an increase in latency after 2 h of exercise concomitant with some hormonal changes, including an increase in cortisol and epinephrine and a decrease in blood glucose. These findings suggest a combined effect of arousal and central fatigue on electrocortical indices of cognitive function during acute physical exercise. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Whereas evoked activity reflects the summation of transient post-synaptic potentials triggered by an event, induced activity, which is mainly oscillatory in nature, is thought to reflect changes in parameters controlling dynamic interactions within and between brain structures. We hypothesize that induced activity may yield information about the dynamics of cell assembly formation, activation and subsequent uncoupling, which may play a prominent role in different types of memory operations. We then describe a number of analysis tools that can be used to study the reactivity of induced rhythmic activity, both in terms of amplitude changes and of phase variability. We briefly discuss how alpha, gamma and theta rhythms are thought to be generated, paying special attention to the hypothesis that the theta rhythm reflects dynamic interactions between the hippocampal system and the neocortex. This hypothesis would imply that studying the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta may provide a window on the contribution of the hippocampus to memory functions. We review studies investigating the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta in paradigms engaging episodic memory, spatial memory and working memory. In addition, we review studies that relate theta reactivity to processes at the interface of memory and language. Despite many unknowns, the experimental evidence largely supports the hypothesis that theta activity plays a functional role in cell assembly formation, a process which may constitute the neural basis of memory formation and retrieval. The available data provide only highly indirect support for the hypothesis that scalp-recorded theta yields information about hippocampal functioning. It is concluded that studying induced rhythmic activity holds promise as an additional important way to study brain function.

Stimulus material consisted of slides of spiders, snakes and neutral objects presented subliminally on a screen. Conscious recognition of stimuli was prevented by backward masking. During the experiment EEG was recorded continuously from 64 electrodes. Results show lower detection thresholds in spider phobics when pictures of spiders were presented as compared to control subjects and to the other stimulus categories. ERPs show no differences between the two groups and between categories of stimuli. Results are discussed with respect to information processing theories and in relation to studies of biased processing of emotional stimuli.

In contrast, visual search experiments revealed that search for a multi-featured object takes more time than for a single-featured object. We used EEG to differentiate the effect of object-load and feature-load in a short-term memory task. We independently varied the amount of objects and features that had to be memorized. Object-load modulated P3 amplitude during encoding and induced 10 Hz oscillations during the retention interval. Feature-load modulated the P3 during retrieval. Thus, only object-load seemed to influence encoding and retention while feature-load played a crucial role during retrieval. Our results demonstrate that object-load and feature-load influence short-term memory at different stages. (C) 2003 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

J	Crone, NE; Hao, L				Crone, NE; Hao, L			Functional dynamics of spoken and signed word production: A case study using electrocorticographic spectral analysis	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article							LEFT TEMPORAL-LOBE; MASSIVE CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; LANGUAGE AREA; WERNICKES AREA; GRASP REPRESENTATIONS; OLFACTORY SYSTEM	Background: Event-related changes in the EEG power spectrum have recently been used to study functional brain activation in humans. Like traditional event-related potentials, event-related spectral changes provide information about the temporal evolution of cortical activation that is difficult to obtain with fMRI or PET. These spectral changes include event-related suppression of power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and even-related augmentation of power in the gamma band (>30 Hz). Most studies of the gamma band have focused on frequencies in and around 40 Hz. Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded with subdural electrodes implanted for the surgical management of epilepsy, we have also observed a broadband augmentation of power in higher gamma frequencies (>80 Hz). This index of cortical activation has compared favourably with alpha suppression and with electrical cortical stimulation mapping in Studies utilising simple motor and auditory processing, but such a comparison has not been done for tasks requiring more complex language processing. Aims: We used two different spectral indices of cortical activation-alpha power suppression and gamma power augmentation, to study the spatial and temporal patterns of human cortical activation during different word production tasks. Methods: Subdural ECoG electrodes were implanted for clinical purposes in a patient with normal hearing, who had learned sign language as an adult and later developed intractable epilepsy. We measured event-related spectral changes during language tasks with different input and output modalities: Picture naming and word reading (visual inputs), and word repetition (auditory input) were performed with spoken responses (oral-articulatory output) and with signed responses (manual-gestural output). In addition we used a visually guided motor task to map tongue and hand representations independent of language. Results: Speech and signing differentially activated tongue and hand regions of sensorimotor cortex. Although posterior superior temporal gyrus was activated early during auditory word repetition, picture naming and word reading also activated this region, albeit slightly later, consistent with phonological and/or lexical-semantic processing. In contrast. basal temporal-occipital cortex was activated earlier and with greater magnitude during picture naming and word reading than during word repetition, Suggesting semantic processing or object and word recognition. In all of the tasks, event-related gamma augmentation occurred in more discrete spatial and temporal patterns than event-related alpha suppression. Conclusions: Event-related alpha suppression and gamma augmentation provide complementary information about task-related cortical activation. This study demonstrates the utility of ECoG spectral analysis for studying the functional anatomy of human language with excellent temporal resolution.

High intelligent individuals, as compared with average ones in both tasks displayed a lesser full width at half maximum (FWHM) volume-indicating the amount of spatial dispersion of the source. High and average intelligent individuals also differed in their source location. The source location of high intelligent individuals was in the inferior right hemispheric brain areas, whereas the source location of average intelligent individuals was in the superior left hemispheric brain areas. The findings were explained in the light of the neural efficiency model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to test this hypothesis, we compared in eight healthy subjects the synchronization of EEG beta rhythms following active and passive index extension. The passive movement was also performed after deafferentation by ischaemic nerve block in three subjects. Beta synchronization was present in all subjects after both active and passive movements, and disappeared under ischaemia in all three subjects. Post-movement beta synchronization can not solely be explained by an idling motor cortex. It may also, at least in part, reflect a movement-related somatosensory processing.

Ultralate LEPs were recorded in eight healthy subjects with 19 channels EEG and EOG. Laser stimuli (n = 200/subject, < 0.5 turn diameter, 5 ms duration, 9.4 mJ/mm(2) energy density) were applied in a pseudo-random order to the proximal phalanx of either middle finger (target) or index (non-target) of the left hand. Vigilance was maintained during recording sessions. Subject's task was to press a button to any kind of sensation perceived at the target zone. We observed a negative-positive (N965-P1139) complex maximal at Cz for all stimulus conditions. This complex was of significantly larger amplitude for rare events. For the target responses, a second distinct positive peak was observed with a mean latency of 1343 +/- 103.5 ms with maximum amplitude at Pz. This latest peak may represent an endogenous P3-like component as it is linked to the subject's detection of the target stimulus (rare events).

J	Titone, DA; Salisbury, DF				Titone, DA; Salisbury, DF			Contextual modulation of N400 amplitude to lexically ambiguous words	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; HEMISPHERIC-DIFFERENCES; TIME-COURSE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMPREHENSION; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; INHIBITION; DISCOURSE; MEMORY	Though much is known about the N400 component, an event-related EEG potential that is sensitive to semantic manipulations, it is unclear whether modulations of N400 amplitude reflect automatic processing, controlled processing, or both. We examined this issue using a semantic judgment task that manipulated local and global contextual cues. Word triplets (prime-noun-target, e.g., finance-bank money) were sequentially presented on a computer screen (500 ms duration, 1000ms stimulus onset asynchrony), in which the second word was a homograph. The first word (prime) created a neutral-, dommant-meaning- or subordinate-meaning-biased "global context," and the third word (target) created a dominant- or subordinate-biased "local context" that was either congruent or incongruent with the "global context" established by the first prime word. Participants were instructed to read all three words but to decide only whether the second and third words were semantically related. Event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically the N400, were recorded to the third terminal word. N400 amplitudes evoked by dominant meaning-related third words incongruent with the globally biased subordinate context (e.g., river-bridge-money) were significantly more negative than dominant endings in neutral contexts (e.g., taxi-bank-money), but not different from unrelated filler triplets. In addition, there was some indication that left hemisphere, temporal-parietal electrode sites were associated with greater N400 negativity for dominant targets in conflicting subordinate global contexts than homologous right hemisphere electrode sites, the latter of which showed significant activation to subordinate meanings in cooperating contexts. Thus, N400 amplitude was more affected by global than local context suggesting that controlled processes may take priority over automatic processes in modulating N400 amplitude, especially for left hemisphere electrode sites.

Methods: Brain's electrical activity was studied using the analysis of event-related (de)synchronizations (ERD/S) of cortical mu and beta rhythms in 17 subjects. 8 young and 9 elderly subjects. Results: In both populations. we found an earlier and broader mu and beta ERD during the preparation of the targeting movement compared to distal and proximal movements, principally involving the contralateral parietal region. During the execution, a spreading over the parietocentral region during proximal movement and over the parietal region during targeting movement was observed. After the execution of proximal and targeting movements, a wider and higher beta ERS was observed only in the young subjects. In the elderly subjects, our results showed a significant decrease of beta ERS during the targeting task. Conclusions: These results suggest there was a larger recruitment of cortical areas, involving notably the parietal cortex when the movement is visuo-guided. Moreover, cerebral aging-related changes in the spatio-temporal beta ERS pattern suggests an impaired sensory integration. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In addition, the effects of selected premorbid and comorbid factors were examined. Methods: P300 ERPs were recorded from 72 residential treatment program patients, characterized by a history of either cocaine (n = 25), or cocaine and alcohol (n = 18), or opioid (n = 29) dependence, and 14 non-drug-dependent community volunteers. The 86 subjects completed a visual continuous performance test formed by a series of 150 presentations of individual consonant letters. They were asked to press a key whenever a letter was presented twice in succession. Results: Analyses of P300 ERPs obtained on target trials revealed a similar amplitude decrement in all the patient groups. Further analyses of P300 activity in the 3 drug-dependent patient groups revealed a negative correlation between P300 amplitude and the number of DSM-M childhood conduct disorder criterion behaviors as well as a positive correlation between P300 amplitude and the duration of drug abstinence. Conclusions: P300 amplitude in drug-dependent patients is influenced by a complex interaction between CNS pathology that predates, and probably promotes, the onset of drug dependence and CNS pathology that resolves during the process of recovery from drug dependence.

J	Bastien, CH; Crowley, KE; Colrain, IM				Bastien, CH; Crowley, KE; Colrain, IM			Evoked potential components unique to non-REM sleep: relationship to evoked K-complexes and vertex sharp waves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						topography; brain states; non-REM sleep	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLOW-WAVE; NREM SLEEP; SCALP TOPOGRAPHY; STAGE-2 SLEEP; EEG; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; BRAIN; STIMULATION	Following the loss of wakeful consciousness, the averaging of responses to stimuli produce evoked potential waveforms with prominent components either unique to or greatly enhanced by non-REM sleep. In the sleep onset periods (stage 1) these are the P2 and N350. Following the establishment of stable sleep (stage 2 and SWS), the N550 and P900 are also prominent. Investigation of the EEG associated with individual responses indicates that a good proportion of stimuli elicit, K-complexes or vertex sharp waves (VSWs) and occasionally will elicit both. Recent work has indicated that the N550 in the averaged response is due to the presence of K-complexes and that the N350 is at least largely due to the presence of VSWs. The large size of these grapho-elements indicates that they are probably produced by a synchronized discharge of multiple neural units. Both are readily observed in the absence of external stimulation and occur as normal components of sleep, indeed the K-complex is used as one of the identifying features of the onset of stable non-REM sleep. The present review details the investigation of these features and their associated evoked potential components, in terms of stimulus features, brain states associated with their production, their scalp topography, and changes as a function of age.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between resting EEG and the ERP components in two groups of healthy subjects with different levels of performance in a highly demanding selective visual attention task. Young adults were classified according to the amount of their correct responses in the task, into high (HP; averaged hits (AH): 86%) and low performance groups (LP; AH: 59%). EEG was recorded during rest, prior to task performance and absolute (AP) and relative power (RP), as well as inter-(rTER) and intrahemispheric (rTRA) correlation were calculated. ERPs during task performance were also obtained and their amplitude and latency measures were assessed. Results showed that individuals with better behavioral performance had a higher synchronization between both hemispheres during rest as well as higher amplitude and shorter latencies of N2 and P3. Principal Component Analysis revealed that alpha2 AP and RP were inversely related to P2 and N2 latency. Higher values of alpha1 and alpha2 rTER were clustered with higher P3 amplitude and shorter reaction time. In conclusion, the differences in the cortical organization of HP and LP at rest (EEG) seem to be associated to the way the brain reacts during information processing (ERPs). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We used the method of quantification of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) to analyze the reactivity of intracerebral rhythms recorded in stereoelectroencephalography within the sensorimotor areas during the preparation and the execution of a simple self-paced hand movement. We recorded 3 epileptic subjects who were explored before a surgical treatment. Results: An ERD of mu and beta rhythms has been recorded before the movement onset in the precentral gyrus, spreading then to the postcentral gyrus and to the frontal medial cortex. The frontal lateral cortex was inconstantly involved during the movement. The movement offset was followed by an important and focused beta ERS which was found within the pre- and post-central gyrus and the frontal medial cortex. Within the beta band, we observed several narrower bands with different reactivities and locations. Focused gamma reactivity was also found in the precentral and postcentral gyri. Conclusions: The reactivities of mu and beta rhythms are different but their locations overlap. Mu ERD is a diffuse phenomenon that reflects the activation of all the sensorimotor areas during a simple movement. Beta band is likely to be composed of different rhythms with different functional significance. The primary motor area seems to contain two distinct areas with different reactivity to the movement preparation and execution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we examined current sources of the presaccadic positivity and pre-REM negativity using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Fourteen young healthy volunteers participated in the study. Brain potentials were recorded from 26 scalp sites and time-locked to the onsets of saccades and REMs during a visually triggered saccade task and natural nocturnal sleep. Current sources of the presaccadic positivity were estimated to be in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, whereas those of the pre-REM negativity were estimated to be in the right amygdala, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left orbital gyrus. Different sources of these potentials give further support to the idea that different neural processes are responsible for saccades and REMs. Moreover, the findings that current sources of the pre-REM negativity were estimated to be in the limbic part of the brain suggests that this negativity might be associated with memory and emotional processing in REM sleep.

Stage 1 sleep was divided into trials preceded by alpha and those preceded by theta. A negative wave peaking at about 100 ms, N1, displayed a significant decrease in amplitude with the onset of Stage 2 sleep. A later N2 peaked at about 250 ms in the waking state. This changed into a sleep-specific negative wave peaking at 300 ms (N300) at the alpha-theta transition within Stage 1. The P300 displayed a similar shift to become a P450 in Stage 2 sleep. N550 was specific to Stage 2, and was larger in response to rare, rather than frequent stimuli. There was no evidence of any enhancement to relevant rare stimuli compared with irrelevant rare stimuli.

J	Herrmann, CS				Herrmann, CS			Human EEG responses to 1-100 Hz flicker: resonance phenomena in visual cortex and their potential correlation to cognitive phenomena	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha; EEG; gamma; flicker; resonance; SSVEP; steady-state potentials	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA; STIMULI; MEMORY; HALLUCINATIONS; PERCEPTION	The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color; are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30-80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. if neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.

A popular approach is identification of component modes on the basis of the time-varying spectrum of multichannel EEG recordings-in other words, a space/frequency/time atomic decomposition of the time-varying EEG spectrum. Previous work has been limited to only two of these dimensions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used to create space/time decompositions; suffering an inherent lack of uniqueness that is overcome only by imposing constraints of orthogonality or independence of atoms. Conventional frequency/time decompositions ignore the spatial aspects of the EEG. Framing of the data being as a three-way array indexed by channel, frequency, and time allows the application of a unique decomposition that is known as Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). Each atom is the tri-linear decomposition into a spatial, spectral, and temporal signature. We applied this decomposition to the EEG recordings of five subjects during the resting state and during mental arithmetic. Common to all subjects were two atoms with spectra signatures whose peaks were in the theta and alpha range. These signatures were modulated by physiological state, increasing during the resting stage for alpha and during mental arithmetic for theta. Furthermore, we describe a new method (Source Spectra Imaging or SSI) to estimate the location of electric current sources from the EEG spectrum. The topography of the theta atom is frontal and the maximum of the corresponding SSI solution is in the anterior frontal cortex. The topography of the alpha atom is occipital with maximum of the SSI solution in the visual cortex. We show that the proposed decomposition can be used to search for activity with a given spectral and topographic profile in new recordings, and that the method may be useful for artifact recognition and removal.

RRPs and AM images were recorded in separate studies during a specifically designed experimental procedure. The protocol consisted of three visual tasks of increasing complexity. In the first two tasks subjects were asked to passively watch at letters and symbols respectively without making any effort in reading or articulating silently them. In the third task subjects were asked to read aloud letters appearing on a screen at a rate of 0.5 Hz. 7 young healthy subjects participated in the experiment. The analysis of RRPs highlighted the following results. During non-alphabetic symbols presentation the amplitude of the potentials was lower in comparison to presentation of letters. Reading aloud generated RRPs of greater amplitude than implicit reading. The analysis of fMRI scans revealed that the visual presentation of both letters and symbols produced similar activation of primary visual areas. Besides these areas, reading aloud activated the motor and pre-motor cortices and the left anterior temporal lobe. The combined analysis of RRPs and fMRI characterizes both temporally and spatially the development of reading processes.

This article presents findings from these research domains and comprehensively reviews their relevance with respect to the behavioral and cognitive profiles of dyslexia. Large-scale alterations were observed in the perisylvian region across paradigms. Convergent evidence has also been reported in terms of hemispheric balance. Specifically, deviances in cerebral asymmetry associated with atypical organization of the left hemisphere were found in both children and adults with dyslexia. Emerging research encompassing high-temporal resolution methods such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggests right-hemisphere involvement and points to the complexity of the developmental disorder. A combined approach of structural imaging and MEG, and most importantly theory driven behavioral tasks may shed light on dynamics and trajectories of the neurobiology of dyslexia.

In this study the AEP P300 responses for 20 patients with scores in the abnormal range were compared to the responses in 20 age and gender equivalent controls. The cortical imaging technique (CIT) was used to calculate the evolution of potential changes on the surface of the brain during a 50-millisecond epoch containing the AEP P300 response for both groups of subjects. AEP P300 condition recordings were obtained from 20 EEG and 2 EOG artifact channels. Previously published CIT results showed anterior and posterior peaks, implying multiple sources, for the P300 component. This study suggests that the anterior sources are significantly attenuated in the patient group and this anterior P300 attenuation appeared relatively more focal than that seen with scalp topographical maps alone and that the effects of the injury appear to be selective at the anterior sites.

Several critical features appear to influence consistently the prognosis of language disorder: the age at onset and the duration of language disorder associated with EEG abnormalities during wakefulness and sleep and the location of the epileptic focus. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological basis of epileptic aphasia and particularly of its poor outcome. we reexamine neuropsychological, electrophysiological and neuro-imaging data from the long-term follow-up study of several cases of Landau and Kleffner Syndrome (LKS). Our neuropsychological findings show that although the outcome of language abilities is variable. the common residual verbal disorders associate an impaired phonological short-term memory with a permanent one-car extinction oil dichotic listening tests contraleral to the temporal cortex previously affected by the epileptic focus. To check the hypothesis of a permanent dysfunction in the auditory system suggested by these findings. we studied auditory event-related potentials studies in order to localize, the level of the dysfunction in auditory language processing and along the auditory pathway. Using H(2)(15)O labeled positron emission tomography (PET), we compared the brain activation for immediate serial recall of lists of 4 words. contratsted to single word repetition in three recovered LKS patients and 14 heavy controls. Both ERP's and PET's findings suggest that the residual verbal impairments at the late outcome of LKS might indeed be related to persistent dysfunction in the temporal regions that were involved in the epileptic focus during the active phase.

One aspect of this control is thought to be a facilitation of sensory pathways in anticipation of such processing. To investigate the possible involvement of prefrontal cortex in anticipatory top-down control, we studied the statistical relations between prefrontal activity, recorded while a macaque monkey waited for presentation of a visual stimulus, and subsequent sensory and motor events. Local field potentials were simultaneously recorded from prefrontal, motor, occipital and temporal cortical sites in the left cerebral hemisphere. Spectral power and coherence analysis revealed that during stimulus anticipation three of five prefrontal sites participated in a coherent oscillatory network synchronized in the P-frequency range. Pre-stimulus network power and coherence were highly correlated with the amplitude and latency of early visual evoked potential components in visual cortical areas, and with response time. The results suggest that synchronized oscillatory networks in prefrontal cortex are involved in top-down anticipatory mechanisms that facilitate subsequent sensory processing in visual cortex. They further imply that stronger top-down control leads to larger and faster sensory responses, and a subsequently faster motor response.

We performed dual neuron-glia intracellular recordings together with multisite field potential recordings from cortical suprasylvian association areas 5 and 7 of cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. Electrical stimuli applied to the cortex elicited responses consisting of a biphasic depolarization in glial cells, which was associated with an EPSP-IPSP sequence in neurons. During the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation, extracellular measurements of the potassium concentration revealed periodic increases with an amplitude of 1-2 mM, similar in shape to glial activities. We suggest that, through their uptake mechanisms, glia cells modulate the neuronal excitability and contribute to the pacing of the slow oscillation. The slow oscillation often evolved into SW paroxysms, mimicking sleep-triggered seizures. This transition was associated with increased coupling between the depolarizing events in neurons and glial cells. During seizures, the glial membrane potential displayed phasic negative events related to the onset of the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in neurons. These events were not voltage dependent and increased their incidence and amplitude with the development of the seizure. It is suggested that the intraglial transient negativities represent field reflections of synchronized neuronal potentials. We propose that the mechanisms underlying the neuron-glia communication include, besides the traditional neurotransmitter- and ion-mediated pathways, field effects crossing their membranes as a function of the state of the cortical network.

We previously found that semantic violations elicited N400 and syntactic violations elicited P600 but not early left anterior negativity (ELAN) or left anterior negativity (LAN) using a relatively long stimulus presentation time (1 s). In the present study, we adopted a shorter stimulus presentation time (0.5 s), which might impose a heavier burden on the working memory system, to test the possible relevance of load on the working memory system to ELAN/LAN. A global field power analysis showed an increased potential field strength at the latency of 320 ms in either type, as well as those at the later latencies reflecting N400 (556 ms) and P600 (712 ins). Statistical analyses revealed a significant negative deflection in the right frontal region for the semantic type, whereas no significant deflection in either specified region was obtained for the syntactic type at the latency of 320 ms. The lack of ELAN/LAN suggested that it was not due to the deactivation of the working memory system. Moreover, scalp current density topographies implied that the processing of the verbal stimuli was mediated by distinct areas within the left temporal region, according to its semantic congruency with the preceding context at a latency as early as 320 ms. These findings are in line with the dual-route hypothesis of reading, which suggests that the reading of verbal stimuli semantically incongruent with the preceding context is dominated by phonological processes rather than lexico-semantic.

We developed a fully computerized classifier based on 5 minutes of EEG recording during an acoustical choice reaction time task (AMDP-module IV). We included factorized variables from the frequency domain and evoked potentials (N100/P200-complex) from central and frontal electrodes, which were preprocessed in a sample of 150 normal subjects prior to classification. We applied discriminant analyses to the electrophysiological data from depressive, schizophrenic and schizotypal subjects, most of them being unmedicated or drug-naive. The classifier was developed on a training set (33 schizophrenics, 49 normals) and tested on an independent sample (32 schizophrenics, 49 normals). A simple three-variable classifier was found to classify schizophrenics and normals in 77 % of those tested correctly. Diagnostic specificity of the das sifier proved to be low as the inclusion of depressive patients (n = 60) significantly decreased classification power. It was demonstrated that atypical but not typical neuroleptic drugs may influence the classification results. Correctly classified schizophrenics showed significantly more negative symptoms and slower reaction times than those schizophrenics who were misclassified as normals. In contrast, these misclassified schizophrenics showed a non-significant trend for more positive symptoms and shorter reaction times. As the correctly classified schizophrenics showed increased frontally pronounced delta-activity and decreased signal power of the N100/P200 amplitude, it was concluded that these schizophrenics show dysfunction of the frontal lobe. It is proposed that this new classifier can be useful for clinical and research applications when subtyping of schizophrenics with detection of frontal dysfunction as the aim.

In: Brunia, C.H.M., Gaillard, A.W.K., Kok, A. (Eds.), Psychophysiological Brain Research. Tilburg Univesity Press, Tilburg, pp. 192-195. Falkenstein, M., Hohnsbein, J., Hoormann, J., 1991. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 78, 447-455]. Originally we assumed the Ne to represent a correlate of error detection in the sense of a mismatch signal when representations of the actual response and the required response are compared. This hypothesis was supported by the results of a variety of experiments from our own laboratory and that of Goles [Gehring, W.J., Goss, B., Goles, M.G.H., Meyer, D.E., Donchin, E., 1993. Psychological Science 4, 385-390. Bernstein, P.S., Scheffers, M.K., Goles, M.G.H., 1995. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 21, 1312-1322. Scheffers, M.K., Goles, M.G.H., Bernstein, P., Gehring, W.J., Donchin, E., 1996. Psychophysiology 33, 42-54]. However, new data from our laboratory and that of Vidal et al. [Vidal, F., Hasbroucq, T., Bonnet, M., 1999. Biological Psychology, 2000] revealed a small negativity similar to the Ne also after correct responses. Since the above mentioned comparison process is also required after correct responses it is conceivable that the Ne reflects this comparison process itself rather than its outcome. As to the Pe, our results suggest that this is a further error-specific component, which is independent of the Ne, and hence associated with a later aspect of error processing or post-error processing. Our new results with different age groups argue against the hypotheses that the Pe reflects conscious error processing or the post-error adjustment of response strategies. Further research is necessary to specify the functional significance of the Pe. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Psychometric task batteries used to characterize such effects do not provide direct information about treatment-related changes in brain function. Since overt task performance reflects motivation and effort as well as ability, behavioral measures alone may overestimate or underestimate the impact of a pharmacological intervention on brain function. Here we present a method that combines behavioral and neurophysiological measures in an attempt to detect the psychoactive effects of pharmacological treatments with greater sensitivity than that provided by behavioral measures alone. Initial application of the method is made to the data from a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in which caffeine, diphenhydramine, and alcohol were used to alter the mental state of 16 healthy subjects at rest and while they performed low load and high load versions of a working memory task. For each intervention, more sensitive detection of drug or alcohol effects over a four hour period was obtained when EEG variables were included in multivariate analyses than when only behavioral variables were used. These initial results suggest that it can be useful to incorporate neurophysiological measures of brain activity into inferences concerning the acute impact of drugs on mental function, and demonstrate the feasibility of using multivariate combinations of behavioral and neurophysiological measures to sensitively characterize the pharmacodynamics of drug-induced changes in cognition.

SEPs were recorded (-50 to +250 ms) from 12 healthy subjects following nonpainful (reference), slight painful, and moderate painful stimulations (subjective scale). Laplacian transformation of scalp SEPs reduced head volume conduction effects and annulled electric reference influence. Typical SEP components to the galvanic nonpainful stimulation were contralateral frontal P20-N30-N60-N120-P170, central P22-P40, and parietal N20-P30-P60-P120 (N = negativity P = positivity number = latency in ms). These components were observed also with the painful stimulations, the N60, N120, P170 having a longer latency with the painful than nonpainful stimulations. Additional SEP components elicited by the painful stimulations were parietomedian P80 as well as central N125, P170 (cP170), and P200. These additional SEP components included the typical vertex negative-positive complex following transient painful stimulations. Latency of the SEP components exclusively elicited by painful stimulation is highly compatible with the involvement of A delta myelinated fibers/spinothalamic pathway. The topography of these components is in line with the response of both nociceptive medial and lateral systems including bilateral primary sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortical areas. The role of attentive, affective, and motor aspects in the modulation of the reported SEP components merits investigation in future experiments. Hum. Brain Mapping 12:168-179, 2001.

Recent studies furthermore suggest that phase synchronization of induced gamma activity may represent a general mechanism enabling transient associations of neural assemblies and thus may play a central role in cortical information processing. Here, we describe findings indicating that synchronized gamma activity is moreover specifically involved in selective attention. While feature binding appears to depend primarily on induced gamma synchronization, attentional processes seem to involve both induced and evoked gamma oscillations. Yet it is still an open question, as to which top-down and bottom-up processes are associated with attentional modulation of gamma activity. A possible mechanism to project influences from attentional control structures to areas concerned with stimulus representation and vice versa, may be neuronal synchronization and the resulting firing rate changes of coincidence-detecting neurons in target areas.

Given that delta electroencephalogram (EEG) and K-complexes are thought to be generated by the same mechanisms, it was hypothesized that K-complex amplitude and rate of production would be lower in the elderly. K-complex amplitude was assessed by averaging K-complex responses to auditory stimuli, and measuring the amplitude of the N550 component of the averaged evoked response. Ten young (five males and five females; mean age 23.10 +/- 5.36 years) and 10 elderly adults (six males and four females; mean age=75.60 +/- 4.48 years) who were neurologically healthy and free from medication spent two non-consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. EEG was recorded from six gold plate electrodes (Fz, Fcz, Cz, Cpz, Pz and O-2 ) referenced to A1 + A2. Tone clicks (1000 Hz), of varying intensity from 70 to 100 decibels above measured awake detection threshold, were presented binaurally during stage 2 sleep. Responses were classified according to whether they produced: a K-complex, a vertex sharp wave (VSW), both of these responses or neither response. They were then averaged separately for each response type. The elderly showed a substantially smaller N350 (averaged VSWs) and N550 amplitudes compared with the young subjects. The elderly also showed an augmented but delayed P2 component, followed by a long-lasting positive EEG shift. The smaller amplitude of the averaged K-complex N550 component is consistent with lower delta amplitudes previously reported in the elderly and with the hypothesis that K-complexes and delta activity share the same generator mechanisms. The enhanced P2 component and the long-lasting positive deflection in the EEG in the elderly indicate the existence of age differences other than smaller EEG amplitude.

This suggests an overlap in the brain regions involved in these processes. Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently revealed parietal and occipital cortex activity during dynamic visuospatial imagery. However, results concerning the involvement of higher-order cortical motor areas have been less consistent. We investigated if and when premotor structures are active during processing of a three-dimensional cube comparison task that requires dynamic visuospatial imagery. In order to achieve a good temporal and spatial resolution, single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp-recorded event-related slow cortical potentials (SCPs) were recorded from the same subjects in two separate measurement sessions. In order to reduce inter-subject variability in brain activity due to individual differences, only male subjects (n = 13) with high task-specific ability were investigated. Functional MRI revealed consistent bilateral activity in the occipital (Brodmann area BA18/19) and parietal cortex (BA7), in lateral and medial premotor areas (BA6), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex MAW, and the anterior insular cortex. The time-course of SCPs indicated that task-related activity in these areas commenced approximately 550-650 ms after stimulus presentation and persisted until task completion. These results provide strong and consistent evidence that the human premotor cortex is involved in dynamic visuospatial imagery. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Can mismatch negativity be an index for evaluating the arousal level in infants?	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Auditory event related potential; Mismatch negativity; High density electroencephalographic system; Active and quiet sleep; Neonates		Background: Electrophysiological and behavioral studies have shown that stimulus relevance contributes to auditory processing in sleep and auditory stimuli changes the sleep stages. So we observed changes in auditory processing due to sleep stages by recording infant mismatch negativity (MMN) during different states and investigated the arousal mechanisms. Methods: Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) of 26 neonates were recorded using high-density EGI EEG system. Stimuli consisted of 1000 Hz tones with 90% probability as standard and 1200 Hz with 10% probability as deviant. Study 1 was designed for the confirmation of the recording of MMN from neonates and Study 2 for investigating whether an appropriate stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the stimulus would induce a clear difference in the latency or amplitude. Results: (Study 1) MMN were obtained from all subjects. No differences of the latencies, amplitudes and distribution due to arousal or sleep stage were observed. After the MMN response occurred, a prominent negativity like Nc was seen in response to deviant stimuli in active sleep and waking state. (Study 2) No distinct differences between the difference states were seen in any SOA. Conclusions: Only MMN did not characterize the arousal or sleep stage. But the modality of the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) may differ according to the state, so further detailed investigation could enable the detection of the infants' state using the AEP.

Statistical k nearest-neighbor methods distinguished AD from control with a maximum sensitivity of 29% and false alarm rate of 12%. The comparable sensitivity/false-alarm values for a statistical projection pursuit method and an extended projection pursuit method, which selectively identify discriminative features for classification, were 75%/18% and 100%/6%, respectively. The results demonstrate that combinations of selected ERP time segments across different electrodes contain signal features that discriminate AD from control subjects with high sensitivity and specificity.

To test whether extra activity in the random task is due to increased motor preparation needed to switch between different movements, or to memory/attentional processes needed to select movements randomly, we compared regular and random movements with an additional alternating task. This alternating task required subjects to make different movements each time as in the random task, but since the task was very simple, the memory/attentional load was similar to that in the regular task. The MRCP was equally large over motor areas in both random and alternating tasks, suggesting that the extra activity over sensorimotor areas reflected processes involved in motor preparation rather than memory/attention. We speculate that, in the regular task, some part of the instructions for the previous movement remains intact, reducing the amount of preparation needed for the next repetition. Thus the MRCP is smaller than in the alternating and random tasks. Although the MRCPs in alternating and random tasks were similar over the motor areas, the random task had more activity than the alternating task in contralateral frontal areas. This part of the MRCP may therefore be related to memory/attentional processes required to randomize the sequence of movements. We conclude that the MRCP contains dissociable components related to motor preparation and memory/attention.

In order to pick out the ABR from the background EEG activity that obscures it, stimulus-synchronized averaging of many repeated trials is necessary and typically requires up to 2000 repetitions. This amount of repetitions could be very difficult and uncomfortable for some subjects. In this study a method based on wavelet analysis is introduced to reduce the required number of repetitions. The important features of the ABR are extracted by thresholding and matching the wavelet coefficients. The rules for the detection of the ABR peaks are obtained from the training data and the classification is carried out after a suitable threshold is chosen. This approach is also validated by another three sets of test data. Moreover, two procedures based on Woody averaging and latency correlated averaging are used to preprocess the ABR, which enhance the classification results.

Neurophysiological, electrophysiological and neuropsychological studies of different brain structures during voluntary attention are analyzed. These data show that selective voluntary attention modulates activity of sensory specific cortical zones involved in relevant signal processing. Fronto-thalamic system consisting of prefrontal cortex and thalamic mediodorsal nuclei is shown to be main source of top-down selective modulation of voluntary attention. The review proposed the hypothetical model of selective cortical activity modulation during voluntary attention based upon the available data and evidence of own electroencephalografic studies.

In the present study, we used an ambiguous motion paradigm and compared endogenous reversals of perceived motion direction which occur spontaneously during constant ambiguous stimulation with exogenous reversals that were induced externally by changes of stimulation. Contrasting the two conditions allowed to investigate processes that trigger endogenous reversals, since the related activity should be absent in the exogenous reversal condition. We employed ambiguous dot patterns which can easily be transformed to present two stable motion directions in order to induce exogenous pattern reversals. Whole-head MEG was recorded from 10 subjects. We analyzed event-related fields (ERFs) and oscillatory activity in the alpha and gamma ranges. The results showed P300-like slow waves in response to both endogenous and exogenous reversals reflecting the conscious recognition of pattern reversals. Analyses in the gamma-band did not reveal any significant modulations. The alpha activity showed different time courses for endogenous and exogenous reversals. While the exogenous alpha activity decreased in temporal relation to the pattern reversal, the endogenous alpha activity displayed a continuous decrease starting in the time interval preceding the reversal. This time course of the endogenous alpha activity is consistent with a bottom-up approach to figure reversals, since it reflects a process of destabilization of the actual percept until a switch of visual awareness occurs.

However, the dynamics of functional coupling among different motor areas has not been fully clarified yet. Because it has been proposed that the functional coupling among cortical areas might be achieved by the synchronization of oscillatory activity, we investigated the electrocorticographic coherence between the supplementary motor and primary sensorimotor areas (SMA and S1-M1) by means of event-related partial coherence analysis in 11 intractable epilepsy patients. We found premovement increase of coherence between the SMA proper and S1-M1 at the frequency of 0-33 Hz and between the pre-SMA and S1-M1 at 0-18 Hz. Coherence between the SMA proper and M1 started to increase 0.9 sec before the movement onset and peaked 0.3 sec after the movement. There was no systematic difference within the SMA (SMA proper vs pre-SMA) or within the S1-M1, in terms of the time course as well as the peak value of coherence. The phase spectra revealed near-zero phase difference in 57% (20 of 35) of region pairs analyzed, and the remaining pairs showed inconsistent results. This increase of synchronization between multiple motor areas in the preparation and execution of voluntary movements may reflect the multiregional functional interactions in human motor behavior.

Methods: A total of 28 children aged 9-12 years (ADHD and matched healthy controls) pressed a button in response to each target stimulus presented at the attended side (right or left). Auditory gamma band responses (GBRs) within 0-120 ms were analyzed at 8 electrodes with wavelet transform. Effects of attended channel, stimulus type. and group were evaluated for GBR power and phase-locking. Results: For both groups. GBRs had a frontal-central distribution, were significantly larger and more strongly phase-locked to target than to non-target stimuli. and did not differentiate the attended from the unattended channel. ADHD children produced larger and more strongly phase-locked GBRs than controls only to right-side stimuli, irrespective of whether these were the attended or the ignored stimuli. Conclusions: The association between auditory GBR and motor task stimulus in children suggests that phase-locked gamma oscillations may reflect processes of sensory-motor integration. ADHD-related deviations of GBRs indicate that early mechanisms of auditory stimulus processing are altered in ADHD. presumably as a result of impaired motor inhibition.

Trains of 10 repetitive tone-pip stimuli were presented. Rats (n = 8) received 4 mg.kg(-1) diazepam subcutaneously or vehicle, counterbalanced over two sessions. Diazepam decreased the amplitude of the middle-latency P-30 component and increased the amplitudes of the late-latency N-60 and P-67 components. The increase in the late-latency components might be due to a diazepam-induced decrease in arousal. Stimulus repetition decreased the amplitudes of the middle-latency N-18 and P-30 components in both conditions. This suggests that automated neuronal recovery functions underlying sensory gating remain intact with diazepam. In the vehicle condition, the amplitude of the late-latency P-67 decreased with stimulus repetition, but not in the diazepam condition. This suggests a diazepam-induced decrease of behaviourally mediated habituation. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG,Basel.

To the extent that both types of oscillations represent the activity of temporally and topographically separable neural populations, time averaging can cause a loss of brain activity information that is important both conceptually and for multimodal integration with hemodynamic techniques. To address this issue for recognition memory, simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of explicit word recognition from 11 healthy subjects were analyzed in two different ways. First, the time course of neural oscillations ranging from theta (4.5 Hz) to gamma (42 Hz) frequencies were identified using single-trial continuous wavelet transforms. Second, traditional analyses of amplitude variations of time-averaged EEG and MEG signals, event-related potentials (ERPs), and fields (ERFs) were performed and submitted to distributed source analyses. To identify data patterns that covaried with the difference between correctly recognized studied (old) words and correctly rejected nonstudied (new) words, a multivariate statistical tool, partial least squares (PLS), was applied to both types of analyses. The results show that ERPs and ERFs are mainly displaying those neural indices of recognition memory that oscillate in the theta (4.5-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5), and to some extent in the betal (12-19.5 Hz) frequency range. The sources of the ERPs/ERFs were in good agreement with the topography of theta/alpha/beta I oscillations in being confined to the anterior temporal lobe at 400 ms and being distributed across temporal, parietal, and occipital areas between 500 and 700 ms. Gamma oscillations covaried either positively or negatively with theta/alpha/beta1 oscillations. A positive covariance, for instance, was detected over left anterior temporal sensors as early as 200-350 ms and is compatible with studies in rodents showing that gamma and theta oscillations emerge together out of the interaction of the hippocampus and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Fast beta oscillations (20-29.5 Hz), on the other hand, did not strongly covary with slow oscillations and were likely to arise from neural populations not adequately represented in ERPs/ERFs. In summary, by providing a more comprehensive description of electromagnetic signals, time-frequency data are of potential benefit for integrating electrophysiological and hemodynamic indices of brain activity and also for integrating human and animal electrophysiology.

The 62-channel EEG, facial EMG and ECG were simultaneously recorded while subjects viewed sequentially presented pictures and subjectively rated them after each presentation. The obtained findings indicate that differences induced by pictures varying in emotional valence are associated mainly with increased theta and alpha-3 synchronization activity and anterior hemispheric asymmetries. In the anterior temporal leads theta ERS revealed a significant valence by hemisphere interaction showing relatively greater right hemisphere theta ERS for Neg and left hemisphere ERS for Pos stimuli in the time window of 100-700 ms poststimulus, whereas in the alpha-3 band Neg stimuli induced lateralized time-dependent left hemisphere ERS increased in the time window of 800-1200 ms. were not observed for Neut and Pos stimuli. The obtained results along with earlier observations on EEG correlates of affective processing challenge the notion that affective anterior hemispheric asymmetries are mainly sensitive to wide alpha frequency band. Frequency and time dependence of anterior hemispheric asymmetries in emotional valence discrimination is emphasized.

The primary purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the startle reflex on the respiratory related P300. A secondary purpose was to assess changes in P300 scalp topography as a function of stimulus familiarity. Young adults (n = 12) were exposed to 200 inspiratory occlusion stimuli, and EEG was recorded from 29 A1/A2 referenced sites. Data from the occlusions were divided into four consecutive blocks of 50 trials to assess blink and P300 habituation effects. Results showed that 40% of the occlusion stimuli elicited a blink response, and that blink amplitude showed significant habituation across the experimental session. Change in P300 amplitude across the experimental session varied according to scalp site. At central and parietal locations, P300 amplitude showed an initial decrease but then remained stable. Frontally, P300 amplitude decreased over each of the four trial blocks. P300 scalp topography showed a classic centro-parietal maximum, however, a more frontally orientated scalp focus was seen for the first trial block. P300 was not significantly different when derived from averages of responses containing and not containing blinks. These data indicate that the previously studied centro-parietal P300 is not related to a startle reflex.

J	Oostenveld, R; Oostendorp, TF				Oostenveld, R; Oostendorp, TF			Validating the boundary element method for forward and inverse EEG computations in the presence of a hole in the skull	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; ERP; inverse modeling; BEM; FDM; skull conductivity	REALISTIC HEAD GEOMETRIES; VOLUME CONDUCTOR MODELS; LOCAL MESH REFINEMENT; DIPOLE LOCALIZATION; POTENTIALS; LOCATION; ACCURACY; MEG	Holes in the skull may have a large influence on the EEG and ERP. Inverse source modeling techniques such as dipole fitting require an accurate volume conductor model. This model should incorporate holes if present, especially when either a neuronal generator or the electrodes are close to the hole, e.g., in case of a trephine hole in the upper part of the skull. The boundary element method (BEM) is at present the preferred method for inverse computations using a realistic head model, because of its efficiency and availability. Using a simulation approach, we have studied the accuracy of the BEM by comparing it to the analytical solution for a volume conductor without a hole, and to the finite difference method (FDM) for one with a hole. Furthermore, we have evaluated the influence of holes on the results of forward and inverse computations using the BEM. Without a hole and compared to the analytical model, a three-sphere BEM model was accurate up to 5-10%, while the corresponding FDM model had an error <0.5%. In the presence of a hole, the difference between the BEM and the FDM was, on average, 4% (1.3-11.4%). The FDM turned out to be very accurate if no hole is present. We believe that the difference between the BEM and the FDM represents the inaccuracy of the BEM. This inaccuracy in the BEM is very small compared to the effect that holes can have on the scalp potential (up to 450%). In regard to the large influence of holes on forward and inverse computations, we conclude that holes in the skull can be treated reliably by means of the BEM and should be incorporated in forward and inverse modeling.

Novel, meaningful behaviors require intact integrative functions such as short-term memory and motor planning, as well as an optimized level of arousal. In this study, we monitored markers of automatic auditory processing in 15 female never-medicated psychotic patients. Fifty-eight channels of EEG were recorded simultaneously with sympathetic skin responses while arousing auditory stimuli were delivered. Neuropsychological tests concentrating on frontal lobe functions were also performed. Prominent neurophysiological and behavioral signs of increased cortical activation were observed in psychotic patients. This widespread disinhibition may attempt to compensate for the impairment of neuronal processing of sensory input from surroundings in the earliest stages of a psychotic illness.

Methods: The authors studied cortical activation in eight elderly (55 to 76 years of age) and eight younger (18 to 27 years of age) healthy subjects while they performed a simple motor task. A 28-channel EEG was recorded; task-related power changes associated with repetitive, metronome-paced (1 Hz) finger movements were computed as a measure of cortical activation. Results: Distinct, age-dependent activation patterns were expressed in four distinct frequency ranges: low-alpha (10 to 11 Hz), high-alpha (12 to 13 Hz), low-beta (16 to 17 Hz), and high-beta (22 to 23 Hz) bands. The main findings were a greater overall activation and, more specifically, a pronounced bilateral activation of sensorimotor regions in elderly subjects for both alpha bands. Additionally, in the elderly subjects there was increased activation of the mesial frontocentral cortex (supplementary motor area region) in the high-beta band, whereas younger volunteers had a prominent activation of the left lateral premotor and sensorimotor region in this frequency range. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the functional anatomy of the human motor system changes during normal aging. It appears that, for a given motor task, the aging brain recruits additional primary sensorimotor and premotor regions of both hemispheres.

We explored SOBI's ability to help isolate underlying neuronal sources with relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios, allowing their identification and localization. We compare localization of the SOBI-separated components to localization from unprocessed sensor signals, using an equivalent current dipole modeling method. For visual and somatosensory modalities, SOBI preprocessing resulted in components that can be localized to physiologically and anatomically meaningful locations. Furthermore, this preprocessing allowed the detection of neuronal source activations that were otherwise undetectable. This increased probability of neuronal source detection and localization can be particularly beneficial for MEG studies of higher-level cognitive functions, which often have greater signal variability and degraded signal-to-noise ratios than sensory activation tasks.

Using linguistic function as an example, we show that (a) injury-related reorganization may also be observed in language-related cortex and (b) this reorganization not only appears in cortical space but also in the dynamic flow of activity. The present study investigated cortical reorganization in a group of 10 nonfluent aphasics who demonstrated partial recovery of linguistic functions. Compared with controls, linguistic functions were organized in an atypical manner. both in terms of spatial structures involved and in the time course of the linguistic processes, from word reading to late stages of word encoding in working memory. For this purpose, event-related potentials were recorded in a two-stimulus design comprising phonological and semantic tasks. Subjects were asked to judge whether two words, separated by a 2-s interval, rhymed (phonological task) or were semantically associated. During word reading of the phonological task, controls showed negativity/activation over occipital sites, whereas patients displayed negativity at left-medial orbitofrontal locations anterior to the common sites of lesion. During the subsequent 2-s interval associated with word encoding, the two groups showed a reversed pattern: significant left-right anterior asymmetry prevailed in controls, whereas lateralization was absent in patients. Aphasics displayed maximum positivity/inhibition over the left frontal regions, at the typical site of lesion. Compared with controls, patients exhibited significant disinhibition (decreased positivity) of right frontal areas and greater activation of left temporal sites. These results suggest that the concept of language plasticity should include, in addition to spatial aspects of linguistic reorganization, the reorganized temporal dynamics associated with recovery of impaired functions.

Since the first descriptions of schizophrenia, attempts to characterize this disorder have focused on disturbances in such integrative processing. Here, we review both micro- and macroscopic neuroscience research into Gamma synchrony, and its application to understanding schizophrenia. The review encompasses evidence from both animal and human studies for the functional significance of Gamma activity, the association between Gamma dysfunction and information processing disturbances, and the relevance of specific Gamma dysfunctions to the integration and extension of previous disconnection models of schizophrenia. Attention is given to the relationship between Gamma activity and the heterogeneous symptoms of schizophrenia. Existing studies show that measures of Gamma activity have the potential to explain far more of the variance in schizophrenia performance than previous neurophysiological measures. It is concluded that measures of Gamma synchrony offer a valuable window into the core integrative disturbance in schizophrenia cognition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Several studies have been performed using wavelets or other signal processing methods to analyze EEG signals in an attempt to find a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, which showed varying degrees of success. To date, in part due to lack of a large study cohort, the results of these studies remain largely inconclusive. In this paper, we describe a new effort using multiresolution wavelet analysis on event related potentials of the EEG to investigate whether such a link can be established. Several factors sets this study apart from similar prior efforts: We use a larger cohort, compare different mother wavelets, rather then using one generic wavelet, and most importantly, we specifically target early diagnosis of the disease. Our multi-year effort will include a total of 80 patients, whose ERPs will be analyzed with several different wavelets and automated classifiers. We present some preliminary, yet very promising, results on analysis of EEGs of the first 28 patients analyzed thus far using two types of wavelets.

Six young volunteers were instructed to extend briskly their dominant wrist as soon as possible after hearing a 2000 Hz sound. Two sequences of stimuli were presented to each subject, the first rhythmic at 1/6 s and the second with random intervals between 5 and 13 s. A time-frequency analysis of nonphase-locked activity in the 7-37 Hz range was performed on stimulus-centred EEG sweeps using wavelet filters and Gabor transforms. During the sequence of predictable rhythmic stimuli, stimulus-induced movements were accompanied by a decrease in beta activity that began contralaterally about 1 s prior to the stimulus and extended to both sides later on. This decrease was followed by a rebound after the end of the movement. In the alpha band, the decrease observed started just after the sound. During the sequence of non-predictable, random stimuli, stimulus-induced movements were accompanied by a shorter and smaller alpha and beta-ERD, that started after the stimulus. The presence of a pre-stimulus beta ERD only in the rhythmic predictable paradigm suggests that central pre-movement beta ERD may be an indicator of motor preparation, and could be used for objective evaluation of time estimation and motor timing. The minimal differences observed in the alpha changes in both paradigms suggest that alpha-ERD may not be linked to motor preparation.

It is supposed that different susceptibility genes produce distinct neurobiological and behavioural phenotypes that may each increase the risk for developing schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to search for genetically and pathophysiologically independent domains of mild cognitive disturbances that might be the components of liability to schizophrenia. One hundred and twenty-seven adult relatives of schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients were tested with a battery of cognitive tasks. Results were subjected to a principal component analysis, and factors obtained were further investigated with behavioural genetic methods in 56 families of schizophrenics. Resting EEGs were recorded from a subsample of 66 relatives. Correlations of the cognitive factors with absolute power values of seven frequency bands at 16 derivations were assessed using regression analysis. The study revealed four components of cognitive deficits in relatives of schizophrenics in domains of verbal short-term memory, thinking, communication and attention/working memory, all with substantive heritability except the last. The four components had a partial overlapping, but still distinct patterns of resting EEG correlates. The findings are in line with the assumption that cognitive deficit in high-risk individuals may be decomposed to relatively independent dimensions, each with its specific genetic and pathophysiological background.

The authors hypothesize that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective mostly in patients with fluctuating cognition. Twenty-three patients affected by mild dementia with similar scores on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale evaluation were classified in a group with fluctuating cognition (n = 11) and a group of nonfluctuators (n = 12). All patients were assigned randomly to the branches of a double-blind crossover study of donepezil (DPZ), a 5 to 10-mg dose, versus vitamin E, a 2000 IU dose, for 30 days. MMSE, ADAS-cog, University of California at Los Angeles Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), quantitative EEG, P3 event-related potentials, choice reaction time variability (CRTV) were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatments. At the end of the crossover study all patients received DPZ for 6 months. The dominant EEG frequency variability, low EEG frequencies amplitude, the P3 latency and jitter, CRTV, and NPI was significantly different in the fluctuating cognition group than the nonfluctuating group at baseline (P < 0.001). Short-term DPZ administration induced a significant increase in MMSE scores, reduction of ADAS-cog and of NPI scores (P < 0.003-0.001), increase of EEG alpha activity and reductions of P3 latency and jitter, dominant frequency variability and CRTV (P < 0.009-0.001) in the fluctuating cognition group, and significant increases of MMSE scores (P = 0.03) and a decrease of P3 jitter and dominant frequency variability (P < 0.034-0.041) in the nonfluctuating group. Short-term DPZ effects differed significantly between fluctuating cognition and nonfluctuating patients (0.001). Significant effects of the 6-month observation were observed only in fluctuating cognition patients. Logistic analysis showed that P3 latency predicts the effect of DPZ (P = 0.04, P < 0.01) in the crossover study, and CRTV predicts the effect at the 6-month follow-up.

J	Filipovic, SR; Jahanshahi, M; Rothwell, JC				Filipovic, SR; Jahanshahi, M; Rothwell, JC			Uncoupling of contingent negative variation and alpha band event-related desynchronization in a go/no-go task	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						go/no-go decision; contingent negative variation; event-related desynchronization; movement suppression; motor control	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELF-PACED MOVEMENT; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; PRIMATE PREMOTOR; EEG ALPHA; CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY; ACTIVATION	Objectives: To examine how the differences in the sequences of brain activation during the go/no-go delayed response choice reaction time (RT) task are reflected into two concurrent methods of measuring brain electrical activity, the alpha band event-related desynchronization (alpha ERD) and the contingent negative variation (CNV). Methods: alpha ERD and CNV were calculated using appropriate techniques from the same samples of electroencephalographic activity recorded during performance of a cued choice go/no-go delayed response RT task (i.e. SI (go/no-go)-S2 paradigm) in 8 healthy subjects. Results: All segments of the CNV traces were different in the go and the no-go conditions. The go CNV traces displayed a typical pattern of slow rising negativity reflecting the build-up of attentional resources necessary for adequate performance of the task. On the other hand, the no-go traces remained close to zero reflecting the 'withdrawal' of further preparation after evaluation of S1. During the same period, both go and no-go ERD traces showed a gradual decrease in alpha band power (desynchronization) that was evident until Shortly before the presentation of S2. It was only in the 500 ms before 52 presentation that there was any indication that the go and no-go ERD traces were different, but this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Our data show that the pattern of the go/no-go difference in alpha ERD traces does not correspond to the pattern that can be seen in the CNV tracts. This suggests that there is no direct coupling of CNV and alpha ERD, most probably because they measure different aspects of cortical electrical activity. In addition, the extent of the no-go alpha ERD reveals that refraining from performance of a pre-programmed movement is by no means a passive/inactive process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Reduced movement-related synchronization of the beta rhythm in Parkinson's disease compared to controls has been put forward as evidence for impaired postmovement cortical deactivation. We assessed the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation and L-dopa on beta rhythm synchronization over the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortex. Ten advanced patients performed self-paced wrist flexion in four conditions according to the presence or not of stimulation and L-dopa. Compared to without treatment, the motor score improved by approximate to 60%; the beta synchronization was present over the contralateral frontocentral region and increased significantly over the contralateral central region under stimulation and under L-dopa, with a maximal effect when both treatments were associated. Our advanced patients displayed very focused and attenuated beta rhythm synchronization which, under stimulation, increased over the contralateral premotor and primary sensorimotor cortex. Stimulation and L-dopa both partly restored postmovement cortical deactivation in advanced Parkinson's disease, although the respective mechanisms probably differ. They may improve bradykinesia and cortical deactivation by reestablishing movement-related somatosensory processing at the end of the movement through the basal ganglia into the cortex.

The main idea is based upon averaging energy distributions of single EEG trials in the time-frequency plane. As the estimator for the signal's energy density, matching pursuit is chosen, with stochastic Gabor dictionaries. Other possible estimates are presented on a simulated signal and discussed briefly. The consistency of the results with previous findings is evaluated on the data from a classical voluntary finger movement experiment.

This paper allows to point out some general experimental conditions relating to the choice of (1) suitable animal species whose use should be advocated, (2) the route by which the effects of the drugs should be studied and (3) the controls of the experimental context (surroundings, temperature, schedules of the trials, interference with food-intake episodes, influence of noises and smells, expertise of the experimental staff) likely to optimize the predictive value of the trials. Besides the core of investigations recommended by most of the regulatory authorities (changes in gross behaviour, motor coordination, locomotor activity, interaction with hypnotics, convulsant potential), the need to include or not some investigations such as EEG studies and the prediction of adverse events, such as anxiolytic and amnesia potentials, is considered. The place, within the scope of CNS Safety Pharmacology, of studies intended to document the potential for drug abuse and dependence is mentioned and some information given about the methods generally used.

We compared the effects of a 3-month electroencephalographic feedback program providing reinforcement contingent on the production of cortical sensorimotor rhythm (12-15 Hz) and beta1 activity (15-18 Hz) with stimulant medication. Participants were N = 34 children aged 8-12 years, 22 of which were assigned to the neurofeedback group and 12 to the methylphenidate group according to their parents' preference. Both neurofeedback and methylphenidate were associated with improvements on all subscales of the Test of Variables of Attention, and on the speed and accuracy measures of the d2 Attention Endurance Test. Furthermore, behaviors related to the disorder were rated as significantly reduced in both groups by both teachers and parents on the IOWA-Conners Behavior Rating Scale. These findings suggest that neurofeedback was efficient in improving some of the behavioral concomitants of ADHD in children whose parents favored a nonpharmacological treatment.

Results revealed that the amplitude of the ERAN, in contrast to the MMN, is specifically dependent on the degree of harmonic appropriateness. Thus, the ERAN is correlated with the cognitive processing of complex rule-based information, i.e. with the application of music-syntactic rules. Moreover, results showed that the ERAN, compared to the abstract-feature MMN, had both a longer latency, and a larger amplitude. The combined findings indicate that ERAN and MMN reflect different mechanisms of pre-attentive irregularity detection, and that, although both components have several features in common, the ERAN does not easily fit into the classical MMN framework. The present ERPs thus provide evidence for a differentiation of cognitive processes underlying the fast and pre-attentive processing of auditory information.

Subjects received electrical stimuli at intensity above pain threshold to their right middle finger while either squeezing a rubber tube with the right index finger and thumb, or keeping their ipsitateral hand muscles relaxed. EEG was recorded using 111 closely spaced electrodes. Somatosensory stimuli were followed by reduction of the relative 8-12 and 16-24 Hz band power (at 0.2-0.4 s) in bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1) and medial frontal cortex, and by a subsequent increase in 16-24 Hz band power (at 0.9 s). Isometric muscle contraction strongly suppressed these band power changes. The 8-12 and 16-24 Hz mean coherence in a wide region surrounding the contralateral S1/M1 and in the media[ frontal cortex showed an initial decrease, partially paralleling band power changes, and later an increase. Ipsitateral S1/M1 showed a decrease in 8-12 Hz coupling only with the central and frontal electrodes of the same hemisphere. Muscle contraction reduced all coherence changes, but enhanced the 8-12 Hz coherence between ipsilateral S1/M1 and posterior parietal cortex. Early post-stimulus decrease of oscillatory coupling between S1/M1 and premotor cortex and between S1/M1 and medial. frontal cortex suggests that these cortical regions act rather independently during processing of somatosensory information, and synchronize only later when the band power in contralateral S1/M1 increases. Motor cortex activation associated with ipsitateral hand muscle contraction interferes with cortical processing of somatosensory stimuli in S1/M1 cortices. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

Superconducting quantum interference devices are used to amplify these very small magnetic field signals. Magnetic source imaging is the combination of functional data derived from magnetoencephalographic recordings coregistered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The utility of magnetic source imaging lies in the combination of the submillisecond temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography with the precise anatomic images provided by magnetic resonance imaging. As such, magnetic source imaging is a useful tool for noninvasive localization of the epileptogenic zone in children who are candidates for epilepsy surgery. Similarly, using magnetoencephalographic recordings with evoked and event-related potentials, magnetic source imaging holds great promise as a noninvasive method for precise localization of somatosensory motor, language, visual, and auditory cortex. Finally, magnetic source imaging is proving a valuable research tool in the investigation of epilepsy, head trauma, brain plasticity, and disorders of language, memory, cognition, and executive function in children.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that VID and VEPs reflect different aspects of cortical activation. For this purpose, we determined whether VID and VEPs are differentially modulated by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the occipital pole. Scalp EEG responses to visual stimuli (flashed either to the left or to the right visual field) were recorded for 8 min in six healthy subjects (1) before, (2) immediately following, and (3) 20 min after left occipital rTMS (1 Hz, 10 min). The parameters aimed to reduce cortical excitability beyond the end of the TMS train. In addition, simple reaction times to visual stimulation were recorded (left or right hand in separate blocks). In all subjects, VID was significantly and prominently reduced by rTMS (P = 0.0001). In contrast, rTMS failed to modulate early VEP components (P1/N1). A moderate effect was found on a late VEP component close to manual response onset (P = 0.014) but this effect was in the opposite direction to the VID change. All changes were restricted to the targeted left occipital cortex. The effects were present only after right visual field stimulation when a right hand response was required, were associated with a behavioral effect, and had washed out 20 min after rTMS. We conclude that VID and early VEPs represent different aspects of cortical activation. The findings that rTMS did not change early VEPs and selectively affected VID and late VEPs in conditions where the visual input must be transferred intrahemispherically for visuornotor integration (right visual field/right hand) are suggestive of rTMS interference with higher-order visual functions beyond visual input. This is consistent with the idea that alpha desynchronization serves an integrative role through a corticocortical "gating function." (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

J	Standish, LJ; Kozak, L; Johnson, LC; Richards, T				Standish, LJ; Kozak, L; Johnson, LC; Richards, T			Electroencephalographic evidence of correlated event-related signals between the brains of spatially and sensory isolated human subjects	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article								Objective: To determine whether correlated event-related potentials (ERPs) can be detected between the brains of spatially and sensory isolated human subjects. Design and setting: Simultaneous digitized electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from the occipital area in pairs of human subjects placed in sound attenuated rooms separated by 10 meters. One person relaxed in one of the rooms while the other received visual stimulation while in the other room. Prior to each experiment, members of the pair were randomly designated as sender and receiver. Sessions were subsequently repeated with subjects reversing their roles. Previous to each session, the sender was instructed "to attempt sending an image/thought." The receiver was instructed "to remain open to receive any image/thought from his/her partner." Alternating stimulus-on/stimulus-off conditions were presented throughout the session to the sender, while a stimulus-off condition was presented to the receiver. Subjects: Thirty-seven (37) female, and 23 male subjects (n = 60; 30 pairs) participated in the study. Subjects knew each other well and claimed to have previous experience of being emotionally/psychologically connected to one another. Outcome measures: A Runs test was applied to compare EEG "hits" in the receiver's EEG during the sender' stimulus-on condition versus sender's stimulus-off conditions. Test results at P < 0.01 were considered evidence of correlated brain signals. Pairs in whom at least one member had significant results were invited back for replication. Results: Of the 60 subjects tested, 5 (4 women/1 man) showed significantly higher brain activation (p < 0.01) during their sending partner's stimulus-on condition as compared to stimulus-off condition. Using the Stouffer z meta-analytic method all receiver EEG results across all 60 subjects were combined by transforming the individual session p values into z scores. Data analyses showed overall significant results for EEG data recorded during the flickering condition (z = -3.28, p = 0.0005) as well as nonsignificant results for data recorded during the static condition (z = 0.35, p = 0.64). Four pairs participated in a replication experiment during which one pair replicated the effect. Conclusions: These results indicate that in some pairs of human subjects a signal may be detected in the brain of a distant member of the pair when the brain of the other member is visually stimulated. These data support the findings of similar studies performed in seven laboratories reported in the peer-reviewed literature since 1963. Research in this area should now proceed with investigation of its physical and biologic mechanism, its generalizability to varying populations and relationships, and its clinical application.

Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded From 64 electrodes during a simple reaction time (RT) task. VEPs to single stimuli displayed in different quadrants were summed ('sum') and compared to the VEP response from simultaneous stimulation of the same two quadrants ('pair'). These responses would be equivalent if the neural responses to the single stimuli were independent. Divergence between the 'pair' and 'sum' VEPs indicates a neural response interaction. In each visual field. interactions occurred within 72-86 ms post-stimulus over parieto-occipital brain regions. Independent of visual quadrant, RTs were faster for stimulus pairs than single stimuli. This replicates the redundant target effect (RTE) observed for bilateral stimulus pairs and generalizes the RTE to unilateral stimulus pairs. Using Miller's 'race model inequality (Miller J. Divided attention: evidence for coactivation with redundant signals, Cognitive Psychology 1982:14:247-79), we found that probability summation could fully account for the RTE in each visual field. Although measurements from voltage waveforms replicated the observation of earlier peak P1 latencies for the 'pair' versus 'sum comparison (Miniussi C, Girelli M, Marzi CA. Neural site of the redundant target effect: electrophysiological evidence. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 1998,10:216-30), this did not hold with measurements taken from second derivative (scalp current density) waveforms. Since interaction effects for bilateral stimulus pairs occurred within 86 ms and require interhemispheric transfer. transcallosal volleys must arrive within 86 ms, which is earlier than previously calculated. Interaction effects for bilateral conditions were delayed by approximate to 10 ms versus unilateral conditions. consistent with current estimates of interhemispheric transmission time. Interaction effects place an upper limit on the lime required for neuronal ensembles to combine inputs from different quadrants of visual space ( approximate to 72 ms for unilateral and approximate to 82 ms for bilateral conditions).

J	Jongsma, MLA; Coenen, AML; Van Rijn, CM				Jongsma, MLA; Coenen, AML; Van Rijn, CM			Omission evoked potentials (OEPs) in rats and the effects of diazepam	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						evoked potentials; omitted stimuli; diazepam; information processing; expectancy; time estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY INFORMATION; MEMORY; P300; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INTEGRATION; BEHAVIOR; ABSENCE; EEG	We investigated whether evoked potentials to omitted stimuli could be measured in rats. Such an animal model would provide a measure of aspects of information processing concerned with expectancy and time estimation. In a first experiment, omission evoked potentials (OEPs) were elicited in rats by omitting stimuli (10%) from a train of tone pips with a fixed ISI (3 s). A control session consisted of omitting stimuli (10%) from a train of tone pips with a variable ISI (2.5-3.5 s). In a second experiment, OEPs were measured in rats that received 4 mg (.) kg(-1) diazepam or vehicle sc. In the first experiment, half of the animals showed OEPs that consisted of a late-latency positive wave, the other rats showed a slow negative drift. No OEPs were found in the control session. Rats showing OEPs consisting of a positive wave in Experiment 1 were passed to Experiment 2. In the vehicle condition of the second experiment, all rats showed OEPs. In the diazepam condition no OEPs were found. We found that OEPs can be measured in rats. In addition, OEPs are disrupted by diazepam. We propose that OEPs provide an elegant toot to elicit selectively endogenous EP components.

J	Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ				Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ			EOG correction: comparing different calibration methods, and determining the number of epochs required in a calibration average	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; EOG; correction; regression; aligned-artifact average; NERP	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG	Objective: A form of EOG correction called the 'aligned-artifact average' (AAA) method has been advanced by the authors. In contrast to many previous methods, this used a correction coefficient (B), based on an average of eye movements rather than raw data, to remove eye movement related contamination from the EEG. The first part of this study was aimed at determining whether a variation of this procedure that is more easily implemented would produce a similar correction. The second pan was designed to determine the number of epochs needed in an average to correct adequately. Methods: Subjects performed a series of eye movement tasks whilst EEG and EOG data were recorded. Data were manipulated according to either the AAA or an alternate new ERP method (NERP) and the resultant Bs were compared in part A. In part B, averages were created from varying numbers of epochs, and the resultant r(2)-values were compared. Results: The AAA and NERP methods produced the same Ss, and averages with at least 40 epochs were required for adequate B estimation for both VEOG and HEOG. Conclusion: There is no difference between the AAA and NERP methods and thus it is acceptable to use the more easily implemented NERP method for EOG correction. Lt is recommended that when applying this procedure, at least 40 epr,chs should be used to make up the averages from which to calculate correction coefficients. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were recorded in 9 normal volunteers during tonic contraction of upper and lower limb muscles on the right side. Coherence between EEG and EMG was computed to analyze their linear association. Results: EEG over the contralateral sensorimotor area was coherent with EMG, with peak coherence at 11-36 Hz (mean, 22 Hz). For the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle, peak coherence, as determined by functional brain mapping with Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), was over or slightly posterior to the hand area on the primary motor cortex determined by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Peak coherence over the scalp was somatotopically organized. The temporal relation between EEC and EMG was analyzed with a new model for interpreting the phase shift ('constant phase shift plus constant time lag' model). For the APE muscle, the phase relation between cortical and muscular oscillations differed in the frequency ranges of 3-13 Hz and 14-50 Hz, respectively, suggesting that different coupling mechanisms operate in different bands. Only the phase shift between cortical and motoneuronal firing at 14-50 Hz was reliably estimated by a linear model. At 14-50 Hz, motoneuronal firing was led by surface-negative cortical activity with a constant time lag that depended on the cortical-muscular distance. For the APE muscle, the time lag was slightly shorter than the cortical-muscular conduction time determined by TMS. Vibratory stimulation (100 Hz) of a muscle tendon during tonic contraction had no significant effect on cortical-muscular coherence. indicating that cortical oscillation reflected motor rather than sensory activity. Conclusions: The present findings suggest temporal coding of the oscillatory motor control system (3-13 Hz vs. 14-50 Hz), and confirm the functional importance of cortical beta and gamma rhythms in the motor efferent command. Cortical-muscular synchronization is most likely mediated by the direct corticospinal pathway within the frequency range of 14-50 Hz. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, this pattern reverses when the upper hemifield is stimulated, suggesting a neural source in VI for this endogenous potential (rivalry-related potential, RRP). Here we investigated the functional significance of the RRP using an interocular suppression procedure. We replicated the RRP polarity reversal for upper versus lower hemifield stimulation and showed that the RRP reflects differences in processing during dominance and suppression and not shifts in dominance.

Odor-air and air-only stimuli were used to determine whether the SSVEP would be altered when odor was present. Comparisons were also made of the topographic activation associated with air and odor stimulation, with the view toward determining whether the revealed topographic activity would differentiate levels of olfactory sensitivity by clearly identifying supra- and subthreshold odor responses. Using a continuous respiration olfactometer (CRO) to precisely deliver and odor or air stimulus synchronously with the natural respiration, air or odor (n-butanol) was randomly delivered into the inspiratory airstream during the simultaneous recording of SSVEPs and subjective behavioral responses. Subjects were placed in groups based on subjective odor detection response: "yes" and "no" detection groups. In comparison to air, SSVEP topography revealed cortical changes in response to odor stimulation for both response groups, with topographic changes evident for those unable to perceive the odor, showing the presence of a subconcious physiological odor detection response. Differences in regional SSVEP topography were shown for those who reported smelling the odor compared with those who remained unaware of the odor. These changes revealed olfactory modulation of SSVEP topography related to odor awareness and sensitivity and therefore odor concentration relative to thresholds.

A large vibration pattern or a small one was delivered at a ratio of 8.5:1.5 to the left or the right index finger. Subjects were asked to push a foot switch when small-size pattern was presented at an attended side. EEG was recorded from 18 locations and SERPs due to large-size pattern to the left index finger were obtained. Regardless whether the left index finger was the attended side or the non-attended one, N80, N140 and P300 were observed in both subject groups. SERP within 200-230 ms under left-attended condition shifted toward negativity than those under right-attended one (p < 0.05) in both subject groups. As a difficult task was used in this study, this negative shift might be processing negativity (PN) with the prolonged latency at the central area. PN was also observed in the blind, but at the parietal area. PN in the blind might infer an involvement of posterior cerebral structure to execute selective attention. Under left-attended condition, sustained positivity after P300 remained until 580 ms in both subject groups. However, sustained positivity was not observed under right-attended condition in the sighted. As the subjects ignored stimulus to the left index finger under right-attended condition, sustained positivity might be concerned with slow wave (SW).

In this study, we demonstrate that a comparable gamma-to-beta transition is seen in the human electroencephalogram (EEC) in response to novel auditory stimuli. Correlations between gamma and beta 1 activity revealed a high degree of interdependence of synchronized oscillations in these bands in the human EEC, Evoked (stimulus-locked) gamma oscillations preceded beta 1 oscillations in response to novel stimuli, suggesting that this may be analogous to the gamma-to-beta shift observed in vitro. Beta 1 oscillations were the earliest discriminatory responses to show enhancement to novel stimuli, preceding changes in the broad-band event-related potential (mismatch negativity). Later peaks of induced beta activity over the parietal cortex were always accompanied by an underlying gamma frequency oscillation as seen in vitro. A further analogy between in vitro and human recordings was that both gamma and beta oscillations habituated markedly after the initial novel stimulus presentation.

Schizophrenia group illnesses are also associated with deficits in working memory and perception. We examined the manifestations of a very early phase of psychotic illness to automatic auditory deviance detection to clarify the basic mechanisms underlying misinterpretations of perception. Methods: Twenty-five never-medicated patients admitted for hospital evaluation of acute psychosis were studied. Fifty-eight EEG channels were recorded during an auditory oddball paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to non-attended deviant auditory stimuli were studied in patients and compared with healthy controls. Auditory processing was examined both at the level of the measured biosianals (standard and deviant responses) and with subtraction waveforms. Topographical differences were characterized using global field power (GFP) and minimum norm estimates. Results: The maximum GFP amplitudes and mean amplitudes of the 58 channels within the time windows corresponding to the previously known 'N2b', 'P3a' and 'P3b' components were clearly reduced in patients when compared to healthy controls. However, the groups did not differ during attention-independent automatic processing corresponding to the 'N1' and 'MMN' components, or with respect to the peak latencies of the GFP maxima. Conclusions: Impairment of the processing of a deviance in simple auditory input in acutely ill drug-naive first-episode psychotic patients only appears in attention-dependent processing after about 250 ms. The alterations in auditory processing differed between stimulus types, suggesting at least two mechanisms underlying the auditory discrimination impairments in acute psychosis. After 250 ms there was a linear and gradually increasing difference in magnitude between the groups in their responses to deviant stimuli, probably related to arousal. In addition. however, there was a striking difference between the groups in the processing of standard stimuli. The early processing was similar in patients and controls. but the striking difference appeared in later processing. The sensory memory deficits associated with psychosis may be explained by an abnormality in sensory model formation rather than by impaired deviant detection. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Generation of the Ne/ERN has been associated with structures in the prefrontal cortex, especially the anterior cingulate region, but also the supplementary motor cortex and subcortical structures. There is some controversy as to whether the Ne/ERN is a necessary concomitant to error detection. We examined the Ne/ERN in five patients with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate region. Our findings support the implication of the rostral anterior cingulate in Ne/ERN production, but they also show that subjects can be aware of errors and yet not produce an Ne/ERN. Thus, error detection leads to the Ne/ERN process and damage to the anterior cingulate region may interrupt this relay, suggesting that error detection may be supported by circuits outside the anterior cingulate region.

A left button was pressed for Left Arrow (LA) stimuli, a right for Right Arrow (RA) stimuli, none (no-go) for a non-directional arrow. Stimulus specific visual evoked potentials were formed and, with PZ as index electrode, were lag-correlated to frontal electrodes to form Event-Related Correlations (ERC). Exploratory t-statistic significance probability maps (t-SPM) were used to define regions of interest (ROI). Behaviorally, there was a right-hand advantage over the left in the NLI group, but less in the LI group. Electrophysiologically,,, RA and LA conditions increased correlation between visual areas (PZ) and contralateral frontal areas (F3 and F4). A unilateral ROI, at electrode FC1, also preceded both left- and right-handed responses. Neurobehaviorally, increased visual-motor correlation was associated with better performance, especially for the left hemisphere, at F3 and FC1. Surprisingly, visual-motor correlations were not associated with performance for the NLI group in the RA and no-go condition. Our data support previously reported difficulties of learning impaired children in low-level information processing. Furthermore, we hypothesize that LI, in contrast to NLI children, demonstrate difficulty in automatizing routine tasks.

Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have focused on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) dysfunction as a possible mediator. However, recent basic research has suggested that the effect of attention is also observed as a relative amplification of activity in modality-associated cortical areas. In the present study, the question was addressed whether an amplification deficit is seen in the auditory cortex of schizophrenic patients during an attention-requiring choice reaction task. Twenty-one drug-free schizophrenic patients and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied (32-channel EEG). The underlying generators of the event-related N1 component were separated in neuroanatomic space using a minimum-norm (LORETA) and a multiple dipole (BESA) approach. Both methods revealed activation in the primary auditory cortex (peak latency approximate to 100 ms) and in the area of the ACC (peak latency approximate to 130 ms). In addition, the adapted multiple dipole model also showed a temporal-radial source activation in nonprimary auditory areas (peak latency approximate to 140 ms). In schizophrenic patients, significant activation deficits were found in the ACC as well as in the left nonprimary auditory areas that differentially correlated with negative and positive symptoms. The results suggest that (1) the source in the nonprimary auditory cortex is detected only with a multiple dipole approach and (2) that the N1 generators in the ACC and in the nonprimary auditory cortex are dysfunctional in schizophrenia. This would be in line with the notion that attention deficits in schizophrenia involve an extended cortical network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

It has been suggested that there are at least three different codes for representing number: a verbal code that is used to manipulate number words and perform mental numerical operations (e.g., multiplication), a visual code that is used to decode frequently used visual number forms (e.g., Arabic digits), and an abstract analog code that may be used to represent numerical quantities [1]. Furthermore, each of these codes is associated with a different neural substrate [1-3]. We extend these studies using dense-sensor event-related EEG recording techniques to investigate the temporal pattern of notation-specific effects observed in a parity judgement (odd versus even) task in which single numbers were presented in one of four different numerical notations. Contrasts between different notations demonstrated clear modulations in the visual evoked potentials (VEP) recorded. We observed increased amplitudes for the P1 and N1 components of the VEP that were specific to Arabic numerals and to dot configurations but differed for random and recognizable (die-face) dot configurations. These results demonstrate clear, notation-specific differences in the time course of numerical information processing and provide electrophysiological support for the triple-code model of numerical representation.

It is uncertain whether interictal spiking in partial epilepsies is causally related with the onset of an ictal discharge. To analyze the reciprocal correlation between interictal and ictal epileptiform events, we performed extracellular recordings in the limbic system of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation. Arterial perfusion of bicuculline (50muM) in vitro consistently induced a focal ictal discharge in the hippocampal-entorhinal region that in one third of the experiments was associated with periodic interictal spikes in the piriform cortex. In the absence of active interictal spiking, the piriform cortex was secondarily invaded by the ictal discharge initiated in the hippocampal-entorhinal region, whereas no secondary ictal entrainment was observed in the presence of periodic piriform cortex spikes at circa 0.1 to 0.2Hz. Similarly, ictal events never occurred when arterial perfusion of bicuculline was preceded by a local injection of the same drug in the piriform cortex, a procedure that induces a sustained interictal spiking. A reduced responsiveness to incoming paroxysmal discharges generated in the hippocampus was observed during the interval between two interictal spikes in the piriform cortex.

Methods: Current sources were calculated on N400 component data from a previous study on lexical decision tasks [Clin Neurophysiol 1999; 110:813] using the variable resolution electromagnetic tomography method (VARETA). In this study, two experiments were carried out, one using directly related pairs and the other one using mediated related pairs. Each experiment consisted of 3 tasks that required different levels of contribution from controlled processes. Results: Average source localization images showed the brain structures involved in lexical decision tasks. The automatic component of the N400 effect was related to activation of occipitotemporal and parahippocampal gyri and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. The expectancy strategy was related to activation of the right posterior temporal and right frontal areas. The postlexical strategy was associated with activation of right frontal, anterior cingulate and bilateral superior parietal areas. Conclusions: The findings indicated that the current sources of the N400 varied according to the relative contributions of automatic and controlled mechanisms. Moreover, the sources of the N400 effect depended on the type of strategy used. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

P300 generators, produced by a rare target tone of 1500 Hz (15%) under a frequent nontarget tone of 1000 Hz (85%), were measured in 20 right-handed schizophrenics and 21 controls. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), using a realistic head model of the boundary element method based on individual MRI, was applied to the 128-channel EEG. Three-dimensional current density images were reconstructed from the LORETA intensity maps that covered the whole cortical gray matter. Spatial normalization and intensity normalization of the smoothed current density images were used to reduce anatomical variance and subject-specific global activity and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied for the statistical analysis. We found that the sources of P300 were consistently localized at the left superior parietal area in normal subjects, while those of schizophrenics were diversely distributed. Upon statistical comparison, schizophrenics, with globally reduced current densities, showed a significant P300 current density reduction in the left medial temporal area and in the left inferior parietal area, while both left prefrontal and right orbitofrontal areas were relatively activated. The left parietotemporal area was found to correlate negatively with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores of schizophrenic patients. In conclusion, the reduced and increased areas of current density in schizophrenic patients suggest that the medial temporal and frontal areas contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the frontotemporal circuitry abnormality.

We examined the role of prefrontal cortex in the processing of stimulus repetition and change in a 6-year-old child undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy. EEG was recorded from three bilateral sub-dural electrode strips located over lateral prefrontal areas during unattended auditory stimulation. EEG epochs were averaged to obtain event-related potentials (ERPs) to repeating (standard) tones and to infrequent (deviant) shorter duration tones and complex sounds (telephone buzz). In another condition, ERPs were recorded to standard and deviant syllables, /ba/ and /da/, respectively. ERPs to vibration stimuli delivered to the fingertips were not observed at any of the sub-dural electrodes, confirming modality specificity of the auditory responses. Focal auditory ERPs consisting of P100 and N150 deflections were recorded to both tones and phonemes over the right lateral prefrontal cortex. These responses were insensitive to the serial position of the repeating sound in the stimulus train. Deviant tones evoked an MMN peaking at around 128 ms. Deviant complex sounds evoked ERPs with a similar onset latency and morphology bur with an approximately two-fold increase in peak-to-peak amplitude. We conclude that right lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 45) is involved in early stages of processing repeating sounds and sound changes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To observe the muscarinic modulation of memory and cortical auditory processing, nine cognitively intact elderly subjects (59-80 years) were studied using neuropsychological tests and 122-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) after an administration of scopolamine hydrobromide (0.3 mg, iv) or glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg, iv), a peripheral muscarinic antagonist. A double-blind randomized crossover design was used in two sessions separated by at least 1 week. Scopolamine, but not glycopyrrolate, produced a transient impairment of verbal memory performance in the elderly subjects. MEG indicated that tire auditory-evoked 40-Hz magnetic response was significantly larger after scopolamine than after glycopyrrolate administration. Furthermore, reanalysis of our earlier results in younger subjects (20-31 years), basically supporting the present MEG findings, tentatively suggests that the scopolamine effects on the 40-Hz response may be slightly pronounced with aging. In sum, the transient magnetic 40-Hz auditory response may be useful in studies on brain cholinergic deficits in elderly subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.

Design: Electrophysiological and clinical assessment of patients on admission and discharge from hospital. Assessment of control subjects on 2 sessions. Setting: Inpatient treatment in a psychiatric university hospital. Subjects: 20 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control subjects of similar age and sex. Selection of patients with first- to third-episode schizophrenia. Outcome measures: Early and late component MMN amplitudes and latencies, P3a amplitudes and latencies, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (EPS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and chlorpromazine equivalents. Results: In patients with schizophrenia, novelty-elicited MMN was unimpaired on admission, and there was a statistically significant reduction of the late MMN component with treatment. Improvements in symptom expression were associated with increased latencies of the early MMN component. Conclusion: Results indicate differences in information processing between conventional and novelty-elicited MMN. Some components of the novelty-elicited MMN might be more state dependent than those of the conventional MMN.

We studied how affective meaning of words is reflected in brain electric activity in German and Chinese subjects (a total of 52 German and 55 Chinese adults were investigated). Two experiments were performed on both subjects groups: (1) a list of words was rated on 12 adjective scales. All words had a comparable number of letters and frequency of occurrence in the Chinese or German language. Factor analysis followed by varimax rotation yielded three semantic dimensions. The correlation between languages ranged from 0.83 to 0.92. For each dimension, words were selected which scored highly positive or highly negative on one of the three dimensions, and had small scores on the others. This resulted in six semantically "clear" word classes. (2) Electrophysiological experiments were performed with 22 German and 23 Chinese healthy, right-handed adults. Stimuli were presented sequentially on a computer monitor in random order, and EEG was recorded from 29 channels. Evoked potentials were computed off-line for each semantic class. Significant differences in scalp topography between semantic word classes were not restricted to late "cognitive" components, but brain activity at latencies as early as 80 ms after stimulus onset was affected by semantic meaning of the stimuli in both groups. Comparison of the potential fields and spatial principal components analysis revealed very similar topographical components in German and Chinese subjects. These results show that early language-related neural activation occurs in subjects of different language and culture. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The authors present a wavelet decomposition algorithm suitable for identification and detection of very weak VEPs. The cross-correlation analysis between Daubechies wavelet (i.e. dbN) functions psi(N)(t), for N = 4, 5,..., 10 and a representative noiseless VEP signal is performed to choose the proper wavelet function, say that with maximum correlation coefficient (highest resemblance) with respect to the representative VEP signal sequence. In this way, the specific choice of the best wavelet prototype function is no longer arbitrary for the application of obtaining pattern reversal VEPs. Extensive clinical experiments have demonstrated that the multiresolution wavelet analysis method can identify and estimate the peak latency of VEP signal well, with only a much reduced trial of ensemble averaging (EA) required. The major advantages of the wavelet transform are that it can 'zoom-in' to time discontinuities, and that orthonormal bases, localised in time and frequency, can be constructed. With this zoom-in property of the wavelet analysis, the irregularities or abnormalities of signals can easily be detected. Also the characteristics of EP signals can be captured by means of wavelet analysis, which can be further used for the detection and recognition of the abnormalities in the brain.

This suggests that between-subject differences in general cognitive ability might be related to observable differences in the activity of brain systems that support working memory and attention control. To test this notion, electroencephalograms were recorded from 80 healthy young adults during spatial working memory tasks. Measures of task-related neurophysiological and behavioral variables were derived from these data and compared to scores on a test battery commonly used to assess general cognitive ability (the WAIS-R). Subjects who scored high on the psychometric test also tended to respond faster in the experimental tasks without any loss of accuracy. The amplitude of the late positive component of the event-related potential was larger in high-ability subjects, and the frontal midline theta component of the EEG signal was also selectively enhanced in this group under conditions of sustained performance and high working memory load. These results suggest that subjects who scored high on the WAIS-R were better able to focus and sustain attention to task performance. Changes in the EEG alpha rhythm in response to manipulations of task practice and load were also examined and compared between frontal and parietal regions. The results indicated that high-ability subjects developed strategies that made relatively greater use of parietal regions, whereas low-ability subjects relied more exclusively on frontal regions. Other analyses indicated that hemispheric asymmetries in alpha band measures distinguish between individuals with relatively high verbal aptitude and those with relatively high nonverbal aptitude. In particular, subjects with a verbal cognitive style tended to make greater use of the left parietal region during task performance, and subjects with a nonverbal style tended to make greater use of the right parietal region. These results help clarify relationships between task related brain activity and individual differences in cognitive ability and style.

EFRP is a kind of ERP measurable at the eye movement situation. Variations of EFRP were examined during a proof reading task for a long time. Two paragraphs of sentences were presented on the left and the right sides of a CRT. The paragraph on one side had some irrelevant words. Ten subjects were asked to detect the irrelevant words. The task started at 09.20 h and finished at 16.00 h and consisted of five blocks. The duration of each block was I-h task and 10-min rest including a lunch (70 min). EEG and EOG were recorded during the task. EEGs were averaged at termination of saccades to obtain EFRP. EFRP showed little changes during the morning blocks. However, the mean amplitude between 100 and 200 ms of the positive component in the last two blocks decreased significantly compared with other blocks. The error rate, the performance and the score of fatigue increased at the end of the task. EFRP would reflect decline of mental concentration (i.e. carelessness) caused by visual fatigue.

The two cognitive components of form discrimination and spatial location were interwoven in the task; however, the fMRI data demonstrated that such a task still activated both ventral GTi/GF (the inferior temporal gyrus/the fusiform gyrus) and dorsal Ga/PCu (the angular gyrus/Precuneus), which are supposed to mediate form discrimination and spatial location, respectively. In addition, the source waveforms of the fMRI foci based on the source analysis of the fMRI-seeded dipole modeling and the moving dipole modeling indicated that in responding to the task combining simultaneously form perception and spatial location, the activity in Ga/PCu begins earlier than that in GTi/GF, but it peaks later and lasts longer.

Emphasis is placed oil the electrophysiological and neuroanatomical basis of the method, on the localization properties of the method, and oil the validation of the method in real experimental human data. Papers that criticize LORETA are briefly discussed. LORETA publications in the 1994-1997 period based localization inference on images of raw electric neuronal activity. In 1998, a series of papers appeared that based localization inference on the statistical parametric mapping methodology applied to high-time resolution LORETA images. Starting in 1999, quantitative neuroanotomy was added to the methodology based oil the digitized Talairach atlas provided by the Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute. The combination of these methodological developments has placed LORETA at a level that compares favorably to the more classical functional imaging methods, such as PET and fMRI.

Theoretically, the same basic neural circuitry supports refixation and correct anti-saccade performances, with additional activity in primarily dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry supporting antisaccade-associated inhibitory processes. Analyses demonstrated that sensory registration of visual stimuli is similar for refixation and anti-saccade conditions. Increased frontal brain activity at 5 and 15Hz was observed preceding correct antisaccades when compared to refixation saccades. These analyses provide specific information suggesting that 160-60ms before saccade generation is the critical period for response inhibition.

Discussion of an unclear case	NERVENARZT			German	Article						Gulf War syndrome; neurological dysfunction; PET; amnesia	PYRIDOSTIGMINE BROMIDE; VETERANS; EXPOSURE; DEET	The Gulf War syndrome represents neurological and neuropsychological disorders in veterans of the Persian Gulf war. Until today, the various symptoms observed could not be attributed to any defined disease. As a possible cause, exposure to neurotoxic agents such as the organophosphates used during the war has been suggested by many authors. We report on a 29-year-old man who suffered from dysmnesia, disturbance of orientation, cognitive impairment,and double vision. His history revealed several front-line operations in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War. Physical examinations showed a complex eye-movement disturbance and a horizontal nystagmus, which was neuro-ophthalmologically confirmed. The early auditory potentials referred to a brainstem dysfunction and the cognitive disturbances correlated to changes in the late-appearing component of event-related potentials (P 300). Brain imaging with CCT, MRI, SPECT, PET, and EEG and CSF showed no pathologies. Neuropsychological tests disclosed severe cognitive impairment especially concerning memory. Three-month follow-up studies in a department of psychosomatic medicine excluded a dissociative disorder as a feature of a post-traumatic stress or a conversion disorder. This is the first case of Gulf War syndrome in Germany. We focus on an unfamiliar complication after the war. The recent literature is reviewed.

However, to date, most of the methods proposed in the literature seeking fMRI signs have been limited to the use of atop-down data analysis approach, thus ignoring a pool of physiological facts. In spite of the important contributions achieved by applying these methods to actual data, there is a disproportionate gap between theoretical models and data-analysis strategies while trying to focus on several new prospects, like for example fMRI/EEG data fusion, causality/connectivity patterns, and nonlinear BOLD signal dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new approach which will allow many of the abovementioned hot topics to be addressed in the near future with an underlying interpretability based on bottom-up modeling. In particular, the theta-MAP presented in the paper to test brain activation corresponds very well with the standardized t test of the SPM99 toolbox. Additionally, a new Impulse Response Function (IRF) has been formulated, directly related to the well-established concept of the hemodynamics response function (HRF). The model uses not only the information contained in the signal but also that in the structure of the background noise to simultaneously estimate the IRF and the autocorrelation function (ACF) by using an autoregressive (AR) model with a filtered Poisson process driving the dynamics. The short-range contributions of voxels within the near-neighborhood are also included, and the potential drift was characterized by a polynomial series. Since our model originated from an immediate extension of the hemodynamics approach [Friston, K.J., Mechelli, A., Turner, R., Price C.J. (2000a). Nonlinear responses in fMRI: the balloon model, volterra kernels, and other hemodynamics. Neurolmage 12, 466-477.], a natural interpretability of the results is feasible. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The key dependent variable of interest was intraindividual rate of accuracy in discrimination of oddball vs. frequent evoked P300 responses, in various paradigms. In Experiment 1 (a lab deception paradigm), we found that the combination of the 0.3 Hz filter setting and the peak-peak measurement of P300 correctly diagnosed oddball vs, frequent in 26 of 26 (100%) cases. This parameter combination outperformed all others. In a second, more field-like experiment tin that the participant knew that the experimenter was blind to ground truth), the peak-peak index again outperformed the base-peak index. It was also observed that the pre-stimulus EEG baseline variability exceeded that of the negative peak (NEG) following P300, i.e. the peak to which the peak-peak index refers P300 for computation. We also observed that the base-peak measurement of P300 is uncorrelated with NEG, and that NEG, seen only in 0.3 Hz channels, correlates highly (- 0.67) with the duration of recovery of P300 to the pre-stimulus baseline EEG level as seen in the 0.01-Hz channel. However, in a final experiment using two simple visual and auditory oddball tasks, the base-peak measurement was as diagnostic as the peak-peak measurement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

There are two principal steps in our analysis of multichannel electromagnetic recordings: (i) the determination of functionally relevant time periods in the ongoing electric activity and (ii) the localization of the sources in the brain that generate these activities recorded on the scalp. We propose a temporal segmentation of the time-varying activity, which is based on determination of changes in the topography of the electric fields, as an approach to the first step, and a distributed linear inverse solution based on realistic head models as an approach to the second step. Data from studies of visual motion perception, visuo-motor transfer, mental imagery, semantic decision, and cognitive interference illustrate that this analysis allows us to define the patterns of electric activity that are present at given time periods after stimulus presentation, as well as those time periods where significantly different patterns appear between different stimuli and tasks. The presented data show rapid and parallel activation of different areas within complex neuronal networks, including early activity of brain regions remote from the primary sensory areas. In addition, the data indicate information exchange between homologous areas of the two hemispheres in cases where unilateral stimulus presentation requires interhemispheric transfer.

Dispersion relations and derivations of power spectral response for the models, show that a low frequency resonant mode and associated travelling wave solutions of the models' equations of state can account for the predominant 1/f spectral content of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Large scale activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, is accounted for by thalamocortical interaction, under regulation by diffuse cortical excitation. System impulse responses can be used to model Event-Related Potentials. Further classes of local resonance may be generated by rapid negative feedbacks at active synapses. Activity in the gamma band around 40 Hz, associated with large amplitude oscillations of pulse density, appears at higher levels of cortical activation, and is unstable unless compensated by synaptic feedbacks. Control of cortical stability by synaptic feedbacks offers a partial account of the regulation of autonomous activity within the cortex. Synchronous oscillation occurs between concurrently excited cortical sites, and can be explained by analysis of wave motion radiating from each of the co-active sites. These models are suitable for the introduction of learning rules-most notably the coherent infomax rule. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A single large pedigree has been described in which schizophrenia and depression segregate with a balanced chromosomal translocation involving the long arm of chromosome 1 and the short arm of chromosome 11. The gene named DISC1, disrupted at the chromosome I breakpoint, is a novel candidate gene that may have a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The cellular location and function of the protein coded by DISCI is currently being investigated. The phenotype associated with DISCI in the t (1;11) translocation family includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, recurrent major depression and bipolar disorder. Hence this locus is one of several now reported apparently showing linkage to both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The study of intermediate phenotypes or "endophenotypes" may clarify the relations between phenotype and genotype. Auditory event related potentials are EEG based physiological measures widely studied in schizophrenia. In particular the cognitive evoked potential, the P300 response generated during an "oddball" two-tone discrimination task consistently shows reduced amplitude in schizophrenia compared to controls. In members of the family with the t (1;11) translocation, P300 amplitude was reduced in relatives who carried the translocation compared to relatives with a normal karyotype. Furthermore the amplitude reduction was independent of the presence or absence of symptoms because asymptomatic translocation carriers showed similar P300 amplitude reduction as was found in translocation carriers who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression. The results confirm that subjects with schizophrenia who carry the t (1;11) translocation have similar phenotype to unrelated subjects; with schizophrenia and a normal karyotype. Furthermore P300 amplitude may be a useful intermediate phenotype detecting the neuropathology of schizophrenia in "at risk" individuals even in the absence of clinical symptoms.

It is known that induced and evoked activities reflect different aspects of cortical processing which may result in different time courses. In the current study, we analyzed topography of postimperative negative variation (PINV) in 39 healthy right-handed adolescents in an acoustic forewarned reaction time (contingent negative variation, CNV) task using a 64-electrode high-density sensor array. We dissociated different PINV components in their time course from postmovement beta ERS in order to provide fundamental knowledge about evoked and induced EEG components after movement execution as a basis for further analysis of postmovement processing. A postmovement negativity occurred from about 500 to 1200 ms after the imperative stimulus (peaking about 600 ins after a right-hand button press) at central electrodes, contralateral to the response movement side. Current source density (CSD) analysis confirmed the current sinks over motor areas [contralateral primary motor/premotor and supplementary/cingulate motor area]. The described DC component (motor PINV, mPINV) differed in time course and localization from later "classical" PINV (cPINV) which is thought to reflect contingency reappraisal. mPINV could also be distinguished topographically from a mere delayed CNV resolution. When mPINV and ERS at the same left central electrode were compared, both parameters showed different time courses. Left central mPINV rather paralleled ERS at midcentral electrodes. Therefore, we suggest that the topography of mPINV provides first hints towards an involvement of contralateral primary motor cortex in postmovement processing beyond a mere idling state as reflected by later beta ERS. mPINV could be a useful tool to investigate the role of primary motor cortex in motor-learning processes. The combined analysis of induced and evoked activities seems to be able to elucidate different aspects of cortical connectivity and motor processes following movement. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ				Croft, RJ; Barry, RJ			EOG correction of blinks with saccade coefficients: a test and revision of the aligned-artefact average solution	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EOG; artefact-aligned average; AAA; saccades; blinks; RAAA	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; EEG; REMOVAL	Objective: The 'aligned-artefact average' (AAA) procedure was advanced by the authors as a technique suitable for removing eye movement-related artefacts from the EEG. It was proposed that this method would correct both blink and non-blink artefact from the EEG, using the same set of correction coefficients (Bs). However, recent evidence suggests that this simplification is not always accurate. Thus, we test here a revision of the AAA, including an appropriate allowance for the radial EOG (REOG) component, that does allow the use of the same Bs for the correction of blink and non-blink artefact. Methods: Blink land saccade) ERP data from 15 subjects were corrected using the AAA method, with Bs calculated from the same blink land saccade! data set (referent waveforms). or a different set of blink land saccade) data, or using the new revised AAA procedure (RAAA). Results: AAA Bs calculated from saccades corrected blinks poorly land vice versa). However, the RAAA Bs corrected blink ERPs better than blink-derived Bs. and saccade ERPs better than saccade-derived Bs. It was also Found that irrespective of correction type, inclusion of REOG improved correction. Conclusion: EOG correction is more accurate when the radial channel is included, but inclusion of REOG (and/or HEOG) is not sufficient to resolve the discrepancy between blink and saccade correction. Using the RAAA procedure, both blink and non-blink data can be corrected using the same set of Bs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study attempted to identify neurophysiologic differences that might underlie this risk factor. Methods: The study examined 158 subjects, aged 14 to 20 years. Each subject was assigned to one of four groups defined by the factorial combination of the subject's gender and the relative number (-/+) of conduct problems exhibited before age 15. Event-related electroencephalographic potentials were recorded from each subject while he or she performed a memory scanning task. Each trial consisted of the brief presentation of either two or four consonant letters, a 2-sec memorization period, and a single "probe" letter. The subject was instructed to mentally, compare the probe with the memory set and execute a discriminative (match vs. mismatch) key-press response. Results: Analyses of P300 event-related potentia Is elicited by the probe stimuli revealed a significant interaction between probe stimulus membership and conduct problems: the P300 difference between trials with matching versus mismatching probes was significantly greater in the control (CP-) group than in the CP+ group. Current source density analyses, utilizing a realistic head-shape boundary element model, revealed that CP- subjects exhibited a robust activation of the left prefrontal cortex on matching versus mismatching trials. Among CP+ subjects, the degree of prefrontal cortex activation was not significant. Conclusions: The P300 results are consistent with those reported from previous studies of adolescents with conduct problems. Our study is unique in implementing current source density-boundary element method techniques for modeling P300 sources in "at-risk" adolescents. These techniques lend greater anatomical precision to the conclusion that conduct problems are associated with a specific dysfunction of the frontal brain. (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Methods: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and magnetic fields (SEFs) to tactile stimulation of the tip of the index finger and/or thenar eminence were measured from 14 healthy newborns. The stimulus was a gentle tap produced by a moving membrane driven by an air-pressure pulse. Results: SEPs and SEFs to tactile stimulation of the skin were similar in waveform and latency to SEPs known to be produced by electrical stimulation of the fingertip of neonates. The two most distinguishable positive deflections of SEPs, P1 and P2, within 300 ms of the stimulation, and their magnetic counterparts were clearly smaller in active compared to quiet sleep. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to record SEFs in neonates, and that clear late cortical somatosensory responses are produced by tactile stimulation. In addition, the effect of sleep stage on these responses indicates differences in the processing of the incoming information, at least in the somatosensory modality, in active and quiet sleep. Significance: Tactile stimulation may be useful as a completely non-invasive technique for studying the physiology of the somatosensory system in neonates. Methodologically, since the effect of sleep stage is profound, one must carefully monitor the sleep stages in studies of event-related responses in newborns, or else this effect may confound the phenomena being studied.

In this work we review some of the options available in rehabilitation technology that are used to aid people with severe neuromuscular disorders, and which take electrophysiological activity as a source of biological signals with which to design interfaces. Development. A number of different researchers have generated a novel communication and control system that utilises the electrical activity of the brain as a signal that represents the messages or commands an individual sends to the outside world, without using the normal output pathways of the brain, such as peripheral nerves and muscles; instead, this is achieved through an artificial system that extracts, encodes and applies them, called a brain-computer interface (BCI). The electrophysiological activity for a BCI can be obtained by means of superficial or implanted electrodes, and may therefore be classified as invasive or non-invasive. Five types of brain signals have been explored for use with a BCI: visual evoked potentials, slow cortical potentials, cortical neuronal activity, beta and nut rhythms, and event-related potentials. Conclusions. Thanks to recent improvements and developments in prototypes, this technology is sure to open up new possibilities of communication and control for the affected population; it also represents a valuable field of multidisciplinary research with numerous interesting applications in areas beyond the sphere of health care.

Methods: Subjects (n = 70 for tones; n = 69 for /da/) were grouped into 2 year intervals (age 3-16) and adults. They listened to a tone (2 kHz; 36 ms; 77 dB SL; ISI = 600 ms; n = 346) ora speech consonant /da/ (female voice recording; 7 ms VOT; 212 ms; 72 dB SL; ISI = 600 ms; n = 349) while watching a Disney(R) screensaver. EEG was recorded from 26 electrodes referenced to Ct. An averaged reference was computed off-line. Amplitude and latency data were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVAs for age x electrode, and age x N1 component. respectively. Results: Left hemisphere N1a was mature before age 3 whereas the right hemisphere N1a matured around 7-8 years. The vertex Nib showed a parietal distribution which shifted anteriorly with age. The Nle showed age- and stimulus-related changes. The Nle measured over the left hemisphere matured earlier than the Nlc over the right hemisphere. The Nlc to /da/ matured earlier than that to tones. Conclusions: Auditory processing undergoes steady and subtle developmental changes. These changes follow different maturational patterns depending on the type of stimuli. The evidence suggests earlier development of the left hemisphere and earlier development of the generators underlying speech processing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Muthukumaraswamy, SD; Johnson, BW; Hamm, JP				Muthukumaraswamy, SD; Johnson, BW; Hamm, JP			A high density ERP comparison of mental rotation and mental size transformation	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						mental rotation; size transformation; image transformation; ERPs; EEG; brain mapping	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENT; IMAGES; RATIO	To compare mental rotation and mental size transformation, 128-channel EEG was recorded while subjects performed both tasks using random two-dimensional shapes as stimuli. Behavioural results showed significant linear effects of both size transformation and mental rotation on reaction times. Rotation ERPs showed experimental effects at two latencies: a bilateral component distributed over posterior parietal electrodes at a latency of approximately 232-300 ms and a second component at approximately 424492 ms distributed over right anterior parietal electrodes. The latency and spatial distribution of this second effect is consistent with previous research indicating a functional connection between this component and mental rotation. ERPs for the size-transformation task showed an effect at 180-228 ms distributed bilaterally over occipital temporal electrodes. These results are consistent with previous hemodynamic imaging studies that show involvement of parietal cortex in mental rotation and also the involvement of BA 19 in size-transformation tasks. However, the superior temporal resolution of the present data indicates that BA 19 activation may occur at a latency that is more likely related to apparent motion than to the size-transformation operation per se.

Methods: Late-latency auditory evoked potentials were measured from 128 recording channels in 13 healthy subjects. Control stimuli consisted of 500 ms segments of broadband acoustic noise presented identically to both ears via earphones, evoking a perception of noise localized in the centre of the head. Dichotic pitch stimuli were created by introducing a dichotic delay to a narrow frequency region of the same noise segments, and resulted in a perception of both the centrally-located noise and a right-lateralized pitch. Results: Both stimuli evoked late auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) characterized by a P1-N1-P2 complex of waves between 60 and 180 ms after stimulus onset. ERPs associated with the control and dichotic pitch stimuli showed no amplitude differences for the P1 and N1 waves. ERPs to dichotic pitch stimuli became significantly more negative beginning at a latency around 150 ms, an effect that was maximal between 210 and 280 ms. Topographic mapping showed that this late negativity was lateralized to the left hemisphere. Conclusions: The late negative wave elicited by the dichotic pitch stimulus reflects neural processing that is dependent upon binaural fusion within the auditory system. Significance: The dichotic pitch paradigm may provide a useful tool for the electrophysiological assessment and study of the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory system. This paradigm may also be useful for the study of binaural mechanisms for the perceptual segregation of concurrent sound sources. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Amplitudes are typically enhanced and/or latencies reduced when evoking stimuli are attended. However, there is controversy concerning the effects of selective attention on short-latency brain stem evoked potentials. The objective of the present study was to assess possible attention effects on the brain stem auditory frequency-following response (FFR) elicited by a periodic tone. Young adult subjects heard a repetitive auditory stimulus while detecting infrequent target stimuli in either an auditory or visual detection task. Five channels of high frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were recorded along the scalp midline with the center electrode positioned at the vertex. The FFR was elicited by the repetitive tone during both tasks. There were significant individual differences in the electrode sites yielding maximum response amplitudes, but overall FFR amplitudes were significantly larger during the auditory attention task. These results suggest that selective attention in humans can modify signal processing in sensory (afferent) pathways at the level of the brain stem. This may reflect top-down perceptual preprocessing mediated by extensive descending (efferent) pathways that originate in the cortex. Overall, the FFR appears to be a robust indicator of early auditory neural processing and shows effects not seen in brain stem auditory evoked response studies employing transient (click) acoustic stimuli.

This idea is supported by the finding that increased ACC activity is found in situations in which errors are likely to occur, even if none are actually made. In addition, recent results suggest that increased ACC activity is negatively correlated with reaction time. We have now compared the error rates and the ACC activity of healthy subjects with short (n = 19) vs. long reaction times (n = 17) in an auditory choice reaction paradigm and analysed the current density differences in the ACC in the time range of the NI component with low resolution electromagnetic tomography. Subjects with short reaction times showed significantly more ACC activation (Brodmann Area 24) and an increased error rate. This finding suggests that increased ACC activity is associated with a gain in reaction speed at the expense of correctness and is discussed in the context of current concepts about the role of the ACC in cognitive functions.

J	Skrandies, W; Chiu, MJ; Lin, YR				Skrandies, W; Chiu, MJ; Lin, YR			The processing of semantic meaning in Chinese words and evoked brain topography	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						language; semantic meaning; German; Chinese language; human electrophysiology; event-related potentials	INFORMATION; COMPONENTS; HUMANS	The connotative meaning of words can be quantified statistically by the "semantic differential technique" resulting in statistically defined, independent dimensions where every word is uniquely located on the three dimensional evaluation. In an earlier study on German subjects we demonstrated that there are electrophysiological correlates of these meaning dimensions. Here a group of 55 Chinese adults was investigated in two experiments: first, 210 nouns were rated by 32 subjects, and factor analysis on the questionnaire data yielded three independent semantic dimensions. Semantically unique words stemming from these results were then used as stimuli in electrophysiological experiments in another group of 23 healthy right-handed adults. Words of similar physical appearance belonging to different semantic classes were presented visually in random order. The EEG was recorded from 29 channels, and evoked brain activity was computed for each semantic class. Significant differences in electrical brain activation between these semantic word classes were observed as early as 80 ms after stimulus onset, confirming earlier reports on similar findings in German subjects. Further similarities were revealed by a direct comparison of the topographical distribution of potential components elicited by words, and by the results of spatial PCA performed on both sets of data. These results illustrate similar early neural activation based on semantic class, in subject groups of different language and culture.

In this paper we explore a recently developed approach to calculate a quantitative measure of deterministic signal complexity and information content: The Renyi number. The Renyi number is by definition an entropy, i.e., a classically used measure of disorder in physical systems, and is calculated in this paper over the basis of the time frequency representation (TFRs) of the measured signals. When calculated in this form, the Renyi entropy (RE) indirectly characterizes the complexity of a signal by providing an approximate counting of the number of separated elementary atoms that compose the time series in the time frequency plane. In this sense, this measure conforms closely to our visual notion of complexity since low complexity values are obtained fur signals formed by a small number of "components". The most remarkable properties of this measure are twofold: 1) It dues not rely on assumptions about the time series such as stationarity or gaussianity and 2) No model of the neural process under study is required, e.g., no hemodynamic response model for fMRI. The method is illustrated in this pager using fMRI, intracranial ERPs and intracranial potentials estimated from scalp recorded ERPs through an inverse solution (ELECTRA). The main theoretical and practical drawbacks of this measure, especially its dependence of the selected TFR, are discussed. Also the capability of this approach to produce, with less restrictive hypothesis, results comparable to those obtained with more standard methods but is emphasized. Hum.

J	Bijma, F; de Munck, JC; Bocker, KBE; Huizenga, HM; Heethaar, RM				Bijma, F; de Munck, JC; Bocker, KBE; Huizenga, HM; Heethaar, RM			The coupled dipole model: an integrated model for multiple MEG/EEG data sets	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG/EEG source analysis; integrated model; trilinear model; spatiotemporal covariance; coupled dipole model; visual evoked field; component model	TOPOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS MODEL; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BACKGROUND-NOISE	Often MEG/EEG is measured in a few slightly different conditions to investigate the functionality of the human brain. This kind of data sets show similarities, though are different for each condition. When solving the inverse problem (IP), performing the source localization, one encounters the problem that this IP is ill-posed: constraints are necessary to solve and stabilize the solution to the IP. Moreover, a substantial amount of data is needed to avoid a signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is too poor for source localizations. In the case of similar conditions, this common information can be exploited by analyzing the data sets simultaneously. The here proposed coupled dipole model (CDM) provides an integrated method in which these similarities between conditions are used to solve and stabilize the inverse problem. The coupled dipole model is applicable when data sets contain common sources or common source time functions. The coupled dipole model uses a set of common sources and a set of common source time functions (STFs) to model all conditions in one single model. The data of each condition are mathematically described as a linear combination of these common spatial and common temporal components. This linear combination is specified in a coupling matrix for each data set. The coupled dipole model was applied in two simulation studies and in one experimental study. The simulations show that the errors in the estimated spatial and temporal parameters decrease compared to the standard separate analyses. A decrease in position error of a factor of 10 was shown for the localization of two nearby sources. In the experimental application, the coupled dipole model was shown to be necessary to obtain a plausible solution in at least 3 of 15 conditions investigated. Moreover, using the CDM, a direct comparison between models, the scaling of the amplitude parameters varies in general from data set to data set. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Spinelli, L; Andino, SG; Lantz, G; Seeck, M; Michel, CM				Spinelli, L; Andino, SG; Lantz, G; Seeck, M; Michel, CM			Electromagnetic inverse solutions in anatomically constrained spherical head models	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; MRI; co-registration; spline; source localization; head model	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; LOCAL MESH REFINEMENT; DIPOLE LOCALIZATION; SCALP POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; GEOMETRIES	Two classes of functional neuroimaging methods exist: hemodynamic techniques such as PET and fMRI, and electromagnetic techniques such as EEG/ERP and MEG. In order to fusion these images with anatomical information, co-registration with volumetric MRT is needed. While such co-registration techniques are well established for hemodynamic images, additional steps are needed for electromagnetic recordings, because the activity is only recorded on the scalp surface and inverse solutions based on specific head models have to be used to estimate the 3-dimensional current distribution. To date most of the experimental and clinical studies use multi-shell concentric sphere models of the head, solve the inverse problem on this simplistic model, and then co-register the solution with the MRT using homogeneous transform operations. Contrary to this standard method, we here propose to map the MRI to the spherical system by defining transformation operations that transform the MRI to a best-fitting sphere. Once done so, the solution points are defined in the cerebral tissue of this deformed MRI and the lead field for the distributed linear inverse solutions is calculated for this solution space. The method, that we call SMAC (Spherical Model with Anatomical Constrains) is tested with simulations, as well as with the following real data: 1) estimation of the sources of visual evoked potentials to unilateral stimulation from data averaged over subjects, and 2) localization of interictal discharges of two epileptic patients, one with a temporal, the other with an occipital focus, both confirmed by seizure freedom after resection of the epileptogenic region.

Design: Two experiments were conducted one using auditory; the other using respiratory occlusion stimuli presented during stage 2 sleep. Trials were classified on the basis of whether they produced a K-complex, a vertex sharp wave, or some other response. Auditory stimuli wee presented in the form of an oddball paradigm, and averaged separately depending on whether they were "frequent" or "rare,". In both experiments, responses were averaged separately based on the appearance of K-complexes, vertex sharps waves, or some "other" response to the stimuli. Setting: Data were collected in the Melbourne University Sleep Laboratory. Participants: Young healthy male adults, eight in experiment 1 and six in experiment 2. Interventions: Na Measurements and Results: Data were collected from 29 scalp sites. In all cases, N300 amplitude was maximal in the vertex sharp wave averages, despite being clearly present in the averages of K-complexes and "other" responses. The vertex maximal scalp topography of the N300 did not differ across response conditions or as a function of stimulus modality. This is consistent with the N300 being produced by the same intracranial generators in all cases. There were no effects of stimulus or response type on N300 latency. Conclusions: N300 should be viewed as a multi-modal component with a different underlying generator mechanism that that of the K-complex.

Median and tibial nerve were stimulated at all four limbs in a random order. Subjects were instructed to count the events on either the right median or the right tibial nerve. Attention-induced changes in the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were revealed by subtracting the median nerve SEPs recorded while subjects attended to stimuli applied to the tibial nerve from those obtained during attention to the stimulated hand. In a current density reconstruction approach source maxima in the time range from 30 to 260 ms after median nerve stimulation were localized and the time courses of activation were elaborated by dipole modeling. Six regions were identified which contribute significant source activity related to selective spatial attention: contralateral postcentral gyrus (Brodman area (BA) 3), contralateral mesial frontal gyrus (BA 6), right posterior parietal cortex (BA 7), anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32), and bilateral middle temporal gyrus (BA 21). Activation started at the right posterior parietal cortex, followed by the contralateral middle temporal gyrus, probably representing SII activity, and the middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyrus. Similar regions of source activation were revealed by tibial nerve SEP, but the effect was less pronounced and restricted almost entirely to activation of the contralateral postcentral gyrus (BA 3), anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32), and ipsilateral middle temporal gyrus (BA 21). Our data provide evidence for a spatially separated frontal generator within the anterior cingulum, dependent on selective attention in the somatosensory modality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Prosaccades were elicited under the 200-ms gap and overlap conditions, antisaccades under the overlap condition (64 trials each). The EEG was recorded from 25 channels with a DC amplifier (MES, Munich). Data of 20 healthy participants were statistically analyzed. We found high test-retest correlations for all SRT (.76 less than or equal to r(u) less than or equal to .88) and neuropsychological (.62 less than or equal to r(u) less than or equal to .88) measures. For the sCNV, coefficients ranging between .58 (pro/gap) and .77 (anti/overlap) were obtained. Whereas SRT were significantly faster during the second than during the first session, group means for the saccadic CNV were stable across the sessions. Our results suggest high 4-week stability of individual differences in SRT, and moderate to good stabilities of saccadic CNV amplitudes. Our results recommend these "traitlike" measures to be used in individual differences research.

Methods: The foreperiod duration (500 or 2500 ms) was varied across blocks of trials during a between-hand choice reaction time task; surface Laplacians were estimated from EEG recordings by the source derivation method. Results: Reaction time was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod. A contralateral negativity/ipsilateral positivity pattern showed up over the primary sensorimotor cortices. The time between the contralateral negativity onset and the electromyographic onset was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod, which suggests that the foreperiod affects the implementation of the motor command. Furthermore, the interval between the onset of the voluntary electromyographic activity and the mechanical response was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod. Conclusions: These results indicate that time preparation affects both central and peripheral motor processes. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Management of refractory status epilepticus on the intensive care unit is necessary for adequate treatment of the physiological compromise that occurs in convulsive status epilepticus. In addition, anaesthesia is sometimes necessary for the treatment of status epilepticus, and provided that the potential benefit of anaesthesia offsets the associated morbidity, then such an approach is warranted. In certain instances of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, especially in the elderly, the risks of anaesthesia outweigh the benefits of such aggressive treatment, and thus some caution must be exercised. Status epilepticus is also under-recognised as a cause of persistent coma on the intensive care unit, though the gain from aggressive treatment in this situation is unknown. In most instances, status epilepticus in coma carries such a poor prognosis that aggressive treatment is probably justified. Myoclonic status epilepticus also occurs on the intensive care unit, usually following cardiorespiratory arrest; this does not necessarily represent an agonal event especially if the intial insult was hypoxia related.

Here, we address the latter problem by proposing that an electrophysiological measure, individual alpha frequency (IAF), may be a suitable means of classifying interindividual differences in sentence processing. Interindividual differences in IAF have been shown to correlate with performance on memory tasks and speed of information processing. In two experiments using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), IAF-based participant groups differed systematically with regard to the processing of ambiguous sentences such that the low-IAF group showed a sustained positivity in the ambiguous region, while the high-IAF group did not. These interindividual differences were independent of whether the ambiguity was syntactic (Experiment 1) or sentence-level semantic (Experiment 2). Moreover, they were reliable only when participants were classified according to IAF, but not in classifications based on reading span, speed of processing (reaction time), or accuracy of processing (error rate).

So far, the mode of action and neuro-anatomical basis is unclear. Sacral reflex mechanisms as well as pontine or cortical centers of modulation have been postulated. Our aim was to evaluate possible alterations in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity as an indicator of a supraspinally mediated mechanism of sacral neuromodulation. Materials and Methods: We analyzed serial EEGs (apparatus: Kolner Vitaport System) using electrodes placed at Fz, Cz. Cz' and Pz in 10 patients. Subsequently, the sacral (S3) nerve was stimulated by means of an impulse generator (Medtronic. Interstim 3023) using an on-off paradigm with a 1.5 s "on" interval followed by a 10 s stimulation break. Raw data were analyzed using both Matlab 4.0 software and a specially developed averaging routine. Results: All patients demonstrated a cortical potential complex following sacral root stimulation with an early electronegative component at 50 ms with a mean amplitude of 23 muV followed by a late potential component with a mean latency of 253 ms and a mean amplitude of 5 muV, both with a maximum at Cz, corresponding to the postcentral gyrus. This finding occurred irrespective of patient's reports of actually feeling the neuromodulator being switched on and off. Conclusion: in neuromodulation responders, both short and long latency cortical potentials can be reproduced with a maximum at the sensory cortical area. Although these potentials are similar to cognitively mediated "event-related potentials", they are clearly distinct from any subjective sensory or even painful response since several patients of this series have not been able to feel any neuromodulator action. Therefore. this pilot study indicates a supraspinally mediated site of modulation, most probably in sensory cortex areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It first shows that the brain's electric fields and potentials are predominantly due to ohmic currents. This serves to reformulate the inverse problem in terms of a restricted source model permitting noninvasive estimations of Local Field Potentials (LFPs) in depth from scalp-recorded data. Uniqueness in the solution is achieved by a physically derived regularization strategy that imposes a spatial structure on the solution based upon the physical laws that describe electromagnetic fields in biological media. The regularization strategy and the source model emulate the properties of brain activity's actual generators. This added information is independent of both the recorded data and head model and suffices for obtaining a unique solution compatible with and aimed at analyzing experimental data. The inverse solution's features are evaluated with event-related potentials (ERPs) from a healthy subject performing a visuo-motor task. Two aspects are addressed: the concordance between available neurophysiological evidence and inverse solution results, and the functional localization provided by fMRI data from the same subject under identical experimental conditions. The localization results are spatially and temporally concordant with experimental evidence, and the areas detected as functionally activated in both imaging modalities are similar, providing indices of localization accuracy. We conclude that biophysically driven inverse solutions offer a novel and reliable possibility for studying brain function with the temporal resolution required to advance our understanding of the brain's functional networks.

While electrophysiological studies provide high temporal resolution, localizing the P300 deficit has been particularly difficult because the measurements are collected from the scalp. Knowing which brain regions are involved in this process would elucidate the behavioral correlates of P300. The aim of this study was to determine the brain regions involved in a visual oddball task using fMRI. In this study, functional and high-resolution anatomical MR images were collected from seven normal volunteers. The data were analyzed using a randomization-based statistical method that accounts for multiple comparisons, requires no assumptions about the noise structure of the data, and does not require spatial or temporal smoothing. Activations were detected (P<0.01) bilaterally in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG; BA 40), superior parietal lobule (BA 7), the posterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, inferior occipitotemporal cortex (BA 19/37), insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), premotor area, and cuneus (BA 17). Our results are consistent with previous studies that have observed activation in ACC and SMG. Activation of thalamus, insula, and the occipitotemporal cortex has been reported less consistently. The present study lends further support to the involvement of these structures in visual target detection. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25 bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.

Both evoked potential (EP) types have been used to demonstrate differences between good readers (WIAT Basic Reading score > 115, N=42) and poor readers (Reading score < 85, N=42). A largely automated, hands off approach was used to reduce artifact contamination, to develop canonical measures for discriminating good from poor readers, and to predict reading scores across the entire population including intermediate (average) readers. Eye and muscle artifact were diminished by multiple regression. Substantial EP data reduction was enabled by an unrestricted use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). For each EP type, 40 factors encompassed 70-80% of initial variance, a meaningful data reduction of about 90:1. Factor interpretation was enhanced by mapping of the factor loadings. By discriminant analysis, resulting factors predicted reading group membership with over 80% jackknifed and also split -half replication accuracy. By multiple regression, they produced a canonical variate correlating significantly (p <0.001) with the Basic Reading score (r=0.39). The TTAER factors were more useful than the TALAER factors. The relevance of rapid auditory processing and phonemic discrimination measurements to dyslexia is discussed.

In the present study, we investigated, by means of EEG, not only the net result of the categorization but also the dynamics of the process. Subjects had to perform a target detection task throughout an image set of distractors belonging to six categories: letters, geometrical figures, faces, tools, structured textures and Asiatic characters. Multivariate analyses were performed on the responses to the non-target stimuli according to their category. Categorical neural responses were only obtained on P2 latencies and N2 amplitudes. This result suggests that there are no differences in the first stage of the implicit categorization of the distractors (visual analysis and proximal stimulus representation elaboration from 100 to 220 ms) and that differences appear between 220 and 280 ms (matching to structural representations). Over-learned stimuli (e.g. letters) elicited the shortest P2 latency, contrasting with unknown categories (e.g. Asiatic characters) that revealed the longest P2 latencies and flattened N2 waves. Categorical differences indicate that the more a subject knows about an object, the less cognitive resources are used. In conclusion, our results suggest that a reduction in neural activity could reflect an improved accuracy in cognitive and cortical processing. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mean coefficient of variation for rotation speed under Very Slow was higher than that under Slow, showing that the subjects found it difficult to perform the Very Slow task smoothly. The EEG score of alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) under Slow Condition was increased significantly more than under the Preferred Condition; however, the increase under Very Slow was small when compared with Preferred. After performing the task, P300 latency under Very Slow increased significantly as compared to that at pretask, Further, P300 amplitude decreased under both speed conditions when compared to that at pretask, and a significant decrease,vas seen under the Slow Condition at Fz, whereas the decrease under the Very Slow Condition was small. These differences indicated that a more complicated neural composition and an increase in subjects' attention might have been involved when the task was performed under the Very Slow Condition. We concluded that slow movement execution may have an influence on cognitive function and may depend on the percentage of decrease from the Preferred speed of the individual.

J	Garcia-Larrea, L; Frot, M; Valeriani, M				Garcia-Larrea, L; Frot, M; Valeriani, M			Brain generators of laser-evoked potentials: from dipoles to functional significance	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						laser-evoked potentials; laser; pain; intracortical; sources; dipole modelling; PET; fMR1	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; REALISTIC HEAD MODEL; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; PAIN PERCEPTION; CEREBRAL ACTIVATION	In this work we review data on cortical generators of laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) in humans, as inferred from dipolar modelling of scalp EEG/MEG results, as well as from intracranial data recorded with subdural grids or intracortical electrodes. The cortical regions most consistently tagged as sources of scalp LERs are the suprasylvian region (parietal operculum, SII) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Variability in opercular sources across studies appear mainly in the anterior-posterior direction, where sources tend to follow the axis of the Sylvian fissure. As compared with parasylvian activation described in functional pain imaging studies, LEP opercular sources tended to cluster at more superior sites and not to involve the insula. The existence of suprasylvian opercular LEPs has been confirmed by both epicortical (subdural) and intracortical recordings. In dipole-modelling studies, these sources appear to become active less than 150 ms post-stimulus, and remain in action for longer than opercular responses recorded intracortically, thus suggesting that modelled opercular dipoles reflect a "lumped" activation of several sources in the suprasylvian region, including both the operculum and the insula. Participation of SI sources to explain LEP scalp distribution remains controversial, but evidence is emerging that both SI and opercular sources may be concomitantly activated by laser pulses, with very similar time courses. Should these data be confirmed, it would suggest that a parallel processing in SI and SII has remained functional in humans for noxious inputs, whereas hierarchical. processing from SI toward SII has emerged for other somatosensory sub-modalities. The ACC has been described as a source of LEPs by virtually all EEG studies so far, with activation times roughly corresponding to scalp P2. Activation is generally confined to area 24 in the caudal ACC, and has been confirmed by subdural and intracortical recordings. The inability of most MEG studies to disclose such ACC activity may be due to the radial orientation of ACC currents relative to scalp. ACC dipole sources have been consistently located between the VAC and VPC lines of Talairach's space, near to the cingulate subsections activated by motor tasks involving control of the hand. Together with the fact that scalp activities at this latency are very sensitive to arousal and attention, this supports the hypothesis that laser-evoked ACC activity may underlie orienting reactions tightly coupled with limb withdrawal (or control of withdrawal). With much less consistency than the above-mentioned areas, posterior parietal, medial temporal and anterior insular regions have been occasionally tagged as possible contributors to LEPs. Dipoles ascribed to medial temporal lobe may be in some cases re-interpreted as being located at or near the insular cortex. This would make sense as the insular region has been shown to respond to thermal pain stimuli in both functional imaging and intracranial EEG studies.

Wavelet tools in combination with Fourier analysis can detect and characterize hitherto unknown discrete, slow potentials underlying the conspicuous oscillations. Ethanol was one of the odorants that we have extensively studied (J. Neurosci. Methods, 119 (2002) 89). To detect new features and to elucidate their functions, we tested the wavelet tools on the ethanol-evoked LFP responses of the slug (Limax) procerebrum. Recordings were made in vitro from the neuropile and the cell layer. The present study led to the following findings: (i) Mutual exclusion. Energy concentrated mainly in two ranges, (a) 0.1-0.4 Hz and (b) 1.56-12.5 Hz, and the sum of energy remained constant throughout experiments regardless of the condition. A redistribution of relative energy within this sum seemed to occur in the course of main, possible interactions between the two components excluding each other ('mutual exclusion'). (ii) Transient signal ordering and disordering. Ethanol stimulation alternatingly evoked periods of strongly time evolving oscillation dominated by the energy of 1.56-12.5 Hz (increase of entropy = disordered or complexly ordered state) and those of near-silence were predominated by the energy of 0.1-0.4 Hz (decrease of entropy = ordered state). (iii) About 0.1 Hz slow wave oscillation. It was robust. The dominant energy oscillation and the resulting large entropy fluctuation were negatively correlated to each other, and revealed strong frequency-tuning or synchronization at this frequency. Our findings suggest that discrete slow waves play functionally important roles in the invertebrate brain, as widely known in vertebrate EEG. Wavelet tools allow an easy interpretation of several minutes of frequency variations in a single display and give precise information on stimulus-evoked complex change of the neural system describing the new state 'more ordered' or 'non-ordered or more complexly ordered'.

Using an auditory dual-click paradigm, a number of studies have found that, compared with normal controls, patients with schizophrenia show impaired inhibition, or gating, of repeated stimulation as measured by the average P50 evoked response to the second click. Since responses to many trials are collected to study the average response, fluctuations in the timing of the P50 response from trial to trial may influence the differences observed. We present a computerized, objective procedure that evaluates temporal variability in brain responses of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Ten normal controls and 10 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were studied using the dual-click procedure. For each single trial, the temporal shift in P50 that yielded the best alignment with the average P50 response was used to derive a measure of P50 temporal variability from trial to trial and to form P50 averages corrected for temporal variability. Results: Patients with schizophrenia had significantly more temporal variability than normal controls. Correction for temporal variability in the P50 responses increased the size of P50 for both patients with schizophrenia and normal controls. Patients with schizophrenia had smaller P50 responses to the first click than controls and less inhibition to the second click before, but not after, correction for temporal variability. Conclusions: These findings suggest that temporal variability contributes significantly to the P50 response as measured using the gating procedure. The measure of temporal variability may provide a new index of inhibitory and attentional function in schizophrenia.

Recently, reports of Ne-like waves on correct responses did challenge this interpretation. It has been proposed, however, that these Ne-like waves result either from an artifactual contamination of response-locked activities by stimulus-locked ones, or from an implicit monitoring of the time elapsing during the RT. Our aim was to reprocess published data: (1) to compare the shape and amplitude of EMG-locked and stimulus-locked ERPs on correct trials, and (2) to compare the size of the EMG-locked Ne-like waves obtained on fast and slow trials. The results neither support the artifact hypothesis nor the RT monitoring one. Therefore, it seems that the Ne-like waves observed on correct trials do correspond to a Ne, which suggests that the Ne has a broader significance than just error detection. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Auditory on- and off-responses of 12 healthy volunteers (average 17 years. old) were recorded from five locations (Fz, Cz, Pz, P3, and P4). The auditory stimuli of 80 dB SPL and 1000 ms duration were delivered at six different stimulation frequencies (f1-f6; 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz, respectively). In using individual alpha frequency (IAF) as individual anchor point, wide band alpha and three different alpha frequency sub-bands with a bandwidth of 2 Hz each were defined: lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha, and upper alpha. The Root Mean Square (RMS) values of the alpha frequency bands were computed for two time periods: +/-3 sd around the mean peak latency of the auditory on-responses (t1-on and t2-on) and a time window of the same length of the auditory off-responses (t1-off and t2-off). The alpha RMS values of both on- and off responses showed significant differences between t1 and t2 periods on wide band, lower-1 and lower-2 alpha bands, especially at 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2, and 3 kHz stimulation frequencies in all recording places. Amplitudes in anterior locations (Fz, Cz) were higher than the others. These observations may provide a preliminary but nonetheless important understanding of how information may be processed in the brain.

One of the tasks required the comparison of pairs of familiar faces, and the other was the comparison of abstract dotted patterns. Each trial began with one of the two cues (S1) followed by consecutive pictures (S2 and S3). Faces and patterns were superimposed, and the switching between tasks depended on the cue. The ERP analysis was done for the time window between S1 (cue) and S2 presentations. The major differences between tasks were found in the anterior scalp regions starting at 700 ms from S1 onset. During Pattern task anticipation, the proposed sources in the right frontal area were more anterior, inferior and lateral than those in Face task. The task-specific slow electric potentials may indicate the functional specialization for attentive anticipation in the human frontal lobe. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Eighteen healthy female and male subjects were enrolled and received single infusions of 30 mg orphenadrine citrate and matching placebo in two periods which were separated by a 1 week washout period. The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, cross-over trial. The intended neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia were induced by topical, occlusive application of 1% capsaicin solution (INCI: Capsicum frutescens, containing capsaicinoides from Capsicum annuum annuum, CAS 84603-55-4) for 30 min on defined skin areas of the back. The pain response to CO2 laser pulses applied to the capsaicin pre-treated skin was measured by event related Vertex-EEG recordings. This technique allowed studying the influence of orphenadrine citrate on the (central) P2-component and the (peripheral) NI-component of the pain response (LSEP). Both, orphenadrine citrate and placebo were given as intravenous infusions over 60 min. Orphenadrine citrate exerted a significant reduction in central and peripheral components of the pain response when compared to placebo. The effect on the central component was highly significant and more pronounced than the peripheral effect of the drug. The analgesic effect developed fast, was already present during infusion, was ongoing, and exceeded the observational period of 4 h after start of infusion. In summary, orphenadrine citrate was able to exert an analgesic/anti-hyperalgesic effect in a low-dose paradigm (30 mg dose) which was predominantly due to central/spinal mechanisms in this capsaicin model with laser somatosensory evoked potentials.

Recent work has also suggested that the P300 component could reflect the efficacy of interhemispheric transmission (Polich & 1998). The purpose of the present study was to study the differential role of the corpus callosum (CC) and anterior commissure (AC) in the interhemispheric propagation of these two electrophysiological components. Thus, the amplitude and latency distribution of the N100 and P300 components were analyzed using high-density electrical mapping in a subject with agenesis of CC but preservation of AC, a subject with agenesis Of both CC and AC, and 10 neurologically intact Control subjects. The task consisted of a Modified visual oddball paradigm comprising one frequent and two rare stimuli, one presented on the same and the other on the opposite side of the frequent stimulus. Interhemispheric differences in latency were found for the N100 component in controls. However, in the acallosal subjects, this component was not identifiable in the indirectly stimulated hemisphere. In controls, no interhemispheric differences were observed in the distribution of the P300 latency and amplitude to rare and frequent stimuli. The distribution of the P300 amplitude in the acallosal subject with an AC was identical to that of the controls, whereas in the acallosal subject lacking the AC, the amplitude was greater in the hemisphere receiving the rare stimuli were presented. In both acallosal subjects, hemispheric differences in the P300 latency were observed, the latencies being shorter in the hemisphere directly stimulated for all categories of stimuli. These results suggest that the interhemispheric transfer of both the N100 and P300 components relies on the integrity of cortical commissures. Possible P300 generator sources are discussed.

Cortical activation patterns were assessed by recordings of direct current components of the EEG signal from the scalp. Right-handed subjects discriminated pairs of declarative sentences with either happy, sad or neutral intonation. Each stimulus pair was derived from two identical original utterances that, due to digital signal manipulations, slightly differed in fundamental frequency (F0) range or in duration of stressed syllables. In the first experiment, subjects were asked: (i) to denote the original emotional category of each sentence pair and (ii) to decide which of the two items displayed stronger emotional expressiveness. Participants in the second experiment were asked to repeat the utterances using inner speech during stimulus presentation in addition to the discrimination task. In the absence of inner speech, a predominant activation of right frontal regions was observed, irrespective of emotional category. In the second experiment, a bilateral activation with left frontal preponderance emerged from discrimination during additional performance of inner speech. Compared with the first experiment, a new pattern of acoustic signal processing arose. A relative decrease of brain activity during processing of F0 stimulus variants was observed together with increased activation during discrimination of duration-manipulated sentence pairs. Analysis of behavioural data revealed no significant differences in evaluation of expressiveness between the two experiments. We conclude that the topographical shift of cortical activity originates from left hemisphere (LH) mechanisms of speech processing that centre around the subvocal rehearsal system as an articulatory control component of the phonological loop. A strong coupling of acoustic input and (planned) verbal output channel in the LH is initiated by subvocal articulatory activity like inner speech. These neural networks may provide interpretations of verbal acoustic signals in terms of motor programs and facilitate continuous control of speech output by comparing the signal produced with that intended. Most likely, information on motor aspects of suprasegmental signal characteristics contributes to the evaluation of affective components of spoken language. In consequence, the right hemisphere (RH) holds a merely relative dominance, both for processing of F0 and for evaluation of emotional significance of sensory input.

Using a standard CNV paradigm, 21 EEG electrodes and topographic mapping analysis, the post-warning (S1) auditory N100a b c, P200, P30 (binaural clicks) and CNV activity were recorded in three additional patients after extensive dorsolateral and/or medial prefrontal cortex ablations, verified through CT/MRI examinations. No true post-S1/CNV components were recordable over the ablated frontal areas, only sporadic volume-conducted ERPs probably generated in the temporo-parietal lobes or posterior cingulate gyrus. For one of these patients, after excision of a vast right frontal epileptogenic cortical region (including extensive dorsolateral areas, but sparing the fronto-medial cortex and anterior/middle cingulate gyrus), no post-S1/CNV components were recordable over the ablated regions. These latest observations again indicate that independent neuronal generators of several post-SI auditory and CNV components are located in the dorsolateral supramodal premotor/prefrontal cortical areas which are directly, ipsilaterally connected to the uni/multimodal temporo-parieto-occipital sensory and associative regions through the long, two-way, fairly superficial, superior arcuate-longitudinal and deeper superior and inferior occipito-frontal bundles. Clear and almost constant differences in the latency of some post-Si N100 subcomponents (especially the time-lapses between onset and the highest amplitude of the N100 a and c) over various posterior, central and anterior cortical areas sequentially involved, roughly measured in 10 normal subjects along the scalp and with MRI cerebral imaging, may probably be accounted for by the transcortical homohemispheric conduction time, which varies in our scalp recordings from 1 cm/0.74-1.28 ms, mean similar to 1 cm/1.02 ms(similar to 9.8 ms).

The data stem from intracellular recordings (most of them dual impalements of pairs of neurons and glia), extracellular ionic concentrations (mainly K+ and Ca2+) and simultaneous intracortical field potentials from the cortex of cats. These data were corroborated with recordings from naturally sleeping animals and humans. It is shown that sleep is dominated by a cortically generated slow (<1 Hz) oscillation resulting from the complex interplay within networks of neurons and glia, which are modulated by the more diffuse action of extracellular currents of ions. Wakefulness is produced through the activation of brainstem and basal forebrain structures, which disrupt sleep oscillations and elicit a global change of the extraneuronal milieu, with profound modifications of glial and cerebral blood flow parameters. Paroxysmal events arising during quiet sleep evolve within the cortex from normal slow sleep oscillations. The synchronization of large cortical and eventually subcortical territories relies on the propagation of increased currents of K+ through the glial syncytium, which compensate for the reduced synaptic efficacy due to the depletion of extracellular Ca2+.

J	Pugnetti, L; Meehan, M; Mendozzi, L				Pugnetti, L; Meehan, M; Mendozzi, L			Psychophysiological correlates of virtual reality: A review	PRESENCE-VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTS	The recording and measurement of central and peripheral nervous system responses can provide important information during the development and the application of virtual reality (VR). Although studies on electroencephalographic, evoked potentials, and peripheral psychophysiological changes in connection with VR exposure are still preliminary, they show that reliable data can be obtained even in immersive VR conditions. There is no firm evidence that neurophysiological equipment-sensors and cables-may increase subjects' discomfort and affect their ability to interact with the virtual environments, but additional study is needed to clarify this issue. Suggestions as to how to limit potential interferences are summarized here. Two main lines of research are emerging: one seeking psychophysiological correlates of reaction and adaptation to stimuli and task variables in an attempt to understand more about human-VR interaction, and the other looking for ways to use psychophysiological responses to automatically control aspects of the virtual environments or other external devices. The main results emerging from the first group of studies indicate that psychophysiological measures of brain activity-notably EEG and event-related responses-may be used to distinguish between automatic and controlled modes of processing. Additionally, peripheral measures, notably skin-resistance levels, are proposed as objective correlates of presence and of the outcome of specific VR-based desensitization therapies. There is no clear-cut evidence that brain waves may index unwanted effects on the central nervous system of VR exposure, but this issue deserves further study. The results of the second line of research seem to indicate that VR-induced psychophysiological responses can be used to develop assistive devices for people with disabilities or to control hands-free interaction within any virtual environment (for example, in highly demanding conditions). A related and promising field of application is that of neuro-feedback, wherein VR may play an important role in increasing the motivational/attentional span of clients, and, ultimately, the effectiveness of treatment protocols. Given these premises, it is suggested that research on psychophysiological correlates of VR should be incremented along the lines already delineated and possibly include also groups of subjects at risk for adverse affects.

Attempts to use clinical features to predict which patients will respond to specific medications have met with limited success (see article by Nierenberg in this issue). Researchers also have sought biological tests that might discriminate between likely treatment responders and nonresponders or identify those at greater risk for relapse. Investigating techniques have ranged from urine neurotransmitter metabolites to electroencephalogram (EEG). Most recently, the widespread availability of neuroimaging technology has led to new efforts to apply these techniques to predict treatment response in psychiatry. The search for response predictors is driven by two related goals. The first is identifying the underlying pathophysiology associated with a given disease. Just as the utility of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in major depression provided evidence for serotonergic dysregulation in some affective illnesses, the discovery that changes in the metabolism of certain brain regions predict treatment response would implicate those structures in the process of disease development or recovery. These findings could guide future drug development. A second goal is to allow more targeted and focused clinical interventions. For example, while first-line antidepressant treatments have response rates of 50% or more, many patients still fail to respond to multiple interventions [1,2]. As each new pharmacotherapy is tried, patients are exposed to additional cost, adverse effect burden, and the potential for loss of function and suicide. Importantly, these two goals imply different criteria for what makes a response predictor useful. From a research perspective, identifying any association would be valuable in guiding future studies. From a clinical perspective, however, the requirements are more stringent and rarely have been achieved. Such factors as positive and negative predictive value and cost and availability of technology become critical in determining the utility of a predictive test (see article by Nierenberg in this issue). Attempts to identify biological response predictors generally have met with limited success, particularly where the goal is to develop clinically useful indices. This article reviews the biological approaches to predicting treatment response, beginning with neuroendocrine studies and EEG analysis and concludes with structural and functional neuroimaging. Where relevant, the authors identify studies correlating change in a measure during treatment; though these studies identify correlates of response rather than true predictors, they also may point the way to useful predictive measures. The article describes the designs of typical studies to aid in interpreting their results and concludes by addressing some of the problems and limitations associated with these approaches and suggesting future directions for this research. Original reports or reviews included in this article were identified by conducting a MEDLINE search with the terms "response," "predictor," and "treatment," combined with "depression," "bipolar disorder," or "affective illness." References in the publications identified were reviewed manually to locate additional relevant publications. Of note, pharmacogenomics, which shows great promise for response prediction in psychiatry, is discussed elsewhere (see article by Pickar in this issue).

Spontaneous magnetoencephalogram as well as auditory-evoked magnetic fields were recorded before and after the drinking of 750 mL water (9 subjects) or saline solution (10 subjects) and during and after hyperventilation following the drinking conditions. Hyperventilation was used to enhance the hypothesized synchronizing effect of water on spontaneous magnetoencephalographic activity. In addition, the magnetic fields were measured during a dichotic listening task under attended and unattended conditions. The prediction, that intake of water, because of induced cell swelling, will increase neuronal excitability and lead to an increased synchronization of the spontaneous magnetoencephalogram during hyperventilation was confirmed. Hyperventilation induced an increase of spectral power in all frequency bands particularly theta and delta power after water drinking. Furthermore, there was an increase of magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) amplitude in attended conditions and a simultaneous decrease in unattended conditions after water drinking. N1m (magnetic NI wave) revealed significant changes during experimental conditions: increase after drinking and decrease after hyperventilation in both groups. MMNm for attended conditions showed a high positive correlation with osmolality changes (difference in the mol solute per kg water before and after drinking); N1m and PNm (magnetic processing negativity) as well as MMNm for unattended conditions showed significant correlations with subjective ratings of thirst and mood state.

The present study was designed to explore the impact of the previous trial on the CNV of the forthcoming trial, that is, how a previous movement affects brain activation preparing the next movement. Effects of alteration of finger (from index to middle, and vice versa) and hand (from left to right, and vice versa) were examined independently from each other. Methods: CNV was recorded in 20 right-handed healthy subjects with electrodes placed at F7, F5, F3, F4, F6, F8, FC5, FC3, FCI, FC2, FC4, FC6, T7, C5, C3, Cl, C2, C4, C6, T8, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, P7, P3, P4 and P8. In a visual/visual SI-choice paradigm, an earlier informative (SI) stimulus which instructed for side and finger of the following movement was followed 3 s later by an imperative (S2) stimulus providing the command to move. Subjects had to respond to each imperative stimulus with an appropriate button press made by brisk flexion movements with the index or middle finger of each hand. The CNV recorded in the interval between the informative and the imperative stimulus was analysed with respect to finger and hand of the present and the preceding movement. Results/Conclusions: (1) A change of the side of movement is associated with a widespread increase of negativity contralateral to the currently prepared movement. (2) A change of finger is associated with a focal increase of negativity contralateral to the side of the current movement over temporoparietal and mid-parietal areas. (3) A change of finger results in a widespread increase of negativity over the left hemisphere. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A fast fixed-point algorithm have been developed based on independent component analysis(ICA). The algorithm possesses the advantages of simple structure and fast computation. However, in some cases, many signals are not completely independent, the stability of the algorithm won't be as ideal as people have expected. Through, analysis based on information theory, we find that fixed step size in fast fixed-point algorithm is reason why the system did not converge steadily, that is, The negentropy J(W(n+1)(T)Z) of random vectors no longer monotonic increasing in the iterative process of separated vectors. We define a cost function DeltaJ=J(w(n+1) (T)Z)-J(w(n+1) (T)Z) And a time-variant step size mu(t), and put forward a algorithm of adjusting step size by the variety of the cost function in iterative process. Results from a series of simulation and experiments show that, single trial ERP extraction could be realized by these processing methods, and the stability and convergence of algorithm is improved.

A useful biomarker should meet the following requirements: a consistent response across studies and antipsychotics; a clear response of the biomarker to a therapeutic dose; a dose-response relationship; a plausible relationship between biomarker, pharmacology and pathogenesis. In the current review, all individual tests found in studies of neuroleptics in healthy volunteers since 1966 were progressively evaluated for compliance with these requirements. A MedLine search yielded 65 different studies, investigating the effects of 23 different neuroleptics on 101 different (variants of) neuropsychological tests, which could be clustered into seven neuropsychological domains. Subjective and objective measures of alertness, and of visual-visuomotor-auditory and motor skills were most sensitive to antipsychotics, although over half of all the studies failed to show statistically significant differences from placebo. The most consistent effects were observed using prolactin response and saccadic eye movements, where 96% and 83% of all studies resp. showed statistically significant effects. The prolactin inducing dose equivalencies relative to haloperidol of 19 different antipsychotic agents correlated with the lowest recommended daily maintenance dose (r(2)=0.52). This relationship could reflect the clinical practice of aiming for maximum tolerated levels, or it could represent a common basis behind prolactin release and antipsychotic activity (probably D-2-receptor antagonism). The number of tests used in human psychopharmacology appears to be excessive. Future studies should look for the most specific and sensitive test within each of the domains that are most susceptible to neuroleptics.

The approach is based on conceptually simple geometrical ideas and enables the convergence of pattern analysis and lion-linear time series analysis. Methods: Classical steps for analyzing the STs by waveform are first employed and the ST-analysis is transferred to a multidimensional space, the feature space, the geometry of which is systematically studied via multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques giving rise to semantic maps. The structure in the feature space characterizes the trial-to-trial variability and this is utilized to probe functional connectivity between two brain areas. The underlying dynamic process responsible for the emerged structure can be described by a multidimensional trajectory in the feature space. This in turn enables the detection of dynamical interareal coupling as similarity between the corresponding trajectories. Results and conclusions: The utility of semantic maps was demonstrated using magnetoencephalographic data from a simple auditory paradigm. The coupling of ongoing activity and evoked response is vividly demonstrated and contrasted with the apparent deflection from zero baseline that survives averaging. Prototypes are easily identified as the end points of distinct paths in the semantic map representation, and their neighborhood is populated by STs with distinct properties not only in the latencies where the evoked response is expected to be strong, but also and very significantly in the prestimulus period. Finally our results provide evidence for interhemispheric binding in the (4-8 Hz) range and dynamical coupling at faster time scales. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previously, we found lateralized presentations of a monosyllabic word to elicit posterior temporoparietal gamma-band activity, possibly reflecting synchronization of neuronal assemblies in putative auditory dorsal stream areas. In addition, beta activity was decreased over sensorimotor regions, suggesting the activation of motor networks involved in orientating. The present study investigated responses to lateralization changes of both a barking dog sound and a distorted noise to test whether beta desynchronization would depend on the sound's relevance for orientating. Eighteen adults listened passively to 900 samples of each sound in separate location mismatch paradigms with midline standards and both right- and left-lateralized deviants. Lateralized distorted noises were accompanied by enhanced spectral amplitude at 58-73 Hz over right temporo-parietal cortex. Left-lateralized barking dog sounds elicited right and right-lateralized sounds elicited bilateral temporo-parietal spectral amplitude increases at approximate to77 Hz. This replicated the involvement of posterior temporo-parietal areas in auditory spatial processing. Only barking dog sounds, but not distorted noises, gave rise to 30 Hz desynchronization over contralateral sensorimotor areas, parieto-frontal gamma coherence increases and beta coherence reductions between sensorimotor and prefrontal sensors. Apparently passive listening to lateralized natural sounds with a potential biological relevance led to an activation of motor networks involved in the automatic preparation for orientating. Parieto-frontal coherence increases may reflect enhanced coupling of networks involved in the integration of auditory spatial and motor processes.

Subjects were 12 healthy students who had slept for only 4 hours the night before being tested. They experienced both nap and no-nap conditions in a counterbalanced order, at least a week apart. The nap condition included a 15-min nap opportunity (12:30-12:45) in bed with polygraphic monitoring. We measured the P300 event-related potential, subjective sleepiness (Visual Analog Scale), and electrocardiogram (ECG) at 10:00, 13.15, and 16.15, and task performance (logical reasoning and digit span) at 10:00, 11:30, 13:15, 14:45, 16:15, and 17:45. Mean home sleep measured by actigraphy was 3.5 hours under both conditions. At 13:15, the P300 latency after the nap was significantly shorter than after no nap, but its amplitude was not affected by napping. Subjective sleepiness at 13:15 and 14:45 was significantly lower: and accuracy of logical reasoning at 13:15 was significantly higher after the nap than after no nap. No other performance measures or the ECG R-R interval variability parameters differed significantly between the nap and no-nap conditions. Mean total sleep time during the nap was 10.2 min, and no stage 3 and 4 sleep was observed. The above results suggest that under prior sleep deficit, a 15-min nap during post-lunch rest maintains subsequent alertness and performance, particularly in the mid-afternoon.

J	McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT				McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT			Electrophysiological evidence of intuition: Part 1. The surprising role of the heart	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							STIMULATION; INFORMATION; PSI	Objectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical papers (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a third paper (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception. Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of normal psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials and heartbeat-evoked potentials were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed. Results: The study's results are presented in two parts. The main findings in relation to the heart's role in intuitive perception presented here are: (1) surprisingly, the heart appears to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) a significantly greater heart rate deceleration occurred prior to future emotional stimuli compared to calm Stimuli; (3) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Part 2 will present results indicating where in the brain intuitive information is processed and data showing that prestimulus information from the heart is Communicated to the brain. It also presents evidence that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart. Conclusions: Overall, we have independently replicated and extended previous research documenting prestimulus responses. It appears that the heart is involved in the processing and decoding of intuitive information. Once the prestimulus information is received in the psychophysiologic systems, it appears to be processed in the same way as conventional sensory input. This Study presents compelling evidence that the body's perceptual apparatus is continuously scanning the future. To account for the results presented in Parts 1 and 2, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about future events is spectrally enfolded.

We examined the effect of a, single visual stimulus on the amplitude and phase of alpha waves using the complex demodulation method. The visual stimuli were generated by an LED mounted in goggles with the eyes-closed condition. The amplitude of the alpha wave decreased gradually after the stimulus, until it reached a minimum at around 300 ms after the stimulus. The alpha wave continued to increase, showing some rebound, and returning again to the pre-stimulus level. The phase variation after the stimulus tends to be considerably larger than that before the stimulus. Moreover, the average phase returned to the same slope as the pre-stimulus by 2550 ms after the stimulus. The visual stimulus has an effect on the alpha wave until about 2500 ms after the stimulus. The phase variation difference before and after stimulus is significant from 112 ms to 678 ms after the stimulus. This finding suggests there is a partially pararell time course between the change in VEPs plus ERP complex and the alpha wave.

Methods: Forty patients with schizophrenia and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were studied in a conventional auditory ERP oddball paradigm, We investigated sub-averaged Gamma activity based upon a simultaneous measure of electrodemal skin conductance response (phasic arousal) to differentiate novelty (large responses) from routinization (small or no responses). Both early Gamma (Gamma 1) and later induced Gamma (Gamma 2) activities were examined. Results: Patients with schizophrenia (compared with controls) had significantly reduced Gamma I amplitude in the right hemisphere for novelty processing and delayed Gamma 2 latency in the left hemisphere for both novelty and routinization. Overall, reduced Gamma I amplitude in patients with schizophrenia was also evident. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the normal laterality of Gamma activity is specifically disturbed in schizophrenia in response to novel, but not routine (familiar) stimuli. The distinct pattern of findings suggests a dysregulation of activation across left and right hemispheres during initial attention and preparatory phases of information processing, in particular, in patients with schizophrenia.

Gamma band oscillatory activity mediates in sensory and cognitive operations, with a role in stimulus-related cortical synchronization, but is reportedly reduced in the time window of the P300 response. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were studied. VEPs and P300 were obtained in a stimulus condition combining standard contrast stimulation and a visual odd-ball paradigm. Visual stimuli were gratings with a sinusoidal luminance profile (9.0 degrees central retina; 1.3 cycles/degree; 70% contrast) that were presented monocularly in onset/offset mode, with vertical orientation (frequent stimulus; 80%) or with a 15 degrees rotation to the right (infrequent, target stimulus). The total signal activity (temporal spectral evolution), the activity phase-locked to the stimulus onset (rectified integrated average), and the 'locking index' (ratio of the activity phase-locked to the stimulus to the total signal activity) were computed over time and across frequencies on the signals recorded at occipital (visual responses) and central locations (P300). Results: Oscillatory activity centered around similar to 20.0-35.0 Hz and phase-locked to the stimulus was recorded at occipital locations with time dynamics anticipating the conventional VEPs. Phase-locking was higher after frequent than in response to target stimuli and after the stimulus offset compared to onset, while the phase-locking of the VEP frequency components was higher after the stimulus onset. The low frequency components of the P300 recorded at Cz (below 8.0-10.0 Hz) were almost totally phase-locked to the stimulus, while the gamma band activity at the P300 location did not vary over time in amplitude or phase-locking and was mostly non-locked to the target stimulus. Conclusions: These observations add to the evidence of a role of the gamma band oscillatory responses (centered at similar to 20.0-35.0 Hz) in visual information processing and suggest that the increment in gamma band activity during cognitive operations also depends on task characteristics, vigilance or selective attention, and brain functional state. The visual P300 appears to reflect low frequency synchronization mechanisms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In first-episode patients, a similar left temporal P300 deficit is present in schizophrenia, but not in affective psychosis. The present study investigated whether the left temporal P300-left posterior STG volume association is selectively present in first-episode schizophrenia. Method: P300 was recorded as first-episode subjects with schizophrenia (n = 15) or affective psychosis (n = 18) or control subjects (n = 18) silently counted infrequent target tones amid standard tones. High-resolution spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition magnetic resonance images provided quantitative measures of temporal lobe gray matter regions of interest. Results: Patients with first-episode schizophrenia displayed a reversed P300 temporal area asymmetry (smaller on the left), while magnetic resonance imaging showed smaller gray matter volumes of left posterior STG relative to control subjects and patients with affective psychosis (15.4% and 11.0%, respectively), smaller gray matter volumes of left planum temporale (21.0% relative to both), and a smaller total Heschl's gyrus volume (14.6% and 21.1%, respectively). Left posterior STG and the left planum temporale, but not other regions of interest, were specifically and positively correlated (r>0.5) with left temporal P300 voltage in patients with schizophrenia but not in patients with affective psychosis or in control subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that the left temporal P300 abnormality specifically associated with left posterior STG gray matter volume reduction is present at the first hospitalization for schizophrenia but is not present at the first hospitalization for affective psychosis.

Methods: Ten male subjects slept in the laboratory for 6 consecutive nights. The first 2 nights were undisturbed. The 3rd night was considered as baseline. During the 4th and 5th nights, selective SWS deprivation was obtained by means of acoustic stimulation. The 6th night was a recovery. The data reported here were collected during the baseline and the recovery night. Subjects were awakened 3 times: after 2 h, 5 h (nocturnal awakenings) and 7.5 h (final morning awakening) of sleep, respectively. All the awakenings were carried out from stage 2. The AEP recordings were carried out in bed, while subjects were performing a simple auditory reaction time task. Results: The amplitude of the N1-P2 complex decreased upon the first awakening of the baseline night as compared to pre-sleep wakefulness levels; during the recovery night, the decrease of N1-P2 amplitude was present also upon the second and final awakening. N1 latency increased upon the two nocturnal awakenings regardless of the night, while P2 latency was not affected. Moreover, the N1-P2 amplitude increased during recovery at the frontal midline derivation as compared to baseline, while it decreased at Pz and Oz. Conclusions: The N1-P2 amplitude and, to a lesser extent, the N1 latency, are sensitive in showing a state of brain deactivation during the sleep-wake transition. The decrease of N1-P2 amplitude at the parieto-occipital locations during recovery is coherent with the hypothesis of a functional link between SWS amount and cortical hypoarousal upon awakening. The unexpected increase of the same variable at Fz can be interpreted as the effect of a compensatory effort of the frontal areas for the increased homeostatic drive for sleep during the recovery night.

This phenomenon is called "bilateral deficit". To identify the mechanisms subserving the bilateral deficit, brain electrical activity was examined, with a source derivation method, in 12 right-handed subjects, during the preparation and execution periods of a RT task. The responses were either unilateral or bilateral index finger flexion, performed either in a simple RT condition, with 20% catch trials, or in a choice RT condition. A deficit was observed in RT for the bilateral response for the right-index finger movement. In cerebral electrical activities, no evidence of a correlate of a bilateral deficit was found during the preparatory period. Conversely, during the execution period, an EEG correlate of the bilateral deficit was found. For the right hand, the activation of the sensorimotor area directly involved in the voluntary control was weaker for bilateral than for unilateral contralateral responses. The reasons for such a bilateral command weakness are discussed in the context of our RT task. First, the constraint of synchronisation included in the bilateral response might require an interhemispheric information transmission that resulted in a braking effect. Second, given that an ipsilateral inhibition is present in case of choice between the two hands of one particular unimanual response, and given that this ipsi lateral inhibition is also present in case of simple unimanual trials, we hypothesise that a mutual transcallosal inhibitory effect also persists in the bilateral response.

J	Kay, LM				Kay, LM			A challenge to chaotic itinerancy from brain dynamics	CHAOS			English	Article							LIMBIC THETA-RHYTHM; OLFACTORY-BULB; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; RAT; EEG; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; MODULATION; RABBITS	Brain hermeneutics and chaotic itinerancy proposed by Tsuda are attractive characterizations of perceptual dynamics in the mammalian olfactory system. This theory proposes that perception occurs at the interface between itinerant neural representation and interaction with the environment. Quantifiable application of these dynamics has been hampered by the lack of definable history and action processes which characterize the changes induced by behavioral state, attention, and learning. Local field potentials measured from several brain areas were used to characterize dynamic activity patterns for their use as representations of history and action processes. The signals were recorded from olfactory areas (olfactory bulb, OB, and pyriform cortex) and hippocampal areas (entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus, DG) in the brains of rats. During odor-guided behavior the system shows dynamics at three temporal scales. Short time-scale changes are system-wide and can occur in the space of a single sniff. They are predictable, associated with learned shifts in behavioral state and occur periodically on the scale of the intertrial interval. These changes occupy the theta (2-12 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), and gamma (40-100 Hz) frequency bands within and between all areas. Medium time-scale changes occur relatively unpredictably, manifesting in these data as alterations in connection strength between the OB and DG. These changes are strongly correlated with performance in associated trial blocks (5-10 min) and may be due to fluctuations in attention, mood, or amount of reward received. Long time-scale changes are likely related to learning or decline due to aging or disease. These may be modeled as slow monotonic processes that occur within or across days or even weeks or years. The folding of different time scales is proposed as a mechanism for chaotic itinerancy, represented by dynamic processes instead of static connection strengths. Thus, the individual maintains continuity of experience within the stability of fast periodic and slow monotonic processes, while medium scale events alter experience and performance dramatically but temporarily. These processes together with as yet to be determined action effects from motor system feedback are proposed as an instantiation of brain hermeneutics and chaotic itinerancy.

[Science 280 (1998) 747] demonstrated that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) detects conditions in which errors are likely to occur. Kirino and Belger [E. Kirino, A. Belger, fMRI and ERP evidence of prefrontal cortex mediation of novelty bias and distractibility in schizophrenia, in: K. Hirata, Y. Koga, K. Nagata, K. Yamazaki (Eds.), Recent Advances in Human Brain Mapping, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2002, pp. 691 -696.] further observed aberrant prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during a visual oddball paradigm containing task-irrelevant distracters in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that schizophrenics show distorted PFC and ACC activation during response competition. We imaged patients and controls performing variants of Continuous Performance Test (CPT) that were designed to increase error rates and manipulate response competition. Subjects made a response whenever the probe was an X proceeded by a cue A, and to make a nontarget response to all other stimuli (AY, BX and BY). When targets (AX) occurred with 70% frequency, AY and BX were previously reported to elicit higher levels of response competition than BY (1998). Event-related design for the functional MRI (fMRI) experiment was employed with AX (p = 86%) as baseline response and AY, BX, and BY (p = 4.7% for each) as event stimuli. Echo Planner images were acquired on a 1.5-T MR system. Schizophrenics showed attenuated activation in PFC and ACC under condition that elicits response competition. These findings might indicate that they are less sensitive to override prepotent responses. Schizophrenics' deficits in working memory might be attributed to the deteriorated central executive system, which involved response competition, rather than slave systems in the working memory model of Baddeley [Science 255 (1992) 556].

Tasks conducted within a laboratory environment often lack a strong resemblance with real life working situations. This paper presents an experimental approach to minimizing this gap by designing a very flexible experimentation system with adequate hardware and software components. The first goal of the system is to design a laboratory based environment in which a broad range of computer supported daily life work can be simulated, including co-operative working situations. Moreover, several behavioral and physiological measurement and analysis techniques are supported, such as video based behavioral analysis, task related event registration, cardiovascular state analysis, determining mental workload indices as well as EEG background and ERP analysis. An important requirement for relating the different measured variables to task performance is synchronization of data sources and task parameters at varying time scales. The highest time accuracy should be at least 10 milliseconds. The present system fulfils this requirement by using software system components and libraries that allow real time experiment control and measurement. Additionally, the new system should work within a Microsoft Windows based environment, providing the possibility to use standard office software that is well known to subjects having to work in the new environment. The option to use such standard software, in combination with new (simulation) techniques for presenting more realistic tasks, results in a powerful laboratory environment in which task elements in semi-realistic tasks can be manipulated experimentally. The way to do this is by defining adequate scenarios that can be simulated. At present, is that both a simple, less realistic task has been realized (Synwork) with a high time accuracy (1 ms), as well as a more realistic simulation of an ambulance dispatcher task with lower time accuracy (10-100 ms). Both types of task can be seen as examples of the range of tasks to be implemented in the near future.
