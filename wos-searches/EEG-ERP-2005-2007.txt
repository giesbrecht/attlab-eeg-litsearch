Single-trial topographic analysis of human EEG: A new 'image' of event-related potentials	2007 6TH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL TOPIC CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Special Topic Conference on Information Technology Applications in Biomedicine	NOV 08-10, 2007	Tokyo, JAPAN	IEEE		electroencephalography; event related potential; single trial; segmentation	COMPONENTS; SEGMENTATION; COGNITION; DYNAMICS	We present a novel approach for analyzing single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) data, using topographic information. The method allows for visualizing event-related potentials using all the electrodes of recordings overcoming the problem of previous approaches that required electrode selection and waveforms filtering. We apply this method to EEG data from an auditory object recognition experiment that we have previously analyzed at an ERP level. Temporally structured periods were statistically identified wherein a given topography predominated without any prior information about the temporal behavior. In addition to providing novel methods for EEG analysis, the data indicate that ERPs are reliably observable at a single-trial level when examined topographically.

The main source of the noise is the spontaneous brain activity and it is called the background Electroencephalography (EEG). Because EEG is highly colored, we wouldn't effectively remove EEG noise by wavelet transform. This paper proposed a new approach that combined the subspace method and lift wavelet transform in order to reduce the number of trials required for the extraction of the brain Event Related Potentials. First, the signal subspace is estimated by applying the singular value decomposition (SVD). Orthonormal projecting the raw data onto the estimated signal subspace can obtain a pre-denoised signal and it whitened the colored noise. Next, the ERPs are extracted by lift wavelet construction of the enhanced version. Simulation results show that the combination of both two methods provides much better capability than each of them separately.

In this paper, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in hearing subjects to evaluate whether auditory cortex comes to serve the visual modality after visual/auditory training. In the perceptual feedback training, the hearing subjects were trained to relate certain visual sources to particular sound sources. In the results, we found that visual activity was observed in the auditory cortex when only the visual stimuli were given to the subjects and feedback training improved the subjects' ability to associate visual actions with particular sound sources.

But ICA analysis of ERP has the problem that it lacks validity across subjects. Therefore, we examined a new approach to give validity across subjects to ICA results obtained from single subjects. To do this, we combined two criteria of how much a single subject's signals contain task-related components and the similarity, of the spatial patterns of those task-related components across subjects. We applied our approach to EEG data recorded in an experiment. As a result, analysis with a combination of ICA and our approach extracted significantly more task-related components from the observed signals than analysis without the combination did, although both analyses suggested that the occipital area activity was most relevant to performing the task across subjects. These results suggest that our approach is useful for extracting task-related components from the observed EEG signals and for giving validity across subjects in ICA analysis of EEG/ERP.

Entropy changes in brain function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; epilepsy; wavelet analysis; signal entropy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INFORMATIONAL TOOLS; WAVELET ENTROPY; TRANSIENT DOMINANCE; EEG-ANALYSIS	The traditional way of analyzing brain electrical activity, on the basis of electroencephalography (EEG) records, relies mainly on visual inspection and years of training. Although it is quite useful, of course, one has to acknowledge its subjective nature that hardly allows for a systematic protocol. In the present work quantifiers based on information theory and wavelet transform are reviewed. The "relative wavelet energy" provides information about the relative energy associated with different frequency bands present in the EEG and their corresponding degree of importance. The "normalized total wavelet entropy" carries information about the degree of order-disorder associated with a multifrequency signal response. Their application in the analysis and quantification of short duration EEG signals (event-related potentials) and epileptic EEG records are summarized. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study introduces a new method for filtering the P300, an ERP component evoked by performing a given cognitive task, in this case, a two-choice reaction time task. The method employed latency correction of the ERPs in the time domain, followed by noise-masking in the wavelet domain. With this filtering method, the P300 component was accurately localized in both time and scale. Wilcoxon tests verified the statistical significance of P300 peak amplitude differences (p<0.0003) between two age groups (old and young).	[Markazi, Seyedehmina Ayoubian; Stergioulas, Larnpros.

Continuous electroencephalography was recorded both on and off dexamphetamine during performance on a Stroop task. An age-, gender- and IQ-matched control also completed the same task. Event related potentials for the control participant revealed a positive potential to incongruent stimuli between 270 and 440 ms, whereas for the participant with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder off medication, the reverse polarity was observed in a later time window. Following administration of dexamphetamine, however, the event-related potentials for the incongruent condition closely resembled those in the control, suggesting that dexamphetamine successfully normalises electroencephalographic activity.

The discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies wavelet is employed to detect the presence of P300 in individual trials. Wavelet filtering is applied to remove noise and unwanted frequency components from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients based on prior knowledge of event-related potentials (ERPs). The filtering mask is computed from the grand-average of wavelet coefficients over all participants. With this filtering, the P300 component is accurately localized in both time and scale.

Thus to design a system capable of learning a particular mapping between EEG features and different attention-level mental tasks is of great significance. Event Related Potentials (ERP) is such a powerful feature which is traditionally extracted by averaging. The paper proposed a new ERP extraction algorithm using radial basis function (RBF) neural network. It discussed the configuration, learning and running of the designed network. In order to reduce computational complexity and the influence of noise in estimating ERP, the partial least square regression was introduced to train the RBF network. Series experiments showed that the method is effective and is suitable for single-trail ERP estimation.

Working memory load-related electroencephalographic parameters can differentiate progressive from stable mild cognitive impairment	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; event-related potential; event-related desynchronization/synchronization; mild cognitive impairment; working memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LONGITUDINAL CHANGES; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; FOLLOW-UP; ACTIVATION; TASK; DYNAMICS	Recent studies described several changes of endogenous event-related potentials (ERP) and brain rhythm synchronization during memory activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Periodically interrupting the presentation sizably modulates the spontaneous reversal rate. We here studied event-related potential (ERP) correlates of the neural processes underlying these strong modulations. An ambiguous Necker stimulus was presented discontinuously with four randomly varying interstimulus intervals (ISI; 14, 43, 130, 390 ms) while participants indicated perceptual reversals. EEG was selectively averaged with respect to the participants' percept and ISI. ERP traces varied markedly between ISIs. A simple model explained a major part of this variation and showed that the ISI-dependent ERP modulation occurs after disambiguation has already taken place. We suggest that perceptual stability (or reversal) depends on a system state, slowly changing from one reversal to the next. ISI can shift this state on a scale between stability and instability.

While both types of sources are likely to contribute significantly to EEG and ERP signals, each method adopts only one of these models and thus may localize the sources of other type incorrectly or not find them at all. Recently introduced Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and more general approach, Blind Source Separation (BSS), make possible the separation of signals from various brain and extra-brain (related to artifacts) sources and can be used as preprocessing technique before applying the localizing algorithms. We suggest using this preprocessing step for combining different localization methods. A brain source, if extracted correctly, can be analyzed separately from the other sources, and thus, the most appropriate localization technique can be chosen for each source. Distributed sources are likely to be localized more precisely without detailed separation but after BSS "cleaning" data from strong localized sources. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We used a Virtual Reality driving simulator consisted of a hydraulic hexapod motion platform to create practical driving events. We compared the EEG dynamics in response to kinesthetic stimulus while the platform was in motion, to that while the platform was stationary. The scalp-recorded EEG channel signals were first separated into independent brain sources using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and then studied with time-frequency analysis. Our results showed that independent brain processes near the somatomotor cortex exhibited alpha power decreases across sessions and subjects. Negative potentials phase-locked to the onsets of deviation events under motion conditions were observed in a central midline component. The results allow us to better understand different brain networks involved in driving, and provide a foundation for studying event-related EEG activities in the presence of kinesthetic stimuli.

By observing ERP's, we estimate recalled words, phrases, or sentences that may contain some homonyms or related words. In particular, we pay attention to the difference between ERP's caused by recalling a single syllable individually without other syllables and ERP's caused by recalling a syllable together with a word containing the syllable. From our observation of this difference, we believe that it may be useful to discuss the possibility of estimating a recalled word by combining ERPs caused by syllables.

The intent was to determine how these measurements are related, and to what extent the ERPs might represent phase-locked changes in EEG rhythms. The experimental manipulations were the stimulus modality (auditory or visual), the discriminability of the target, and the presence or absence of distraction. The ERPs showed sensory-evoked potentials that were specific to the modality and a target-evoked P300 wave that was later in the visual modality than in the auditory, and later and smaller when the discrimination was more difficult. The averaged EEG spectrograms showed that targets increased the frontal theta activity, decreased posterior and central alpha and beta activity, and decreased the central gamma activity. The scalp topography of the changes in the alpha and beta activity indicated a posterior desynchronization specific for the visual task and occurring with both targets and standards and a more widespread desynchronization for targets in either modality. Increased phase synchronization occurred during the event-related potentials, but modeling demonstrated that this can be seen when an evoked potential waveform is simply added to the background EEG. However, subtracting the spectrogram of the average ERP from the average spectrogram of the single trials indicated that phase-resetting of the background EEG rhythms can occur during the ERP. The idea that the ERPs and the EEG rhythms "share generators" can explain these findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The areas were identified in a previous study of the same data set using event-related potentials (ERP). Chains of closely spaced (similar to 2 cm) scalp electrodes covering these areas were selected for phase synchronization analysis in which task and control conditions were compared. Phase synchronization spreading in the task condition at 20 Hz reached a maximum about 180 ms post-stimulus in the right occipital area. This maximum coincides with the attention-related negative peak N180 in the corresponding ERP study. Intervals of evoked phase synchronization were longer in the task than in control condition. It was concluded that attention-related modulation of evoked activity is reflected not only in enhanced amplitude of low-frequency ERP, but also in phase synchronization of high-frequency ongoing rhythms in local brain areas.

Optimisation of a post-processing method to remove the pulse artifact from EEG data recorded during fMRI: An application to P300 recordings during e-fMRI	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						simultaneous EEG/e-fMRI; cardiac pulse artifact (PA); ballistocardiogram artifact; event-related potential; P300	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INTERLEAVED EEG; MAGNETIC-FIELD; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ACQUISITION; ERP; FEASIBILITY; RESTORATION	In functional cerebral studies, it has been established that co-registered electroencephalography (EEG) measurements and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were complementary. However, EEG data recorded inside an MRI scanner are heavily distorted, mainly by the most prominent artifact, the cardiac pulse artifact (PA). We describe an original algorithm which yields a high-quality PA filter and demonstrates how this tool can be used to improve the quality of P300 ERP measurements during event-related fMRI (e-fMRI) experiments. EEG data were acquired in interleaved mode during e-fMRI while six healthy volunteers performed a visual odd-ball task, involving Distractors, Target and Novel stimuli, to elicit P300 components. The PA was corrected with the original algorithm. The temporal variations in the PA were evidenced using a principal component analysis (PCA), on each EEG channel. The procedure yielded several PA templates, which were regressed from the EEG data. The PA removal procedure was optimised, and then implemented to improve the measured P300 components. Regressing the most adequate PA template resulted in a high-quality reduction in spectral power at frequencies associated with the cardiac PA. More reliable P300 component measurements were obtained, evidencing higher amplitudes for Novels (9.76-11.20 mu V) than for to Targets (6.3-9.09 mu V) in centro-parietal and prefrontal areas. The improvement of the processing of EEG data acquired simultaneously with fMRI data provides a new tool and casts perspectives to study the functional organisation of the brain.

VF initially caused a considerable suppression and slowing of the EEG. The recovery of cerebral function was evaluated by recording both EEG and auditory event related potentials (ERPs). Six hours after the episode of VF, when the patient was asleep but arousable to voice command, the N100 component of the auditory ERPs had recovered to the level measured before the operation, whereas the EEG was still very slow for that level of sedation. This may have been due to VF having less effect on the N100 component than on the background EEG. Our findings suggest that measuring evoked potentials may improve the evaluation of brain function after cardiac arrest.

The validity of the evoked model has been questioned by studies arguing that ERPs are generated at least in part by a reset of ongoing oscillations. But a proof of phase reset that is distinct from the 'artificial' influence of evoked components on EEG phase-has been proven difficult for a variety of methodological reasons. We argue that a theoretical analysis of the assumptions and empirical evaluation of predictions of the evoked and oscillatory ERP model offer a promising way to shed new light on mechanisms generating ERPs that goes well beyond attempts to prove phase reset. Research on EEG oscillations documents that oscillations are task relevant and show a common operating principle, which is the control of the timing of neural activity. Both findings suggest that phase reorganization of task relevant oscillations is a theoretical necessity. We further argue and show evidence that (i) task relevant oscillations exhibit a typical interactive and task relevant relationship between pre- and poststimulus power in the theta and alpha frequency range in a way that small prestimulus power is related to large poststimulus power and vice versa, (ii) ERP (interpeak) latencies and (iii) ERP amplitudes reflect frequency characteristics of alpha and theta oscillations. We emphasize that central assumptions of the evoked model cannot be substantiated and conclude that the ERPR model offers a new way for an integrative interpretation of ongoing and event-related EEG phenomena.

J	Becker, K; Holtmann, M				Becker, Katja; Holtmann, Martin			Role of electroencephalography in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder	EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS			English	Review						adolescents; attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; children; diagnostics; electroencephalography; event-related potentials		Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and affects 3-5% of school-aged children. Recommendations regarding the relative importance of electroencephalography (EEG) in ADHD are ambiguous. Most guidelines for ADHD diagnostics only recommend an EEG in cases with clinical suggestion of seizure disorders or degenerative conditions and not for routine use. Although in most cases of ADHD, an EEG is indeed unnecessary, without a routine EEG, some children with absences or rolandic spikes will not be identified and, therefore, will not be treated correctly. The EEGs of children with ADHD demonstrated increased theta activity and fewer alpha waves compared with controls. Research on event-related potentials is helpful in identifying underlying attentional deficits in ADHD. Future studies that combine EEG analysis with functional magnetic resonance imaging data, positron emission tomography studies or genetic research will help to improve our knowledge about the pathophysiology of ADHD and perhaps lead to a better, more individual treatment in well defined subgroups.

Flexibility in spatial and non-spatial feature grouping: an event-related potentials study. Brain Res Cogn Brain Res 2004;22:13-25] were re-analyzed to identify event-related dynamics of phase-synchronization. Methods: In 20 Hz activity, uniform spreading of phase synchronization in closely spaced (similar to 2 cm) scalp electrodes appears and disappears spontaneously. The lengths of synchronized activity intervals and how they vary as a function of stimulus presentation were compared between task and control conditions. Results: Synchronization reached a maximum in the task condition about 180 ms post-stimulus onset, coinciding with the peak N180 ERP marking the deployment of task-specific attention. Synchronized intervals were longer in the task than in the control condition. Long (above 80 ms) intervals occurred at a stable rate before and just after stimulus onset, but steeply decreased 200-400 ms afterwards. Conclusions: Perceptual tasks lead to longer synchronized intervals in early visual areas. Attention deployment resets the ongoing synchronization. Event-related activity, besides low-frequency ERP, consists of high-frequency short and long synchronized intervals corresponding to evoked bursts and ongoing oscillations, respectively. Significance: High-density scalp recorded EEG revealed synchronization dynamics in a local, early visual area of cortex that can be interpreted as modulation of spontaneous ongoing task-related processes by attention.

We aim to evaluate the usability of information appliances that interact with users. In addition to traditional usability testing, it is necessary to consider the user's mental state, that is, how users understand and predict an appliance's response. Two serial psychophysiological experiments were conducted to confirm whether the EEG signals obtained from a user reflect the cognitive mismatch that occurs when a user's expectations conflict with the actual response. We focused on the event-related brain potential (ERP) components measured by EEG, and we identified a positive ERP component with a peak latency of 550-600ms as an indicator of cognitive mismatch. These results suggest that the ERP component might reflect a user's mental status. By combining signals with behavioural observations, we can realize detailed evaluations that will improve product design.

We use examples from an audiovisual attention-shifting task performed by young and old subjects to illustrate the power of ICA to resolve subtle differences between evoked responses in the two age groups. Preliminary analysis of these data using ICA suggests a loss of task specificity in independent component (IC) processes in frontal and somatomotor cortex during post-response periods in older as compared to younger subjects, trends not detected during examination of scalp-channel event-related potential (ERP) averages. We discuss possible approaches to component clustering across subjects and new ways to visualize mean and trial-by-trial variations in the data, including ERP-image plots of dynamics within and across trials as well as plots of event-related spectral perturbations in component power, phase locking, and coherence. We believe that widespread application of these and related analysis methods should bring EEG once again to the forefront of brain imaging, merging its high time and frequency resolution with enhanced cm-scale spatial resolution of its cortical sources.

Although recent work has identified brain areas that respond to multimodal stimuli, the temporal features are not clear yet. Earlier event-related potential studies revealed crossmodal attention effects, but did not focus on mechanisms underlying crossmodal integration. Here, electroencephalography (EEG) activity in the gamma band was considered as a correlate of multimodal integration. Participants localized a tactile stimulus on their fingers while seeing visual stimuli on rubber hands with the same posture as their hands. EEG analyses using wavelet transform suggested that interelectrode phase synchrony in the gamma-band range (40-50 Hz) was related to behavioral indices of the intermodal illusion under consideration. The findings suggest a role of high-frequency oscillations in the integrative processing of stimuli across modalities.

Event-related potentials during an auditory oddball paradigm and QEEG in resting state were recorded. Patients exhibited attenuation of P300 amplitudes compared with controls during dissociative episodes, but exhibited recovery to control levels in remission. Patients had a larger Sylvian fissure-brain ratio than did controls. QEEG findings revealed no significant differences between the patients and controls or between episodes and remission in the patient group. Attenuation of the P300 can be interpreted as the result of a negative feedback loop from the medial temporal lobe to the cortex, which decreases the amount of information flow, allocation of attentional resources, and updating of working memory to avoid both excessive long-term memory system activity in medial temporal lobe and resurgence of affect-laden memories.

EEG and fMRI are the two crucial modalities which reflect the functional activity inside the brain. EEG is easy to apply and provides high temporal resolution but has poor spatial resolution. Contrarily, fMRI has a higher spatial resolution while having a poor temporal resolution. In this study, multi modal data sets obtained from Event Related fMRI and EEG measurements are analyzed using SPM and LORETA based dipole source reconstruction techniques, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the generator of N170 component of ERP which is located at superior temporal region is in agreement with the SPM results of fMRI. The results imply that the joint use of fMRI and ERP data helps identifying the physiological and hemodynamic correlates of face recognition by estimating the underlying functional activity in a fine temporal and spatial resolution.

Therefore, it is very hard to apply the event-related potential (ERP) to assessment of sensation and attention at clinical fields or at industrial settings. We developed a system to analyze the brain potential associated with offset of saccadic eye movements. The potential is called eye fixation-related potential (EFRP). EFRP is identical with the so-called visual ERR We can measure the topographical change of EFRP in real time. The first system with a UNIX (Version 1) was very fast, but very expensive. However, the new system (Version 2) is more economical, because it can be used in a notebook computer with Windows XP. EEG and EOG data can be sampled in real time, although the data are analyzed offline. The new system will be useful to study cognitive factors under eye movement conditions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Chinese and German musicians performed a cultural categorization task under Chinese and Western music listening conditions. Western music was the major subject for both groups of musicians, while Chinese music was familiar to Chinese subjects only. By manipulating the presence of pauses between two phrases in the biphrasal melodies, EEG correlates for the perception of phrase boundaries were found in both groups under both music listening conditions. Between 450 and 600 ms, the music CPS (closure positive shift), which had been found in earlier studies with a false tone detection task, was replicated for the more global categorization task and for all combinations of subject group and musical style. At short latencies (100 and 450 ms post phrase boundary offset), EEG correlates varied as a function of musical styles and subject group. Both bottom-up (style properties of the music) and top-down (acculturation of the subjects) information interacted during this early processing stage. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impulsiveness was determined by calculating individual reaction times (as a function of general response speed) in order to split the entire group into two subgroups with a more controlled (n = 16) and less controlled (n = 16) response style. Participants performed a Go/Nogo task while a 64 channel EEG was recorded. Artifact-free EEG segments were used to compute ERPs on correct Go trials and incorrect Nogo trials, separately. Three ERP components were of special interest: the error-related negativity (ERN)/error negativity (Ne) and the "early" error positivity (Pe) reflecting automatic error processing and the "late" error positivity (Pe) which is thought to mirror the awareness of erroneous responses. Subjects with higher impulsiveness showed smaller amplitudes than subjects with lower impulsiveness for the ERN/Ne component and the "early" Pe component. With regard to the "late" Pe groups did not differ. Hence, ERP measures appear suitable for detailed analyses of impulsiveness in healthy participants. Moreover, present results argue for the necessity of careful control of impulsiveness when including normal comparison groups in the context of clinical studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

ERP old/new effects were obtained in two distinct source-memory tasks. Functionally related EEG power and phase locking effects were found in the delta and theta frequency range. A late posterior negativity (LPN) was larger for old than new responses irrespective of source accuracy. It was also larger when participants were required to judge how they had previously interacted with a recognized picture as compared to judging its study location. This result is consistent with the view that the LPN reflects processes in the service of reconstructing previous episodes by integrating recognized items with task-relevant contextual attributes, and that LPN amplitude is related to the amount of contextual features available for forming such an integrated representation. Phase locking of ongoing delta and theta activity (but not EEG power) was functionally equivalent to LPN amplitude modulations, suggesting that stimulus-induced concentration of delta and theta phases without stimulus-induced power changes may be the neural mechanism of LPN generation. In addition, sustained enhancements of phase-locking precision in the theta range were observed for erroneous and delayed source judgments, suggesting that theta-phase locking is related to the coordination of multiple cortical assemblies in highly demanding task situations.

We analyzed data of a visual feature detection task and will show 1) phase concentration in the alpha frequency range, 2) ongoing alpha activity prior to stimulus onset, 3) evoked alpha oscillation in the ERP, 4) lack of power increase during phase concentration, 5) decrease in amplitude variance during early evoked components preceding a decrease in power, and 6) the same cortical sources for induced prestimulus power and evoked poststimulus power. Because none of these data provide unequivocal evidence for phase reset, we additionally tested the basic assumption of the evoked model, which is the additivity of the evoked response an the basis of a simulation approach. Our findings suggest that nonadditive processes-typical for a phase reset-are involved in the generation of the ERP. Thus, together with the other findings this study provides unequivocal evidence for phase resetting in the human EEG.

Cross-modal attention capture by affective stimuli: Evidence from event-related potentials	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; BRAIN; P300; EEG; ERP; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; RESPONSES; STARTLE; TARGET	The P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) to an acoustic startle probe is modulated during picture viewing, with reduced P3 amplitude when participants view either pleasant or unpleasant, as opposed to neutral, pictures. We have interpreted this as reflecting capture of attentional resources by affective pictures, with fewer resources available for processing the secondary startle probe. In the present study, we tested this resource allocation hypothesis by presenting either pictures or sounds as foreground stimuli, with the prediction that P3 amplitude in response to secondary startle probes would be reduced for affectively engaging foregrounds regardless of modality Using dense-array electroencephalography and a source estimation procedure, we observed that P3 amplitude was indeed smaller when startle probes were presented during emotional, as opposed to neutral, stimuli for both sound and picture foregrounds. Source modeling indicated a common frontocentral maximum of P3 modulation by affect. The data support the notion that emotionally arousing stimuli transmodally attract resources, leading to optimized processing of the affective stimuli at the cost of the processing of concurrent stimuli.

Methods: This study focused on the operation of three recently-reported phase-influenced mechanisms, and ERP responses to the standard stimuli were analysed. Prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1 Hz bands from 1 to 13 Hz) at Cz was assessed for each trial using digital filtering. For each frequency, the cycle at stimulus onset was used to sort trials into four phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz and Pz. Results: Preferred brain states at various frequencies were indicated by approximately 20% differential occurrence within the orthogonal phase dimensions explored. Conclusions: The preferred states were associated with more efficient processing of the stimulus, as reflected in differences in latency and/or amplitude of various ERP components, and provided evidence for the operation of the three separate phase-influenced mechanisms. Significance: Both the occurrence of preferred brain states, and the mechanisms linking them to ERP outcomes focused on here, appeared relatively invariant across tasks, suggesting that they largely reflect reflexive brain processes.

Two-person games with dominant strategies can be treated as simple decision problems that involve no assessment of one's partner. By contrast, two-person games with mixed strategies require that one think about one's partner. We measure differences in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity while a human subject is playing two-person games. We time-lock the EEG to a common event and use the average across many trials and subjects to find an Event Related Potential (ERP) associated with the common event. The ERP is the brain's response to events-in this case our different games. Our findings lend modest support for the idea that subjects respond to types of games differently.

J	Praamstra, P				Praamstra, P			Prior information of stimulus location: Effects on ERP measures of visual selection and response selection	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						spatial attention; premotor cortex; electroencephalography; event-related potential	PREMOTOR CORTEX; ATTENTION; MOTOR; EEG; ACTIVATION; SEARCH; TASK	This paper examines the effects of prior information of the location of an upcoming stimulus on event-related EEG potentials associated with the focusing of attention. Results of two tasks, reported in a previous publication (Praamstra, P., Boutsen, L., Humphreys, G.W., 2005. Frontoparietal control of spatial attention and motor intention in human EEG. J. Neurophysiol. 94, 764-774), were compared: one in which spatial attention was cued to the stimulus location and one in which the cue was non-informative. Only informative directional cues elicited directing-attention EEG potentials in the delay period between cue and target. Notwithstanding these electrophysiological signs of an attentional orientation prior to the occurrence of the target, there were no reaction time effects related to the presence of advance spatial information. By contrast, the advance information did have effects on EEG potentials following the target stimulus. The N2pc, reflecting an attentional selection mechanism in extrastriate cortex, was reduced in amplitude with advance spatial information. The N2cc, coinciding in time with the N2pc but measured over the motor cortex, was preempted by the advance spatial information. These results support that the N2cc is not due to overlap of the N2pc with movement execution-related activity. It is proposed that the neural activity underlying this EEG potential arises from the dorsal premotor cortex and serves an executive-attentional function that helps to ensure that the selection of a manual response is not biased by the direction of spatial attention.

The goal of this study was to analyze electrophysiological, motor, cognitive and behavioral changes produced by caffeine ingestion after sleep deprivation. Ten subjects were evaluated after sleep deprivation, comparing the ingestion of either 400 mg of caffeine or placebo, in a double-blind randomized study. The variables analyzed were: quantitative EEG, the event-related potential (ERP-P300) and cognitive responses. The most significant quantitative EEG results, which were characterized by moment x treatment interactions, were seen in alpha and theta relative power variables. A significant decrease in relative alpha and theta was observed in the caffeine group after sleep deprivation. In relation to caffeine stimulant effects, there were no significant differences in the other parameters. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Little is known about the effects of the fMRI environment on the time-course and topography of previously documented ERP effects. We examined the replicability of ER-P differences in the scanner at the level of individual subjects, using two cognitive paradigms and two statistical procedures. ERP P3 differences found outside the scanner in both paradigms were also robustly detected in the ERPs acquired during fMRI scanning. These P3 effects had equivalent time-courses and scalp topographies inside and outside the scanner. This replication at the level of individual data-sets has implications for the clinical applicability of ERP-fMRI and, more generally, for the quality of scanner recorded ERPs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An inverse relation between event-related and time-frequency violation responses in sentence processing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cognitive and behavioral; neuroscience; N400; P600; semantic; grammatical; sentence processing; time-frequency analysis	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; THETA-RESPONSES; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY; BAND; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INCREASES	The relationship between semantic and grammatical processing in sentence comprehension was investigated by examining event-related potential (ERP) and event-related power changes in response to semantic and grammatical violations. Sentences with semantic, phrase structure, or number violations and matched controls were presented serially (1.25 words/s) to 20 participants while EEG was recorded. Semantic violations were associated with an N400 effect and a theta band increase in power, while grammatical violations were associated with a P600 effect and an alpha/beta band decrease in power. A quartile analysis showed that for both types of violations, larger average violation effects were associated with lower relative amplitudes of oscillatory activity, implying an inverse relation between ERP amplitude and event-related power magnitude change in sentence processing.

Complete artifact removal for EEG recorded during continuous fMRI using independent component analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; independent component analysis; artifact removal; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ICA; ACTIVATION	The simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI is a promising method for combining the electrophysiological and hemodynamic information on cerebral dynamics. However, EEG recordings performed in the MRI scanner are contaminated by imaging, ballistocardiographic (BCG) and ocular artifacts. A number of processing techniques for the cancellation of fMRI environment disturbances exist: the most popular is averaged artifact subtraction (AAS), which performs well for the imaging artifact, but has some limitations in removing the BCG artifact, due to the variability in cardiac wave duration and shape; furthermore, no processing method to attenuate ocular artifact is currently used in EEG/fMRI, and contaminated epochs are simply rejected before signal analysis. In this work, we present a comprehensive method based on independent component analysis (ICA) for simultaneously removing BCG and ocular artifacts from the EEG recordings, as well as residual MRI contamination left by AAS. The ICA method has been tested on event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from a visual oddball paradigm: it is very effective in attenuating artifacts in order to reconstruct clear brain signals from EEG acquired in the MRI scanner. It performs significantly better than the AAS method in removing the BCG artifact. Furthermore, since ocular artifacts can be completely suppressed, a larger number of trials is available for analysis. A comparison of ERPs inside the magnetic environment with those obtained out of the MRI scanner confirms that no systematic bias in the ERP waveform is produced by the ICA method.

In this study, we apply independent component analysis (ICA) to eye blinking artifact removal from cognitive EEG recordings. Due to the specific design of the experiment, the eye blinks almost always co-occur with the event-related potentials (ERP), which creates problems for ICA. We introduced another data set of spontaneous blink and combined it with single-trial ERP data. Our results show that ICA on the combined data set gives separation that makes more sense and makes it easier for EEG interpretation and analysis.

However, the direct relationship between neural and hemodynamic activity is still poorly understood. Of particular interest is the spatial correspondence between event-related potential (ERP) and fMRI sources. In the current study we localized sources generated by a checkerboard stimulus presented to eight subjects using both EEG and fMRI. The location of the sources of the visual evoked potential (VEP) were estimated at each timepoint and compared to the location of peak fMRI activity. In the majority of participants we found that the N75 dipole location coincides with a region of positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation and the P100 dipole location coincides with a region of negative BOLD activation. These findings demonstrate the importance of including the negative BOLD response in combined EEG/fMRI studies.

In addition, two calculating methods, mean of entropy for each trial (Mean of ApEn) and entropy for averaged ERP (ApEn of ERP), were validated and compared through an investigation of EEG complexity in a Chinese Stroop task containing two types of stimulus. Two phenomena can be observed from the experiment: 1. In contrast to the ApEn before stimulus, ApEn from two types of tasks decreased remarkably after the presence of stimulus, reached a minimum corresponding to the response output and rose back after response over frontal, central, and parietal regions. 2. ApEn of ERP had significant difference among three periods: pre-stimulus, within-response, and post-response, while Mean of ApEn did not. It is demonstrated that time-dependent approximate entropy is an effective method to measure the dynamic complexity of cognitive ERPs.

Modifications in the Human EEG during Extralong Physical Activity	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials; event-related desynchronization; N200; P300; alpha rhythm; physical exercise; ultramarathon		In a single-case study, the effects of very long-lasting physical exercise, namely a 24-h-long ultramarathon, on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) were evaluated. While only effects of relatively short exercise have been reported earlier, we focused on the changes induced by these long-lasting physical requires. EEG was recorded repeatedly using an auditory oddball paradigm, and event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as changes in the current oscillatory brain activity (in particular, event-related desynchronization, ERD), were repeatedly monitored. While an increase in several attention-related ERP parameters was reported for shorter exercises, the results of our study show that cognitive performance-related EEG phenomena slowly decreased throughout the race. The P300 amplitude decreased, and the P300 latency increased with ongoing exercise duration. In addition, the difference between standard and target tones at N200b, as well as the difference in the lower alpha ERD, decreased with time, indicating a reduced automatic stimulus evaluation.

Electroencephalographic measures indicate an overall slowing subsequent to meditation, with theta and alpha activation related to proficiency of practice. Sensory evoked potential assessment of concentrative meditation yields amplitude and latency changes for some components and practices. Cognitive event-related potential evaluation of meditation implies that practice changes attentional allocation. Neuroimaging studies indicate increased regional cerebral blood flow measures during meditation. Taken together, meditation appears to reflect changes in anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal areas. Neurophysiological meditative state and trait effects are variable but are beginning to demonstrate consistent outcomes for research and clinical applications. Psychological and clinical effects of meditation are summarized, integrated, and discussed with respect to neuroimaging data.

In this article we present a refined notion of RQA based on order patterns. The use of order patterns is commonplace in time series analysis. Exploiting this concept in combination with recurrence plots (RP) and their quantification (RQA) allows for advances in contemporary EEG research, specifically in the analysis of event related potentials (ERP), as the method is known to be robust against non-stationary data. The use of order patterns recurrence plots (OPRPs) on EEG data recorded during a language processing experiment exemplifies the potentials of the method. We could show that the application of RQA to ERP data allows for a considerable reduction of the number of trials required in ERP research while still maintaining statistical validity.

This happens with ambiguous figures, like the Necker cube. Explanations favor either bottom-up factors in early visual processing, or top-down factors near awareness. The EEG has a high temporal resolution, so event related potentials (ERPs) may help to throw light on these alternative explanations. However, the precise point in time of neural correlates of perceptual reversal is difficult to estimate. We developed a paradigm that overcomes this problem and found an early (120ms) occipital ERP signal correlated with endogenous perceptual reversal. Parallels of ambiguous-figure-reversal to binocular-rivalry-reversals are explored. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gibbons, H; Stahl, J				Gibbons, Henning; Stahl, Jutta			Response-time corrected averaging of event-related potentials	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; averaging; response-time correction; late positive complex	VARIETIES	Objective: The present study presents a novel approach to averaging of event-related potentials (ERPs). Acknowledging latency variability of late ERP components as related to performance fluctuations across trials should improve the assessment of late portions of the ERP. Methods: Prior to the averaging procedure stimulus-to-response epochs in the electroencephalogram (EEG) were expanded/compressed in time to match mean RT in a certain condition and participant. By means of several mathematical functions RT variability was differentially distributed over late vs. early portions of the ERP. Data from 20 participants from two conditions of an identity-based priming task were analyzed using traditional stimulus- and response-locked averaging, as well as four different RT-corrected averaging procedures. Results: Area under the curve as an index of precision of LPC assessment was reliably enhanced for certain RT-corrected procedures relative to traditional ERP averaging. Moreover, a priming effect on amplitude of a distinct LPC subcomponent which could not be confirmed with traditional stimulus-locked averaging was reliably born out using a cubic RT-correction procedure. Conclusions: RT-corrected ERP averaging can outperform traditional ERP averaging in the assessment of late portions of the ERP, and experimental effects upon. Significance: Cognitive ERP researchers may take advantage of the improved capability of RT-corrected averaging to establish experimental effects on amplitudes in the late ERP range.

The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential (ERP) modulation that distinguishes losses from wins, but little is known about the effects of outcome probability on these ERP responses. Further, little is known about the frequency characteristics of feedback processing, for example, event-related oscillations and phase synchronizations. Here, we report an EEG experiment designed to address these issues. Subjects engaged in a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which we manipulated, across blocks, the probability of winning and losing to each of two possible decision options. Behaviorally, all subjects quickly adapted their decision-making to maximize rewards. ERP analyses revealed that the probability of reward modulated neural responses to wins, but not to losses. This was seen both across blocks as well as within blocks, as learning progressed. Frequency decomposition via complex wavelets revealed that EEG responses to losses, compared to wins, were associated with enhanced power and phase coherence in the theta frequency band. As in the ERP analyses, power and phase coherence values following wins but not losses were modulated by reward probability. Some findings between ERP and frequency analyses diverged, suggesting that these analytic approaches provide complementary insights into neural processing. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms of feedback processing may differ between wins and losses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of PCA and ICA of simulated ERPs: Promax vs. infomax rotations	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						principal components analysis; independent components analysis; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED-POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; BLIND SEPARATION; AVERAGE REFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MISALLOCATION; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES; VARIANCE	Independent components analysis (ICA) and principal components analysis (PCA) are methods used to analyze event-related potential (ERP) and functional imaging (fMRI) data. In the present study, ICA and PCA were directly compared by applying them to simulated ERP datasets. Specifically, PCA was used to generate a subspace of the dataset followed by the application of PCA Promax or ICA Infomax rotations. The simulated datasets were composed of real background EEG activity plus two ERP simulated components. The results suggest that Promax is most effective for temporal analysis, whereas Infomax is most effective for spatial analysis. Failed analyses were examined and used to devise potential diagnostic strategies for both rotations. Finally, the results also showed that decomposition of subject averages yield better results than of grand averages across subjects.

The statistical characteristics of the TDE for different signal distributions are studied. Results indicated that with the appearance of P2 and N2, a significant decrease of TDE was correlated with the responses to small size cue which supports the previous theoretic analysis. This method provides a novel quantitative measurement for ERPs actives and may be a useful monitoring.

But, there are only a few reports dealing with occupational health issues or age effects. The question arises how VR generally interferes with cognitive processes. This interference might have relevant implications for workability and work-efficiency in virtual environments. Event-related potentials are known to reflect different stages of stimulus reception, evaluation, and response. We have established an electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, focussing on event-related potentials (N100; mismatch negativity, i.e., MMN) to obtain access to attention dependent and pre-attentive processing of sensory stimuli applied in VE. The MMN is known to be correlated with the ability of subjects to react to an unexpected event. The aim of the present study was to investigate cognitive responses to distracting auditory stimuli in two different age groups in a virtual environment (VE) and in a real environment ("real reality"), and to compare characteristic neurophysiological response patterns. Data show that stimulus detection as given by the N100 amplitude and latency does not differ in both age groups and task conditions. In contrast, the pre-attentive processing as given by the MMN is altered in the VR such as the non-VR condition in an age-related manner. A relevant finding of the present study was that the age related differences seen in the non-VR condition were not strengthened in VR.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize the findings of ERP PTSD research, including studies that have examined P50 auditory sensory gating, augmenting-reducing P200, and P300 in target detection oddball tasks. The results suggest that persons with PTSD exhibit alterations in the amplitude and latency of ERP within these paradigms that support the hypothesis that changes in information processing can accompany PTSD. The results were also consistent with recent cognitive neuropsychological findings in PTSD research. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is thus critical to examine the neural processes that impair learning to read during the early phase of reading acquisition, before compensatory mechanisms are adapted by older readers with dyslexia. Using electroencephalography-based event-related imaging, we investigated how tuning of visual activity for print advances in the same children before and after initial reading training in school. The focus was on a fast, coarse form of visual tuning for print, measured as an increase of the occipito-temporal N1 response at 150270 ms in the event-related potential (ERP) to words compared to symbol strings. The results demonstrate that the initial development of reading skills and visual tuning for print progressed more slowly in those children who became dyslexic than in their control peers. Print-specific tuning in 2nd grade strongly distinguished dyslexic children from controls. It was maximal in the inferior occipito-temporal cortex, left-lateralized in controls, and reduced in dyslexic children. The results suggest that delayed initial visual tuning for print critically contributes to the development of dyslexia.

It is unclear whether ADAN effects are contaminated by contralateral negativity arising from residual gaze shifts. Conversely, it is possible that ADAN-related potentials contaminate the horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG), via volume conduction. To evaluate these possibilities, we used high-resolution infrared eye tracking while recording EEG and HEOG in a cued spatial-attention task. We found that, after conventional ER-P and HEOG preprocessing exclusions, small but systematic residual gaze shifts in the cued direction can remain, as revealed by the infrared measure. Nevertheless, by using this measure for more stringent exclusion of small gaze shifts, we confirmed that reliable ADAN components remain for preparatory spatial attention in the absence of any systematic gaze shifts toward the cued side.

ERP activities time-locked to stimulus presentation and task performance are often observed separately at individual scalp channels based on averaged time series across epochs and experimental subjects. An analysis using averaged EEG dynamics could discount information regarding interdependency between ongoing EEG and salient ERP features. Advanced tools such as independent component analysis (ICA) have been developed for decomposing collections of single-trial EEG records into separate features. Those features (or independent components) can then be mapped onto the cortical surface using source localization algorithms to visualize brain activation maps and to study between-subject consistency. In this study, we propose a statistical framework for estimating the time course of spatiotemporally independent EEG components simultaneously with their cortical distributions. Within this framework, we implemented Bayesian spatiotemporal analysis for imaging the sources of EEG features on the cortical surface. The framework allows researchers to include prior knowledge regarding spatial locations as well as spatiotemporal independence of different EEG sources. The use of the Electromagnetic Spatiotemporal ICA (ENISICA) method is illustrated by mapping event-related EEG dynamics induced by events in a visual two-back continuous performance task. The proposed method successfully identified several interesting components with plausible corresponding cortical activation topographies, including processes contributing to the late positive complex (LPC) located in central parietal, frontal midline, and anterior cingulate cortex, to atypical mu rhythms associated with the precentral gyros, and to the central posterior alpha activity in the precuneus.

Using the analytical results we intend to construct a reliable communication system between humans and computers. When a person visualizes a character in mind, a special signal appears on his/her EEG. The signal is considered a kind of an event related potential (ERP). In this paper, we discuss how to obtain ERPs caused by visualizing homonyms, how to indicate whether homonyms cause different ERPs or not, and how to clarify the difference among various ERPs. By the analysis of our experimental data, it is confirmed that EPRs caused by homonyms are different from each other and the homonyms can be distinguished by the ERPs in some cases.

Automatic correction of artifact from single-trial event-related potentials by blind source separation using second order statistics only	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); automatic artifact correction; blind source separation (BSS); second order statistics (SOS); independent component analysis (ICA); higher order statistics (HOS)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REMOVAL; EEG	Event-related potentials (ERP) are in general masked by various kinds of artifacts. To attenuate the effects of artifacts, various schemes have been introduced, such as epoch rejection, electro-oculogram (EOG) regression and independent component analysis (ICA). However, none of the existing techniques can automatically remove various kinds of artifacts from a single ERP epoch. EOG regression cannot handle artifacts other than ocular ones. ICA incorporating higher order statistics (HOS) normally requires data with large number of time samples in order that the solution is robust. In this paper we blindly separate the multi-channel ERP into source components by estimating the correlation matrices of the data. Since only second order statistics (SOS) is involved, the process performs well at the single epoch level. Automatic artifact identification is performed in the source domain by introducing objective criteria for various artifacts. Criteria are based on time domain signal amplitude for blink and spurious peak artifact, scalp distribution of signal power for eye movement artifact and power distribution of frequency components for muscle artifact. The correction procedure can be completed by removing the identified artifactual sources from the raw multi-channel ERP. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Artifacts generated in the EEG signal during MR acquisition, however, continue to pose a major challenge. Due to these artifacts, an interleaved modus has often been used for "evoked potential" experiments, i.e., only EEG signals recorded between MRI scan periods were assessed. An obvious disadvantage of this approach is the loss of a portion of the EEG information, which might be relevant for the specific scientific issue. In this study, continuous, simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements were carried out. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) could be reconstructed reliably from periods during MR scanning and in between successive scans. No significant differences between both VEPs were detected. This indicates sufficient artifact removal as well as physiological correspondence of VEPs in both periods. Simultaneous continuous VEP-fMRI recordings are thus shown to be feasible.

Previously, SOBI, as well as other BSS algorithms, has been applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. These BSS algorithms have been shown to recover components that appear to he physiologically and neuroanatomically interpretable. While some proponents of these algorithms suggest that fundamental discoveries about the human brain might be made through the application of these techniques, validation of BSS components has not yet received sufficient attention. Here we present two experiments for validating SOBI-recovered components. The first takes advantage of the fact that noise sources associated with individual sensors can be objectively validated independently from the SOBI process. The second utilizes the fact that the time course and location of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex activation by median nerve stimulation have been extensively characterized using converging imaging methods. In this paper, using both known noise sources and highly constrained and well-characterized neuronal sources, we provide validation for SOBI decomposition of high-density EEG data. We show that SOBI is able to (1) recover known noise sources that were either spontaneously occurring or artificially induced; (2) recover neuronal sources activated by median nerve stimulation that were spatially and temporally consistent with estimates obtained from previous EEG, MEG, and fMRI studies; (3) improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs); and (4) reduce the level of subjectivity involved in the source localization process.

With the development of technology, neural basis of functional areas of emotion processing is revealed gradually. In order to extract the useful information of emotion out from the background of EEG signals and noise, we propose it is needed to combine the methods of psychology and the technology of signal processing such as pattern recognition, etc. In this paper, we first review the psychological methods and signal processing technology in the field of emotion research, and point out the junctions of these two approaches. Secondly, we introduce a method to evaluate emotion competence objectively, which involves the analyses of frequency fluctuations of EEG signals and frontal EEG asymmetry. Then, we take an example of event-related potentials (ERP) study about the face recognition task and the discrimination of sad/happy/neutral emotional facial expressions task. Finally, we indicate the present difficulties in this research area, and advance the possible solution to resolve these problems.

In this paper, we develop a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of cognitive response by investigating the neurobiological brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments. A single-trial event-related-potential (ERP)-based fuzzy neural network (FNN) is applied to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic-light events. The system consists of a dynamic virtual-reality (VR)-based motion simulation platform, EEG signal detection and analysis units, and FNN-based classifier. The independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms are used to obtain noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A novel temporal filter is also proposed to solve time-alignment problems of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dimension of features, which were then fed into a FNN classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that organize operators' cognitive responses to task events. Comparisons of three kinds of linear and nonlinear classifiers show that our proposed FNN-based classifier can achieve a satisfactory and superior recognition rate (85%). The classification results can be further transformed as the control/biofeedback signals of intelligent driving systems.

We investigate this question in a memory task in which human subjects had to retrieve a verbal label in response to the presentation of a picture. The results show that (i) evoked oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha and beta range undergo a significant phase resetting and (ii) become synchronized in absolute phase during small time windows that (iii) coincide with the latencies of the P1-N1 complex. Our conclusion is that the latencies of ERP components can be predicted at least in part by phase synchronization between frequencies.

Scrambled motion with the same velocity vector as the BM but randomized initial starting points was used as the distractor. The number of distractors was varied to control the difficulty of the task. The behavioral data showed that the reaction time increased with the number of distractors. Moreover, the ERP results showed that enhanced negativity was elicited at posterior electrodes contralateral to the location of the BM as with the conventional N2pc-like component, which is related to selection of the target. The increment of reaction time indicated that the attentional process is involved in the detection of BM. Furthermore, the ERP waveforms suggest that, even when detection of the target requires form-from-motion processing, similar neural mechanisms to those involved in conventional visual search tasks were employed here.

The infants were tested in a spatial cueing procedure. The reaction time to localize the target showed response facilitation for valid trials relative to invalid or neutral trials. High-density EEG (126 channels) was recorded during the task, and independent component analysis and equivalent current dipole analysis was used to estimate the cortical sources of the EEG during the task. There was a larger P1 ERP component on the valid trials than the other trials (P1 validity effect). The cortical source analysis suggested that this occurred due to acidity in Brodmann's areas 18 and 19. A presaccadic ERP component occurred over the frontal scalp areas (-65 ms) and was larger to a target in a cued location than in uncued locations. A potential cortical source for this ERP component was the superior frontal gyrus on the inferior portion of the prefrontal cortex. Increases from 14 to 20 weeks in amplitude of the P1 validity effect and the presaccadic ERP could be modeled by an increase in activation in the corresponding cortical areas.

During the last few years there has been a debate about the neural fundamentals of ERPs. Two models have been proposed: The evoked model states that additive evoked responses which are completely independent of ongoing background electroencephalogram generate the ERP. On the other hand the phase reset model suggests a resetting of ongoing brain oscillations to be the neural generator of ERPs. Here, evidence for either of the two models is presented and validated, and their possible impact on cognitive neuroscience is discussed. In addition, future prospects on this field of research are presented. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Szucs, D				Szucs, D			The use of electrophysiology in the study of early development	INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Editorial Material							INFANT BRAIN; EEG POWER; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; HZ	Electrophysiology is a timely and important tool in the study of early cognitive development. This commentary polishes the definition of event-related potential (ERP) components; often interpreted as expressions of mental processes. Further, attention is drawn to time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) which conveys much more information than the exclusive use of traditional ERP methodology. Several studies have shown that frequency bands of the EEG undergo systematic development in early childhood. EEG frequency analysis has a potential in early risk assessment. 40 Hz gamma range oscillation bursts accompany stimulus feature binding both in infants and in adults, probably indexing grouping and selection of distributed neuronal populations. Methodological concerns are noted and the need for long-term normative studies is stressed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The ERP results demonstrated that the emotional face elicited a negative peak at approximately 230 ms (N2). Moreover, EEG measures showed that motivational significance of face (emotional vs. neutral) could modulate the amplitude of EROs, but only for some frequency bands (i.e. theta and gamma bands). In a second phase, we considered the resemblance of the two EEG measures by a regression analysis. It revealed that theta and gamma oscillations mainly effect as oscillation activity at the N2 latency. Finally, a posterior increased power of theta was found for emotional faces.

Fifteen university students participated in conditions of (1) listening to the musical rhythm, (2) finger tapping with musical rhythm, and (3) imaging the finger tapping with musical rhythm. Considering the results of previous behavioral experiment, five musical rhythm patterns were selected. These rhythm patterns differed in difficulty for finger tapping and had a different rest and accent position in music score. EEG was recorded from 25 channels, then ERPs were analyzed for a measure in each condition. Two ERP components were considered as the feature of waveform of ERP elicited by musical rhythm. The first component was positive potential with the musical note after rest. The second component-like contingent negative variation (CNV) was negative slow potential at frontal-central area with rest position in musical score. It is inferred that this component reflects the tapping facility. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we measured the ERP P300 component-a waveform that reflects the real-time allocation of attention to stimuli of high informational salience-as it was elicited by neutral and negatively valent words among currently depressed, previously depressed, and never-depressed participants. The study design allowed us to clarify the degree to which the oft-reported attenuation of P300 response in depression should be regarded as evidence of: (a) a general, pervasive impairment in depressive attentional function; or (b) the operation of depressotypic attentional biases, which may give rise to attentional deficits only regarding stimuli of non-negative emotional valence. Consistent with the latter possibility, depressed individuals were observed in this study to experience, on average, a robust P300 response to negatively valent target words-a response of larger magnitude than that observed among previously depressed and never-depressed controls. This enhanced P300 response to negative stimuli in depression appears to be a statelike, rather than traitlike, phenomenon.

This study tested the assumption of sensory integration theory that states that a relationship exists between brain function and the behavioral manifestations of sensory integrative dysfunction. METHOD. Electroencephalographic measures were used to examine brain processing in 28 children with sensory processing disorders (SPD) and 25 children who were typically developing, ages 5-12 years. RESULTS. Children with SPD demonstrated less sensory gating than children who were typically developing. A significant relationship between sensory gating and age was found in children who were typically developing but not in children with SPD. Brain activity correctly distinguished children with SPD from children who were typically developing with 86% accuracy. CONCLUSION. These results present empirical evidence that children with SPD display unique brain processing mechanisms compared to children who are typically developing and provide external validity for the diagnosis of SPD.

Existing evidence suggests impairment of preattentive auditory processing in aging, which appears to be accompanied by decline of cholinergic activity. Previous studies indicate that scopolamine, which is a centrally acting muscarinic receptor antagonist, modulates preattentive auditory processing in young subjects. It has remained elusive, however, to which extent scopolamine affects preattentive auditory processing in aged subjects. We measured auditory responses simultaneously with electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) from nine non-demented elderly subjects after intravenous injection of scopolamine or glycopyrrolate, the latter being a peripherally acting cholinergic antagonist, using a double blind protocol. Scopolamine significantly delayed electric P50, both electric and magnetic N100 responses, whereas subsequent MMN and P200 responses were not altered by scopolamine. Our results indicate that the cholinergic system modulates auditory processing underlying stimulus detection in aging. In addition, auditory evoked responses appear to have different age-related sensitivity to cholinergic modulation. The combined MEG/EEG measurements using particularly auditory N100 response might offer an objective tool to monitor cholinergic activity in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Stimulated brain areas can be identified by electrophysiological methods even in children. Subjects and method: Event related potentials (ERP) were recorded with EEG-surface electrodes in children and adolescents who were shown pictures of increasing complexity. Pictures were categorized into morphologic features such as brightness, color and pattern as well as semantic content. Results: Presentation of comics and unstructured pictures, similar in color and brightness, revealed ERP with nearly identical early components (P 100). However, substantial differences were found in frontocentral brain areas. A negative wave at approximately 400 ms was recorded only when comics were shown. Conclusions: Semantic scenes provoked significant different ERP, which indicate an early involvement of complex neuronal networks. These results could be applied in the research of pediatric cognitive disturbances.

The simultaneous recording permits obtaining event-related potentials (ERPs) and MR images in the same environment, conditions of stimulation, and subject state; it also enables tracing the joint fluctuations of EEG and fMRI signals. The goal of this study was to investigate the possibility of tracking the trial-to-trial changes in event-related EEG activity, and of using this information as a parameter in fMR1 analysis. We used an auditory oddball paradigm and obtained single-trial amplitude and latency features from the EEG acquired during fMRI scanning. The single-trial P300 latency presented significant correlation with parameters external to the EEG (target-to-target interval and reaction time). Moreover, we obtained significant fMRI activations for the modulation by P300 amplitude and latency, both at the single-subject and at the group level. Our results indicate that, in line with other studies, the EEG can bring a new dimension to the field of fMRI analysis by providing fine temporal information on the fluctuations in brain activity.

An event-related brain potential (ERP) is a peculiar feature in the signals, which is evoked by a specific stimulus or task, the so-called 'event'. The ERP contains a considerable number of distinct meaningful peak components that reflect brain functions related to the event. The complexity of the ERP can be easily characterized if it can be reliably decomposed into its subcomponents, thereby enabling the localization of the equivalent dipole sources corresponding to those components. To date, this decomposition has typically been performed using independent component analysis (ICA) or principal component analysis (PCA), both of which exploit the statistical independence or uncorrelatedness of sources. However, the temporally overlapped, distinct single-peak-pulse (SPP) signals within a time series are not only mutually dependent but also mutually correlated. In this paper, we propose a gradient descent method for the blind separation of dependent peak signal sources. The method does not exploit any statistical properties of the sources; rather, it uses simple functions characterizing the shapes of the output waveforms and an adaptive peak-searching technique. Application of the proposed method to a numerical example and data from a real ERP experiment suggest that it is superior to an ICA in terms of extracting peak component sources.

The amplitude of P300 - a component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by 10 smoking-related ( craving), 10 antismoking ( aversive) and 10 neutral stimuli was recorded in smokers ( n = 10) and nonsmokers ( n = 10). Electroencephalography ( EEG) data were obtained by the Laxtha EEG-monitoring device in the EEG recording room, and were recorded at F3, F4, C3, and C4. Three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA) was computed on the P300 amplitudes. The factors were group ( smokers, nonsmokers), stimulus ( craving, aversive, neutral), and electrode location ( F3, F4, C3, and C4). The main effects of stimulus were significant, but the group effects did not show significant interactions with other factors. An interesting observation was the similarity between P300 waveforms for craving and aversive stimuli in smokers. These findings could indicate that the antismoking-related response is similar to the smoking-related one.

Psychopaths' ERP abnormalities are most prominent in the 300-500 ms post-stimulus time window. It is unclear whether these ERP differences are related to neurocognitive processes associated with the P300 (i.e., poor attention/orienting/working memory) or N400 (i.e., aberrant semantic processes). To address this issue, the present study employed a canonical semantic sentence processing paradigm known to selectively elicit the N400. Fifty incarcerated participants were divided into psychopathic (n = 25) or nonpsychopathic (n = 25) groups based on scores from the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. The N400 and P600 components elicited by terminal words of sentences either congruent or incongruent with the previous sentence context were examined. No differences were observed between groups in the behavioral or ERP data. These data do not support the hypothesis that the semantic processes, and underlying neural systems, associated with the generation of the N400 during sentence processing tasks are abnormal in psychopathy.

The P300 potential is an important component of the ERP waveform and has been used to study cognition as well as psychiatric disorders such as alcoholism. In this work, we aim to further understand the nature of the event-related oscillation (ERO) components which form the P300 wave and how these components may be used to differentiate alcoholic individuals from controls. Methods: The S-transform decomposition method is used to derive TFR's from single trial and trial-averaged ERP data acquired during a visual oddball task. These TFR's are averaged within time and frequency windows to provide ERO measures for further investigation. ERO measures are compared with conventional ERP amplitude measures using correlation analyses. Statistical analyses was performed with MANOVA and stepwise logistic regressions to contrast an age-matched sample of control (N = 100) and alcoholic male subjects (N = 100). Results: The results indicate that the P300 waveform, elicited using infrequent salient stimuli, is composed of frontal theta and posterior delta activations. The frontal theta activation does not closely correspond to any of the conventional ERP components and is therefore best analyzed using spectral methods. Between group comparisons and group predictions indicate that the delta and theta band ERO's, which underlie the P300, show deficits in the alcoholic group. Additionally, each band contributes unique information to discriminate between the groups. Conclusions: ERO measures which underlie and compose the P300 wave provide additional information to that offered by conventional ERP amplitude measures, and serve as useful genetic markers in the study of alcoholism. Significance: Studying the ERP waveform using time-frequency analysis methods opens new avenues of research in electrophysiology which may lead to a better understanding of cognitive processes, lead to improved clinical diagnoses, and provide phenotypes/endophenotypes for genetic analyses.

Thirty-four unmedicated AD/HD adolescents (11 - 17 years; 6 females) were first compared to 34 age- and sex-matched controls, and then re-tested at least 4 weeks after methylphenidate (MPH) medication. In each testing session, EDA was recorded simultaneously with EEG during a resting eyes open condition, and with ERPs during an auditory oddball task. Unmedicated AD/HD subjects were compared to controls and then AD/HD subjects were compared pre- and post-medication. Correlations between the change in EEG theta and the remaining psychophysiological variables were undertaken to provide information about post MPH treatment changes. In the unmedicated state, AD/HD was characterized by abnormally enhanced theta, across fronto-central sites, generally reduced P2 responses, with larger nonspecific and oddball-elicited SCRs and poor behavioural performance on the oddball task. Following treatment, AD/HD showed a 'normalization' of theta activity (particularly in the right hemisphere), a reduction in the rate of decrement of EDA and a general increase in P3 amplitude. These findings suggest that methylphenidate is associated with a robust 'normalization' of low frequency EEG activity during the resting brain state, but has less impact on task-related brain activity or phasic changes in autonomic function. This dissociation of resting and task-related activity may prove to be useful in elucidating the effects of stimulant versus new non-stimulant medications in AD/HD. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Subjects had to memorize one (load 1) or 3 (load3) letters (memory set) and search for these among a recognition set consisting of 4 letters only, if the letters appeared in the correct (relevant) color. Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as alpha and theta event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERD/ERS) were derived from the EEG that was recorded during the task. Results: In the ERP to the memory set, a prolonged load-related positivity was found. In response to the recognition set, effects of relevance were manifested in an early frontal positivity and a later frontal negativity. Effects of load were found in a search-related negativity within the attended category and a suppression of the P3-amplitude. Theta ERS was most pronounced for the most difficult task condition during the recognition set, whereas alpha ERD showed a load-effect only during memorization. Conclusions: The manipulation of stimulus relevance and memory load affected both ERP components and ERD/ERS. Significance: The present paradigm may supply a useful method for studying processes of selective attention and working memory and can be used to examine group differences between healthy controls and children showing psychopathology.

Twelve subjects observed pairs of single letters and digits presented serially, and decided whether the colour (blue or red) or the category membership (letter or number) of the second item in a pair matched the first one. In both tasks mismatch elicited central N2b components (220ms peak latency in the C0101ir matching task, and 280 ins peak latency in the category matching task). Furthermore, in the category matching task a centroparietal negativity (N400) emerged. The topography of the N2b effect was clearly distinct from that of the N400 effect. Analysis of event-related spectral perturbations confirmed that N400 time-range effects were specific to category matching. We conclude that while the N400 effect is a specific marker of semantic mismatch, the N2b effect is a general correlate of detecting mismatch between the representations of task-relevant features.

The proposed method is based on, firstly, separation of the ERP recordings into independent components using the method of temporal decorrelation source separation (TDSEP). Secondly, the novel lagged auto-mutual information clustering (LAMIC) algorithm is used to cluster the estimated components, together with ocular reference signals, into clusters corresponding to cerebral and non-cerebral activity. Thirdly, the components in the cluster which contains the ocular reference signals are discarded. The remaining components are then recombined to reconstruct the clean ERPs.

However, significant discrepancies exist between the efMRI data and the results of previously published intracranial ERP studies of oddball task. To evaluate the capacity of efMRI to define the sources of the P3 component of ERP within the human brain, both efMRI and intracerebral ERP recordings were performed in eight patients with intractable epilepsy (five males and three females) during their preoperative invasive video-EEG monitoring. An identical auditory oddball task with frequent and target stimuli was completed in two sessions. A total of 606 intracerebral sites were electrophysiologically investigated by means of depth electrodes. In accordance with the finding of multiple intracerebral generators of P3 potential, the target stimuli evoked MRI signal increase in multiple brain regions. However, regions with evident hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses overlapped only partially. P3 generators were always found within hemodynamic-active sites, if these sites were investigated by means of depth electrodes. On the other hand, unequivocal local sources of P3 potential were apparently also located outside the regions with a significant hemodynamic response (typically in mesiotemporal regions). Both methods should thus be viewed as mutually complementary in investigations of the spatial distribution of cortical and subcortical activation during oddball task. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The paper discusses major aspects of performing research using EEG/ERP based experiments including the recording of the signals, removing noise, estimating ERP signals, and signal analysis for better understanding of the neural correlates of processes involved in creativity. Important factors to be kept in mind to record clean EEG signal in creativity research are discussed. The recorded EEG signal can be corrupted by various sources of noise and methodologies to handle the presence of unwanted artifacts and filtering noise are presented followed by methods to estimate ERPs from the EEG signals from multiple trials. The EEG and ERP signals are further analyzed using various techniques including spectral analysis, coherence analysis, and non-linear signal analysis. These analysis techniques provide a way to understand the spatial activations and temporal development of large scale electrical activity in the brain during creative tasks. The use of this methodology will further enhance our understanding the processes neural and cognitive processes involved in creativity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The children received feedback on their performance while conducting a probabilistic learning task. Error-related ERP components time-locked to the response increased in amplitude when the children had learned the task, whereas the feedback-locked components decreased. Concerning, EHR, there was a general reduction in feedback-related heart rate deceleration when the children had learned. Moreover, a prolonged heart rate deceleration was observed at negative feedback onset in comparison to positive feedback, which shifted in timing when the task progressed. Together, the ERP and EHR-measures suggest a shift from external to internal monitoring when the children are learning by performance feedback. The data suggest that error- and feedback-related EHR deceleration is a reflection of the same error monitoring system that is responsible for the emergence of the error-related negativity (ERN).

Statistical analysis of event-related potential elicited by verb-complement merge in Brazilian Portuguese	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; verb-complement merges; averaging; N-400 identification	BRAIN POTENTIALS; SPEECH; ERP	An interesting fact about language cognition is that stimulation involving incongruence in the merge operation between verb and complement has often been related to a negative event-related potential (ERP) of augmented amplitude and latency of ca. 400 ms - the N-400- Using an automatic ERP latency and amplitude estimator to facilitate the recognition of waves with a low signal-to-noise ratio, the objective of the present study was to study the N-400 statistically in 24 volunteers. Stimulation consisted of 80 experimental sentences (40 congruous and 40 incongruous), generated in Brazilian Portuguese, involving two distinct local verb-argument combinations (nominal object and pronominal object series). For each volunteer, the EEG was simultaneously acquired at 20 derivations, topographically localized according to the 10-20 International System. A computerized routine for automatic N-400-peak marking (based on the ascendant zero-cross of the first waveform derivative) was applied to the estimated individual ERP waveform for congruous and incongruous sentences in both series for all ERP topographic derivations. Peak-to-peak N400 amplitude was significantly augmented (P < 0.05; one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test) due to incongruence in derivations F-3, T-3, C-3, C-z, T-5, P-3, P-z, and P-4 for nominal object series and in P-3, P-z and P-4 for pronominal object series. The results also indicated high inter-individual variability in ERP waveforms, suggesting that the usual procedure of grand averaging might not be considered a generally adequate approach. Hence, signal processing statistical techniques should be applied in neurolinguistic ERP studies allowing waveform analysis with low signal-to-noise ratio.

However, the mechanism of central nervous action is poorly understood. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies may be of interest since chronic peripheral current application to the vagus nerve may exert lasting neurophysiologically detectable effects on central electrical activity. In an exploratory study, we investigated the effects of VNS on auditory event-related potentials (ERP). Methods: Thirteen depressive patients (mean Hamilton depression score (HAMD) at baseline = 24.2) receiving VNS were investigated prior to implantation and 10 weeks after standard cycling VNS. Stimulation intensity was 0.94 +/- 0.46 mA, pulse width 0.250 mu s, and frequency 20 Hz. 1 h prior to follow-up investigation, VNS was turned off. Auditory ERP were elicited using a standard auditory oddball paradigm and were recorded with 29-channel EEG. Results: Post VNS, grand averages of the auditory ER-P did not show significant differences as compared to baseline recording. However, differential effects were found when separating ERP of responders (N = 5, mean HAMD post VNS = 8.8) and nonresponders (N = 8, mean HAMD) post VNS = 22.4). In VNS responders only, P300 at midline electrodes Fz and Cz was significantly increased and correlated with HAMD scores. Conclusion: Auditory ERP seem to provide a useful tool for investigating VNS-induced changes concerning information processing in major depressive disorder. In our sample, enhancement of P300 distinguished VNS responders from non-responders 10 weeks after therapy onset. Our findings may be relevant for the understanding of both neurophysiological mechanism of action of VNS and pathophysiology of depression. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Priming for sounds and words was observed in response latency as well as in event-related potentials. Reactions were faster when a related word followed an environmental sound and vice versa. Moreover both stimulus types produced an N400-effect for unrelated compared to related trials. The N400-effect had an earlier onset for environmental sounds than for words. The results support the theoretical notion that conceptual processing may be similar for verbal and non-verbal stimuli. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent hardware and software developments have made it feasible to acquire EEG and fMRI data simultaneously. We emphasize the potential of simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings to pursue new strategies in cognitive neuroimaging. Specifically, we propose that, by exploiting the combined spatiotemporal resolution of the methods, the integration of EEG and fMRI recordings on a single-trial level enables the rich temporal dynamics of information processing to be characterized within spatially well-defined neural networks.

The aim of this study was to assess the timing of thalamic versus cortical processes involved in this cognitive operation. To this end, simultaneous depth and scalp EEG was recorded in eight patients with essential tremor, undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), when the DBS electrodes could be accessed via their temporarily externalized leads. The patients performed an oddball task consisting of 300 presentations of one frequent and two rare visual cues, appearing in randomized order. One of the rare cues was defined as a target, the occurrences of which had to be indicated by a button press (motor condition) or silently counted (non-motor condition). At the scalp and the thalamus, event-related potentials (ERP) were largest upon target presentation, with peak latencies in the time domain of classical P300 responses. Remarkably, target-specific thalamic ERP emerged significantly prior to scalp P300. Furthermore, whereas scalp ERP had a higher amplitude upon rare than upon frequent non-target signals, thalamic ERP were independent of stimulus probability. This pattern was identified during motor and non-motor task execution. We conclude that the human thalamus specifically supports the early recognition of target events and can widely distribute this label through its divergent cortical projections.

For the ERPs of matching stimulus we describe an application of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm proposed by Kohonen and namely Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) for the classification of ERPs signals from individuals at HR and LR for alcoholism. After training, the LVQs nets were able to correctly classify about 80% of the HR and LR class of ERP. The results of this study suggest, as well, that the reduced amplitude of the c247 and P3 to matching stimuli appears to characterize subjects at HR for alcoholism.

These techniques are often underutilized in the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, but nevertheless they can-be most useful and highly effective in the diagnostic workup of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in monitoring the course of the disorders and the prediction of treatment responses. ERP are noninvasive instruments that directly reflect cortical neuronal activity. Cortical neuronal dysfunction plays a major role in variable neuropsychiatric disorders, and a change in cortical activity under medication might reflect treatment response and could be useful for monitoring drug effects. ERP are the only methods with a sufficiently high time resolution for the analysis of the dynamic patterns of neuronal brain activity, e.g., synchronization and desynchronization, oscillations, coherence, gamma band activity, latency of event related activity, etc., which are crucial for a deeper understanding of functional (neurophysiological) correlates of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances in neuropsychiatric patients. Methodological advances have further improved and strengthened the position of ERP concerning research and clinical application. The usefulness and applicability of ERP in determining and monitoring clinico-pharmacological effects will be summarized mainly by focussing on the auditory evoked P300 and the N1/P2 component of auditory evoked potentials. Owing to important recent developments in the field of brain functional diagnostics the combination of neurophysiological techniques and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be included.

Non-invasive recordings of electric (EEG/ERP) and magnetic (MEG) fields provide this time resolution. They directly measure neural activations associated with a wide variety of brain states and processes, even during sleep or in infants. Mapping and source estimation can localise these time-varying activation patterns inside the brain. Methods: Recent EEG/ERP research on brain functions in the domains of attention and executive functioning, perception, memory, language, emotion and motor processing in ADHD, autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, specific language disorder and developmental dyslexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression is reviewed. Results: Over the past two decades, electrophysiology has substantially contributed to the understanding of brain functions during normal development, and psychiatric conditions of children and adolescents. Its time resolution has been important to measure covert processes, and to distinguish cause and effect. Conclusions: In the future, EEG/ERP parameters will increasingly characterise the interplay of neural states and information processing. They are particularly promising tools for multilevel investigations of etiological pathways and potential predictors of clinical treatment response.

We therefore proposed a new method of reducing the noise component including the background wave in a single-trial response. In this study, our target is a component such as N-100 approximated by one dipole. The method was performed by modifying the dipole position in the brain and detecting the projected components with reference to the dipole estimated from an averaged response. Results of simulation indicate that the proposed method could improve signal-to-noise ratio by 7.6 dB and decrease the error in N-100 peak latency 6.7 ms by suppressing the influence of the background wave. In the EEG experiment, eight healthy subjects paticipated and their results show that the sway of waveforms by the background wave is suppressed and that the peak of the N-100 component becomes prominent compared with that of the original single-trial response.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.

Here, we develop a method that uses prior information about the phase-locking property of event-related potentials in a regularization framework to bias a blind source separation algorithm toward an improved separation of single-trial phase-locked responses in terms of an increased signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, we suggest a transformation of the data, using weighted average of the single trial and trial-averaged response, that redirects the focus of source separation methods onto the subspace of event-related potentials. The practical benefit with respect to an improved separation of such components from ongoing background activity and extraneous noise is first illustrated on artificial data and finally verified in a real-world application of extracting single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials from multichannel EEG-recordings.

The four components are encapsulated in a black sponge to decrease the interference of outside light as well as facilitate the placement on the forehead. The signals from the PDs and the electrode separately pass though two adjustable amplify-filter circuits which amplify the weak signals and block the high frequency interferences. A high speed data acquisition board samples the modulated signals under the control of a home-made software. The time resolution of the instrument achieves less than 10ms, which makes it realizable to compare the fNIRS data with the ERP data.

However, EEG data recorded inside an MR scanner is heavily distorted by artifacts. It is important in cognitive studies to ensure that recorded data reflect the same brain activity, and this is achieved through interleaved electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI measurements. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of recording P300 ERPs during fMRI using a three-stimulus visual oddball task and involving a small number of trials for each stimulus. Ten EEG channels were acquired interleaved with fMRI images in five healthy subjects. The stimuli, including rare targets "X," frequent repetitive distractors "O," and rare distractors referred to as novels, were randomly presented every 2 +/- 1 s. The post hoc filter presented here was designed and applied to EEG data to remove the cardiac pulse artifact. Interleaved EEG/fMRI acquisition evidenced two P300 ERPs evoked at Fz; Cz, and Pz by targets and novels. Novel-related ERPs were of higher amplitude than their target-related counterparts. The fMRI maps acquired concurrently showed stronger BOLD response for target condition. We have shown that interleaved acquisition allows to obtain reliable P300 data and fMRI results, likely to shed light on the anatomical location of brain regions involved in cognitive ERPs relevant to many disorders affecting CNS functions. These noninvasive multimodal neuroimaging techniques can be used to explore and better understand processes underlying the functional brain organization. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Participants had to decide whether the last beat of a short sequence was presented 'too early' or 'too late'. Target beats were accelerated or decelerated with 0%, 2%, 5%, or 10%. Individuals differed in their capability to detect small tempo changes. We found that good responders were able to identify all tempo changes whereas poor responders were only able to identify large (10%) tempo changes. In addition, we found that tempo changes affected two subcomponents of the ERP P3 in good performers. Accelerations increased a late-P3 amplitude whereas decelerations increased an early-P3 amplitude. These results imply the principle possibility to measure differential P3 effects within one task. This is important for acquiring more refined knowledge concerning different subcomponents of the ERP P3 complex and the cognitive processes by which they are elicited. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

ER-P generator patterns were summarized by temporal PCA from reference-free current source density (CSD) waveforms to sharpen 31-channel topographies. Patients showed poorer performance and reduced left inferior parietotemporal P3 source. Build-up of mid-frontal negative slow wave (SW) in controls during item encoding, integration, and active maintenance was absent in patients, whereas a sustained mid-frontal SW sink during the retention interval was comparable across groups. Midfrontal SW sinks (encoding and retention periods) and posterior SW sinks and sources (encoding only) were related to performance in controls only. Data suggest disturbed processes in a frontal-parietotemporal network in schizophrenia, affecting encoding and early item storage.

Previous research has suggested that scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) may index the activity of separate familiarity and recollection processes. Other research indicates that the amnestic drug midazolam impairs recollection more than familiarity. Here, we used a convergent pharmacological and electrophysiological approach to manipulate and monitor human brain activity and provide evidence for separate processes. Midazolam selectively influenced the putative ERP-correlate of recollection but not the putative ERP-correlate of familiarity. Under control conditions (saline), subjects' accuracy correlated with the recollection-related but not the familiarity-related ERP component, suggesting that recollection was dominant in driving memory. The opposite pattern was observed under midazolam administration, suggesting that when recollection fails, subjects may leverage familiarity to compensate. Thus, in contrast to perspectives holding that familiarity represents the default process, these results suggest that recollection was dominant until its impairment unveiled the influence of familiarity.

Methods: CSERP from 20 normosmic subjects were obtained in response to stimulation with two olfactory (H2S and PEA) and a trigeminal (CO2) stimulant. For each of these odors, 160 stimuli were delivered into the right nostril (duration 200 ms., mean ISI 30 s) using a constant-flow, air-dilution olfactometer. For each EEG recording site (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, C4), peak-to-peak amplitude N1P2 and noise amplitude levels were determined. Subsequently, S/N ratios were calculated. Results: The S/N ratios for olfactory ERP generally improved for H2S and PEA. For responses to PEA, S/N ratios increased significantly up to 80 averages (S/N ratio = 5.6). The number of stimuli for an optimal S/N ratio for trigeminal ERP was slightly lower, i.e. 60 averages (S/N ratio = 7.9). Conclusions: S/N N1P2 ratios in olfactory and trigeminal ERP significantly improve with an increasing number of responses averaged under these experimental conditions. This is mainly due to a reduction of noise level. Applying more stimuli has little additional effect on S/N ratio due to a concomitant decrease in signal amplitude. Significance: An optimal S/N ratio is essential when recording CSERP in neurodegenerative disorders, where responses may be of low amplitude, and for medico-legal purposes.

We investigated the relationship between event-related oscillatory activity in the alpha band and prestimulus levels of ongoing alpha activity on ERPs. EEG was recorded from 23 participants performing a visual discrimination task. Individuals were assigned to one of three groups according to the amount of prestimulus total alpha activity, and distinct differences of the event-related EEG dynamics between groups were observed. While all groups exhibited an eventre-lated increase in phase-locked (evoked) alpha activity, only individuals with sustained prestimulus alpha activity showed alpha-blocking, that is, a considerable decrease of poststimulus non-phase-locked alpha activity. In contrast, individuals without observable prestimulus total alpha activity showed a concurrent increase of phase-locked and non-phase-locked alpha activity after stimulation. Data from this group seems to be in favor of an additive event-related neuronal response without alpha-blocking. However, the dissociable EEG dynamics of total and evoked alpha activities together with a complementary simulation analysis indicated a partial event-related reorganization of ongoing brain activity. We conclude that both partial phase-resetting and partial additive power contribute dynamically to the generation of ERPs. The prestimulus brain state exerts a prominent influence on event-related brain responses. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet, multiple implicit variables may be involved in limited event related potential (ERP) measures. Special computation techniques are needed to recover these parameters. In the study of involuntary visual spatial attention, we may obtain the ERP in valid cued (V), invalid cued (1) and neutral cued (N) conditions. Usually, the effect of involuntary attention is computed by the subtraction model with the assumption that V/I and N are independent. Yet, they should be related. Treating V/I as a function of N, a linear model V(I) = W + GN is assumed, where W and G are implicit in the ERP measures. G is the gain control on the neutral function. Provided G and W are constant over a local brain region, we may use the Total Least Square (TLS) algorithm to compute their values. The values of W and G computed from an involuntary attention experiment data show that multiple implicit variables are involved in obtained ERPs. Here G acts as a "top-down" sensory modulator on the neutral ERPs and W is related to possible newly involved neural activities. The parameters derived from the new linear model also suggest that there are different mechanisms involved in involuntary attention and voluntary allocation of attention.

Conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded during the performance of a task that involves ignoring irrelevant sounds while trying to hold in memory lists of numbers. Specific bioelectric measures are made to prevent the contamination of recordings by the movements of articulators. An approach is also outlined which controls the timing of ERP components to sounds with different envelopes. Using this approach, it has been shown that the neural processes involved in the elicitation of the auditory NI ER-P response may be involved in the disruption of memory for serial order produced by irrelevant sound.

In techniques of time-domain and frequency-domain analysis (short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform) assumptions concerning linearity, stationarity, and templates are made about the brain signals. In the time-frequency component analyser (TFCA), the assumption is that the signal has one or more components with non-overlapping supports in the time-frequency plane. In this study, the TFCA technique was applied to ERPs. TFCA determined and extracted the oscillatory components from the signal and, simultaneously, localized them in the time-frequency plane with high resolution and negligible cross-term contamination. The results obtained by means of TFCA were compared with those obtained by means of other commonly used techniques of ERP analysis, such as bilinear time-frequency distributions and wavelet analysis.

Event related potentials during the visual discrimination of words and pseudowords by children	ARQUIVOS DE NEURO-PSIQUIATRIA			English	Article						event-related potential; pseudowords; lexical decision; child; EEG	BRAIN POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; STIMULI; TASK; ERP	Event related potentials (ERPs) in reading were studied in children in a word and pseudoword discriminating task. Seventy-nine children (9 to 11 year old), all with no elements suggesting brain injury and with school performance compatible with their age were studied. The ERP were registered as there were presented, visually, successively and in a random manner, 100 words and 100 pseudowords. For each stimulus the child pressed a key corresponding to the discrimination between word and pseudoword. The register was carried out for the electrodes of the 10-20 system and the mean amplitudes and latency peaks measured and also the amplitude from 200 to 550 milliseconds. The most significant differences between the ERPs occurred in Cz, with greater negativity for the mean of the amplitude between 425 and 550 milliseconds for pseudowords (N400). The N400 was more precocious in 11 year old. The influence of age was thus evident and also the differences in ERPs between words and pseudowords.

Comparable to theata, a load dependent increase in power can be observed during retention and increased evoked activity during retrieval. During retrieval attempts theta behaves like a traveling wave spreading from anterior to posterior sites. During actual retrieval, however, evoked upper alpha becomes transiently nested in theta. We suggest that theta reflects working memory functions whereas upper alpha may be important for the reactivation of long-term memory codes in short-term memory.

A series of event-related brain potential (ERP) studies is reviewed demonstrating the consistent and robust modulation of specific ERP components by emotional images. Specifically, pictures depicting natural pleasant and unpleasant scenes are associated with an increased early posterior negativity, late positive potential, and sustained positive slow wave compared with neutral contents. These modulations are considered to index different stages of stimulus processing including perceptual encoding, stimulus representation in working memory, and elaborate stimulus evaluation. Furthermore, the review includes a discussion of studies exploring the interaction of motivated attention with passive and active forms of attentional control. Recent research is reviewed exploring the selective processing of emotional cues as a function of stimulus novelty, emotional prime pictures, learned stimulus significance, and in the context of explicit attention tasks. It is concluded that ERP measures are useful to assess the emotion-attention interface at the level of distinct processing stages. Results are discussed within the context of two-stage models of stimulus perception brought out by studies of attention, orienting, and learning.

The present study aimed to detect alcohol-induced changes in spontaneous neuronal oscillations with combined EEG and MEG techniques. The effects of alcohol on spontaneous neuronal rhythms were studied in 12 healthy subjects after 0.8 g/kg alcohol or juice in a double-blind, placebo-con trolled, cross-over design using simultaneous high-resolution MEG and EEG in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The data were analyzed with a power spectral density analysis. MEG recording showed that alcohol significantly increased the relative power of alpha rhythm (8-10 Hz) and reduced the relative power of beta activity (17-25 Hz)in both left and right hemispheres, but only in the eyes-closed condition. These effects did not depend on gender. No analogous statistically significant changes were observed in EEG rhythms. However, the power of alpha and beta rhythms was positively correlated in MEG and EEG recordings, indicating that MEG and EEG reflect similar processes. A distinct sensitivity of MEG and EEG to the sources of cortical oscillations, a better signal-to-noise ratio of MEG, as well as strong spatial blurring of potentials in EEG are most likely the reasons for the observed differences in the effects of alcohol on spontaneous oscillations as detected with two methods.

Specifically, we detail how the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique (and its magnetic counterpart) can aid in development of models of visual word recognition. Any viable and accurate account of reading must take into account the temporal and anatomical constraints imposed by the fact that reading is a human brain function. We believe that neurophysiological (especially, although not limited to electrophysiological) data can serve an essential reference in the development of biologically realistic models of reading. We assess just how well extant electrophysiological data comport with specific predictions of existing computational models and offer some suggestions for the kinds of research that can address some of the remaining open questions.

Study participants judged whether preexperimentally unfamiliar figures (meaningless line drawings) that were repeated up to four times contained a crossover in their contour. Stimulus repetition thereby led to a reduction of the visual NI component in event-related potentials as well as to a late (430-600 ms), successively increasing positivity over posterior electrodes. In particular, the size of this latter event-related potential effect highly correlated with and thus predicted participants' performance in a subsequent recognition memory test. It can therefore be interpreted as neural correlate of the creation of a new memory-effective stimulus representation.

The effects of caffeine have been studied using cognitive and motor measures, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and event-related potentials. However, these methods are not usually employed in combination, a fact that impairs the interpretation of the results. The objective of the present study was t. analyze changes in electrophysiological, cognitive and motor variables with the ingestion of caffeine, and to relate central to peripheral responses. For this purpose we recorded event-related potentials and eyes-closed, resting EEG, applied the Stroop test, and measured reaction time. Fifteen volunteers took caffeine (400 mg) or placebo in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. A significant reduction of alpha absolute power over the entire scalp and of P300 latency at the Fz electrode were observed after caffeine ingestion. These results are consistent with a stimulatory effect of caffeine, although there was no change in the attention (Stroop) test or in reaction time. The qEEG seems to be the most sensitive index of the changes produced by caffeine in the central nervous system since it proved to be capable of detecting changes that were not evident in the tests of cognitive or motor performance.

The utility of these neuroelectric measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric genetics is evaluated. Methods: This article reviews the main findings of EEG and ERP abnormalities in alcoholics, offspring of alcoholics at high risk to develop alcoholism and the electrophysiological effects of alcohol on high risk compared to low-risk offspring. It highlights findings using EROs, a fast developing tool in examining brain function and cognition. It also reviews evidence of genetic findings related to these electrophysiological measures and their relationship to clinical diagnosis. Results: Many of these abnormal neuroelectric measures are under genetic control, may precede the development of alcoholism, and may be markers of a predisposition toward the development of a spectrum of disinhibitory conditions including alcoholism. Genetic loci underlying some neuroelectic measures that involve neurotransmitter systems of the brain have been identified. Conclusions: Quantitative neuroelectric measures (EEG, ERPs, EROs) provide valuable endophenotypes in the study of genetic risk to develop alcoholism and related disorders. Significance: Genetic studies of neuroelectric endophenotypes offer a powerful strategy for identifying susceptibility genes for developing psychiatric disorders, and provide novel insights into etiological factors.

An omitted-stimulus paradigm induced the expectancy of the painful stimulation at the left hand. In the experimental condition, the painful stimulation was associated with a visual go/no-go task triggering right-hand movements. Two control conditions manipulated the painful sensorimotor interaction variable. Compared with the control conditions, the expectancy of the painful sensorimotor interaction increased the high-band alpha EEG oscillations over the right primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the nociceptive stimuli and, to a lesser extent, over the centroparietal midline. These findings suggest that concomitant painful stimuli and simple sensorimotor go/no-go demands affect anticipatory activity as revealed by alpha ERD.

J	Bugli, C; Lambert, P				Bugli, Celine; Lambert, Philippe			Functional ANOVA with random functional effects: an application to event-related potentials modelling for electroencephalograms analysis	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; P300; mixed model; P-splines; regression; functional ANOVA	SPLINES; CURVES	The differential effects of basic visual or auditory stimuli on electroencephalograms (EEG), named event related potentials (ERPs), are often used to evaluate the impact of treatments on brain performances. In the present paper, we propose a P-splines based model that can be used to evaluate treatment effect on the timing and the amplitude of some peaks of the ERPs curves. Functional ANOVA is an adaptation of linear model or analysis of variance to analyse functional observations. The changes in the functional of interest effects are generally described using smoothing splines. Eilers and Marx proposed to work with P-splines, a combination of B-splines and difference penalties on coefficients. We define a Psplines model for ERPs curves combined with random effects. In particular, we show that it is a useful alternative to classical strategies requiring the visual and usually imprecise localization of specific ERP peaks from curves with a low signal-to-noise ratio.

Dynamics of narrow-band EEG phase effects in the passive auditory oddball task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain dynamics; event-related potentials; mechanisms; orthogonal phase effects; phase synchronization; stimulus intensity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; STIMULUS ONSET; THETA-RESPONSE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; LATENCY; MEMORY; P300; ERP	Evidence suggests that the component frequencies of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are dynamically adjusted to provide particular brain states at stimulus occurrence, and that these facilitate cortical processing of the stimulus. We examined relationships between stimulus intensity, the phase of narrow-band EEG activity at stimulus onset, and the resultant event-related potentials (ERPs) in a passive auditory oddball task, using a novel conceptualization of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). EEG responses to the standard stimuli (50 vs. 80 dB, varied between subjects) were analysed. Prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1-Hz bands from 1 to 13 Hz) at Cz was assessed for each trial by digital filtering. For each frequency, the cycle at stimulus onset was used to sort trials into four phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz and Pz. Preferred brain states at various frequencies were indicated by 16-34% differential occurrence within the orthogonal phase dimensions explored. The preferred states were associated with smaller N1, N2 and N3, larger P2 and P3, shorter N1, P2, N2 and P3 latencies, and some intensity effects. These effects reflected the operation of three separate phase-influenced mechanisms, involving anticipatory potentials and prestimulus/poststimulus amplitudes in various EEG frequencies. Results indicate that, even in paradigms with a slightly varying interstimulus interval, brain dynamics provide preferred brain states at the moment of stimulus presentation, which differentially affect the EEG correlates of stimulus processing.

Methods: The BAs are approximated as deterministically chaotic dynamics. A Wavelet-based nonlinear noise reduction (WNNR) method consisting of: (a) wavelet transformation, (b) nonlinear noise reduction and (c) spatial average subtraction, is developed to effectively reduce the BAs so that the residual artifacts are smaller than the EEG signals. Results: The effectiveness of the WNNR method to remove the BAs with conservation of the temporal EEG signals is evaluated by simulations and experiments inside a 1.5 T static magnetic field, with the visual evoked EEG dynamics. The WNNR method is also demonstrated to effectively retrieve alpha waves while the subjects' eyes are closed. Conclusions: The WNNR method has the abilities to effectively remove the BAs and conserve the time-frequency features of EEG activity. Significance: The WNNR method provides us a significant technique to obtain clean temporal EEG signals during recording with MRI, especially for the event-related EEG dynamics. Notably, it might work effectively at higher field strengths as well. Moreover, it can be also used to process many other biological data contaminated by the cardiac pulses.

Distinct neural mechanisms for repetition effects of visual objects	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG/ERPs; fMRI; working memory; priming; temporal pole; LORETA	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; WORD REPETITION; FMRI; ADAPTATION; MODULATION; CORTEX; RECOGNITION	Repetition of visually common objects was examined in relation to prior intentional learning and memory status using a delayed match-to-sample task in humans. Both response time and two temporally separate event-related potential (ERP) components indexed repetition. The early repetition effect (similar to 200-550 ms) evoked more ERP responses for repeated visual objects, and was diminished by prior intentional learning (old/new) or being maintained in working memory (targets/distracters). In contrast, the late repetition effect (after similar to 550 ms) evoked reduced ERP activation for repeated items, and was not affected by prior learning or working memory status. Our source localization results indicate that the late and posterior repetition effect in visual cortex is consistent with repetition suppression results reported in monkey physiology and human fMRI studies. Mean-while, the early and anterior repetition effect, in temporal pole and frontol cortices, is modulated by explicit memory mechanisms. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, authors reviewed some studies on EFRP in games and in ergonomics and, secondly introduced a new system for assessment of visual entertainments by using EFRP. The distinctive feature of the system is that we can measure the ERP under the conditions where a subject moves eyes. This system can analyze EEG data from many sites on the head and can display in real time the topographical maps related to the brain activities. EFRP is classified into several components at latent periods. We developed a new system to display topographical maps at three latent regions in order to analyze in more detail psychological and neural activities in the brain. This system will be useful for assessment of the visual entertainment.

Event-related potentials (ER-Ps) were recorded from two groups of subjects, young (mean 22 years) and older adults (mean 58 years), who performed a four-alternative choice-reaction task. The results showed the expected reaction time slowing in the older subjects. This behavioural slowing was not due to delays in stimulus processing (as reflected by latencies of early ERP components), or in response selection (as reflected by the onset of the lateralized readiness potential). Instead, this slowing was due to an alteration of movement-related components, particularly an amplitude enhancement and prolongation of the motor-related potential at the cortex contralateral to the responding hand. This alteration was reliable and of general nature since it was also found in a second study using a different choice-reaction task with a more direct stimulus-response relation. The results suggest that the overt response requires a higher activation level in older vs. young subjects; this extra-activation needs time and hence prolongs reaction time with aging.

An analysis of two steps was applied to the ERP data. First, principal component analysis was performed to obtain significant ERP components. Then LORETA was applied to each component to localize their brain sources. The first six principal components were extracted, each of which showed different spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity. The results agree with other emotional study by fMRI or PET. The combination of PCA and LORETA can be used to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of ERP data in emotional processing.

Basic perceptive skills are important prerequisites for the infant's later development. The automatic cortical. processes related to processing auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli can be addressed by using responses recorded directly from the brain. The traditional method, the event-related potential (ERP), has recently been accompanied by ERFs. Similarly to ERPs, higher processes related to short-term memory, stimulus comparisons, and attention allocation can also be studied with ERFs. Further, since addressing the neonatal higher cognitive and social capabilities is challenging using only behavioural means, ERFs provide information on these important functions at a very early stage immediately after birth or in some cases even before birth. The main advantage of ERFs, compared to ERPs, is detection of the signals with high accuracy both with respect to the noise level and estimation of the spatial location. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Our attention to objects in our visual field is largely controlled endogenously, but is also affected exogenously through the influence of novel stimuli and events. The study of endogenous and exogenous attention as separate mechanisms has been possible in behavioral and functional imaging studies, where multiple stimuli can be presented continuously and simultaneously. It has also been possible in electroencephalogram studies using the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP); however, it has not been possible in conventional event-related potential (ERP) studies, which are hampered by the need to present suddenly onsetting stimuli in isolation. This is unfortunate as the ERP technique allows for the analysis of human physiology with much greater temporal resolution than functional magnetic resonance imaging or the SSVEP. While ERP studies of endogenous attention have been widely reported, these experiments have a serious limitation in that the suddenly onsetting stimuli, used to elicit the ERP, inevitably have an exogenous, attention-grabbing effect. Recently we have shown that it is possible to derive separate event-related responses to concurrent, continuously presented stimuli using the VESPA (visual-evoked spread spectrum analysis) technique. In this study we employed an experimental paradigm based on this method, in which two pairs of diagonally opposite, non-contiguous disc-segment stimuli were presented, one pair to be ignored and the other to be attended. VESPA responses derived for each pair showed a strong modulation at 90-100 ms (during the visual P1 component), demonstrating the utility of the method for isolating endogenous visuo-spatial attention effects.

A critical challenge to the fMRI-EEG/MEG integration lies in the spatial mismatches between fMRI activations and instantaneous electrical source activities. Such mismatches are fundamentally due to the fact that fMRI and EEG/MEG signals are generated and collected in highly different time scales. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical framework to solve the problem of fMRI-EEG integrated cortical source imaging. The new framework has two principal technical advancements. First, by assuming a linear neurovascular coupling, a method is rigorously derived to quantify the fMRI signal in each voxel as proportional to the time integral of the power of local electrical current source over the period of event related potentials (ERP). Second, the EEG inverse problem is solved for every time instant using an adaptive Wiener filter, in which the prior time-variant source covariance matrix is estimated by combining the quantified fMRI responses and the segmented EEG signals before response averaging. Our preliminary computer simulation results suggest that the proposed method provides a reliable technique for the fMRI-EEG integration and represents a significant advancement over the conventional fMRI-weighted EEG (or MEG) source imaging techniques, and is also applicable to fMRI-MEG integrated source imaging.

J	Fell, J				Fell, Juergen			Cognitive neurophysiology: Beyond averaging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Editorial Material							FIELD POTENTIALS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; PHASE-RESET; EEG; FMRI; RESPONSES; COMPLEX	Averaging of repeated responses to sensory stimuli is the standard approach in cognitive electro physiology. This procedure can give rise to inappropriate interpretations in some situations, because two factors contribute to the average ERP responses: the amplitude of the responses during the individual experimental trials, and the concentration of the phases (phase-locking) across responses. Larger post-stimulus single-trial amplitudes compared to prestimulus baseline are thought to correspond to a stimulus-related increase of postsynaptic potentials or/and activation of an increased amount of neural assemblies. But the functional interpretation of an enhanced inter-trial phase-locking is unclear. BOLD responses are probably related to single-trial EEG amplitudes, but not to the phase concentration across trials. Therefore, separation of amplitude and phase contributions is indispensable to avoid misinterpretations and to gain a deeper understanding of the relation between event-related EEG and fMRI.

Twelve patients with BPD and 12 healthy controls were additionally rated with the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS-10). Participants performed a Go/Nogo task while a 64 channel EEG was recorded. Three ERP components were of special interest: error-related negativity (ERN)/error negativity (Ne), early error positivity (early Pe) reflecting automatic error processing, and the late Pe component which is thought to mirror the awareness of erroneous responses. We found smaller amplitudes of the ERN/Ne in patients with BPD compared to controls. Moreover, significant correlations with the BIS-10 non-planning sub-score could be demonstrated for both the entire group and the patient group. No between-group differences were observed for the early and late Pe components. ERP measures appear to be a suitable tool to study clinical time courses in BPD. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison between Principal Component Analysis and independent component analysis in electroencephalograms modelling	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						EEG; ERP; ICA; PCA; statistical independence	INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; VISUAL-STIMULI; RARE TARGET; LOBE	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a classical technique in statistical data analysis, feature extraction and data reduction, aiming at explaining observed signals as a linear combination of orthogonal principal components. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique of array processing and data analysis, aiming at recovering unobserved signals or 'sources' from observed mixtures, exploiting only the assumption of mutual independence between the signals. The separation of the sources by ICA has great potential in applications such as the separation of sound signals (like voices mixed in simultaneous multiple records, for example), in telecommunication or in the treatment of medical signals. However, ICA is not yet often used by statisticians. In this paper, we shall present ICA in a statistical framework and compare this method with PCA for electroencephalograms (EEG) analysis.We shall see that ICA provides a more useful data representation than PCA, for instance, for the representation of a particular characteristic of the EEG named event-related potential (ERP).

Successful removal of fMRI scanning artifacts from continuous EEG in simultaneous recordings his been reported. We assessed the feasibility of recording reliable visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during fMRI scanning using available artifact removing procedures. EEG during administration of visual stimuli was recorded using MRI-compatible 32-channel equipment in nine normal subjects (mean age, 23.9 +/- 2.5 years), with and without fMRI acquisition. fMRI scanning and cardioballistographic artifacts were removed after subtraction of averaged artifact waveforms. Consistency between VEPs waveforms and of P1 and N1 peak latencies and amplitudes in the two conditions was assessed. Good correlation was found between VEP waveforms (Pearson's correlation coefficient: r(P) between 0.76-0.94 across subjects; P < 0.0001) and between latency or amplitude of P1 and N1 peaks (latencies: r = 0.7, P < 0.035; amplitudes: r > 0.65, P < 0.05; Spearman rank correlation coefficient) in the two recording conditions. No significant differences were found between P1 and N1 parameters in the two conditions (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Consistent VEP waveforms, latencies, and amplitudes with and without fMRI scanning indicate that reliable VEPs may be obtained simultaneously with fMRI recording. This possibility might be helpful by shortening recording times and reducing variability from learning, habituation, and fatigue phenomena from separate recordings for the integration of event-related EEG and fMRl data.

Methods: Nose-referenced ERPs (31 sites total) were recorded from 66 right-handed adults during oddball tasks using syllables or tones. Response mode (left press, right press, silent count) and task was varied within subjects. Spherical spline current source density (CSD) waveforms were computed to sharpen ERP scalp topographies and eliminate volume-conducted contributions. ERP and CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax) to disentangle temporally and spatially overlapping ERP and CSD components. Results: Corresponding ERP and CSD factors were unambiguously related to known ERP components. For example, the dipolar organization of a central N1 was evident from factorized anterior sinks and posterior sources encompassing the Sylvian fissure. Factors associated with N2 were characterized by asymmetric frontolateral (tonal: frontotemporal R > L) and parietotemporal (phonetic: parietotemporal L > R) sinks for targets. A single ERP factor summarized parietal P3 activity, along with an anterior negativity. In contrast, two CSD factors peaking at 360 and 560 ms distinguished a parietal P3 source with an anterior sink from a centroparietal P3 source with a sharply localized Fz sink. A smaller parietal but larger left temporal P3 source was found for silent count compared to button press. Left or right press produced opposite, region-specific asymmetries originating from central sites, modulating the N2/P3 complex. Conclusions: CSD transformation is shown to be a valuable preprocessing step for PCA of ERP data, providing a unique, physiologically meaningful solution to the ubiquitous reference problem. By reducing ERP redundancy and producing sharper, simpler topographies, and without losing or distorting any effects of interest, the CSD-PCA solution replicated and extended previous task- and response-related findings. Significance: Eliminating ambiguities of the recording reference, the combined CSD-PCA approach systematically bridges between montage-dependent scalp potentials and distinct, anatomically-relevant current generators, and shows promise as a comprehensive, generic strategy for ERP analysis.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed from EEG recordings during two conditions (memory and control). Timing and source localization of different generators taking part in visual information processing and short-term memory encoding were estimated. The main generators of P I, NI, and P2 event-related potentials were estimated in the primary visual, lateral occipital and posterior temporal, and medial parietal regions of the cortex. Furthermore, from later ERP's related to encoding of stimuli in memory, subsequent activations were estimated in anterior regions of the left temporal and frontal cortex between 300 and 450 ms. Definition of few most activated areas in these simple tasks (source localization was obtained from distributed and dipolar fitting inverse solutions) could be used in construction of simple, relatively reliable brain source models. Based on these multiple source models, applying weighted linear inverse filters to the continuous data, useful source signals could be extracted for time-frequency, event-related (de)synchronization and coherence analysis. The observed event-related theta frequency synchronizations and alpha frequency desynchronizations were related to stimulus encoding. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG was acquired during a lateralized, numeric Stroop working memory task that featured task-irrelevant aversive and neutral pictures between stimuli. Performance accuracy showed a right-hemisphere advantage for stimuli that followed aversive pictures. Response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) from accurate trials showed an early negative component (CRN; correct response/conflict-related negativity) followed by a positive wave comparable to the Pe (error positivity). The CRN was bi-peaked with an earlier peak that was sensitive to aversive pictures during early portions of the experiment and a later peak that increased with error likelihood later in the experiment. Pe amplitude was increased with aversive pictures early in the experiment and was sensitive to picture type, Stroop interference, and hemisphere of stimulus delivery during later trials. This suggests that ERP indices of performance monitoring, the CRN and Pe, are dynamically modulated by both affective and cognitive demands.

Since the peak of the grand-averaged P300 waveform was not clear, it was sometimes difficult to detect the amplitude and the latency. The removal of the noisy electroencephalography (EEG) waveform based on the cross-correlation between a grand-averaged waveform and each waveform was found to be effective for making the P300 waveform clear. The parameter extraction methods using a principal component analysis and temporal changes of the cross-correlation function between the grand-averaged waveform and each waveform were used to evaluate mental fatigue. The P300b component and the standard deviation of the lime lag T that corresponded to the maximum cross-correlation between the grand-averaged waveform and each EEG waveform were found to reflect some aspects of mental fatigue (the decreased function of cognitive information processing). Relevance to industry: Fatigue, especially mental fatigue, is inevitable for office workers and in life in general. Fatigue is usually related to a loss of efficiency and disinclination to effort. It is important to manage and cope with fatigue so that the workers do not damage their health. It is also possible that cumulative mental fatigue leads to decreased productivity in the workplace and induces critical errors in the worst cases. Therefore, the management of mental fatigue is important from the viewpoint of occupational risk management, productivity, and occupational health. This study presents a systematic approach to the evaluation of mental fatigue induced during a VDT task. The proposed method provides a useful means for evaluating the state of mental fatigue, which would be potentially applicable to the management of fatigue from the three viewpoints listed above and would lead to increased agility in an organization.

Brain connectivity network that could imply interaction and coordination between different brain regions is a focused research of brain function. Usually synchronization and correlation are used to reveal the connectivity network based on event-related potential (ERP) signals. However, these methods lack the further information such as direction of the connectivity network. In this paper, we performed an approach to detect the direction by Granger causality model. Considering the non-stationary of ERP data, we used traditional recursive least square (RLS) algorithm to calculate time variant Granger causality. In particular, we extended the method on the significance of causality measures in order to make results more reasonable. These approaches were applied to the classic Stroop cognitive experiment to establish the causality network related to attention process mechanism.

A serotonergic modulation of the sound level dependence only of the primary auditory cortex but not of the auditory association cortex has been suggested by a number of clinical and preclinical studies. Therefore, a precise covering of the activity of the primary auditory cortex seems necessary if sound level dependence is used as an indicator of the central serotonergic system. Recent fMRI studies described a pronounced sound level dependence only in the Heschl gyrus/primary auditory cortex but not in auditory association areas. In the present simultaneous 61-channel EEG and fMRI study investigating fourteen healthy subjects, we found a high correlation between the loudness-dependent change of the extent of fMRI activation (number of activated voxels) and the corresponding changes of the mean current source density within the same region of interest covering the primary auditory cortex (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Our findings suggest a close relationship between the fMRI signal and event-related potential activity. In addition, the correspondence of the ERP-based data and the fMRI results further supports the validity the ER-P localization approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study used multivariate genetic model fitting analytic techniques in 46 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic twin pairs. P300, P50 suppression, and MMN were recorded using a 19-channel electroencephalograph (EEG). Zygosity was determined using DNA genotyping. Little evidence for either genetic or environmental association between each of the three ERP paradigms was found. This result suggests that P300, MMN, and P50 suppression serve to evaluate different brain information processing functions that may be mediated by distinct neurobiological mechanisms which in turn are influenced by different sets of genes. Within paradigm, P300 amplitude and latency shared about half of their genetic effects. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Event-related potential (ERP) signals were recorded to tone pair stimuli at 62 electrode sites from the scalp using an oddball paradigm (a two-block design, inter-stimulus interval = 70 or 300 ms; frequency of tone pair = 100 vs. 100 Hz for the frequent and 100 vs. 300 Hz for the infrequent). Latencies and amplitudes of P-150, N-250, and mismatch negativity (MMN)-like components were compared between children with HPE and controls. Our results revealed less organized ERP waveforms to both stimuli in children with HPE, with diminished P-150 and N-250 components across brain area. Robust and delayed MMN-like responses were elicited from the children with HPE, with decreased MMN amplitudes in the central, parietal, occipital, and posterior temporal areas. Our results suggest that while brain sensory responses to auditory tones may be impaired in children with semi-lobar HPE, subcomponents of auditory discrimination processes remain functional.

High-density recordings traced this potential to a common frontoparietal network activated by attentional orienting and by response selection. Within this network, parietal and frontal cortex were activated sequentially, followed by an anterior-to-posterior migration of activity culminating in the lateral occipital cortex. Based on temporal and polarity information provided by EEG, we hypothesize that the frontoparietal activation, evoked by directional information, updates a task-defined preparatory state by deselecting or inhibiting the behavioral option competing with the cued response side or the cued direction of attention. These results from human EEG demonstrate a direct EEG manifestation of the frontoparietal attention network previously identified in functional imaging. EEG reveals the time-course of activation within this network and elucidates the generation and function of associated directing-attention EEG potentials. The results emphasize transient activation and a decision-related function of the frontoparietal attention network, contrasting with the sustained preparatory activation that is commonly inferred from neuroimaging.

Sequences were composed such that perceived differences in the cognitive processing between syntactically regular and irregular chords could not be due to the sensory processing of acoustic factors like pitch repetition, pitch commonality (the major component of "sensory dissonance"), or roughness. Three experiments with independent groups of subjects were conducted: a behavioral experiment and two experiments using electroencephalography. Irregular chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) in the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) under both task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions. Behaviorally, participants detected around 75% of the irregular chords, indicating that these chords were only moderately salient. Nevertheless, the irregular chords reliably elicited clear ERP effects. Amateur musicians were slightly more sensitive to musical irregularities than nonmusicians, supporting previous studies demonstrating effects of musical training on music-syntactic processing. The findings indicate that the ERAN is an index of music-syntactic processing and that the ERAN can be elicited even when irregular chords are not detectable based on acoustical factors such as pitch repetition, sensory dissonance, or roughness.

Neural redundancy and plastic remodelling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modem neurophysiological techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index normal and abnormal brain aging to facilitate non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies. The present review provides a perspective of these issues by assaying different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results with functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, with applications at the individual level also suggested. Integrated approaches utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost and non-invasive evaluation of at-risk populations. Practical implications of the methods are emphasized. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The oscillatory ERP patterns of two components are well described by the phase resetting and the inter-trial phase coherency. A method for the estimation of the nonlinear dynamic dependency between two components is proposed. According to the method, the coupling is asymmetric with the coupling from the B to the a rhythms stronger than the reversed one. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Subjects were tested with dichotic pairs of six consonant-vowel (CV) syllables that initially started with a voiced (/ba/, /da/, /ga/) or a voiceless stop consonant (/pa/, /ta/, /ka/). Electrophysiological correlates were analyzed by a low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) approach to estimate the sources of NI event-related potentials (ERP) in the 3D brain. Results: Behavioral and electrophysiological measures revealed different ear advantages and ERP amplitude measures for voiced and voiceless syllables. Fronto-central NI amplitudes were larger for syllables with voiced than voiceless initial consonants. LORETA source estimates revealed a lateralization effect, with stronger leftward lateralization for voiced than voiceless CV syllables. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that auditory lateralization is affected by temporal cues in CV syllables. The lateralization effect suggests that functional hemispheric differences exist at an early prelexical level of speech processing.

Familial risk for depression and P3b component as a possible neurocognitive vulnerability marker	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						depression; event-related potentials; P3b component, vulnerability marker; target detection; source analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION MEMORY; TOMOGRAPHY; P300; PREDISPOSITION; ABNORMALITIES; ALCOHOLISM; ATTENTION; AMPLITUDE; EEG	Objective: Complex genetic mechanisms are involved in the vulnerability to depressive disorders and cognitive dysfunctions found in depression. This study was performed to explore the effect of the familial risk for depression on electrophysiological correlates of attentional functions as demonstrated by an event-related potential (ERP) go/no-go experiment. Methods: The component P3b as an indicator of target detection processing was investigated in two groups of healthy subjects with or without a family history of depression (n = 14 each). An electrophysiological source localization method (LORETA) was employed to allow a neuroanatomical interpretation for the ERP data. Results: The group with a familial risk for depression showed a reduced P3b amplitude over left temporal areas in contrast to the control group. This two-dimensional effect was associated with a significantly reduced activation of the left middle temporal gyrus. Conclusions: The P3b amplitude decrement might represent a neurocognitive vulnerability marker for the development of depression. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

We compute an estimator of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the symbolic dynamics measuring the coherence of threshold-crossing events. Hence, we utilize the inherent noise of the EEG for sweeping the underlying ERP components beyond the encoding thresholds. Plotting the SNR computed within the time window of a particular ERP component (the N400) against the encoding thresholds, we find different resonance curves for the experimental conditions. The maximal differences of the SNR lead to the estimation of optimal encoding thresholds. We show that topographic brain maps of the optimal threshold voltages and of their associated coherence differences are able to dissociate the underlying physiological processes, while corresponding maps gained from the customary voltage averaging technique are unable to do so.

The results include a comparison with previously reported event-related potential (ERP) findings from the same paradigm. Unisensory-auditory (A), unisensory-visual (V), and multisensory (AV) stimuli were presented to the left and right hemispaces while subjects attended to a designated side to detect deviant target stimuli in either sensory modality. For attended multisensory stimuli we observed larger evoked GBRs approximately 40-50 ms post-stimulus over medial-frontal brain areas compared with those same multisensory stimuli when unattended. Further analysis indicated that the integration effect and its attentional enhancement may be caused in part by a stimulus-triggered phase resetting of ongoing gamma-band responses. Interestingly, no such early interaction effects (< 90 ms) could be found in the ERP waveforms, suggesting that oscillatory GBRs may be more sensitive than ERPs to these early latency attention effects. Moreover, no GBR attention effects could be found for the unisensory auditory or unisensory visual stimuli, suggesting that attention particularly affects the integrative processing of audiovisual stimuli at these early latencies.

Single-trial event-related potential (ERP) data are usually averaged firstly to analysis in order to increase their signal/noise in electroen-cephalographic (EEG) experiment. However, averaging ignores the trial-by-triall variation of the amplitude. Our approach is based upon the two techniques: decorrelation with a high-level additive noise reduction and decomposition of individual source components. The results on the unaveraged auditory evoked potential single-trial data analysis illustrate that not only the behavior and location but also the activity strength (amplitude) and dynamics of the individual evoked response can be visualized by the proposed method.

Three stimulus categories were prepared: SELF (participant's own objects), FAMILIAR (disposable and public objects, defined as objects with less-self-relevant familiarity), and UNFAMILIAR (others' objects). The participants' task was to watch the stimuli passively. Results showed that left-lateralized N250 activity differentiated SELF and FAMILIAR from UNFAMILIAR, but SELF and FAMILIAR were not differentiated. In the later time-course, SELF was dissociated from FAMILIAR, indicating the self-relevance effect in object recognition at this stage, This activity did not show consistent lateralization, in contrast to previous studies reporting right lateralization in self-relevant face and name recognition. We concluded that in object recognition, self-relevance was processed by higher-order cognitive functions later than 300 ms after stimulus onset. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In Experiment 1, participants classified the relatedness between gestures and words. In Experiment 2, they attended to stimuli, and performed an incidental recognition memory test on words presented during the EEG recording session. Event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to the onset of probe words were measured, along with response latencies and word recognition rates. Although word relatedness did not affect reaction times or recognition rates, contextually related probe words elicited less-negative ERPs than did unrelated ones between 3 00 and 500 msec after stimulus onset (N400) in both experiments. These findings demonstrate sensitivity to semantic relations between iconic gestures and words in brain activity engendered during word comprehension.

The background of this study is a recent debate about the functional meaning of evoked and induced gamma oscillations. Brain electrical source analysis (BESA) and low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) was performed on the basis of the event-related potential (ERP) data. A component at around 230 ms (termed C230) showed strongest differences between objects and scrambled objects. Time-frequency analyses were run across electrodes and within the dipole sources. We found increased gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) between 200 and 300 ms for real objects. This effect was strongest in a fronto-medial source. Induced gamma, as also shown in previous studies, reflects the more task-relevant mechanism where object representations become activated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in auditory GO/NOGO task before and after 15-22 sessions of EEG biofeedback. Each session consisted of 20 min of enhancing the ratio of the EEG power in 15-18 Hz band to the EEG power in the rest of spectrum, and 7 - 10 min of enhancing of the ratio of the EEG power in 12-15 Hz to the EEG power in the rest of spectrum with C3-Fz electrodes' placements for the first protocol and C4-Pz for the second protocol. On the basis of quality of performance during training sessions, the patients were divided into two groups: good performers and bad performers. ERPs of good performers to GO and NOGO cues gained positive components evoked within 180-420 ms latency. At the same time, no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-training ERPs were observed for bad performers. The ERP differences between post- and pretreatment conditions for good performers were distributed over frontal-central areas and appear to reflect an activation of frontal cortical areas associated with beta training.

This task has been previously analyzed by conventional event-related potential (ERP) computation, and Slow Potentials (SPs) were seen to be highly variable across subjects in topography and generators [Basile LF, Brunetti EP, Pereira JF Jr, Ballester G, Amaro E Jr, Anghinah R, Ribeiro P, Piedade R, Gattaz WE (2006) Complex slow potential generators in a simplified attention paradigm. Int J Psychophysiol. 61(2):149-57]. We obtained 124-channel EEG recordings from 12 individuals and computed latency-corrected peak averaging in oscillatory bursts. We used currentdensity reconstruction to model the generators of attention-related activity that would not be seen in ER-Ps, which are restricted to stimulus-locked activity. We intended to compare a possibly found spectral correlate of attention, in topographic variability, with stimulus-related activity. The main results were (1) the detection of two bands of attention-induced beta range oscillations (around 25 and 21 Hz), whose scalp topography and current density cortical distribution were complex multi-focal, and highly variable across subjects (topographic dispersion significantly higher than sensory-related visual theta induced band-power), including prefrontal and posterior cortical areas. Most interesting, however, was the observation that (2) the generators of task-induced oscillations are largely the same individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during the pre-stimulus baseline. We concluded that attention-related electrical cortical activity is highly individual-specific, and possibly, to a great extent already established during mere resting wakefulness. We discuss the critical implications of those results, in combination with results from other methods that present individual data, to functional mapping of cortical association areas.

Electrophysiological prognostication and brain injury from cardiac arrest	SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						electroencephalography; somatosensory evoked potentials; cardiorespiratory arrest; anoxic coma; prognosis; outcome	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ANOXIC-ISCHEMIC COMA; LOCKED-IN-SYNDROME; LATERALIZED EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; ALPHA-THETA-COMA; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; NONTRAUMATIC COMA; INTENSIVE-CARE	Anoxic coma after cardiorespiratory arrest warrants precocious investigation to establish probable outcome. Electroencephalogram (EEG) may uncover subclinical seizures; EEG grades have provided accurate prognosis of poor and favorable outcomes, but are weakest in those patients in between. Somatosensory evoked potentials now have proven benefit in accurately establishing a poor outcome (death or persistent vegetative state) when cortical responses (N20) are absent. These studies are particularly helpful when clinical examination of coma, early on, might yield uncertain prognosis (i.e., when brain stem reflexes are present). Combining clinical examination with electrophysiology has increasingly Yielded multimodality approaches to early prognostication of coma after cardiorespiratory arrest, with more recent studies using event-related and middle-latency potentials showing promise for distinguishing good outcome (to consciousness), from awake but vegetative states. Further studies are warranted for this multimodality approach which, hopefully, may yield more widespread practical use of these testing modalities.

Comparative multiresolution wavelet analysis of ERP spectral bands using an ensemble of classifiers approach for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; wavelets; event-related potentials; ensemble classifiers	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MULTIPLE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS; MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; TARGET DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS	Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming an increasingly important healthcare concern. Prior approaches analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) had varying degrees of success, primarily due to smaller study cohorts, and the inherent difficulty of the problem. A new effort using multiresolution analysis of ERPs is described. Distinctions of this study include analyzing a larger cohort, comparing different wavelets and different frequency bands, using ensemble-based decisions and, most importantly, aiming the earliest possible diagnosis of the disease. Surprising yet promising outcomes indicate that ERPs in response to novel sounds of oddball paradigm may be more reliable as a biomarker than the more commonly used responses to target sounds.

Healthy marijuana users 0 2 men, 11 women) participated in four sessions. They were randomly assigned to a low or a high Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol group (THC; 1.8% versus 3.6%). In the four sessions under blinded conditions subjects smoked marijuana cigarettes containing placebo (no active cannabinoids), or cigarettes containing THC with low or high levels of cannabichromene (CBC; 0.1% versus 0.5%) and low or high levels of cannabidiol (CBD; 0.2% versus 1.0%). Dependent measures included subjective reports, measures of cognitive task performance and neurophysiological measures [electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP)]. Compared to placebo, active THC cigarettes produced expected effects on mood, behavior and brain activity. A decrease in performance, reduction in EEG power and attenuation of ERP components reflecting attentional processes were observed during tests of working memory and episodic memory. Most of these effects were not dose-dependent. Varying the concentrations of CBC and CBD did not change subjects' responses on any of the outcome measures. These findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that THC and its metabolites are the primary active constituents of marijuana. They also suggest that neurophysiological EEG and ERP measures are useful biomarkers of the effects of THC.

In this paper, we present and evaluate a more robust and efficient optimization approach, named chaotic simulated annealing (CSA) algorithm. The key idea of CSA is to replace the Gaussian distribution by a chaotic sequence in the conventional standard simulated annealing (SSA). The effectiveness of the new method was confirmed by the computer simulation and the preliminary application to the early event-related potential (ERP) of a spatial visual attention experiment. Our results showed that CSA has better robustness and higher feasibility compared with other methods for global optimization problem. Also, the positive results of dipole localization using CSA were achieved for an ERP study.

Current research efforts are primarily devoted to the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs), extracted from the ongoing EEG, in patients with schizophrenia and in clinically unaffected individuals who, due to their family history and current mental status, are at high risk for developing schizophrenia. In this article, we discuss the potential usefulness of ERPs and EROs as genetic vulnerability markers, as pathophysiological markers, and as markers of possible ongoing progressive cognitive and cortical deterioration in schizophrenia. Our main purpose is to illustrate that these neurophysiological measures can offer valuable quantitative biological markers of basic pathophysiological mechanisms and cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia, yet they may not be specific to current psychiatry's diagnosis and classification. These biological markers can provide unique information on the nature and extent of cognitive and brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, they can be utilized to gain deeper theoretical insights into illness etiology and pathophysiology and may lead to improvements in early detection and more effective and targeted treatment of schizophrenia. We conclude by addressing several key methodological, conceptual, and interpretative issues involved in this research field and by suggesting future research directions.

We examined the differences of processing recognizable and unrecognizable pictures as reflected by changes in cortical networks within the time-window of a determined event-related potential (ERP) component, namely the N400. Fourteen participants performed an image recognition task, while sequentially confronted with pictures of recognizable and unrecognizable objects. The time-window of N400 as indicative of object semantics was defined from the ERP. Differences of PDC in the beta-band between these tasks were represented topographically as patterns of electrical couplings, possibly indicating changing degrees of functional cooperation between brain areas. Successful memory retrieval of picture meaning appears to be supported by networks comprising left temporal and parietal regions and bilateral frontal brain areas.

The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations.

Methods: Eight normal subjects were instructed to perform six types of self-paced tool-use pantomime and communicative gesture movements with the right hand. We recorded 64-channel EEG using a linked ear reference and electromyogram (EMG) from right thumb and forearm flexors. Results: Data revealed early slow wave components of the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) beginning over the left parietal area about 3 s before movement onset, similarly for both movement types. At movement onset, maximal amplitude was present over central and bilateral sensorimotor areas. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta band was seen over the left parietal and sensorimotor cortices during preparation, later spreading to the homologous area of the right hemisphere. Alpha ERD was mainly in the left sensorimotor cortex about 1.5 s before movement onset. Beta ERD in mesial frontal areas was greater during preparation for tool use compared to communicative gesture movements. Mesial frontal beta event-related synchronization (ERS) developed more rapidly after communicative gestures than tool-use. Conclusions: The dynamics of parietal and frontal activities indicates the timing of these areas in the production of praxis. The posterior parietal cortex contributes to the early slow wave negativity of the MRCP. Significance: Planning self-paced praxis movements begins as early as 3 s before movement in the left parietal area and subsequently engages frontal cortical regions.

Brain event-related potentials: Diagnosing early-stage Alzheimer's disease	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERPs); neurophysiology; Alzheimer's disease; diagnostic; EEG; principal components analysis (PCA); discriminant analysis; P3; CNV; "storage" component	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CLINICAL UTILITY; P300; DEMENTIA; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	A pattern of components from brain event-related potentials (ERPs) (cognitive non-invasive electrical brain measures) performed well in separating early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects from normal-aging control subjects and shows promise for developing a clinical diagnostic for probable AD. A Number-Letter task elicited brain activity related to cognitive processes. In response to the task stimuli, brain activity was recorded as ERPs, whose components were measured by principal components analysis (PCA). The ERP component scores to relevant and irrelevant stimuli were used in discriminant analyses to develop functions that successfully classified individuals as belonging to an early-stage Alzheimer's disease group or a like-aged Control group, with probabilities of an individual belonging, to each group. Applying the discriminant function to the developmental half of the data showed 92% of the subjects were correctly classified into either the AD group or the Control group with a sensitivity of 1.00. The two crossvalidation results were good with sensitivities of 0.83 and classification accuracies of 0.75-0.79. P3 and CNV components, as well as other, earlier ERP components, e.g. C145 and the memory "Storage" component, were useful in the discriminant functions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kahkonen, S; Rossi, EM; Yamashita, H				Kahkonen, S; Rossi, EM; Yamashita, H			Alcohol impairs auditory processing of frequency changes and novel sounds: a combined MEG and EEG study	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol; attention; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; N1; mismatch negativity; P3a	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; ACUTE ETHANOL; REACTION-TIME; BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; INTOXICATION; METABOLISM	Rationale: Alcohol has been shown to impair involuntary attention studied by event-related potentials using mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a. Objectives: However, no studies have investigated whether alcohol affects the magnetic counterparts of N1 (N1m), MMN (MMNm) and P3a (P3am). Methods: Auditory evoked potentials and magnetic fields elicited by infrequent deviant tones differing in frequency (5% and 20% change) and novel sounds were recorded with whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Stimuli were presented separately to the left and right ear. Eleven right-handed subjects were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled (0.8 g/kg ethanol or juice), cross-over design. N1m, MMNm, and P3am were calculated from the channel pair at the temporal cortex showing the strongest responses in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation. N1, MMN and P3a were analyzed from 12 electrodes at the midline frontocentral area. Results: Alcohol reduced bilaterally N1, N1m, MMN and MMNm amplitudes. P3a amplitudes, but not P3am amplitudes were also significantly decreased. No effects of alcohol on the latencies of N1, MMN and P3a or their magnetic counterparts were observed. Conclusions: Alcohol impairs the processing of tones, frequency change and novel sounds at different phases of auditory processing similarly in both hemispheres. MEG provides us with additional information unobtainable with EEG about the effects of alcohol on the neural correlates of cognition.

Single-trial EEG dynamics of object and face visual processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED RESPONSES; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; PHASE DIFFERENCES; ALPHA; COMPONENT; RESET; N170	There has been extensive work using early event-related potentials (ERPs) to study visual object processing. ERP analyses focus traditionally on mean amplitude differences, with the implicit assumption that all of the neuronal activity of interest is evoked by the stimulus in a time-locked manner from trial to trial. However, several recent studies have suggested that visual ERP components might be explained to a large extent by the partial phase resetting of ongoing activity in restricted frequency bands. Here we apply that approach to the neural processing of visual objects. We examine the single-trial dynamics of the EEG signal elicited by the presentation of noise textures, houses and faces. We show that the brain response to those stimuli is best explained by amplitude increase that is maximal in the 5- to 15-Hz frequency band. The results indicate also the presence of a substantial increase in phase coherence in the same frequency band. However, analyses of residual activity, after subtracting the mean from single trials, show that this increase in phase coherence is not due to phase resetting per se, but rather to the presence of the ERP +noise in each trial. In keeping with this idea, a simulation demonstrates that a purely evoked model of the ERP produces quantitatively very similar results. Finally, the stronger response to faces compared to other objects (the `N170 face effect') can be explained by a pure modulation of amplitude centered in the 5- to 15-Hz band. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This inverse effect might reflect general regularities of masked priming or be either due to the task-relevant elements of the mask or to special features of arrows. Here we report a slow negative EEG potential recorded from the scalp above the visual cortex, which is evoked by masks that contain arrows. Even being evoked when arrows masks were presented in isolation, this "Nd-mask" appeared to be an obligatory response. Yet Nd-mask was enhanced when primes and targets were arrows and was reduced in the other cases, and even reversed its polarity with appropriate control stimuli. These findings provide support both for the special status of arrows and for the notion of mask relevance. Nd-mask might be one instance of negative EEG potentials evoked by stimuli with familiar gestalts.

Questions about how task sets are engaged, maintained, and shifted have recently become a major focus of research on executive control processes. We employed dense-array (128-channel) event-related potential (ER-P) methodology to examine the dynamics of brain systems engaged during the preparation and implementation of task switching. The EEG was recorded While participants performed letter and digit judgments to pseudorandomly-ordered, univalent (#3, A %) and bivalent (G5) stimulus trials, with the appropriate task cued by a colored rectangle presented 450 ms before target onset. Results revealed spatial and temporal variations in brain activity that could be related to preparatory processes common to both switch and repeat trials, switch-specific control processes engaged to reconfigure and maintain task set under conflict, and visual priming benefits of task repetition. Despite extensive practice and improvement, both behavioral and ERP results indicated that subjects maintained high levels of executive control processing with extended task engagement. The patterns of ERP activity obtained in the present study fit well with functional neuroanatomical models of self-regulation of action. The frontopolar and right-lateralized frontal switch effects obtained in the present study are consistent with the role of these regions in adapting to changing contextual contingencies. In contrast, the centroparietal P3b and N384 effects related to the contextual ambiguity of bivalent trials are consistent with the context monitoring and updating functions associated with the posterior cingulate learning circuit.

Fifty-one subjects (n = 17 in each group) performed the stop-signal task, which consisted of a visual choice reaction time (RT) task and auditory stop-signals, while EEG was recorded. The original EEG data (0.01-30 Hz) was subsequently filtered to separate slow-wave (0.01-2 Hz) and residual (2-30 Hz) activity. Performance findings revealed that stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) decreased from the child to young-adult group and then showed a small increase in the middle-aged adult group. Original ERPs revealed decreasing N1 and N2 amplitudes and increasing P2 and P3 amplitudes across the scalp with increasing age for successful-stop trials. These developmental effects did not occur in the residual waveforms after removal of slow-wave activity. For failed-stop trials, a response-locked negative component, identified as the error-negativity (Ne), showed an age-related decrease in amplitude across the scalp in the residual, but not the original, waveform. The error-positivity (Pe) increased in amplitude with age in the original data, but this was accounted for by a positive slow-wave (PSW). Together, the findings suggest that underlying slow-wave activity accounts for a large number of developmental effects in the traditionally quantified ERP components, but may also obscure effects occurring in residual activity. These findings highlight the importance of dissociating low- and higher-frequency ERP activity in developmental research.

In the present study, the time course and underlying mechanisms for such fast differentiation are of interest. We investigated the involvement of the primary visual cortex in affective evaluation of conditioned stimuli (CSs). In order to elicit learning within the visual system we chose affective pictures as unconditioned stimuli and used laterally presented gratings as CSs. Using high-density electroencephalography, we demonstrated modulation of the C1 visual event-related component for threat-related stimuli versus neutral stimuli, which increased with continuing acquisition of affective meaning. The differentiation between aversive and neutral visual stimuli occurred as early as 65-90 ms after stimulus onset and suggested involvement of the primary visual areas in affective evaluation. As an underlying mechanism, we discuss short-term reorganization in visual cortex, enabling sensory amplification of specific visual features that are related to motivationally relevant information.

Methods: The sample consisted of 17 (11 males, 6 females), right-handed, healthy, volunteer participants. Event-related activity was recorded under the omitted stimulus paradigm. Alpha response was obtained through digital filtering. The alpha response of each participant was separately analyzed. Results: The ARIMA(0,2,1) model was found to be applicable to alpha response that was evoked by stimulus omission. ARIMA (0,2,1) shows that this activity is short-lasting and it fluctuates stochastically. Conclusion: The present study showed that the alpha responses of single participants obtained under the omitted stimulus paradigm were best modeled by the ARIMA (0, 2, 1) type of time series model.

According to the requirements of the applied method, it is useful to simplify tasks for methodological reasons. In the present study we tested whether ERP measures are also suitable for analyzing complex tasks. In order to do this, we developed an analysis strategy based on the post hoc analysis of the behavioural data. We applied this method to a pursuit-tracking task of 25 s trial duration, consisting of repeated and non-repeated waveforms, where subjects had to track a target cross with a mouse-controlled cursor cross. An EEG was recorded from 62 channels. Response-locked ERPs were computed for two types of error correction: the correction of errors induced externally by the change of target direction and of internal errors generated by the subject itself. We found several ERP components that could be assigned to different feedback and feed-forward controlled processing steps in the frontoparietal circuitry underlying visuomotor control, such as movement planning, movement execution (motor potential), reafferent activity, visuospatial analysis, and attentional (P300) processes. Our results support newer models that propose a role for the posterior parietal cortex in integrating multimodal sensory information. In addition, fast (about 180 ms and probably facilitated by anticipation) and slow (about 230260 ms) error corrections could be differentiated by the time course of ERP activity. Our results show that complex (motor) tasks can be investigated with ERPs. This opens fruitful perspectives for future research on motor control in an ecological setting. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For this study, the RMM representing the three basic tissues of the human head (brain, skull and scalp) was superimposed on a spherical volume mimicking the head volume: it included 43 102 resistances and 14 123 nodes. The validation was performed with reference to the analytical model by consideration of a set of four dipoles close to the cortex. Using the RMM and the chosen dipoles, four distinct families of interpolation technique (nearest neighbour, polynomial, splines and lead fields) were tested and compared so that the scalp potentials could be recovered from the electrode potentials. The 3D spline interpolation and the inverse forward technique (IFT) gave the best results. The IFT is very easy to use when the lead-field matrix between scalp electrodes and cortex nodes has been calculated. By simple application of the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse matrix to the electrode cap potentials, a set of current sources on the cortex is obtained. Then, the forward problem using these cortex sources renders all the scalp potentials.

It has been found that distinct auditory features (such as frequency or intensity) are encoded separately in sensory memory. Nevertheless, the conjunction of these features (auditory "gestalts") can also be encoded in auditory sensory memory. Here we investigated how auditory and visual features of bimodal events are represented in sensory memory by recording audiovisual MMNs in two different audiovisual oddball paradigms. The results of a first ERP experiment showed that the sensory memory representations of auditory and visual features of audiovisual events lie within the temporal and occipital cortex, respectively, yet with possible interactions between the processing of the unimodal features. In a subsequent MEG experiment, we found some evidence that audiovisual feature conjunctions could also be represented in sensory memory These results, thus, extend to the audiovisual domain a number of properties of sensory memory already established within the auditory system.

Neuropsychological research has yielded contradicting results regarding WM in OCD. Eighteen patients with OCD symptomatology and 20 normal controls (age and sex matched) were subjected to a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded from 15 scalp electrodes (leads). A dedicated computer software was developed to read the ERP signals and to calculate features related to the ER-P P600 component (500-800 ms). Nineteen features were generated, from each ER-P-signal and each lead, and were employed in the design of the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier. Highest single-lead precision (86.8%) was found at the Fp2 and C6 leads. When the output from all single-lead PNN classifiers fed a Majority Vote Engine (MVE), the system classified correctly all subjects, providing a powerful classification scheme. Findings indicated that OCD patients differed from normal controls at the prefrontal and temporo-central brain regions.

Specifically, the P3a and P3b subcomponents are extracted from an ERP incorporating some prior knowledge of the desired signals. The method reliably extracts the desired P300 subcomponents with great accuracy. One advantage of BSE algorithms over Blind Signal Separation (BSS), which have been used in EEG research, is that the algorithm focuses on one source instead of trying to extract all of the sources simultaneously which involves indeterminacy in the number of sources. To testify the performance of the algorithm, some experiments are shown which are performed on real EEG data.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 15 French and 15 Japanese volunteers during the presentation of neutral and emotional pictures in their own country. ERPs were analyzed by means of spatio-temporal Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and allow to evaluate cultural influences on emotional processing along three temporal windows: 105 to 140 ms, 176 to 230 ms and 255 to 455 ms. Main results highlight that (1) early ERP components coded emotional charge but were not modulated by cultural background, (2) later components showed a significant decrease of amplitudes at parieto-occipital areas for Japanese participants compared to French ones in emotional condition. These findings suggest that, in both populations, similar neurocognitive processes are involved in the early stage of the emotional stimuli processing and effects observed on later components may reflect a poorer engagement of parietal areas, known to be involved in emotional arousal dimension. Considering that cognitive judgments were similar in both populations, electrophysiological findings suggest that cultural influences on later stage of emotional processing could be related to the known lower level of emotionally expressive behavior in Japanese than in Caucasians.

Predominance of negative symptoms also reflects the degree of deficit in schizophrenia and is associated with poorer pre-morbid functioning, lower IQ, and poorer outcomes. However, a consistent relationship between auditory sensory gating and negative symptoms in schizophrenia has yet to be demonstrated. The absence of such a finding is surprising, since both impaired auditory gating and negative symptoms have been linked with impaired fronto-temporal cortical function. The present study measured auditory gating using the P50 event related potential (ERP) in a paired-click paradigm and capitalized on the relative localization advantage of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess auditory sensory gating in terms of the event related field (ERF) M50 source dipoles on bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG). The primary hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between lateralized M50 auditory sensory gating measures and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. A standard paired-click paradigm was used during simultaneous EEG and MEG data collection to determine S2/S1 sensory gating ratios in a group of 20 patients for both neuroimaging techniques. Participants were administered the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Consistent with previous reports, there was no relationship between ERP P50 sensory gating and negative symptoms. However, right (not left) hemisphere ERF M50 sensory gating ratio was significantly and positively correlated with negative symptoms. This finding is compatible with information processing theories of negative symptoms and with more recent findings of fronto-temporal abnormality in patients with predominantly negative symptoms.

Recent theories of working memory suggest that they are closely linked, and in fact share certain brain mechanisms. We used a sequential motion imitation task in combination with EEG and ERP techniques for a direct, online examination of memory load's influence on the processing of visual stimuli. Using a paradigm in which subjects tried to reproduce random motion sequences from memory, we found a systematic decrease in ERP amplitude with each additional motion segment that was viewed and memorized for later imitation. High frequency (> 20 Hz) oscillatory activity exhibited a similar position-dependent decrease. When trials were sorted according to the accuracy of subsequent imitation, the amplitude of the ERPs during stimulus presentation correlated with behavioral performance: the larger the amplitude, the more accurate the subsequent imitation. These findings imply that visual processing of sequential stimuli is not uniform. Rather, earlier information elicits stronger neural activity. We discuss possible explanations for this observation, among them competition for attention between memory and perception and encoding of serial order by means of differential activation strengths.

J	Frisch, S; Graben, PB				Frisch, S; Graben, PB			Finding needles in haystacks: Symbolic resonance analysis of event-related potentials unveils different processing demands	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related brain potential; language processing; argument structure; symbolic dynamic; stochastic resonance	STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; TUTORIAL	Previous ERP studies have found an N400-P600 pattern in sentences in which the number of arguments does not match the number of arguments that the verb can take. In the present study, we elaborate on this question by investigating whether the case of the mismatching object argument in German (accusative/direct object versus dative/indirect object) affects processing differently. In general, both types of mismatches elicited a biphasic N400 P600 response in the ERP. However, traditional voltage average analysis was unable to reveal differences between the two mismatching conditions, that is, between a mismatching accusative versus dative. Therefore, we employed a recently developed method on ER-P data analysis, the symbolic resonance analysis (SRA), where EEG epochs are symbolically encoded in sequences of three symbols depending on a given parameter, the encoding threshold. We found a larger proportion of threshold crossing events with negative polarity in the N400 time window for a mismatching dative argument compared to a mismatching accusative argument. By contrast, the proportion of threshold crossing events with positive polarity was smaller for dative in the P600 time window. We argue that this difference is due to the phenomenon of "free dative" in German. This result also shows that the SRA provides a useful tool for revealing ERP differences that cannot be discovered using the traditional voltage average analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This may be annoying to some people and acceptable to others. The aim of this study was to examine, by means of event-related potentials (ERPs), the possible influence of this noise on brain activity while performing a mental reasoning task. Subjects carrying out tasks in a silent environment were compared with two groups executing the same tasks in an "fMRI-like" noisy environment, one of which consisted of subjects who were annoyed by the noise and the other of subjects who tolerated it easily. Subjects who were annoyed performed less well (i.e., produced more errors compared to the "no noise" group) and "not annoyed" subjects showed a speed-accuracy trade-off (i.e., reacted faster but made more errors compared to "no noise" subjects). Noise led to more pronounced NI1and P2 peaks but attenuated N2. As early ERP components are influenced by attention, this observation most likely reflects different attentional requirements. The slow cortical negative shift during task processing was significantly attenuated with,annoyed" subjects compared to "not annoyed" subjects. Emotion-related subcortical structures may be responsible for the observed difference. These findings suggest that individual reactions to fMRI scanner noise should be taken into account when designing fMRI studies and interpreting results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although it is impossible to square all findings obtained across and within methodologies, a consistent pattern of generators has emerged, with target-related responses in the parietal cortex and the cingulate and novelty-related activations mainly in the inferior parietal and prefrontal regions. Stimulus modality-specific contributions come from the inferior temporal and superior parietal cortex for the visual and from the superior temporal cortex for the auditory modality. The P300 continues to be an important signature of cognitive processes such as attention and working memory and of its dysfunction in neurologic and mental disorders. It is increasingly being investigated as a potential genetic marker of mental disorders. Knowledge about the generators of the P300 will be crucial for a better understanding of its cognitive significance and its continuing clinical application.

Integrative neuroscience: The role of a standardized database	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; age; database; genetics; individual differences; neuroimaging; neuropsychology; psychiatry; psychophysiology; regression		Most brain related databases bring together specialized information, with a growing number that include neuroimaging measures. This article outlines the potential use and insights from the first entirely standardized and centralized database, which integrates information from neuroirnaging measures (EEG, event related potential (ERP), structural/functional MRI), arousal (skin conductance responses (SCR)s, heart rate, respiration), neuropsychological and personality tests, genomics and demographics: The Brain Resource International Database. It comprises data from over 2,000 "normative" subjects and a growing number of patients with neurological and psychiatric illnesses, acquired from over 50 laboratories (in the USA, United Kingdom, Holland, South Africa, Israel and Australia), all with identical equipment and experimental procedures. Three primary goals of this database are to quantify individual differences in normative brain function, to compare an individual's performance to their database peers, and to provide a robust normative framework for clinical assessment and treatment prediction. We present three example demonstrations in relation to these goals. First, we show how consistent age differences may be quantified when large subject numbers are available, using EEG and ERP data from nearly 2,000 stringently screened normative subjects. Second, the use of a normalization technique provides a means to compare clinical subjects (50 ADHD subjects in this study) to the normative database with the effects of age and gender taken into account. Third, we show how a profile of EEG/ERP and autonomic measures potentially provides a means to predict treatment response in ADHD subjects. The example data consists of EEG under eyes open and eyes closed and ERP data for auditory oddball, working memory and Go-NoGo paradigms. Autonomic measures of skin conductance (tonic skin conductance level, SCL, and phasic skin conductance responses, SCRs) were acquired simultaneously with central EEG/ERP measures. The findings show that the power of large samples, tested using standardized protocols, allows for the quantification of individual differences that can subsequently be used to control such variation and to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of comparisons between normative and clinical groups. In terms of broader significance, the combination of size and multidimensional measures tapping the brain's core cognitive competencies, may provide a normative and evidence-based framework for individually-based assessments in "Personalized Medicine."

This research studied pre-movement EEG from shoulder-elbow movement in stroke survivors to identify signal characteristics potentially useful for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation. Pre-movement event-related desynchronization (ERD) was examined in the alpha band mu rhythm for control (n = 7) and stroke subjects (n = 11). Subjects were all right-hand dominant; stroke subjects used their impaired arm and controls were assigned a side to match stroke subjects. Both non-dominant-arm-tested stroke and control subjects exhibited greater ERD intensity vs. those using their dominant arm (p < 0.05). Also, pre-movement ERD was detected in stroke survivors, which suggests at the possibility of using ERD as a BCI system control signal. However, the peak ERD of stroke survivors was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (p < 0.05), which brings doubt to whether the intensity of ERD in stroke survivors is large enough to be used as a BCI system control signal.

However, in most studies combining the two techniques, the acquisition of functional MR images has been interleaved with the recording of evoked potentials. In this study we investigated the feasibility of recording pain-related evoked potentials during continuous and simultaneous collection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MR images at 3 T. Brain potentials were elicited by selective stimulation of cutaneous A delta and C nociceptors using brief radiant laser pulses (laser-evoked potentials, LEPs). MR-induced artifacts on EEG data were removed using a novel algorithm. Latencies, amplitudes, and scalp distribution of LEPs recorded during fMRI were not significantly different from those recorded in a control session outside of the MR scanner using the same equipment and experimental design. Stability tests confirmed that MR-image quality was not impaired by the evoked potential recording, beyond signal loss related to magnetic susceptibility differences local to the electrodes. fMRI results were consistent with our previous studies of brain activity in response to nociceptive stimulation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording reliable pain-related LEPs and fMRI responses simultaneously. Because LEPs collected during fMRI and those collected in a control session show remarkable similarity, for many experimental designs the integration of LEP and MRI data collected in separate, single-modality acquisitions may be appropriate. Truly simultaneous recording of LEPs and fMRI is still desirable in specific experimental conditions, such as single-trial, learning, and pharmacological studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that variance in nonspatial attention and switches of attention toward target locations can account for variance in reaction times of neutral trials. Lateralized event-related potentials (ERPs) and changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands served as predictor variables in a single-trial logistic regression analysis to predict the direction of spatial attention in cued and neutral trials. The contingent negative variation (CNV) and nonlateralized changes in the alpha hand served as markers of nonspatial attention. The direction of attention in cued trials was reliably predicted from single-trial lateralized ERP components. In neutral trials, only evidence for nonspatial attention was found, indicated by increases in the CNV and decreases in alpha preceding targets to which responses were relatively fast.

Using a wavelet-based analysis, we investigated how power changes and phase clustering in different frequency bands contribute to the averaged event-related potentials (ERPs). In addition, we analyzed the actual mean phases of the different oscillations. Our analyses yielded the following results: (1) power changes contributed significantly only to the late components of the ERPs (> 400 ms) (2) earlier ERP components were produced by a stimulus-related broad-band phase and amplitude reset of ongoing oscillatory activity about 190 ms after stimulus onset that involved not only the theta band, but also covered alpha and lower beta band frequencies (3) phase and amplitude reset occurred during an epoch of increased phase entrainment over time that lasted for about two oscillation periods for all involved frequencies and was more pronounced for correct rejections than for hits. The broad-band phase and amplitude reset was observed for both hits and correct rejections, and therefore, did not appear to support a specific cognitive function, but rather to act as a general facilitating factor for the processes involved in this memory task. Further analyses of synchronization between oscillations and power changes in different frequency bands revealed a task-dependent modulation of gamma activity by the entrained theta cycle, a mechanism potentially related to memory encoding and retrieval in the rhinal cortex and hippocampus, respectively.

Facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia: When and why does it go awry?

This study examined event-related potential (ERP) responses to emotional faces in schizophrenia patients and controls to determine when, in the temporal processing stream, patient abnormalities occur. Method: 16 patients and 16 healthy control participants performed a facial emotion recognition task. Very sad, somewhat sad, neutral, somewhat happy, and very happy faces were each presented for 100 ms. Subjects indicated whether each face was '' Happy '', '' Neutral '', or '' Sad ''. Evoked potential data were obtained using a 32-channel EEG system. Results: Controls performed better than patients in recognizing facial emotions. In patients, better recognition of happy faces correlated with less severe negative symptoms. Four ERP components corresponding to the P100, N170, N250, and P300 were identified. Group differences were noted for the N 170 '' face processing '' component that underlies the structural encoding of facial features, but not for the subsequent N250 '' affect modulation '' component. Higher amplitude of the N 170 response to sad faces was correlated with less severe delusional symptoms. Although P300 abnormalities were found, the variance of this component was explained by the earlier N170 response. Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate abnormalities in early visual encoding of facial features that precedes the ERP response typically associated with facial affect recognition. This suggests that affect recognition deficits, at least for happy and sad discrimination, are secondary to faulty structural encoding of faces. The association of abnormal face encoding with delusions may denote the physiological basis for clinical misidentification syndromes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The same sense thymine-to-cytosine polymorphism (c.1629T-C; Ser543Ser) was shown to preferentially modulate early components in both modalities. Specifically, the auditory NI component amplitude was higher for T allele homozygotes than for C allele carriers. The visual P1 component revealed the same pattern of significant polymorphic modulation, but the later N1 amplitude differences were only marginally significant. There was no reliable indication of interactions between genotype and task factors. Parallel modulation of early latency modality-specific event-related potential (ERP) components in vision and audition may indicate that the CHRNA4 polymorphism affects factors that are common to top-down modulation of sensory processing across modalities.

Event Related Potentials (ERPs) are measures that reflect the responses of the brain to events in the external or internal environment of the organism. P300 is the most important and the most studied component of the ERP. In this paper, a new method for P300 wave detection is introduced. It consists of two components: feature extraction and classification. For feature extraction, Mexican hat wavelet coefficients provide robust features when averaged over different scales. Classification has been carried out using rough set based methods. The overall results show that P300 wave detection can be performed using only five EEG channels. This in turn reduces the computational time compared to the averaging method that uses more channels.

In the present study, we examined whether these results only hold for errors in choice reaction time experiments and Stroop tasks or extend to errors of commission in a Go/NoGo task, as well. We investigated the electrophysiological correlates of error monitoring in 11 patients with OCD and 11 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed a Go/NoGo task while a 64-channel EEG was recorded. Our study focused on three ERP components: the error-related negativity (ERN)/error negativity (Ne), the "early" error positivity ("early" Pe) reflecting automatic error processing, and the "late" error positivity ("late" Pe), which is thought to mirror the awareness of erroneous responses. Artifact-free EEG-segments were used to compute ERPs on correct Go trials and incorrect NoGo trials (i.e., errors of commission), separately. Patients with OCD showed enhanced (more negative) ERN/Ne amplitudes compared to control subjects. Groups did not differ with regard to the early Pe component and the late Pe component. Our results support the view that compulsivity in OCD patients is related to hyper-functioning error monitoring processes.

Evidence suggests, however, that P50 amplitude is selectively impaired in nonparanoid, but not paranoid, schizophrenia subtypes. Furthermore, paired-click suppression can appear deficient in schizophrenia due to smaller evoked responses to the first stimulus (S 1), rather than larger, less effectively "gated" responses to the second (S2). Finally, the P50 ERP is comprised of activity from at least two frequency components that may be distinctly impaired: the gamma band, associated with sensory registration, and the low frequency response, associated with attention/encoding processes. P50 and related frequency subcomponents were examined as a function of illness subtype to further integrate these concepts. Method: The standard paired-click paradigm was administered to 38 schizophrenia (27 paranoid, 11 nonparanoid) and 38 age-matched healthy control participants. P50 amplitudes and spectral power of gamma band (GBR; 20-50 Hz) and low frequency (LFR; 1-20 Hz) responses were analyzed. Results: P50 analyses revealed smaller S1 amplitude and normal S2 in schizophrenia participants collectively, but no differentiation of schizophrenia subtypes. Spectral analyses revealed smaller magnitude S1 and normal S2 responses in schizophrenia across both the GBR and LFR. The LFR, but not GBR, was found to distinguish nonparanoid from control groups, while paranoid participants evidenced no impairment in either frequency domain. LFR amplitude values correlated with clinical ratings of cognitive symptomatology. Conclusions: ERP deficits in the dual-click paradigm were specific to S I amplitudes and most prominent in the low frequency response. These results replicate previous findings and extend their relevance to schizophrenia subtype distinctions. implications for the recurrent inhibition model of sensory gating are discussed.

Based on the characteristics of the transient evoked potential (EP) and the background noise, the mixed dictionary is constructed with an over-complete wavelet dictionary and an over-complete discrete cosine (DC) function dictionary, and the signal is separated by learning in this mixed dictionary with a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. MOSCA is designed specifically for the separation of a desired transient EP from the existing spontaneous EEG or other background noise. The method was evaluated with several simulation tests in which EPs or simulated EPs were deeply masked in different strong noise backgrounds, and the recovered signal is similar to the original assumed EP with a high and stable correlation coefficient (CC). The method was then applied to estimate event related potential (ERP) in the classical oddball experiment, and the results confirmed that the trial number for a reliable ERP estimation might be greatly reduced by MOSCA.

Methods: Components of stimulus- and response-related potentials (ERPs/RRPs) and lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were analyzed in two groups of young (mean 22.5 years) and older adults (mean 58.3 years) during an auditory and a visual four-choice-reaction task. Results: (1) Reaction time (RT) depended on the SR type, indicating SR-specific differences in processing, which did not vary with age. (2) For each SR type, the RT increased with age. RT slowing was not accompanied by significant delays in early stimulus processing (as reflected by P1 and N1 latencies) nor in response selection (as reflected by the onset of stimulus-locked LRP), but resulted from a prolongation of contralateral motor activity during motor response execution indexed by earlier, longer durated and larger motor-related potentials in older adults. These aging effects were observed for each SR type. Conclusion: In a four-choice-reaction task, (1) task complexity rather than differences in cognitive strategy or activation patterns subserving SR-specific processing leads to response slowing with aging and (2) the most plausible contributor to this slowing is the cortical response generation system.

It solves the blind source separation problem (BSS). The EEG satisfies most of the assumptions of ICA, so it may be an adequate signal for ICA for its use. In this paper we review the method and the applications of ICA in EEG. The studied applications are: a) artifacts removal; b) source estimation of spikes; c) analysis of seizures. Several studies have demonstrated that ICA is useful to remove artifacts from contaminated EEG records without distorting cerebral activity. It is able to decompose epileptic discharges and seizures in independent spatio-temporal components. In combination with techniques of source localisation, as dipole modelling, ICA improves the localization of the epileptic focus. Finally, we discuss the future role of ICA in the study of epileptic patients.

In the present research we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to test the common hypothesis that this component is generated in the caudal anterior cingulate cortex. The EEG results indicated that our paradigm, a time estimation task with trial-to-trial performance feedback, elicited a large feedback-related negativity (FRN). Nevertheless, the fMRI results did not reveal any area in the caudal anterior cingulate cortex that was differentially activated by positive and negative performance feedback, casting doubt on the notion that the FRN is generated in this brain region. In contrast, we found a number of brain areas outside the posterior medial frontal cortex that were activated more strongly by positive feedback than by negative feedback. These included areas in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, and striatum. An anatomically constrained source model assuming equivalent dipole generators in the rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and right superior frontal gyrus produced a simulated scalp distribution that corresponded closely to the observed scalp distribution of the FRN. These results support a new hypothesis regarding the neural generators of the FRN, and have important implications for the use of this component as an electrophysiological index of performance monitoring and reward processing.

We used a neuronally plausible model to characterise the dependency of response components on the models parameters. This generative model was a neural mass model of hierarchically arranged areas using three kinds of inter-area connections (forward, backward and lateral). We investigated how responses, at each level of a cortical hierarchy, depended on the strength of connections or coupling. Our strategy was to systematically add connections and examine the responses of each successive architecture. We did this in the context of deterministic responses and then with stochastic spontaneous activity. Our aim was to show, in a simple way, how event-related dynamics depend on extrinsic connectivity. To emphasise the importance of nonlinear interactions, we tried to disambiguate the components of event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs) that can be explained by a linear superposition of trial-specific responses and those engendered nonlinearly (e.g., by phase-resetting). Our key conclusions were; (i) when forward connections, mediating bottom-up or extrinsic inputs, are sufficiently strong, nonlinear mechanisms cause a saturation of excitatory interneuron responses. This endows the system with an inherent stability that precludes nondissipative population dynamics. (ii) The duration of evoked transients increases with the hierarchical depth or level of processing. (iii) When backward connections are added, evoked transients become more protracted, exhibiting damped oscillations. These are formally identical to late or endogenous components seen empirically. This suggests that late components are mediated by reentrant dynamics within cortical hierarchies. (iv) Bilateral connections produce similar effects to backward connections but can also mediate zero-lag phase-locking among areas. (v) Finally, with spontaneous activity, ERPs/ERFs can arise from two distinct mechanisms: For low levels of (stimulus related and ongoing) activity, the systems response conforms to a quasi-linear superposition of separable responses to the fixed and stochastic inputs. This is consistent with classical assumptions that motivate trial averaging to suppress spontaneous activity and disclose the ERP/ ERE However, when activity is sufficiently high, there are nonlinear interactions between the fixed and stochastic inputs. This interaction is expressed as a phase-resetting and represents a qualitatively different explanation for the ERP/ERF. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to explore differential cortical processing during executive control in schizophrenia as assessed with the attention network test (ANT). Methods: Sixteen schizophrenic patients and sixteen healthy controls matched for gender, age, education, and nicotine consumption were tested with the ANT while recording 29-channel-electroencephalogram (EEG). Visual event-related potentials (ERP) N200 and P300 were topographically analyzed and cortical mapping using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was applied to localize neuroelectric generators of ERP. Results: Behaviourally, significant differences between schizophrenic patients and controls were found only for the conflict condition (p < 0.05) and for conflict adjusted by mean reaction time (p < 0.01). Examining ERP of control subjects, N200 failed to show robust flanker congruency effects. P300 amplitude was reduced at Pz (p < 0.05) and P300 latency was increased at Cz (p < 0.005) for the conflict condition. Schizophrenic patients differed significantly in P300 latency at Cz during late conflict processing (P < 0.005). Source analysis revealed a deficit in anterior cingulate cortex (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results are in line with previous reports about dysfunctional ACC activation in schizophrenia and argue in favour of a selective deficit of cortical conflict resolution. It is further proposed that dysfunctional ACC activation during executive processing may be a neurophysiologic endophenotype candidate of schizophrenia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The application of computerized signal analysis to EEG recordings collected using standardized procedures has made it possible to obtain quantitative descriptions of brain electrical activity (QEEG) in normal individuals and patients with disorders of brain function or structure, as well as quantitative description of the ways in which centrally active medications alter this activity (Pharmaco-EEG or "PEEG"). With the emergence of three-dimensional EEG source localization techniques, it has recently become possible to visualize the mathematically most probable generators of QEEG abnormalities within the brain as well as the neuroanatomical regions where abnormal activity is most altered by efficacious medication. As QEEG and PEEG have evolved, a vast body of facts has been accumulated, describing changes in the EEG or event-related potentials (ERPs) observed. in a variety of brain disorders or after administration of a variety of medications. With some notable exceptions, these studies,have, tended to be phenomenological rather than analytic. There has not been a systematic attempt to integrate these phenomena in order to build better understanding of how the abnormal behaviors of a particular psychiatric patient might be related to the specific pattern of the deviant electrical activity, nor just how pharmacological reduction of that deviant activity may have resulted in more normal behavior. This article is an endeavor to provide a more specific theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of the homeostatic system underlying the regulation of the QEEG, and the mechanisms revealed by Pharmaco-EEG that aid in correcting these illnesses.

This can be a challenge in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who are often unable to participate reliably in clinical evaluations. With recent advances in computer instrumentation and signal processing, evoked potentials and event-related potentials show increasing promise as powerful tools for prognosticating the trajectory of recovery and ultimate outcome from the TBI. Short- and middle-latency evoked potentials can now effectively predict coma outcomes in patients with acute TBI. Long-latency event-related potential components hold promise in predicting recovery of higher order cognitive abilities.

Inherited auditory-cortical dysfunction in twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						auditory cortex; electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG); schizophrenia; twins	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; HUMAN-BRAIN; BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES; ABNORMALITIES; REDUCTION; EXPERIENCES; MECHANISMS	Background-Information on the inheritance of neurophysiological abnormalities might help elucidate the molecular genetic basis of schizophrenia. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the inheritance of auditory-cortical deficiencies in twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia. Methods: Auditory EEG/MEG responses to frequent standard and occasional deviant tones were measured in mono- and dizygotic (MZ and DZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and demographically matched healthy twin pairs, recruited from a total population cohort. The MEG/EEG results were regressed against the genetic resemblance to patients with schizophrenia across the patients' unaffected MZ/DZ co-twins and control subjects (with genetic correlations of 1, .5, and 0 to schizophrenia patients, respectively). Results. The EEG responses P50, N100, and mismatch negativity (MMN), as well as the MEG response P50m, were reduced in the schizophrenic patients. P50 and N100 were significantly decreased also in their unaffected co-twins, as compared with the control subjects. Importantly, the P50 and N100 decrease correlated with the unaffected subjects' genetic resemblance to schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest inherited abnormalities in cortical auditory processing in schizophrenia, reflected by the decreased P50/P50m and N100 amplitudes, whereas the MMN abnormalities might reflect predominantly state-dependent neurodegeneration.

Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms are instrumental in addressing cognitive functions such as visual attention, and they are increasingly combined with the measurement of electrical brain activity. In the present study, gamma-band responses for target and standard stimuli were investigated in an RSVP oddball paradigm. In a first study, stimuli were presented at a frequency of 10 Hz, the stimulus sequence consisted of rare colored letters (targets) and frequent black letters (standards). In addition, stimulus size was varied across experimental blocks. Significant target modulations were observed for the P3 ERP and induced (i.e., not phase-locked) gamma-band responses. Besides this late activation, no further gamma-band responses were observed. A second study aimed at replicating these findings by employing a reduced stimulus presentation rate of 7.1 Hz. Again, besides the P3 ERP a late increase in induced gamma-band activity was observed. However, as compared to Study 1, this induced response was less pronounced. The induced gamma-band response observed in the present studies might reflect utilization of information derived from previous processing steps for behavioral performance or memory storage as suggested in the 'match-and-utilization-model' of gamma activity.

We examined thirteen patients with OCD and thirteen age-, sex-, and education matched healthy controls using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed a hybrid flanker-Go/Nogo task while multichannel EEG was recorded. Our study focused on two ERP components: the Nogo-N2 and the Nogo-P3, which have been discussed in the context of response inhibition and response conflict. Artifact-free EEG-segments were used to compute ERPs on correct Go trials (button press) and correct Nogo trials (no button press), separately. Patients with OCD showed enhanced (more negative) Nogo-N2 amplitudes than controls, and a significant difference in amplitudes between Nogo-N2 and Go-N2 trials (more negative for Nogo trials) at central midline electrode positions. However, groups did not differ with regard to the Nogo-P3 and Go-P3. The present study replicates and extends previous findings of altered executive control processes in OCD patients.

Theta EEG dynamics of the error-related negativity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						error-related negativity; event-related potentials; theta; oscillations; phase-resetting; wavelet	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES	Objective: The error-related negativity (ERN) is a response-locked brain potential (ERP) occurring 80-100 ms following response errors. This report contrasts three views of the genesis of the ERN, testing the classic view that time-locked phasic bursts give rise to the ERN against the view that the ERN arises from a pure phase-resetting of ongoing theta (4-7 Hz) EEG activity and the view that the ERN is generated - at least in part - by a phase-resetting and amplitude enhancement of ongoing theta EEG activity. Methods: Time-domain ERP analyses were augmented with time-frequency investigations of phase-locked and non-phase-locked spectral power, and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) computed from individual EEG trials, examining time courses and scalp topographies. Simulations based on the assumptions of the classic, pure phase-resetting, and phase-resetting plus enhancement views, using parameters from each subject's empirical data, were used to contrast the time-frequency findings that could be expected if one or more of these hypotheses adequately modeled the data. Results: Error responses produced larger amplitude activity than correct responses in time-domain ERPs immediately following responses, as expected. Time-frequency analyses revealed that significant error-related post-response increases in total spectral power (phase- and non-phase-locked), phase-locked power, and ITPC were primarily restricted to the theta range, with this effect located over midfrontocentral sites, with a temporal distribution from approximate to 150-200 ms prior to the button press and persisting up to 400 ms post-button press. The increase in non-phase-locked power (total power minus phase-locked power) was larger than phase-locked power, indicating that the bulk of the theta event-related dynamics were not phase-locked to response. Results of the simulations revealed a good fit for data simulated according to the phase-locking with amplitude enhancement perspective, and a poor fit for data simulated according to the classic view and the pure phase-resetting view. Conclusions: Error responses produce not only phase-locked increases in theta EEG activity, but also increases in non-phase-locked theta, both of which share a similar topography. Significance: The findings are thus consistent with the notion advanced by Luu et al. [Luu P, Tucker DM, Makeig S. Frontal midline theta and the error-related negativity; neurophysiological mechanisms of action regulation. Clin Neurophysiol 2004; 115:1821-35] that the ERN emerges, at least in part, from a phase-resetting and phase-locking of ongoing theta-band activity, in the context of a general increase in theta power following errors.

Developmental studies inform debates about the specificity of social functions in the adult cortex. This review highlights recent work, mainly based on electroencephalography/event-related potential methods, examining the precursors of the human social brain network during infancy in several domains such as face and eye gaze processing, the perception of emotions, decoding biological motion, perceiving human actions and joint attention. The findings illustrate that the human brain is fundamentally adapted to develop within a social context, and that this context contributes to many of the specializations seen in the adult cortex.

Since the original preparation of that review, a significant number of studies have been published using techniques such as electroencephalography, event-related potentials and positron emission tomography to investigate electromagnetic field effects upon human physiology and various measures of performance (cognitive, perceptual, behavioral). We review these recent studies, and when effects were observed, we reference the time course of observed effects (immediate or delayed). In our concluding remarks, we discuss a number of variables that are not often considered in human bioelectromagnetics studies, such as personality, individual differences and the specific laterality of ELF MF and mobile phone exposure over the brain. We also consider the sensitivity of various physiological assays and performance measures in the study of biological effects of electromagnetic fields.

Videos were followed by one of four types of picture probes: cross-modal related probes were congruent with both speech and gestures; speech-only related probes were congruent with information in the speech, but not the gesture; and two sorts of unrelated probes were created by pairing each related probe with a different discourse prime. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by picture probes were measured within the time windows of the N300 (250-350 ms post-stimulus) and N400 (350-550 ms post-stimulus). Cross-modal related probes elicited smaller N300 and N400 than speech-only related ones, indicating that pictures were easier to interpret when they corresponded with gestures. N300 and N400 effects were not due to differences in the visual complexity of each probe type, since the same cross-modal and speech-only picture probes elicited N300 and N400 with similar amplitudes when they appeared as unrelated items. These findings extend previous research on gesture comprehension by revealing how iconic co-speech gestures modulate conceptualization, enabling listeners to better represent visuo-spatial aspects of the speaker's meaning.

Anticipatory cortical responses during the expectancy of a predictable painful stimulation. A high-resolution electroencephalography study. Eur. J. Neurosci. 18 (6) 1692-700). This study tested the hypothesis that alpha ERD before predictable painful stimuli is reduced as an effect of distraction. A visual warning stimulus preceded a laser painful stimulation, which was strictly followed by visual imperative stimuli. In the Pain (control) condition, no task was required after the imperative stimuli. In the Pain + Movement condition, subjects had to perform a movement of the right index finger. In the Pain + Cognition condition, they had to mentally perform an arithmetical task. EEG data were recorded in 10 subjects from 30 electrodes. Artifact-free recordings were spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian transformation. Alpha ERD was computed at three alpha sub-bands according to subjects' individual alpha frequency peak (i.e., about 6-8 Hz, 8-10 Hz, 10-12 Hz). Compared to the control condition, the subjects reported a significantly lower stimulus intensity perception and unpleasantness in the Pain + Movement and Pain + Cognition conditions. In addition, there was a cancellation of the alpha 3 ERD (i.e., about 10-12 Hz) in Pain + Cognition condition and even a generation of a statistically significant alpha 3 ERS in Pain + Movement condition. These effects were maximum over fronto-central midline. These results suggest that distraction during the expectancy of pain is related to a reduced neural desynchronization of fronto-central midline alpha rhythms (i.e., reduced cortical activation) towards an overt hyper-synchronization (cortical idling).

Because a Kanji character can be discriminated visually and linguistically from other characters, in Kanji character discrimination, we hypothesized that frontal event-related potential (ERP) waveforms reflect two discrimination processes in separate time periods: one based on visual analysis and the other based on lexcical access. To examine this hypothesis, we recorded ERPs while performing a Kanji lexical decision task. In this task, either a known Kanji character, an unknown Kanji character or a symbol was presented and the subject had to report if the presented character was a known Kanji character for the subject or not. The same response was required for unknown Kanji trials and symbol trials. As a preprocessing of signals, we examined the performance of a method using independent component analysis for artifact rejection and found it was effective. Therefore we used it. In the ERP results, there were two time periods in which the frontal ERP wavefoms were significantly different betweeen the unknown Kanji trials and the symbol trials: around 170ms and around 300ms after stimulus onset. This result supported our hypothesis. In addition, the result suggests that Kanji character lexical access may be fully completed by around 260ms after stimulus onset.

Treating an averaged event-related potential (ERP) data is a main approach in recent topics of applying independent component analysis (ICA) to EEG signal processing. By taking the average, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) is increased, however, some important information such as the trial-by-trial variation of the amplitude will be lost during the averaging. On the other hand, the analysis of single-trial data will generally be hard in the low SNR. This paper presents a robust pre-whitening technique with ICA approach for the unaveraged single-trial EEG data. Our approach is based upon the two techniques: decorrelation with a high-level additive noise reduction and decomposition of individual source components. The results on the unaveraged visual evoked potential (VEP) single-trial data analysis illustrate that not only the behavior and location but also the activity strength (amplitude) and dynamics of the individual evoked response can be visualized by the proposed method.

J	Morup, M; Hansen, LK; Herrmann, CS; Parnas, J; Arnfred, SM				Morup, M; Hansen, LK; Herrmann, CS; Parnas, J; Arnfred, SM			Parallel Factor Analysis as an exploratory tool for wavelet transformed event-related EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						PARAFAC; CANDECOMP; decomposition; ERP; ITPC; gamma coherence; multi-way arrays; channel-time-frequency analysis; wavelet analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; POTENTIAL COMPONENTS; BRAIN RESPONSES; ALGORITHM; DECOMPOSITION; STATISTICS; COMPLEXITY; UNIQUENESS; RESOLUTION; ARRAYS	In the decomposition of multi-channel EEG signals, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) have widely been used. However, as both methods are based on handling two-way data, i.e. two-dimensional matrices, multi-way methods might improve the interpretation of frequency transformed multi-channel EEG of channel x frequency x time data. The multiway decomposition method Parallel Factor (PARAFAC), also named Canonical Decomposition (CANDECOMP), was recently used to decompose the wavelet transformed ongoing EEG of channel x frequency x time (Miwakeichi, F., Martinez-Montes, E., Valdes-Sosa, P.A., Nishiyama, N., Mizuhara, H., Yamaguchi, Y., 2004. Decomposing EEG data into space-time-frequency components using parallel factor analysis. Neuroimage 22, 1035-1045). In this article, PARAFAC is used for the first time to decompose wavelet transformed event-related EEG given by the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) encompassing ANOVA analysis of differences between conditions and 5-way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition. A flow chart is presented on how to perform data exploration using the PARAFAC decomposition on multi-way arrays. This includes (A) channel x frequency x time 3-way arrays of F test values from a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) between two stimulus conditions; (B) subject-specific 3-way analyses; and (C) an overall 5-way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition. The PARAFAC decompositions were able to extract the expected features of a previously reported ERP paradigm: namely, a quantitative difference of coherent occipital gamma activity between conditions of a visual paradigm. Furthermore, the method revealed a qualitative difference which has not previously been reported. The PARAFAC decomposition of the 3-way array of ANOVA F test values clearly showed the difference of regions of interest across modalities, while the 5-way analysis enabled visualization of both quantitative and qualitative differences. Consequently, PARAFAC is a promising data exploratory tool in the analysis of the wavelets transformed event-related EEG. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 11 musicians and 12 nonmusicians in passive and active conditions. All pitches of the E major scale were presented, with the first-scale pitch having a higher frequency of occurrence than the others. Among the six infrequently presented scale pitches, results showed largest NI for the fifth-scale pitch highest in the scale pitch structure. This suggested enhanced neural representations for a pitch high in hierarchy. Moreover, in musicians the amplitude of P3 was modulated by the status of the pitch. Taken together, the hierarchical tonal relations may be probed by ERPs to sparsely presented tones of the scale.

A new electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system utilizing active segment selection and multiresolution fractal features is designed and tested for single-trial EEG classification. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the proposed system consists of three main procedures including active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. The active segment selection is based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, and is used to obtain the optimal active time segment in the time-frequency domain. We then utilize a modified fractal dimension to extract multiresolution fractal feature vectors from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) data for movement classification. By using a simple linear classifier, we find significant improvements in the rate of correct classification over the conventional approaches in all of our single-trial experiments for real finger movement. These results can be extended to see the good adaptability of the proposed method to imaginary movement data acquired from the public databases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Evoked (P3) and induced ERD/ERS changes were studied in six subjects with drug-resistant epilepsy. Depth EEG activity from the mesiotemporal limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus) was analyzed. We used an averaging of raw data to obtain ERPs, and an averaging of the amplitude/power envelope (complex demodulation) in five frequency bands: theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma to obtain ERD/ERS. The P3 component of ERP and ERD/ERS in response to target and nontarget stimuli were evaluated. Results: Even though both P3 and ERD/ERS phenomena were observed in all of the investigated mesiotemporal regions, the most pronounced findings were revealed in the hippocampus. A P3 component of ERP was repeatedly observed in the hippocampus after target stimuli. Significant changes in the oscillatory hippocampal activity were found: ERD in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 frequency bands. Evident, near-significant changes were observed throughout the hippocampus in the theta band. No apparent ERD/ERS changes in the beta or in the gamma frequency band were seen in our intracerebral data. The distribution of the P3 and ERD/ERS maxima differed slightly in adjacent contacts, but occurred at the same time. Conclusions: The cognitive processing of visual information is simultaneously accompanied by several electrophysiological phenomena. In addition to ERPs, apparent changes in oscillatory activity were detected in the intracerebral recordings from mesiotemporal limbic structures. Timing of both neuronal processes seems to be simultaneous, but differing spatial distribution could reflect the involvement of different networks.

The approach was applied to a promising finding (increased electroencephalogram [EEG] Theta in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). A meta-analysis for the effect sizes was performed. Seventeen studies were included (12 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis). The majority of papers met criteria for Step 1. A number of papers qualified for Step 2 or Step 3. The effect size of the total sample for absolute theta was 0.58 and for relative theta 0.92. The proposed schema was able to classify a representative biological finding into a specific phase of development as a diagnostic tool. Based on the meta-analysis, the authors conclude that increased EEG theta activity in ADHD is promising and should be further developed as a diagnostic test.

J	Mathews, S; Dean, PJA; Sterr, A				Mathews, Simon; Dean, Phil John Ainsley; Sterr, Annette			EEG dipole analysis of motor-priming foreperiod activity reveals separate sources for motor and spatial attention components	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; source localisation; movement preparation; LRP; ADAN; LDAP; BESA	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; ADVANCE MOVEMENT PREPARATION; EXTRASTRIATE BODY AREA; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ERP EVIDENCE; BRAIN; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; SACCADES; OVERLAP	Objective: This study employed EEG source localisation procedures to study the contribution of motor preparatory and attentional processing to foreperiod activity in an S1-S2 motor priming task. Methods: Behavioural and high-density event-related potential (ERP) data were recorded in an S1-S2 priming task where participants responded to S2 with a left or right-hand button press. S1 either provided information about response hand (informative) or ambiguous information (uninformative). Results: Responses were significantly faster in informative trials compared with uninformative trials. Dipole source analysis of foreperiod lateralized ERPs revealed sources of motor preparatory activity in the dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) in line with previous work. In addition, two spatial attention components (ADAN, LDAP) were identified with generators in the PMd and occipitotemporal visual areas in the middle temporal (NIT) region, respectively. Separation of motor-related and attentional PMd source locations was reliable along the rostral-caudal axis. Conclusions: The presence of attentional components in a motor priming paradigm supports the premotor theory of attention which suggests a close link between attention and motor preparatory processes. Separation of components in the premotor cortex is in accord with a functional division of PMd into rostral (higher-order processing) and caudal (motor-related processing) areas as suggested by imaging work.

In the present study we obtained EEG data during a modified Stroop task and during a color matching task using smoking related and neutral words (nicotine Stroop) in smokers and non-smoking controls. We assumed that in smokers smoking-related word meanings would interfere with color matching, and that this should be reflected in an ERP activation pattern comparable to that induced by the Stroop task. In smokers and non-smokers the classic Stroop-related interference effect of longer reaction times in the incongruent condition could be observed. This interference effect in both groups was related to a late posterio-central relative negativity and a right frontal relative positivity in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition. The behavioral data in the color matching task (nicotine Stroop) derived from both groups did not show a comparable interference effect related to the use of drug-related words. However, in smokers the smoking-related words elicited ERP activation patterns comparable to those evoked by the Stroop interference task. The ERP results are discussed as possibly reflecting a modulation of color processing of smoking-related words in smokers. The results imply an interference, but also attention enhancing, effect of smoking-related words in smokers, which maybe associated with addiction memory and enhanced sensitivity for drug-cues. Therefore, the addiction memory driven interference effect might be counteracted by performance enhancement induced by the same nicotine cues. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some ERP studies on ambiguous figures report a P300-like component correlated with perceptual reversals supporting a top-down explanation, while other studies found early visual EPP components supporting a bottom-up explanation. Based on an experimental paradigm that permits a high temporal resolution of the endogenous reversal event, we compared endogenous Necker-cube reversals with exogenously-induced reversals of unambiguous cube variants. For both reversal types, we found a chain of ERP components with the following characteristics: (1) An early occipital ER-P component (130 ins) is restricted to endogenous reversals. (2) All subsequent components also appear with exogenously-induced reversals, however 40-90 ms earlier than their endogenous counterparts. (3). The latency difference between reversal types is also reflected in the timing of manual reactions, which occur 100- 130 ms after P300-like components. The results suggest that the P300-like component is the same as found in other ERP studies on ambiguous figures. This component does not reflect the reversal per se, but rather its cognitive analysis, 300 ms after a change of the representation in early visual areas. The presented ERP chains integrate the different ERP results and allow to pinpoint the steps where top-down mechanisms begin to exert their influence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Isoflurane disrupts anterio-posterior phase synchronization of flash-induced field potentials in the rat	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						synchronization; consciousness; anesthesia; event-related potential; EEG; gamma	BISPECTRAL INDEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; EEG; ANESTHESIA; AWARENESS; RESPONSES; PROPOFOL; BINDING	Consciousness presumes a set of integrated functions such as sensory processing, attention, and interpretation, and may depend upon both local and long-range phase synchronization of neuronal activity in cerebral cortex. Here we investigated whether volatile anesthetic isoflurane at concentrations that produce loss of consciousness (LOC) disrupts long-range anterio-posterior and local anterior synchronization of neuronal activity in the rat. In six rats, deep electrodes were chronically implanted in the primary visual cortex (VI) and in two areas of the motor cortex (M1 and M2) for recording of intracortical event-related potentials (ERP). Thirty discrete flashes were presented at random interstimulus intervals of 15-45 s, and ERPs were recorded at stepwise increasing isoflurane concentrations of 0-1.1%. Neuronal synchronization was estimated using wavelet coherence computed from the ERP data band-pass filtered at 5-50 Hz. We found that (1) in the waking state, long-range anterio-posterior coherence in 5-25 Hz and 25-50 Hz frequency bands was significantly higher than local anterior coherence; (2) anterio-posterior coherence in both 5-25 Hz and 26-50 Hz bands was significantly reduced by isoflurane in a concentration-dependent manner; (3) local anterior coherence was not affected by isoflurane at any of the concentrations studied. These findings suggest that a disruption of long-range anterio-posterior rather than local anterior synchronization of neuronal activity precedes the anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.

To investigate late development of the visual motion system, we measured brain activity with event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in groups of adolescents (15-17 years) and adults (20-30 years) during a visual form discrimination task-with forms being either defined by motion or luminance contrast. We further explored whether possible developmental changes varied with the degree of motion coherence reflecting maturation specific to global motion processing. Both the fMRI activation patterns and ERP topographies were very similar between adolescents and adults, suggesting that the basic visual networks for processing motion and form are established by the age of 15-17. The ERP response to luminance- and motion-defined forms was dominated by a posterior negativity (N1: 120-270 ms). The N1 of the motion contrast was delayed in adolescents, whereas the N1 of the static condition did not differ between groups. Since the motion-evoked N1 is thought to arise in the middle temporal area MT/V5, our results indicate that visual motion processing in MT continues to get faster, becoming still more efficient during late development. Neither the ERP nor the fMRI results revealed maturation effects specific to motion coherence. This indicates that the specific mechanisms to process global dot motion are already mature in adolescence. The present findings support the view, that static perception matures earlier than dynamic perception, and that these visual systems have different developmental courses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, a sample of American Indians (n = 146) were given a structured diagnostic interview that additionally indexed traumatic life events and symptoms emerging following those events. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra and visual event-related potentials (ERPs) to happy, sad, and neutral faces were also recorded from each participant. Ninety-nine percent of the sample had experienced at least one category of trauma with the mean number being 5, 27% had experienced at least 8 categories, and 13% met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The PTSD group did not differ on any demographic or diagnostic variables from the larger sample. An electrophysiological signature for PTSD was found that included increases in high-frequency gamma activity (20-40 Hz, F = 8.7, P < 0.004) in frontal leads, higher NI amplitudes to sad stimuli in frontotemporal leads (F = 12.4, P < 0.001, F = 5.0, P < 0.03), and longer latency P3 components to happy stimuli in midline, central, and right frontal leads (F = 4.7, P < 0.03; F = 4.1, P < 0.04; F = 4.0, P < 0.05). These findings were observed in participants with PTSD, but not in a group with equivalently high trauma counts. These findings suggest that PTSD is associated with EEG hyper-arousal, higher attentional levels to sad stimuli, and slower processing of happy stimuli. They also partially confirm ERP data reported in combat victims with PTSD suggesting that PTSD may induce neurobiological consequences that transcend type of eliciting trauma as well as ethnic and cultural factors.

Practice effects were Studied in a visual Go-Nogo task which contained stimuli either compatible or incompatible with a response. Eight participants (19-28 years old, M = 23.3, SD = 3.6) performed the task with simultaneous EEG recording every morning during three consecutive weeks except weekends. Short-term, long-term, as well as weekday effects were analyzed. As a short-term effect, the false allarm rate became smaller; this was accompanied by an enhancement of the frontal N2 component of the event-related potential (ERP). As a long-term effect, the shortening of reaction time to incompatible stimuli and increase of the blink rate for Go trials was observed. Within the N2 two subcomponents, the early (N2e and late (N2l) Could be distinguished. N2e and N2l varied differently with the experimental manipulations. First, they showed different effects of stimulus compatibility. Second, the N2e was enhanced with practice irrespective of trial type, while the practice-related increase of the N2l was obtained for Nogo trials only. Third, the practice-related effects on components differed in scalp topography. The results Suggest N2e reflects the comparison process and N2l the inhibition of an irrelevant response representation. Both processes improved with practice.

Alpha and beta bands were investigated in three temporal intervals: a sensory period, a delay period and a saccade preparation period time locked with saccade onset. Modulations of ERD/ERS power, coupled with the task, reached the largest amplitudes over the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. Differences of oscillatory activity in the alpha bands revealed an intriguing pattern of asymmetry in parieto-occipital areas. Rightward saccades induced a larger desynchronization with respect to the leftward saccades in the left hemisphere, but not in the right. If representative, these findings are congruent to the established right-hemisphere dominance of the brain areas that direct attention. Moreover differences between the two alpha types emerged in the frontal areas before and during the saccade preparation periods, indicative of differential engagement of these areas depending on the task demands. In conclusion, the present approach shows that planning eye movements is linked with covert orienting of spatial attention and may supply a useful method for studying eye movements and selective attention-related processes.

The pictures varied on valence (negative, neutral, positive) ratings but had the same medium arousal level ratings. The images were presented as targets with a standard stimulus composed of red/white triangles designed to mimic the spatial frequency of the pictures. P300 amplitude from negative relative to neutral stimuli was smaller over frontal areas, whereas amplitude from positive relative to neutral stimuli did not differ. P300 amplitude differences among valence categories were consistent across the midline electrodes, and did not change over the parietal area where arousal effects are typically observed. The findings suggest that valence affects P300 frontal amplitude, and arousal level should be controlled when using emotional stimuli to elicit ERPs. Theoretical implications are discussed.

During this task, participants respond faster when the relative spatial positions of stimulus and response match (no response conflict exists) than when they do not match (response conflict exists). An increased response conflict (increase in reaction times known as Simon effect) was found in elderly control and Parkinson's patients compared with young participants. Group and condition differences were found in the 6 and 0 frequency range, which may reflect that Parkinson's patients and matched controls use different cognitive strategies for stimulus-response processing than young controls and neurophysiological correlates of such strategy are deficient in patients compared with age-matched controls.

Correlations between qEEG variables and regional metabolism were examined as an approach to investigating the metabolic and neuroanatomical basis of the generation of the EEG. Analogous to the neurometric approach to qEEG, a normative 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose voxel data base was developed for the PET image. The PET image was transformed to an idealized cylindrical set of coordinates to allow registration with the Talairach stercotactic atlas. PET regions of interest for the thalamus, the left and right temporal lobes, the medial frontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were defined using Talairach coordinates and correlated to the QEEG. Salient findings included a negative correlation of thalamic metabolism to alpha power and a positive correlation of medial frontal cortical metabolism to delta EEG power. The significance of these findings is discussed with reference to the existing literature on the physiology of the generation of the EEG. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: Our aim was to clarify the effects of MPH on central and autonomic measures in AD/HD children during a continuous performance task (CPT) using a naturalistic open-label study. Method: Thirty-six boys (18 AD/ HD and 18 control) participated in a CPT over two trial periods, allowing a more valid estimate of the effects of medication, rather than assuming that retesting per se has no substantial impact. MPH was administered to the AD/ HD group 1 h prior to the second trial. Errors and reaction time (RT) were recorded as measures of performance, electrodermal activity as an autonomic nervous system measure and event-related potentials (ERPs) as an index of central nervous system activity. Results: AD/HD children made more errors than controls in the first session, but no group differences were found after medication. No significant differences were observed for RT. Skin conductance level was found to be lower in AD/HD children than controls, but this difference was also ameliorated after medication. Conversely, mean skin conductance response to target stimuli was found not to differ between groups during the initial test phase but became significantly different in phase 2. ERP data showed topographic differences between groups in N1, P2, N2 and P3 at the initial test phase, which were reduced at the second test. Conclusion: Stimulant medication ameliorated some of the dysfunctions in AD/HD children, which are reflected in behavioural and ERP measures. These results, in combination with general differences in electrodermal activity, support a hypoarousal model of AD/HD, which can explain the action of MPH in these children.

By decomposing the measured data into maximally independent components (ICs), estimates of the time course and the topographies of neural sources are obtained. In this paper, we show that when using estimated source topographies for localization, correlations between neural sources introduce an error into the obtained source locations. This error can be avoided by reprojecting ICs onto the observation space, but requires the identification of relevant ICs. For Event Related Potentials (ERPs), we identify relevant ICs by estimating their non-Gaussianity. The efficacy of the approach is tested on auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded by MEG. It is shown that ten trials are sufficient for reconstructing all important characteristics of the AEP, and source localization of the reconstructed ERP yields the same focus of activity as the average of 250 trials.

S 17092 (100, 200, 400 or 600 mg) and placebo were administered once daily for 10 days in a rising multiple-dose scheme. EEG recordings were performed before and repeatedly from 0.5 to 24 h after dose on day 1 and day 10. PEP activity in plasma was also measured for the same periods. S 17092 appeared as a potent inhibitor of PEP activity at all doses, after both single and repeated administrations. EEG changes after acute doses were slight and of short duration, mainly characterized by increased relative alpha 1 power, suggesting a vigilance-promoting EEG profile. After repeated doses and more strikingly after a superimposed dose, increases in relative alpha 1 power were still present with additional increase in relative delta power and decreases in absolute fast alpha, fast beta, theta powers and total power at all doses. These EEG findings suggest that S 17092 might possess some mood-stabilizing potential in addition to its cognition-enhancing properties. Copyright c 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Complex, multifocal, individual-specific attention-related cortical functional circuits	BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						attention; cortical electrical activity; high-resolution electroencephalography; slow potentials; source localization; functional mapping	VISUAL-ATTENTION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; PARIETAL LOBE; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; RECONSTRUCTIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; POTENTIALS; ANATOMY	Recent studies focusing on the analysis of individual patterns of non-sensory-motor CNS activity may significantly alter our view of CNS functional mapping. We have recently provided evidence for highly variable attention-related Slow Potential (SP) generating cortical areas across individuals (Basile et al., 2003, 2006). In this work, we present new evidence, searching for other physiological indexes of attention by a new use of a well established method, for individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during expecting attention. We applied latency corrected peak averaging to oscillatory bursts, from 124-channel EEG recordings, and modeled their generators by current density reconstruction. We first computed event-related total power, and averaging was based on individual patterns of narrow task-induced band-power. This method is sensitive to activity out of synchrony with stimuli, and may detect task-related changes missed by regular Event-Related Potential (ERP) averaging. We additionally analyzed overall inter-electrode phase-coherence. The main results were (1) the detection of two bands of attention-induced beta range oscillations (around 25 and 21 Hz), whose scalp topography and current density cortical distribution were complex multi-focal, and highly variable across subjects, including prefrontal and posterior cortical areas. Most important, however, was the observation that (2) the generators of task-induced oscillations are largely the same individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during the resting, baseline state. We concluded that attention-related electrical cortical activity is highly individual-specific (significantly different from sensory-related visual evoked potentials or delta and theta induced band-power), and to a great extent already established during mere wakefulness. We discuss the critical implications of those results, in combination with other studies presenting individual data, to functional mapping: the need to abandon group averaging of task-related cortical activity and to revise studies on group averaged data, since the assumption of universal function to each cortical area appears deeply challenged. Clinical implications regard the interpretation of focal lesion consequences, functional reorganization, and neurosurgical planning.	[Basile, Luis F.

Gamma band oscillations reveal neural network cortical coherence dysfunction in schizophrenia patients	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						gamma band; oscillations; EEG; schizophrenia; coherence; event-related potential; evoked power; induced oscillations; cognition; working memory	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY DEFICITS; WORKING-MEMORY; 40 HZ; AUDITORY-STIMULATION; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL NETWORKS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BIPOLAR DISORDER	Background: Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of h formation across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics. Methods. Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) werepresented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments. Results: Patients bad reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r=.32, p <.01). Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients havefrequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.

The sentences were modulated in amplitude by a binary m-sequence and played forward or backward. A circular cross-correlation function was computed between the EEG signals and the m-sequence and averaged across subjects. Independent component analysis of the averaged function revealed a component source response which was obtained only for the comprehensible Japanese and not for the incomprehensible sentences. The present study has thus shown that a 1-min long EEG signal is sufficient for the assessment of speech comprehension. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

Sixteen participants responded to the central digit ("target") of a triplet of digits while ignoring the identical flankers ("distractors"). In the DT condition designed to produce NP, the target was the preceding distractor. No stimuli were repeated in the control condition. In the TT condition supposed to produce positive priming (PP), the target stimulus was repeated. With this latter condition, design imbalances were avoided and ERP correlates of PP and NP could be compared. Significant behavioural PP (81-ms RT decrease in the TT condition) and NP effects (13-ms RT increase in the DT condition) were observed. Compared to control, left-posterior P300 amplitude was reduced for priming conditions TT and DT. It is argued that P300 findings are better in line with episodic-retrieval than activation/inhibition view since the latter predicts opposite ERP differences-to-control for TT and DT. P300 reduction may reflect an initial evaluation of both TT and DT probe displays as similar to the prime, resulting in a tendency to repeat the prime response. This tendency is correct in the TT condition but wrong in the DT condition, causing response conflict. A response-conflict account of flanker NP also receives support from the present LRP data: onset of the response-locked LRP occurred significantly earlier for DT than control, indicating increased motor processing time. Overall, data support episodic-retrieval explanations of flanker NP.

High-resolution EEG data were recorded (126 channels) from 10 healthy adult volunteers during the expectancy of a painful CO2-laser stimulation at the right wrist. Surface laplacian estimation enhanced the EEG spatial information content over 6 scalp regions of interest (left frontal, right frontal, left central, right central, left parietal, and right parietal areas). Spectral power was computed for 3 alpha sub-bands with reference to the individual alpha frequency peak (about 5-7 Hz for alpha 1, 7-9 Hz for alpha 2, and 9-11 Hz for alpha 3). The suppression of the alpha power before the painful stimulation [as reflected by the event-related desynchronization (ERD)] indexed the anticipatory cortical processes. Results showed maximum (negative) correlations between the alpha 2 and alpha 3 ERD amplitude at the left central area and the subjective evaluation of pain intensity (P < .001). The stronger the anticipatory alpha 2 and alpha 3 ERD, the higher the subjective evaluation of pain intensity. For alpha 3, that correlation was confirmed even when the effect of habituation across the recording session was taken into account. These results suggest that the anticipatory suppression of the alpha rhythms over the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex predicts subsequent subjects' evaluation of pain intensity, in line with its crucial role for the discrimination of that intensity. Perspective: This electroencephalographic study showed that anticipatory activation/deactivation of sensorimotor cortex roughly predicts subjective evaluation of pain. This motivates further investigation on possible implications for the understanding of central chronic pain. Chronic pain patients might exaggerate the anticipatory activation of sensorimotor cortex to negligible pain stimuli.

A recently published study (Liu et al., 2002) using magnetoencephalography (MEG) clearly indicated that a face-selective component can be observed at 100 ms (M100) which is about 70 ms earlier than reported in most previous studies. Here we report these early differences at 107 ms between the ERPs of faces and buildings over the occipito-temporal cortex using electroencephalography. To exclude contrast differences as the main factor for this P100 differences we replicated this study using pictures of faces and scrambled faces. Both studies indicated that face processing starts already at similar to 100 ms with an initial stage which can be measured not only with MEG but also with ERPs.

Some theories suggest that schizophrenia is related to a deficiency of the system that generates information about the sensory consequences of the actions realized by the subject. This system monitors the reafferent information resulting from an action and allows its anticipation. In the present study, we examined visual-event-related potentials (ERPs) generated by a sensorimotor task in 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 normal controls. The visual feedback from hand movements performed by the subjects was experimentally distorted. Behavioral results showed that patients were impaired in recognizing their own movements. The ERP signal in patients also differed from those of control subjects. In patients, the ERP waveform was affected during the early part of the response (200 ms). This early effect in schizophrenic patients reveals a modified processing of the visual consequence of their actions.

To address this question, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants viewed pictures of animals and tools. Within the 200-600-ms epoch after stimulus presentation, animals (relative to tools) elicited an increased anterior negativity that, based on previous ERP studies, we interpret as associated with semantic processing of visual object attributes. In contrast, tools (relative to animals) evoked an enhanced posterior left-lateralized negativity that, according to prior research, might reflect accessing knowledge of characteristic motion and/or more general functional properties of objects. These results support the hypothesis of the neuroanatomical knowledge organization at the level of object features: the observed neurophysiological activity was modulated by the features that were most salient for object recognition. The high temporal resolution of ERPs allowed us to demonstrate that differences in processing animals and tools occurred specifically within the time-window encompassing semantic analysis.

Dynamic causal modelling of evoked responses: The role of intrinsic connections	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/MEG; evoked response; dynamic causal modelling; intrinsic connections; extrinsic connection	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BRAIN; FMRI; MEG; EEG	Dynamic causal modelling is an approach to characterising evoked responses as measured by magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG). A dynamic causal model (DCM) is a spatiotemporal, generative network model for event-related fields/responses (ERP/ERF) data. Using Bayesian model inversion, one can compute the posterior distributions of the DCM's physiological parameters and its marginal likelihood for model comparison. Model comparison can be used to test mechanistic hypotheses about how electrophysiological data were generated. In this work, we look at the relative importance of changes in intrinsic (within source) and extrinsic (between sources) connections in generating mismatch responses. In short, we introduce the modulation of intrinsic connectivity to the DCM framework. This is useful for testing hypotheses about adaptation of neuronal responses to local influences, in relation to influences that are mediated by long-range extrinsic connections (forward, backward, and lateral) from other sources. We illustrate this extension using synthetic data and empirical data from an oddball ERP experiment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different methods have been proposed to remove the BCG artefact focusing on channel-wise template subtraction procedures or spatial filtering approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA). Here we systematically compared the performance of the optimal basis set (OBS), a channel-wise correction approach, with ICA and a recently proposed combination of both (OBS-ICA). The three different procedures were applied to 60-channel EEG data from 12 subjects recorded during fMRI acquisition in a 3-T scanner. In addition to examination of the residual BCG artefact, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the topography of the resulting auditory evoked potential component NI were compared. Whereas all three approaches led to a significant artefact reduction, the ICA procedure resulted in a significantly reduced NI SNR and amplitude when compared to BCG-uncorrected data, indicating a rather poor performance. In contrast to ICA, OBS and OBS-ICA corrected data substantially improved the SNR of the N1. The quality of the auditory evoked potential NI topography was investigated by means of equivalent current dipole modelling. On a descriptive level, all three correction procedures led to a reduced localization error when compared to BCG-uncorrected data. This improvement was significant for OBS-ICA. We conclude that OBS and OBS-ICA can efficiently remove BCG artefacts and substantially improve the quality of EEG signals recorded inside the scanner, a prerequisite for the successful integration of simultaneously recorded EEG and IMR].

In an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, subjects heard Dutch stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun. To probe whether this noun was anticipated at a preceding indefinite article, stories were continued with a gender-marked adjective whose suffix in mismatched the upcoming noun's syntactic gender. Prediction-inconsistant adjectives elicited a differential ERP effect, which disappeared in a no-discourse control experiment. Furthermore, in self-paced reading, prediction-inconsistent adjectives slowed readers down before the noun. These findings suggest that people can indeed predict upcoming words in fluent discourse and, moreover, that these predicted words can immediately begin to participate in incremental parsing operations.

Data reduction techniques for TFTs have been slow to develop beyond time analysis of detail functions from wavelet transforms. Cohen's class of TFTs based on the reduced interference distribution (RID) offer some benefits over wavelet TFTs, but do not offer the simplicity of detail functions from wavelet decomposition. The objective of the current approach is a data reduction method to extract succinct and meaningful events from both RID and wavelet TFTs. Methods: A general energy-based principal components analysis (PCA) approach to reducing TFTs is detailed. TFT surfaces are first restructured into vectors, recasting the data as a two-dimensional matrix amenable to PCA. PCA decomposition is performed on the two-dimensional matrix, and surfaces are then reconstructed. The PCA decomposition method is conducted with RID and Morlet wavelet TFTs, as well as with PCA for time and frequency domains separately. Results: Three simulated datasets were decomposed. These included Gabor logons and chirped signals. All simulated events were appropriately extracted from the TFTs using both wavelet and RID TFTs. Varying levels of noise were then added to the simulated data, as well as a simulated condition difference. The PCA-TFT method, particularly when used with RID TFTs, appropriately extracted the components and detected condition differences for signals where time or frequency domain analysis alone failed. Response-locked ERP data from a reaction time experiment was also decomposed. Meaningful components representing distinct neurophysiological activity were extracted from the ERP TFT data, including the error-related negativity (ERN). Conclusions: Effective TFT data reduction was achieved. Activity that overlapped in time, frequency, and topography were effectively separated and extracted. Methodological issues involved in the application of PCA to TFTs are detailed, and directions for further development are discussed. Significance: The reported decomposition method represents a natural but significant extension of PCA into the TFT domain from the time and frequency domains alone. Evaluation of many aspects of this extension could now be conducted, using the PCA-TFT decomposition as a basis.

More specifically, we examine whether increases in theta (approximate to 3-7 Hz) and gamma (around 40 Hz) band power occur in response to sentences that were either semantically correct or contained a semantically incongruent word (semantic violation). ERP results indicated a classical N400 effect. A wavelet-based time-frequency analysis revealed a theta band power increase during an interval of 300-800 ms after critical word onset, at temporal electrodes bilaterally for both sentence conditions, and over midfrontal areas for the semantic violations only. In the gamma frequency band, a predominantly frontal power increase was observed during the processing of correct sentences. This effect was absent following semantic violations. These results provide a characterization of the oscillatory brain dynamics, and notably of both theta and gamma oscillations, that occur during language comprehension. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Event-related brain potentials were recorded during a response precueing paradigm where visual cues provided either partial (Experiment 1) or full (Experiment 2) information about the response hand and the direction for a subsequent reaching movement. Results: ADAN and LDAP components were elicited even when only partial response information was available, demonstrating that they do not require the presence of a fully specified motor program. The ADAN was elicited in a similar fashion regardless of whether effector or movement direction information was provided, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are equally sensitive to both types of response-related information. In contrast, the LDAP was larger in response to cues providing effector information, but was also reliably present when movement direction was available. Conclusions: ADAN and LDAP components reflect preparatory activity within anterior and posterior parts of the parieto-premotor sensorimotor network where different parameters for manual reaching movements are programmed independently. Significance: These results support the claim of the premotor theory of attention that shared sensorimotor control mechanisms are involved in attention and motor programming.

Accordingly, the NI potential indexes mechanisms connecting the separate parts of the illusory form, whereas a subsequent negative potential indexes compensatory processes triggered by perceptual difficulty. Here, perceptual difficulty was induced by bistability; that is, by equating the probability of perceiving the illusory form to that of perceiving the independent separate parts. We compared the brain potentials evoked by a strongly connected illusory square, with almost no bistability, with those evoked by a weakly connected illusory square presenting strong bistability. Consistent with our hypotheses, the latter figure evoked the smallest NI and a larger negative component peaking at 360ms (N360). These results strengthen the link between NI and connection and between negativity to perceptual difficulty and perceptual difficulty.

Inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis, ON) is a common symptom at the onset of MS. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have been widely used as diagnostic tools for ON as they can detect the malfunctioning of visual pathways. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has also been used to identify impaired visual brain function in ON patients. As VEPs and fMRI have complementary features (high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution, respectively), the integration of simultaneously recorded VEP and fMRI might provide more detailed information on the cortical representation of the visual stimulus, thus improving the diagnosis of ON. In this work, we present a method for simultaneous acquisition of EEG signals and fMRI. More specifically, we show that reliable VEPs can be obtained during fMRI acquisition and, conversely, sequences of MR images of good quality can be obtained in presence of EEG electrodes in the MRI bore. On the basis of these preliminary results, we suggest that the simultaneous recording of VEP and fMRI is feasible and can be used in studying ON.

Methods: EEG was recorded from 53 scalp electrodes referenced online to the left mastoid while subjects viewed face, car and word stimuli. Off-line, the data were systematically re-referenced to the common average, averaged mastoids, averaged earlobes, non-cephalic, and nose. The correlation of timing, amplitude, and effects was investigated across reference electrodes. Results: (1) The amplitude of the N170 and VPP components varies in a precisely inverse manner across reference; (2) the peaks of the N170 and VPP are temporally coincident for all reference electrodes, (3) both components can be accounted for by the same dipolar configuration, and (4) the components show identical functional properties. Conclusions: The VPP and N170 are two 'faces' of the same brain generators. Significance: The differential N170/VPP effects observed in ERP studies can be accounted for by differences in reference methodology. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) reflect extracranial measures of time-resolved neuromagnetic fields or potentials whereas fMRI displays tomographically hemodynamic changes in response to neuronal activation. EEG and fMRI can be recorded simultaneously and can provide basic knowledge on the relation of the two mechanisms of signal generation. MEG is less prone to spatial distortions and, thus, may be better mapped to the tomographic images. From the beginning of the 1990s, investigations involving both modalities with the same paradigm were presented regularly. Many of these studies investigated localization properties of both systems for presurgical localization. Comparative measurements showed largely similar activation patterns in sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks. The difference between fMRI and MEG coordinates of the activations to the same task, commonly show deviations of 1 cm or more (about 2 cm with EEG). However, the differences in both modalities may distinguish in hemispheric lateralization, signal dynamics, or effects of disorders. We suggest that in addition to the integrative use of the modalities, a complementing use of MEG or EEG and fMRI may lead to new measures which help to understand brain physiology and mechanisms of neuronal dysfunctions.

Thirty-two healthy young subjects performed a visual Go/Nogo task with simultaneous EEG recording after a quiet night and after 3 nights with railway noise at different noise levels. As motivational traits, the "hope of success" (HS) and "fear of failure" (IFF) were assessed. Subjective sleep rating worsened with increased noise level, but, noise-induced sleep disturbances did not affect performance immediately following sleep. However, in the event-related potential (ERP) an attenuation of the N2 and P3 amplitude as well as an increase in N2 latency in Noise conditions were found. Only subjects who scored low in HS showed a reduction of the N2 after Noise, while subjects who scored high in HS did not. The N2 and P3 were larger in high HS than in low HS subjects in Nogo trials only. Similarly, low FF subjects had larger N2 and P3 than high FF subjects in Nogo trials only. The results suggest that achievement motivation modulates executive control and stimulus-response mapping processes as well as their resistance against aftereffects of noise-induced sleep disturbance.

The conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease is associated with substantial compromise of neocortical circuits subserving rapid cognitive functions such as working memory. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis is a powerful tool to identify early impairment of these circuits, yet research for an electrophysiological marker of cognitive deterioration in MCI is scarce. Using a "2-back" activation paradigm, we recently described an electrophysiological correlate of working memory activation (positive-negative working memory [PNwm] component) over parietal electrodes. Methods. Ours was a longitudinal study of 24 MCI patients with ERP analysis at inclusion and neuropsychological follow-up after 1 year. We used ERP waveform subtraction analysis between the n-back and control tasks. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare electroencephalograph latencies between progressive MCl (PMCl) and stable MCl (SMCl), and univariate regression was used to assess the relationship between neuropsychological measures at baseline and clinical outcome. Results. Thirteen (54%) MCl patients showed PMCl, and 11 (46%) remained stable (SMCl). In SMCl. a PNwm component with significantly larger density compared to baseline was identified when subtracting the detection task for both the 1- and 2-back tasks. In contrast, in PMCl, the PNwm component was absent in both 1-back and 2-back conditions. Neuropsychological variables and n-back test performance at inclusion did not predict cognitive deterioration 1 year later. Conclusions. In conjunction with recent functional imaging data, the present results support the notion of an early dysfunction of neural generators within the parietal cortex in MCl. They also reveal that the absence of the PNwm component may provide an easily applicable qualitative predictive marker of rapid cognitive deterioration in MCl.

Our working hypothesis is that, at difference of non-athletes, athletes are characterized by enhanced cortical information processing as indexed by the amplitude reduction of EEG oscillations at alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz) during open- referenced to closed-eyes condition (event-related desynchronization, ERD). Balance during quiet standing was indexed by body "sway area". Correlation between alpha ERD and event-related change of the sway area was computed by a nonparametric test (p < 0.05). It was found that alpha ERD (10-12 Hz) is stronger in amplitude in the karate and fencing athletes than in the non-athletes at ventral centro-parietal electrodes of the right hemisphere (p < 0.02). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant correlation in the karate athletes between right ventral centro-parietal alpha ERD and body sway area (r=0.61; p < 0.008): specifically, the greater the alpha ERD, the greater the percentage reduction of the body sway area when the visual inputs were available.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a change-specific component of ERPs that indicates a pre-cognitive discrimination process. MMN responses were recorded in 10 healthy preschool children to four different types of signal changes. The signals investigated were processed using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze the characteristics of the ERP components. All children showed distinct MMN that was significant in all tasks. The MMN amplitudes varied between subjects and depended on the different tasks. The wavelet transform allowed simplified analysis and quantification of the MMN component, as well as the double-peak structure of the P1 component. The variation in MMN amplitudes suggests the possibility of determining individual auditory profiles. Owing to the shorter time required, the MMN paradigm suggested combined with the DWT proposed offers a new objective investigation method for children.

For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has good spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution, whereas the converse is true for electrophysiological recordings (event-related potentials or ERPs). In this review of recent work, we highlight a novel approach to combining these modalities in a manner designed to increase information on the origins and locations of the generators of specific ERPs and the relationship between fMRI and ERP signals. Near infrared imaging techniques have also been studied as alternatives to fMRI and can be readily integrated with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. Each of these modalities may in principle be also used in so-called steady-state acquisitions in which the correlational structure of signals from the brain may be analyzed to provide new insights into brain function.

In one such study, we showed that early-blind subjects were able to localize sound sources accurately despite the lack of visual input for the calibration of their auditory space. A further ERP study with these subjects also revealed N1 and P3 components during a sound localization task to be more posteriorly distributed than for sighted controls, indicating an involvement of posterior regions in sound localization for blind subjects not present for sighted subjects. In the current study, we analyzed these data for EEG power and coherence in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands to see whether blind individuals would show increased coherence reflecting increased connectivity between the central and posterior cortical regions. Blind and sighted subjects did not differ with respect to overall EEG power in any frequency range. However, EEG coherence was significantly increased in blind subjects compared to sighted in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. These results have implications for cortical plasticity affected by sensory deprivation in humans. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Materials and methods Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques and computerized cognitive tests were performed in young, healthy male volunteers during two double-blind and placebo-controlled studies: a rising single dose crossover study (from 2 to 320 mg) and a rising repeated dose study with a parallel group design (50, 100, and 200 mg). Results In contrast to acute administration, administration of AZD3480 over 10 days produced statistically significant enhancement of several cognitive measures (attention and episodic memory) compared to placebo. Regarding EEG data, AZD3480 showed acceleration of the alpha centroid and of the alpha peak in the single-dose study. This EEG profile of the acceleration type was confirmed in the repeated dose study on both day 1 and day 10, with the greatest effect observed with the highest dose. The EEG pattern shown for AZD3480 was consistent with that previously described with other drugs known to improve attention and vigilance (including nicotine). In addition, subjects dosed with AZD3480 showed a statistically significant increase in mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude at 50 and 200 mg while reducing MMN latency (200 mg only), suggesting an improvement of pre-attentional mechanisms. Conclusion These early data in healthy subjects provide encouragement to consider development of AZD3480 as a novel agent for the treatment of cognitive decline in the elderly, including age-associated memory impairment and/or dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

Here we have successfully developed a technique with which we can objectively estimate the level of listeners' speech comprehension using continuous speech sounds without linguistic anomalies. We used minute-long speech sounds whose amplitudes were modulated by an m-sequence (pseudorandom binary sequence). Eelectroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from Japanese speakers and were cross-correlated with the m-sequence. We identified a signal peak which was found only for comprehensible but not for incomprehensible (backward-played Japanese and Spanish) speech stimuli in an independent component cross-correlation function. The correlation time of the signal peak was 400 ms and the peak location on the scalp was Cz-Pz. The present study has thus shown that a minute-long EEG signal is sufficient for the assessment of speech comprehension.

J	Tang, AC; Sutherland, MT; Wang, Y				Tang, AC; Sutherland, MT; Wang, Y			Contrasting single-trial ERPs between experimental manipulations: Improving differentiability by blind source separation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PENALIZED DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; EEG CLASSIFICATION; MEDIAN NERVE; HAND MOVEMENT; STIMULATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ARTIFACTS	Contrasting event-related potentials (ERPs) generated under different experimental conditions and inferring differential brain responses is widely practiced in cognitive neuroscience research. Traditionally, these contrasts and subsequent inferences have proceeded directly from ER-Ps measured at the scalp. For certain tasks, it is not unusual that ERPs from a subset of channels are given particular emphasis in data analysis, such as the channels displaying the maximum peak amplitude in regions of interest ('' best sensors '') or channels showing the largest averaged ERP waveform differences. With the aid of a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm, second-order blind identification (SOBI), which has been recently validated for its ability to recover correlated neuronal sources, we show that single-trial ERPs from previously validated neuronal sources were more distinguishable among different experimental manipulations than the single-trial ERPs measured at the comparable '' best sensors ''. This suggests that by using validated SOBI-recovered neuronal sources, ERP researchers can improve the ability to detect differences in neuronal responses induced by experimental manipulations. Critically, our observations were made at the level of single trials, as opposed to the averaged ERP. Therefore, our conclusions are particularly relevant to phenomena involving trialto-trial changes in brain activation, for example, rapid induction of brain plasticity and perceptual learning, as well as to the development of brain-computer interfaces. Similar advantages would also apply to analogous situations with magnetoencephalography (MEG). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we used evoked potentials to examine the influence of sex and hemisphere on brain responses to emotional stimuli. Given that the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) is considered a cognitive neuroelectric phenomenon, we compared left and right hemisphere P300 responses to brief (2 s) presentations of emotionally arousing pictures in men and women. P300 waves were recorded from sites overlying left (F3 and P3) and right (F4 and P4) hemisphere frontal and parietal locations in response to a series of standardized pictures rated as emotionally negative, positive, or neutral. Negative pictures elicited more robust P300 effects, as indexed by both amplitude and latency measures, in the left hemisphere in women than in men, yet elicited a stronger P300 component in the right hemisphere in men than in women. The variables of sex and hemisphere interacted significantly to influence the strength of the P300 component to the negative slides. Negative slides were also best recalled at a long-term, incidental memory test, a fact potentially related to the differential P300 waves at encoding. These data further support the view that both sex and cerebral hemisphere represent relevant, interacting influences on neural correlates of emotion, and of emotionally influenced memory.

MMN was recorded during an auditory oddball paradigm. QEEG was recorded in the resting condition. Additionally, areas of the lateral ventricles and Sylvian fissure were measured using CT. Although the authors could not obtain a significant difference in MMN amplitudes between controls and the schizophrenic patients, MMN deflection inversely correlated with slow wave QEEG power and dilation of the lateral ventricles. Furthermore, the longer the duration of illness, the lower the MMN amplitudes and the larger the SF-BR in the patients. However there was no significant correlation between illness duration and QEEG. In this view, a correlation between MMN and the delta power in QEEG might usefully suggest a progression in pathology of first manifestation of psychosis. The patients with reduced MMN accompanied by greater slow waves even at their first manifestation might have severely progressing pathological process and poor prognosis of disease outcome.

The aim of the present study was to examine the neurophysiological basis of emotional expression processing in children and adults with AS relative to age- and gender-matched NT controls. High-density event-related potentials were recorded during explicit processing of happy, sad, angry, seared, and neutral faces. Adults with AS were found to exhibit delayed P1 and N170 latencies and smaller N170 amplitudes in comparison to control subjects for all expressions. This may reflect impaired holistic and configural processing of faces in AS adults. However, these differences were not observed between AS and control children. This may result from incomplete development of the neuronal generators of these ERP components and/or early intervention. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We compared predictive powers of clinical examination (pupillary responses, motor responses and Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS), electroencephalography ( EEG) and computed tomography (CT) to that of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in a systematic review. Materials and methods: Medline ( 1976 - 2002) and Embase ( 1980 2002) were searched, manual review of article reference lists was conducted, and authors were contacted. We selected 25 studies addressing the prediction of outcome after severe brain injury using SEPs and either GCS, EEG, CT, pupillary or motor responses. Outcomes were determined for patients with normal or bilaterally absent SEPs and graded measures of GCS, EEG, CT, pupillary responses or motor responses. For favourable outcome prediction SEPs were superior in sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values, except for pupillary responses which had superior sensitivity and GCS which had higher specificity. SEPs had superior summary receiver operating characteristic curves, with the exception of motor responses, and superior ratio of odds ratios. For unfavourable outcome prediction SEPs were superior to the other tests in sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values, except for motor and pupillary responses, GCS and CTs which had superior sensitivity. All SEP summary receiver operating characteristic curves and pooled ratio of odds ratios were superior. Conclusions: Although imperfect, SEPs appear to be the best single overall predictor of outcome. There is sufficient evidence for clinicians to use SEPs in the prediction of outcome after brain injury.

Acute nicotine fails to alter event-related potential or behavioral performance indices of auditory distraction in cigarette smokers	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							CORTICAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TOBACCO SMOKING; SEX-DIFFERENCES; EEG; STIMULATION; ATTENTION; HISTORY; SINGLE	Behavioral studies have shown that nicotine enhances performance in sustained attention tasks, but they have not shown convincing support for the effects of nicotine on tasks requiring selective attention or attentional control under conditions of distraction. We investigated distractibility in 14 smokers (7 females) with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance measures extracted from an auditory discrimination task requiring a choice reaction time response to short- and long-duration tones, both with and without embedded deviants. Nicotine gum (4 mg), administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, failed to counter deviant-elicited behavioral distraction (i.e., slower reaction times and increased response errors), and it did not influence the distracter-elicited mismatch negativity, the P300a, or the reorienting negativity ERP components reflecting acoustic change detection, involuntary attentional switching, and attentional reorienting, respectively. Results are discussed in relation to a stimulus-filter model of smoking and in relation to future research directions.

The objective of this study was to use the clamp to examine the effects of alcohol on event-related potentials (ERPs) in rats and to assess the development of tolerance during a single alcohol exposure. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats that had a chronic implant of EEG electrodes overlying the frontal cortex and were equipped with cannulae in the jugular vein, were clamped at 75 or 150 mg/dl via an intravenous infusion of 20% (v/v) alcohol. Auditory ERPs were recorded before the alcohol infusion (baseline) and at 5, 15, 120, 135, or 195 min after steady-state AAC was achieved. In a separate group of rats, test-retest reliability was examined by acquiring ERPs two to three times in the same rat at 60-min intervals. Dependent variables were calculated as changes from baseline for each time point for P1-N1 amplitude and P1 and N1 latencies. Results: In the test-retest study, there were no differences in any of the dependent variables over time, indicating that the measures were stable and repeatable. Estimated AACs of 75 and 150 mg/dl significantly (p = 0.0001) decreased P1-N1 amplitude in a dose-related manner. During both clamps, the alcohol effect peaked at 120 min (p < 0.03) and decreased thereafter. Alcohol had no effect on P1 or N1 latencies. Conclusions: Pharmacologically relevant AACs significantly decreased the amplitude but not the latencies of the long-latency components of the rat auditory ERP. Acute tolerance developed because the amplitude of the ERP component recovered as AACs were held relatively constant.

This study tested the hypothesis that the anticipatory processes for this interaction increase the synchronization of cortical neurons as revealed by negative event-related potentials (contingent negative variation, CNV). High-resolution electroencephalographic data (128 electrodes) were recorded in 14 subjects. In the "sensorimotor interaction" condition, the subjects were waiting for a galvanic somatosensory stimulation at the left hand concomitant with a Go or NoGo stimulus (50% of Go trials triggering right hand movements). In the control condition, the Go/NoGo stimulus followed the somatosensory stimulation of 1.5 s. The electroencephalographic data were spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian estimation. In the control condition, the CNV was observed only in the foreperiod between the somatosensory stimulation and Go/NoGo task (i.e. no CNV before the somatosensory stimuli). It was spatially localized in the primary sensorimotor area contralateral to the possible motor response. In the "sensorimotor interaction" condition, the CNV preceded the concomitant somatosensory stimulation and Go/NoGo task and was distributed to the frontocentral midline other than the contralateral sensorimotor area. These results suggest that the anticipatory processes for sensorimotor interactions increase the synchronization of cortical neurons in the frontocentral midline, possibly due to mechanisms sub-serving top-down attentional processes.

The effectiveness of such an EEG-based BCI system relies on two indispensable components: distinguishable patterns of brain signals and accurate classifiers. This work aims to extract two reliable neural features, termed contralateral and ipsilateral rebound maps, by removing artifacts from motor imagery EEG based on independent component analysis (ICA), and to employ four classifiers to investigate the efficacy of rebound maps. Results demonstrate that, with the use of ICA, recognition rates for four classifiers (fisher linear discriminant (FLD), back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), radial-basis function neural network (RBF-NN), and support vector machine (SVM)) improved significantly, from 54%, 54%, 57% and 55% to 70.5%, 75.5%, 76.5% and 77.3%, respectively. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which assess the quality of classification over a wide range of misclassification costs, also improved from .65, .60, .62, and .64 to .74, .76, .80 and .81, respectively.

Methods: ERPs were recorded over about 8 months using the auditory oddball paradigm in a patient with bilateral hippocampal lesions confirmed on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Findings were compared with those from clinical electroencephalography (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) or bilateral independent PLEDs (BIPLEDs)). The patient displayed no marked clinical symptoms aside from mild memory impairment during this time, and was able to fully perform the oddball task. Results: Clearly identifiable P300 were present in all recordings. Furthermore, increases in the number of right PLEDs were significantly correlated with increases in P300 latency. Conclusions: Two key results were apparent. First, the appearance of P300 in all ERP recordings supports the suggestion that the hippocampus is not indispensable for P300 generation. Second, the correlation between the number of PLEDs and P300 latency supports the suggestion that the hippocampus affect the components of P300 latency. Significance: This case thus offers very suggestive evidence regarding the generation of P300. (c) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Application of event-related potentials for tracing auditory attention in cochlear implant users	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Article						cochlear-implant; event-related potentials; ERP; auditory attention; Nd; P3b	SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; P300; STIMULI; BRAIN	Background: Cochlea-implant (CI) users suffer from degraded recognition performance in noisy environments when one has to separate the signal from the noise. Thus, mechanisms of auditory selective attention seem to be impaired in Cl patients. It is unknown to what extend auditory attention can be employed from the very first days after the initial Cl processor calibration. Event-related potentials (ERPs), a non-invasive EEG-based technique, have recently been adopted to trace non-attentive stimulus detection and attentive stimulus discrimination in Cl users. Method: 7 days after the initial processor calibration we recorded attention-modulated (Nd, N2b, P3b) and non-attentive (mismatch negativity - MMN) ERPs when 7 postlingually deafened patients performed auditory and visual discrimination tasks. Results: For visual and auditory tasks ERPs were modulated by attention, thus indicating preserved attentive processing in the auditory modality even within a very short period after first processor calibration. When rare deviant stimuli were presented in an unattended tone sequence, the MMN indicated automatic stimulus detection of the acoustic environment in Cl users. Conclusions: From the first days after cochlear-implantation, both pre-attentive and attentive stimulus processing are initiated to gain the incoming acoustic signal.

The cross-sectional sample consisted of 48 subjects (32 normal aging and 16 ADRD: n=3 mild dementia, n=13 MCI FAST stage 3). During EEG recording, subjects performed two visual, delayed recognition memory tasks as well as a task that tested their ability to perceive structure-from-motion (SFM). These EEG data were used to compute qEEG measures of the (normalized) variance of posterior cortical activity during the first 150 milliseconds (ms) after stimulus onset and the variance of anterior cortical activity during the second 150 ms epoch. The ratio, anterior/posterior cerebral qEEG value, was then computed for each subject, and the optimal cutoff value identified to discriminate normal from impaired subjects. An optimal qEEG cutoff value for the delayed recognition memory tasks correctly discriminated 30 of the 32 normal aging subjects (94% specificity) and 14 of 16 MCI-to-mild ADRD subjects (88% sensitivity). On the other hand, the application of this qEEG measure to EEG data recorded while subjects performed a SFM task did not distinguish between ADRD and normal aging any better than chance. In conclusion, this qEEG measure is specific to the psychophysical task being performed by the subject. When it was combined with delayed recognition memory tasks, it yielded results that are comparable to the accuracies reported by PET scan studies of normal aging vs. AD with mild cognitive impairment. These results warrant further evaluation.

The QEEG was obtained from 20 boys with ADHD. The amplitudes of 4 bands (alpha, beta, delta, and theta) in the QEEG, as well as the theta/beta ratio, before and after the administration of methylphenidate were compared during both the resting and CPT states. Methylphenidate induced a significant increase of a activities in both the right and left frontal and occipital areas, an increase of beta activities in almost all areas except for the temporal region, a decrease of theta activities in both the occipital and right temporo-parietal areas, a mild decrease of a activities in the occipito-parietal areas, and an increase of the theta/beta ratio in the right frontal and parieto-occipital, and left temporal areas during the CPT state. No significant QEEG changes were induced by the administration of methylphenidate in the resting state. These data suggest that methylphenidate has greater electrophysiological influences on the cerebral topographical activities during the performance of attentional tasks, as compared to the resting state, in boys with ADHD.

J	Klimesch, W; Sauseng, P; Hanslmayr, S				Klimesch, Wolfgang; Sauseng, Paul; Hanslmayr, Simon			EEG alpha oscillations: The inhibition-timing hypothesis	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						electroencephalogram; event-related synchronization/desynchronization ERS/ERD; event-related potentials ERP; memory; oscillations; phase synchronization	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; REACTION-TIME; MU-RHYTHM; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE	The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can solely be described in terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization (ERD). Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.

For the perception of such structures, the detection of phrase boundaries is crucial. We discovered electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) correlates for the perception of phrase boundaries in music. In EEG, this process was marked by a positive wave approximately between 500 and 600 ms after the offset of a phrase boundary with a centroparietal maximum. In MEG, we found major activity in an even broader time window (400-700 ms). Source localization revealed that likely candidates for the generation of the observed effects are structures in the limbic system, including anterior and posterior cingulate as well as posterior mediotemporal cortex. The timing and topography of the EEG effect bear some resemblance to a positive shift (closure positive shift, CPS) found for prosodic phrase boundaries during speech perception in an earlier study, suggesting that the underlying processes might be related. Because the brain structures, which possibly underlie the observed effects, are known to be involved in memory and attention processes, we suggest that the CPS may not reflect the detection of the phrase boundary as such, but those memory and attention related processes that are necessary to guide the attention focus from one phrase to the next, thereby closing the former and opening up the next phrase.

The guiding purposes of the review were to determine if (1) EEG is a useful neuroimaging technique for investigating the brain correlates of PEA in infants and children, (2) there are indeed consistent EEG correlates of PEA in literature, and (3) these EEG correlates can be framed within a coherent picture of emerging implications for the study of PEA and its effects. The review confirms that EEG techniques have proven useful in indicating evidence of differential effects of patterns of PEA and timing in early fetal development and impairment of brain maturation in older children. In general, these techniques could be important in functional assessment of the brain of children affected by PEA, especially if used in conjunction with other neuroimaging techniques. The reviewed studies also suggest that although the impact on sensory and cognitive functions may involve extensive neural networks, there are EEG correlates of PEA which may in the future lead to the identification of neurophysiologic markers. A consistent aspect that emerges from the EEG data is that converging evidence from the study of different systems and processes suggests that PEA may almost invariably have consequences for later neurocognitive development.

Design: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalogram spectrum during performance of Flanker task were obtained in a within-subject, counter-balanced, repeated-measures design. Setting: Sleep deprivation and data collection were conducted in a laboratory setting. Participants: Sixteen young healthy adults (7 women, 18-23 years old) Interventions: Performance and electroencephalogram data were collected after normal sleep and sleep deprivation. Measurements and Results: Compared to normal sleep, 1 night of sleep deprivation resulted in slower and more varied reaction times, more response errors and omissions, and impaired posterror adjustments to response accuracy. Concomitantly, 2 error-related ERPs, error-related negativity and Pe, showed reduced amplitude measurements after sleep deprivation. Conversely, conflict monitoring as expressed behaviorally and by the N2 component of the ERP was not attenuated by sleep deprivation. Ten of the sixteen participants maintained similar accuracy levels under both sleep conditions, although they still showed reduced error-related negativity and error positivity amplitude measurements and impaired error remedial actions for accuracy. Electroencephalogram spectral activity at beta and theta frequency bands was related to response correctness on subsequent trials but not related to that of preceding trials under both sleep conditions. Conclusions: One night of sleep deprivation impaired both the error detection and error remedial actions and highlighted the inability to avoid making errors again after erroneous responses were already made. The results showed that a vicious cycle occurred between performance deterioration and impairment of error-remedial mechanisms that inevitably led to making more successive errors.

Even earlier effects have occasionally been reported with subliminal or perceptual threshold presentation, particularly in clinical populations. Here, the underlying mechanisms are likely to diverge from the ones operational in standard natural reading. The variability in timing of the effects can be accounted for by dynamically changing lexical representations that can be activated as required by the Subjects' motivational state, the task at hand, and additional contextual factors. Through-out, Subcortical structures such as the amygdala, are likely to contribute these enhancements. Further research will establish whether or when emotional arousal, valence, or additional emotional properties drive the observed effects and how experimental factors interact with these. Meticulous control of other word properties known to affect ERPs in visual word processing, such as word class, length, frequency, and concreteness and the use of more standardized EEG procedures is vital. Mapping the interplay between cortical and subcortical mechanisms that give rise to amplified cortical responses to emotional words will be of highest priority for future research.

Dynamics of EEG Potentials at the Beginning of a Series of EEG-Feedback Sessions	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						feedback by EEG characteristics (neurofeedback); EEG frequency components; measuring of time intervals; event-related EEG potentials (ERPs)		We studied changes in the amplitudes of event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) and power spectra of background EEG in the course of a series of EEG-feedback sessions directed toward an increase in the ratio of powers of the alpha vs theta rhythms. The examined group included 70 volunteers divided into an experimental group (n = 37) and a control group (n = 33). The intensity of acoustic white noise overlapping the musical background served as a feedback signal; it became lower with increase in the above ratio, while in the control group it remained constant. The EEG potentials were recorded from C3 and C4 leads. The ERPs were recorded within a paradigm of measuring time intervals. Within a series of EEG-feedback sessions, the alpha/theta ratio decreased somewhat both in the control and experimental groups, but in subjects of the latter group this decrease was less significant, and the mean intragroup index became significantly greater than the respective value in the control group after the end of the third session. The EEG-feedback sessions also resulted in significant increases in the amplitudes of early components of the readiness potential in both hemispheres and in the amplitude of the contingent negative variation in the right hemisphere. We conclude that, in most healthy subjects, at least three sessions of alpha/theta training are necessary to form an effective series providing considerable changes in the pattern of EEG potentials.

In contrast, the notion that P3b is related to a decision process implies some mediating function between stimulus and response. If P3b does indeed felect the link between perceputal processing and response preparation (1) amplitudes should be as large in response-locked averages as in stimulus-locked averages, (2) this should be true independent of response speed, for separate subaverages of slow and fast responses, and (3) latencies should vary across response speed both in stimulus-locked and in response-locked averages. These hypotheses were tested in data evoked by visual and auditory stimuli in choice-response tasks. All three predictions were confirmed. In contrast to this balanced relation to perceptions and responding, fronto-central P3 with auditory stimuli was stimulus-related and, for comparison, the peak amplitudes of both the response-force and of the lateralized readiness potential were response-related. We conclude that P3b reflects a process that mediates between perceptual analysis,and, response initiation, possibly monitoring whether the decision to classify some stimulus is appropriately transformed into action.

The primary focus was to determine the neural sources associated with the processing of target stimuli containing animals compared to nontarget control stimuli. Neural source estimation techniques [current source density (CSD) and L2-minimum norm estimate (L2-MNE)] were used to determine the sources of the potential fields measured from 58 sensor sites. Assuring an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, the categorization task consisted of 2400 trials. Replicating previous findings, target and non-target ERP activity diverged sharply around 150 ms after stimulus onset and the early differential ERP activity appeared as positive deflection over fronto-central sensor sites and as negative deflection over temporo-occipital regions. Both source estimation techniques (CSD and L2-MNE) suggested primary sources of the early differential ERP activity in posterior, visual-associative brain regions and, although less pronounced, revealed the contribution of additional anterior sources. These findings suggest that selective attention to category-relevant features reflects the interactions between prefrontal and inferior temporal cortex during visual processing of natural scenes.

Automated protocol for evaluation of electromagnetic component separation (APECS): Application of a framework for evaluating statistical methods of blink extraction from multichannel EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						BSS; ICA; electroencephalography; ocular artifacts	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EYE ACTIVITY; REMOVAL; REDUCTION	Objective: We present APECS (Automated Protocol for Evaluation of Electromagnetic Component Separation), a framework for evaluating the accuracy of blind source separation algorithms in removing artifacts from EEG data. APECS applies multiple, automated procedures to quantify the extent to which blinks are removed, and the degree to which nonocular activity is left intact. Methods: APECS was used to evaluate blink removal using three BSS algorithms: Second-Order Blind Inference (SOBI) and two Independent Component Analysis (ICA) implementations, FastICA and Infomax. The algorithms were applied to a series of blink-free EEG datasets, which were contaminated with real or simulated blinks. Extracted components were assumed to contain blink activity if correlation of their spatial projectors to a predefined blink template exceeded some threshold, and if polarity inverted above and below the eyes. Blink-related components were then subtracted to produce filtered data. The success of each data decomposition is evaluated through the use of multiple, automated metrics, to determine which decomposition best approximates the ideal solution (complete separation of blink from nonblink activity). Results: The outcomes for the evaluation measures were generally congruent, but also provided different and complementary information about the quality of each data decomposition. Under our testing framework, Infomax outperformed both FastICA and SOBI. Best results were achieved when blink activity loaded onto a single component. Conclusions: Multiple metrics, both quantitative and qualitative, are important in evaluating algorithms for artifact extraction. Significance: Failure to achieve complete separation of blink from nonblink activity can affect experimental outcomes, as illustrated here, using an ERP study of word-nonword discrimination. This illustrates the importance of methods for evaluation of artifact extraction results. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Johnson, JS; Olshausen, BA				Johnson, JS; Olshausen, BA			The earliest EEG signatures of object recognition in a cued-target task are postsensory	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						object recognition; visual cortex; electrophysiology; ERP; ERPimage; P300	WORD RECOGNITION; CORTEX; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; SPEED; P300; CATEGORIZATION; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; TIME	Recent experiments have demonstrated early target minus nontarget differences in the human event-related potential (ERP) during visual object recognition tasks. It is unclear whether these differences reflect high-level visual processes, effectively indexing the speed of object recognition, or whether they arise from postsensory decision processes, leaving the actual time of object recognition uncertain. Here we report three sets of ERP experiments designed to determine what processes underlie the target minus nontarget difference signals seen in visual cued-target paradigms. We demonstrate that the same difference signals are present when the target match is made to word stimuli as well as to object stimuli, suggesting that the disparate mechanisms involved in letter string and object processing are not directly responsible for the signals. We also find that the amplitude of these signals can be reduced by increasing trial difficulty in three different ways: image difficulty, level of semantic categorization, and overall task demands. In many respects, the difference signal is similar to the postrecognition P300. Together, these results suggest that the target minus nontarget difference does not reflect object recognition per se, but rather postsensory decision processes.

Materials and methods: EEG data were gathered while 15 subjects (age 10-14 years) performed an auditory memory task both with and without exposure to a digital 902 MHz MP in counterbalanced order. Results: During memory encoding, the active MP modulated the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ ERS) responses in the similar to 4-8 Hz EEG frequencies. During recognition, the active MP transformed these brain oscillatory responses in the similar to 4-8 Hz and similar to 15 Hz frequencies. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that EMF emitted by mobile phones has effects on brain oscillatory responses during cognitive processing in children.

As a framework to investigate the integration of data from two imaging modalities, this method is dedicated to identify components of both modalities and connections between them through enhancing intrinsic interrelationships. The performance is assessed by simulations under different conditions of signal to noise ratio, connection strength and estimation of component order. An application to functional magnetic resonance images and electroencephalography data is conducted to illustrate the usage of paraICA. Results show that paraICA provides stable results and can identify the linked components with a relatively high accuracy. The application exhibits the ability to discover the connection between brain maps and event related potential time courses, and suggests a new way to investigate the coupling between hemodynamics and neural activity.

The aim of the present study was to classify the TD+ADHD comorbidity in the neurocognitive domain and to elucidate the neurophysiological background of TD+ADHD coexistence by analyzing event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in the theta (3-7.5 Hz) frequency band. Methods: Event-related potentials were recorded at 10 electrodes in 53 children (9-13 years old) from four groups (healthy controls, TD-only, ADHD-only, and combined TD+ADRD patients), while they performed an auditory selective attention task requiring a button press to a predefined target. Event-related theta oscillations were analyzed by means of time-frequency decomposition (wavelet analysis) in two latency ranges-early (0 - 200 ms) and late (200 - 450 ms). The effects of psychopathology factors (TD and ADHD) and task variables (attended channel and stimulus task relevance) on early (ETR) and late (LTR) theta response's were evaluated statistically. Theta response measures were further correlated with psychopathology scores and spontaneous theta EEG activity. Results: (1) The ETR was enhanced only in comorbid children and did not differ between the control, TD-only, and ADHD-only groups. (2) The LTR was larger in children with ADHD (ADHD-only and comorbid), but this effect was mediated by the spontaneous theta EEG activity. (3) The ETR was larger to attended stimuli at frontal-central electrodes contralateral to the side of attention, to the target stimulus type at frontal locations, and at the hemisphere contralateral to the side of the response. The functional reactivity and scalp distribution of ETRs were modulated by psychopathological factors. Conclusions: In the neurocognitive domain, the TD+ADHD comorbidity can be identified as a unique nosologic entity. Both the spontaneous theta activity and late event-related theta oscillations appear as neurophysiological markers of the ADHD condition. In children, the early event-related theta oscillations may be associated with representations of relevant target features in working memory. Significance: (1) A new model is proposed according to which TD+ADHD comorbidity can be classified at different levels (from neurobiological to cognitive). (2) The functional significance of stimulus-synchronized theta oscillations in children is described for the first time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cognitive and neurophysiological outcome of cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia	STROKE			English	Article						cardiac arrest; cognition; hypothermia; P300 evoked response; Q-EEG	MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; SEQUELAE; EEG; DEMENTIA	Background and Purpose - Cognitive deficits are common in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of therapeutic hypothermia after CA on cognitive functioning and neurophysiological outcome. Methods - A cohort of 70 consecutive adult patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation CA were randomly assigned to therapeutic hypothermia of 33 C for 24 hours accomplished by external cooling or normothermia. Neuropsychological examination was performed to 45 of the 47 conscious survivors of CA (27 in hypothermia and 18 in normothermia group) 3 months after the incident. Quantitative electroencephalography (Q-EEG) and auditory P300 event-related potentials were studied on 42 patients at the same time point. Results - There were no differences between the 2 treatment groups in demographic variables, depression, or delays related to the resuscitation. No differences were found in any of the cognitive functions between the 2 groups. 67% of patients in hypothermia and 44% patients in normothermia group were cognitively intact or had only very mild impairment. Severe cognitive deficits were found in 15% and 28% of patients, respectively. All Q-EEG parameters were better in the hypothermia-treated group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. The amplitude of P300 potential was significantly higher in hypothermia-reated group. Conclusions - The use of therapeutic hypothermia was not associated with cognitive decline or neurophysiological deficits after out-of-hospital CA.

Sixty subjects, with 20 in each of the child (mean age 10.8 years), young-adult (mean age 20.7 years), and older adult (mean age 36.4 years) groups, performed an auditory Go/NoGo task while task performance variables and EEG were recorded. ERPs were derived to Go (response activation) and NoGo (response inhibition) stimuli, with the amplitude and latency of the N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERP components analyzed as a function of age. Results indicate improved task performance, and a reduction in the latency of each component and the amplitude of the N2 and P3 components, with increasing age. Analyses of Go versus NoGo effects indicated differential utilization of inhibition-related processing stages in children compared to adults, with some minor differences between the two adult groups. Go/NoGo effects were evident during early stages of processing, such as those indexed by the N1 and N2 components in children, but only in later stages, as indexed by P3, in adult subjects. This study provides much-needed data on the normative development of response activation and inhibition, as operationalized by the auditory Go/NoGo task, in children and two groups of younger/older adult subjects.

Methods: High-density ERP data (129 sites) recorded from 17 adults during tonal and phonetic oddball tasks were converted to a 10-20-system EEG montage (31 sites) using spherical spline interpolations. Cur-rent source density (CSD) waveforms were computed from the high- and low-density, but otherwise identical, ERPs, and correlated at corresponding locations. CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax of covariance loadings) to identify and effectively summarize temporally and spatially overlapping CSD components. Solutions were compared by correlating factor loadings and scores, and by plotting ANOVA F statistics derived from corresponding high- and low-resolution factor scores using representative sites. Results: High- and low-density CSD waveforms, PCA solutions, and F statistics were remarkably similar, yielding correlations of .9 <= r <= .999 between waveforms, loadings, and scores for almost all comparisons at low-density locations except for low-signal CSD waveforms at occipital sites. Each of the first 10 high-density factors corresponded precisely to one factor of the first 10 low-density factors, with each 10-factor set accounting for the meaningful CSD variance (> 91.6%). Conclusions: Low-density surface Laplacian estimates were shown to be accurate approximations of high-density CSDs at these locations, which adequately and quite sufficiently summarized group data. Moreover, reasonable approximations of many high-density scalp locations were obtained for group data from interpolations of low-density data. If group findings are the primary objective, as typical for cognitive ERP research, low-resolution CSD topographies may be as efficient, given the effective spatial smoothing when averaging across subjects and/or conditions. Significance: Conservative recommendations for restricting surface Laplacians to high-density recordings may not be appropriate for all ERP research applications, and should be re-evaluated considering objective, costs and benefits.

Auditory oddball paradigms are commonly used to investigate the processing of stimulus relevance. The present study used dense-array EEG and distributed source reconstructions to examine schizophrenia-normal differences in the processing of targets and standards as a function of the temporal sequence of stimuli. Brain responses were evaluated separately for early and late standards (standards 1-3 and 4-6 following a target, respectively) and early and late targets (those following 2-3 standards and 4-6 standards, respectively). The latencies of peaks (N1, P2, P3) in the event-related potential (ERP) waveforms did not differ between schizophrenia and normal subjects. However, schizophrenia-normal differences in neural activity, derived from minimum norm estimation, occurred at specific times during stimulus processing as a function of stimulus sequence. Schizophrenia patients displayed smaller activity than normals in early ERPs (left hemispheric N1, right frontal P2) to late targets, and they produced P3-like responses to late standards. Furthermore, during the P2/N2 time interval, opposite patterns of brain activity were elicited in schizophrenia and normal subjects in response to standards, indicating different neural responses to the same stimulus events. These results suggest attention allocation to task-irrelevant stimuli in schizophrenia, consequent upon insufficient representation of stimulus significance and context. Thus, schizophrenia compromises the ability to properly use context to solve even simple cognitive problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether neurophysiologic measures can aid in the detection and characterization of impairments in functional alertness in the elderly. Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, counter-balanced, crossover study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Twelve healthy older adults (62-75 years of age). Interventions: Diphenhydramine, 50 mg. Measurements and Results: Behavioral performance and electroencephalogram measures were obtained while participants completed spatial working memory and word recognition episodic memory tasks in a baseline interval before drug ingestion and in 4 hourly test intervals following drug ingestion. Relative to placebo, diphenhydramine had marginal effects on task performance yet was effective in reducing alertness, as evidenced by subjective ratings and objective neurophysiologic (electroencephalogram) markers. Diphenhydramine significantly reduced the amplitude of alertness-sensitive event-related potentials recorded during working memory task performance, including the N160 and P300. It also affected neurophysiologic processes underlying episodic memory, as evidenced by a reduction in the difference in event-related potentials between old and new words in the word recognition task. Discriminant analyses incorporating neurophysiologic measures showed that the time course of the central effects of diphenhydramine in older subjects was similar to that previously observed in young adults. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that diphenhydramine has adverse neurocognitive effects in elderly individuals and highlights the utility of incorporating direct measures of brain function into assessments of functional alertness.

Therefore, we had Subjects perform a task, which required a high degree of action monitoring, continuously for 2 h. In addition we tried to relate the observed behavioural and electrophysiological changes to motivational processes and individual differences. Changes in task performance due to fatigue were accompanied by a decrease in Ne/ERN and N2 amplitude, reflecting impaired action monitoring, as well as a decrease in CNV amplitude which reflects reduced response preparation with increasing fatigue. Increasing the motivational level of our subjects resulted in changes in behaviour and brain activity that were different for individual subjects. Subjects that increased their performance accuracy displayed an increase in Ne/ERN amplitude, while subjects that increased their response speed displayed an increase in CNV amplitude. We will discuss the effects prolonged task performance on the behavioural and physiological indices of action monitoring, as well as the relationship between fatigue, motivation and individual differences.

High-density EEG signals were recorded from the scalp monthly between 3 and 24 months of age. Two types of stimuli (100 vs. 100 Hz for standard stimuli; 100 vs. 300 Hz for deviant Stimuli; occurrence rate: 85:15%) were presented using an oddball paradigm. Latencies and amplitudes were compared across development. The results showed that latencies of P-150, N-250, P-350, and N-450 components gradually decreased with increasing age. Amplitudes of the N-250 and P-350 components gradually increased and reached the maximum at 9 months, and then gradually decreased with the increase of age. Mismatch negativity was not obvious at 3 months of age, but was seen at 4-5 months and became robust after 6 months. Robust late positivity was recorded at all ages. These mismatch responses were noticeable in the frontal, central, and parietal areas, and the maximal MMN amplitude distribution gradually moved from the parietal area to the frontal area across the age range. Two important periods-one around 6 months and the other around 9 months are suggested in the maturation of auditory central system. Dynamical changes in the underlying source strengths and orientations may be principal contributors to ERP morphological changes in infants within the first 24 months. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

BCIs allow control of computers or external devices with the regulation of brain activity only. Two different research traditions produced two different types of BCIs: invasive BCIs, realized with implanted electrodes in brain tissue and noninvasive BCIs using electrophysiological recordings in humans such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and metabolic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Clinical applications were reserved with few exceptions for the noninvasive approach: communication with the completely paralyzed and locked-in syndrome with slow cortical potentials (SCPs), sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), and P300 and restoration of movement and cortical reorganization in high spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived Communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients. Movement restoration was achieved with noninvasive BCIs based on SMRs control in single cases with spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations from spike patterns and extracellular field potentials. Whether invasive approaches allow superior brain control of motor responses compared to noninvasive BCI with intelligent peripheral devices and electrical muscle stimulation and EMG feedback remains to be demonstrated. The newly developed fMRI-BCIs and NIRS-BCIs offer promise for the learned regulation of emotional disorders and also disorders of small children (in the case of NIRS).

This potentiation was shown to last over I h. In the present study, the effect of a photic tetanus on oscillatory activity is investigated. EEGs were collected from eight healthy subjects in three conditions while visual checkerboards were displayed. Following baseline presentations in two conditions a lateralized visual tetanus was given, either to the left or right visual field, and in a third condition no tetanus was given. This was followed by a return to baseline presentations, both immediately after the tetanus/control block, and 1 h later. Enhanced event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the alpha rhythm lasting 1 h was seen following the photic tetanus over occipital electrodes. Because ERD of the alpha rhythm is thought to represent active cortex, these results suggest that the visual tetanus induces long-lasting cortical changes, with stronger neuronal assemblies and increased neuronal output.

Methods: For recording activities following A delta fiber stimulation relating to first pain, several kinds of lasers such as CO2, Tm:YAG and argon lasers are now widely used. The activity is frequently termed laser evoked potential (LEP), and we reviewed previous basic and clinical reports on LEP. We also introduced our new method, epidermal stimulation (ES), which is useful for recording brain activities by the signals ascending through A delta fibers. For recording activities following C fiber Stimulation relating to second pain, several methods have been used but weak CO2 laser stimuli applied to tiny areas of the skin were recently used. Results: EEG and MEG findings following C fiber stimulation were similar to those following A delta fiber stimulation except for a longer latency. Finally, we reviewed the effect of rTMS on acute pain perception. rTMS alleviated acute pain induced by intracutaneous injection of capsaicin, which activated C fibers, but it enhanced acute pain induced by laser stimulation, which activated A delta fibers. Conclusions: One promising approach in the near future is to analyze the change of a frequency band. This method will probably be used for evaluation of continuous tonic pain such as cancer pain, which evoked response studies cannot evaluate.

Aversive white noise (unconditioned stimulus) was paired with two exemplars of /ba/ (conditioned stimulus, CS+) occurring near the category boundary of a 10-item /ba/-da/ continuum. Two corresponding /da/ syllables served as the CS- and indicated absence of white noise. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants passively listened to the stimuli. Prior to the EEG session and after intermittent conditioning, participants were asked to identify the syllables in a categorical perception task. Analysis of time-locked electrocortical data revealed amplitude modulations of the N2 (248-312 ms) component as a function of acquired stimulus properties (CS+ versus CS-). Over right hemisphere regions, negativity was specifically enhanced for the CS+ during intermittent conditioning. During extinction, this conditioning effect was paralleled by findings in the time-frequency domain, showing greater oscillatory activity in the gamma-band (25-40 Hz) range, 80-120 ms following onset of the CS+ compared with CS-. A similar pattern emerged in a later time segment of 400-600 ms (30-45 Hz). Aversive conditioning was not reflected in superior categorical perception performance. Our data indicate that electrocortical correlates of speech syllable perception are susceptible to changes induced by contingencies. Physiological differences were not manifest in behavioral advantage for a specific stimulus, i.e., the CS+, however. We conclude that training speech categorization by merely enhancing motivational relevance is not effective for conveying behavioral improvement.

Brain signals and the cholinergic and GABAergic systems, in vivo and in vitro evidence from studies on the retina, or the "gamma band" oscillations in neuron membrane potential/spiking rate and neuronal assemblies are examples in this respect. However, spontaneous and stimulus-event-related signals at any location and time point reflect brain state conditions that depend on neuromodulation, neurotransmitter interaction, hormones (e.g., glucocorticois, ACTH, estrogens) and neuroendocrine interaction at different levels of complexity, as well as on the spontaneous or experimentally-induced changes in metabolism (e.g., glucose, ammonia), blood flow, pO2, pCO2, acid/base balance, K activity, etc., that occur locally or systemically. Any of these factors can account for individual differences and/or changes over time that often are (or need to be) neglected in pharmaco-EEG studies or are dealt with statistically and by controlling the experimental conditions. As a result, the electrophysiological effects of neuroactive drugs are to an extent non-specific and require adequate modeling and precise correlation with independent parameters (e.g., drug kinetics, vigilance, hormonal profile or metabolic status, etc.) to avoid biased results in otherwise controlled studies.

Here, we utilized acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) to reduce the brain synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), which is thought to have a central role in regulation of emotions and mood in humans. ATD effects on event-related potentials and magnetic fields were studied using a passive odd-ball paradigm in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over design. Auditory responses were recorded simultaneously with high-resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electro-encephalography (EEG) in 14 healthy subjects, 5 h after ATD or a control condition. ATD significantly increased depressed mood and lowered plasma tryptophan concentration (total tryptophan decreased by 75%, free tryptophan decreased by 39%). As compared with the control condition, ATD increased the amplitudes of mismatch negativity (MMN) to duration and frequency changes and decreased the latencies of magnetic MMN to frequency changes in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ear stimulated. Further, ATD modulated N1m latencies and decreased P2m source activity. ATD increased the interhemispheric latency difference of MMNm to frequency changes. No effects on P50 were observed. The present results suggest serotonergic modulation of preattentive auditory change detection, suggested to initiate involuntary attention shifting in the human brain. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Data were separately recorded during the same event-related experimental design, consisting of visually presented single letters and nonalphabetic symbols, that had to be either simply observed (passive condition) or read aloud (active condition). This protocol was useful for exploring the neural correlates of reading processes. Healthy adults participated in the experiment. Averaged ERPs were decomposed by Independent Component Analysis; Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was applied to estimate the current density distribution maps of each independent component. fMRI images time series were analyzed by multiple linear regression. ERP-fMRI correspondence was quantified by computing the Euclidean distance between LORETA local maxima and clusters of significantly activated fMRI voxels. During reading aloud of letters, that is clearly the task most similar to natural reading conditions, significant electrical and hemodynamic response was observed in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22/39) just before articulation and in the bilateral middle superior temporal gyrus (BA 22/37) during and after verbal-motor production. These results indicate that the middle-superior temporal gyrus plays a crucial and multifunctional role in grapheme-phoneme matching.

Resting EEG sources correlate with attentional span in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease (AD); electroencephalography (EEG); low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); neuropsychological measures	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; CORTICAL CHOLINERGIC FIBERS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REACTION TIME TASKS; BAND POWER CHANGES	Previous evidence has shown that resting delta and alpha electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms are abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its potential preclinical stage (mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Here, we tested the hypothesis that these EEG rhythms are correlated with memory and attention in the continuum across MCI and AD. Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 53 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). These sources were correlated with neuropsychological measures such as Rey list immediate recall (word short-term memory), Rey list delayed recall (word medium-term memory), Digit span forward (immediate memory for digits probing focused attention), and Corsi span forward (visuo-spatial immediate memory probing focused attention). A statistically significant negative correlation (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05) was observed between Corsi span forward score and amplitude of occipital or temporal delta sources across MCI and AD subjects. Furthermore, a positive correlation was shown between Digit span forward score and occipital alpha 1 sources (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05). These results suggest that cortical sources of resting delta and alpha rhythms correlate with neuropsychological measures of immediate memory based on focused attention in the continuum of MCI and AD subjects.

Eighteen young native English-speakers (6 males, 12 females) participated in the study. Two sets of 720 prime-target pairs (240 affectively congruent, 240 affectively incongruent, and 240 neutral) used either words or pictures as primes and only words as targets. ERPs were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes while participants pressed either "Happy" or "Sad" buttons to indicate target pleasantness. The response time (RT) results confirmed an affective priming effect, with faster responses to affectively congruent trials (659 ms) than affectively incongruent trials (690 ms). Affectively incongruent trials had larger and more negative N200 activation than those to neutral trials. Importantly, a delayed N400 for word prime-target pairs matched the RT results with larger negative amplitudes for incongruent than congruent pairs. This finding suggests that the N400 component is not only sensitive to semantic mismatches, but is also sensitive to affective mismatches for word prime-target pairs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Under the conventional conditions of a 5000 Hz EEG sampling rate. but in the absence of the MRI slice-timing signals, the imaging artifact during each slice scanning is theoretically inferred to be a linear combination of the average artifact waveform and its derivatives, deduced by band-limited Taylor's expansion. Technically, the imaging artifact reduction algorithm is equivalent to an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Results: The capability of this novel method removing the imaging artifacts of EEG recording during fMRI scanning has been demonstrated by a phantom experiment. Moreover, the effectiveness of this method in conserving the time-frequency features of EEG activity has been evaluated by both visually evoked experiments and alpha waves. Conclusions: The adaptive FIR method is an effective method of removing the imaging artifacts under conventional conditions, and also conserving the time-frequency EEG signals. Significance: The proposed adaptive FIR method, removing the imaging artifacts, combined with the wavelet-based non-linear noise reduction (WNNR) method [Wan X, Iwata K, Riera J, OZaki T, Kitamura M, Kawashima R.

In this study, an event-related brain potential (ER-P) paradigm to record the on-line responses to the processing of sentences is chosen as an example. In order to give attention to both utilizing the ERPs' temporal resolution of milliseconds and overcoming the insensibility of cerebral location ERP sources, we separate these sources in space and time based on a combined method of independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution tomography (LORETA) algorithms. ICA blindly separate the input ERP data into a sum of temporally independent and spatially fixed components arising from distinct or overlapping brain or extra-brain sources. And then the spatial maps associated with each ICA component are analyzed, with use of LORETA to uniquely locate its cerebral sources throughout the full brain according to the assumption that neighboring neurons are simultaneously and synchronously activated. Our results show that the cerebral computation mechanism underlies content words reading is mediated by the orchestrated activity of several spatially distributed brain sources located in the temporal, frontal, and parietal areas, and activate at distinct time intervals and are grouped into different statistically independent components. Thus ICA-LORETA analysis provides an encouraging and effective method to study brain dynamics from ERP.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from electrodes located over the primary sensorimotor cortices during the performance of a between-hand choice reaction time task in which foreperiod duration (the interval between the warning and the imperative signals, 800 vs. 2800ms) was varied across blocks of trials. In order to increase the spatial resolution of the EEG traces, surface Laplacian was estimated. The amplitude of the negative wave developing over the hemisphere contralateral to the response was smaller for the short foreperiod associated with the best performance level. These results indicate that the activation of the primary sensorimotor cortex involved in the response is less pronounced for the short foreperiod, suggesting that temporal advance information increases the efficiency of the cortical motor command.

A follow-up testing was conducted 3 months after the initial recordings with a twofold purpose: (1) to validate the reproducibility of the experimental protocol in normal subjects; and (2) to study changes of inter-hemispheric PMBS-symmetry as a response to recovery of motor function. PMBS values were calculated and their topographic distributions illustrated at various time instances following movement offset. Significant PMBS patterns were present in all normal subjects, with only minor differences within consecutive recordings. The side of hemiparesis in acute stroke subjects could be distinguished (P = 0.04) on the basis of the signed symmetry index, a quantitative measure of lateralization. The follow-up testing on three recovered stroke subjects revealed a trend of changes in the lateralization towards the contralateral side of movement, an indication that the cortical organization of movement following recovery turned out as reported for normal subjects. Further clinical investigations need to be carried out to evaluate the relationship between recovery and PMBS symmetry on a large number of subjects, using the method presented here.

However, neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are poorly understood. We investigated whether MDD affects neural mechanisms of involuntary attention studied by auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs). Methods: AEPs and AEFs were studied in a passive odd-ball paradigm in 13 drug-free patients with unipolar MDD during an acute episode and 12 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects. Auditory responses to monaurally presented frequent " standard" tones, infrequent " deviant" tones (10% and 20% frequency change) and occasional " novel" sounds (complex sounds) were simultaneously recorded with whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Results: P1 and P1 m latencies were decreased in patients with MDD, compared with those in healthy subjects. Further, the mismatch negativity amplitude to the 10% frequency deviance in the EEG, but not in the MEG, was increased in MDD. We observed no differences in N1/N1 m and P3a responses in the MEG and EEG. The magnitude of decrease in P1/P1 m latency correlated negatively with the severity of depression in the patients. Conclusions: Early auditory processing is impaired in patients with MDD during an acute episode, probably reflecting dysfunctional frontotemporal neural circuits. These dysfunctions may contribute to the cognitive disturbances observed in people with MDD.

Based on the fusion results, we applied spatial target likelihood maps to present the estimated target locations in the images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the method on multiple subjects.

[Simson, R., Vaughan, H.G., Jr., Ritter, W., 1977. The scalp topography of potentials in auditory and visual go/nogo tasks. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology 43, 864-875], the difference between no-go P3 and go-P3 (the go/no-go effect) is due to overlap of P3 onto the return of the preceding contingent negative variation (CNV) in no-go trials and onto the continuing CNV in go trials. Similarly, according to Kok [Kok, A., 1986. Effects of degradation of visual stimuli on components of the event-related potential (ERP) in go/nogo reaction tasks. Biological Psychology 23, 21-38], the go/no-go effect is due to movement-related negative potentials, in particular contralateral negativity, adding with P3 in go trials. To investigate these notions, we studied how CNV, go-P3 and no-go P3 are lateralized at fronto-central sites when the side of the response varies across trials, comparing these effects between hand movements and eye movements and delineating them more precisely for hand movements with multichannel recordings. The go/no-go effect was larger and contralaterally lateralized with hand movements than with eye movements. Dipole analysis dissected its components into a large contribution of the medial cingulate gyrus, into activity of motor areas contralateral to the cued hand and a left-frontal source. Motor-related portions of the effect seemed to build upon and extend motor-related components included in CNV. Results provide support for the notion that the go/no-go effect is related to movement-related potentials. We suggest that go-P3 and no-go P3 are characterized by addition and reduction of motor-related activation to the core P3. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ICA blindly decomposes multi-channel EEG data into maximally independent component processes (ICs) that typically express either particularly brain generated EEG activities or some type of non-brain artifacts (line or other environmental noise, eye blinks and other eye movements, or scalp or heart muscle activity). Each brain and non-brain IC is identified with an activity time course (its 'activation') and a set of relative strengths of its projections (by volume conduction) to the recording electrodes (its 'scalp map'). Many non-articraft IC scalp maps strongly resemble the projection of a single dipole, allowing the location and orientation of the best-fitting equivalent dipole (or other source model) to be easily determined. In favorable circumstances, ICA decomposition of high-density scalp EEG data appears to allow concurrent monitoring, with high time resolution, of separate EEG activities in twenty or more separate cortical EEG source areas. We illustrate the differences between ICA and traditional approaches to EEG analysis by comparing time courses and mean event related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) of scalp channel and IC data. Comparing IC activities across subjects necessitates clustering of similar Ics based on common dynamic and/or spatial features. We discuss and illustrate such a component clustering strategy. In sum, continued application of ICA methods in EEG research should continue to yield new insights into the nature and role of the complex macroscopic cortical dynamics captured by scalp electrode recordings.

Researches on the brain-computer interface (BCI) are aimed to help such patients. This study analyzes the characteristics of brainwaves when a subject thinks of a "yes" or "no" response to an auditory stimuli question. Experiment using auditory stimuli of the form of questions is performed. We discriminate between the activities of the brainwaves of the "yes" and "no" responses using the alpha power. Nineteen healthy subjects (7 females and 12 males), aged between 20 and 35 years, volunteered to participate in the experiment. In the experiment, for 14 out of 19 subjects (73.680, the average alpha power for the "yes" response is lower than that for the "no " response.

They were instructed to shift their attention to either the left or right visual hemifield according to a cue, which could be valid or invalid. Thereafter, a peripheral target had to be evaluated. At posterior parietal brain areas early components of the event-related potential (P1 and N1) were higher when the cue had been valid compared with invalid. An anticipatory attention effect was found in EEG alpha magnitude at parieto-occipital electrode sites. Starting 200 ms before target onset alpha amplitudes were significantly stronger suppressed at sites contralateral to the attended visual hemifield than ipsilateral to it. In addition, phase coupling between prefrontal and posterior parietal electrode sites was calculated. It was found that prefrontal cortex shows stronger phase coupling with posterior sites that are contralateral to the attended hemifield than ipsilateral sites. The results suggest that a shift of attention selectively modulates excitability of the contralateral posterior parietal cortex and that this posterior modulation of alpha activity is controlled by prefrontal regions.

In previous EEG studies on aesthetic and symmetry judgments, an early frontocentral negativity has been observed for not beautiful judgments, and interpreted as reflecting an impression formation. In addition, a lateralized late positivity, more pronounced in the aesthetic than in the symmetry judgment task, has been interpreted as reflecting evaluative categorization; and a sustained posterior negativity for not symmetric judgments, has been interpreted as reflecting a prolonged symmetry analysis. Here, we investigated whether these processes occur spontaneously, i.e. independent of an aesthetics task instruction or a judgment task demand. Participants were randomly assigned to two group conditions. In the Viewing condition, participants were instructed to view graphic patterns, and to detect a probe. In the Contemplation condition, participants were instructed to contemplate the beauty of the patterns, and to detect a probe. No aesthetics-related response was required in either condition. ERP results suggest that symmetry analysis occurred spontaneously. Evaluative categorization, reflected by a late positivity, required an aesthetics instruction and did not occur spontaneously. This process was elicited without an overt aesthetic judgment. An early frontocentral negativity for not beautiful patterns, interpreted as reflecting impression formation, did not occur (in contrast to previous studies that required an overt aesthetic judgment). Given the present data, aesthetic appreciation of graphic patterns requires different sub-processes. Aesthetic contemplation is reflected by a lateralized late positivity, whilst an aesthetic judgment is additionally reflected by an early frontocentral negativity. Aesthetic appreciation of beauty appears to require intention and is not spontaneous in character. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental paradigm employed was the use of electroencephalography to measure the detection of semantic incongruity within written sentences, as indexed by an N400 event-related potential. Whilst the seven controls appropriately demonstrated N400 potentials only to semantically incongruent stimuli, the seven participants with AS inappropriately demonstrated N400 potentials to congruent stimuli. These results are compatible with the possibility that the participants with AS did not use the context within sentences to predict the final word of the sentences.

In recent years, the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and movement-related potentials (MRPs) are utilized as important features in motor related BCI system, and the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm has shown to be very useful for ERD-based classification. However, as MRPs are slow nonoscillatory EEG potential shifts, CSP is not an appropriate approach for MRPs-based classification. Here, another spatial filtering algorithm, discriminative spatial patterns (DSP), is newly introduced for better extraction of the difference in the amplitudes of MRPs, and it is integrated with CSP to extract the features from the EEG signals recorded during voluntary left versus right finger movement tasks. A support vector machines (SVM) based framework is designed as the classifier for the features. The results show that, for MRPs and ERD features, the combined spatial filters can realize the single-trial EEG classification better than anyone of DSP and CSP alone does. Thus, we propose an EEG-based BCI system with the two feature sets, one based on CSP (ERD) and the other based on DSP (MRPs), classified by SVM.

The toolbox provides tools for data analysis and visualization of the most commonly used measures of time-frequency transformed event related data as well as data decomposition through non-negative matrix and multi-way (tensor) factorization. The decompositions provided can accommodate additional dimensions like subjects, conditions or repeats and as such they are perfected for group analysis. Furthermore, the toolbox enables tracking of phase locked activity from one channel-time-frequency instance to another as well as tools for artifact rejection in the time-frequency domain. Several other features are highlighted. ERPWAVELAB can freely be downloaded from www.erpwavelab.org, requires EEGLAB [Delorme A, Makeig S.

High resolution event related brain potentials were recorded to capture the brain activation underlying the motor execution and motor imagery. ERS and ERD were studied using a complex morlet wavelet decomposition of EEG responses. The results show similar patterns of beta ERD/ERS after the stimulus onset, for both the actual and imagery finger tapping task. This approach and results can be regarded as indicative evidences of a new strategy for recognizing imagined movements in EEG-based brain computer interface research. The long-term objective of this study is to create a multiposition brain controlled switch that is activated by signals that are measured directly from a human's brain.

Participants' task was to detect deviations of the rule or category restriction (single deviants) or both (double deviants). In Experiment 1, participants detected double deviants faster and more accurately than single deviants. This result is compatible with statistical facilitation, i.e. with distinct information processing in two channels. Experiment 2 used the same paradigm but did not require an immediate behavioural response to deviants. Here, event-related brain potentials revealed a redundant deviance effect in the P3 component (i.e. shorter latency and larger amplitude for double deviants compared with either single deviant). Category restriction deviants additionally led to an increased P2 amplitude. It is suggested that rule and category restriction information is processed separately at central levels, and that two central stages can be distinguished in the processing of categorical visual sequence events that make different use of short-term and long-term memory resources.

However, little work has been done examining the electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of early sensory processing in cannabis users. The present study therefore examined visual function in cannabis users as assessed via the steady state visual evoked potential. (SSVEP). Methods: SSVEPs were examined in current cannabis users (n = 17; 59% male; mean age = 23.2 (S.D. = 5.3)) and drug-naive controls (n = 16; 38% male; mean age = 21.3 (S.D. = 3. 1)) to periodic photic stimulation presented at 18 and 25 Hz. The visual SSVEP was quantified via spectral power and the phase-locking factor (PLF) at each frequency of stimulation. The transient N160 event-related potential (ERP) was also evaluated at stimulus onset. Results: The results showed that for both frequencies, female subjects in general displayed larger visual SSVEPs. A significant gender X group interaction also occurred at 18 Hz of stimulation, and age of onset of cannabis use positively correlated with 18 Hz spectral power values. Finally, the transient N160 component was shown to be reduced in cannabis users, regardless of gender. Conclusions: The present study was the first to demonstrate altered visual SSVEPs in cannabis users, and extends previous research demonstrating increased steady state responses in female subjects. While decreased SSVEPs provide initial evidence of altered oscillatory properties in primary visual circuits, reduction of the transient N160 component suggests disruption of later-stage visual processing in cannabis users. Significance: These data provide evidence of cannabinoid modulation of sensory/perceptual function in the visual system, and indicates that cannabis use may affect the oscillatory properties of sensory cortical circuits.

First, we briefly discuss the current classification of different memory systems and their neuroanatomical correlates, focusing on episodic memory and evidence from lesion studies. We then survey both fMRI and iEEG studies of memory function. For each modality, we discuss its physiological basis, as well as point out key studies that have led to new insights regarding memory. Advantages and disadvantages of each brain mapping modality are addressed. Wherever appropriate, we point out implications these studies have for the treatment of patients with epilepsy. We conclude this review with further discussion regarding the potential for combining fMRI and iEEG techniques in future investigations of memory function. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Within the predominantly inattentive type of AD/HD (AD/HDin), two distinct groups have been identified, based on underlying EEG activity that represents either cortical hypoarousal, or a maturational lag (with EEGs resembling those of younger children). This study investigated whether ERPs from an inter-modal oddball task could differentiate AD/HDin children from controls, and whether the ERPs of the two previously identified subgroups of AD/HDin children with different EEG profiles differ on this task. AD/HDin children (N=54), 27 identified as cortically hypoaroused and 27 as maturationally lagged, and 27 age-matched controls, were presented with an inter-modal oddball task in which the non-target stimulus was a counter-phasing checkerboard and the target was a 2000 Hz auditory tone. Stimuli (20% targets) were presented at a fixed ISI of 1.03 s and participants were required to count all targets. The task successfully differentiated the AD/HDin children from controls, with AD/HDin children having smaller N1, P2 and P3 amplitudes to both the auditory targets and the visual non-targets. These results were interpreted as indicating a generalised stimulus registration, facilitation and processing deficit in AD/HDin. The only difference between the EEG-defined subtypes was a relative increase in left-frontal NI amplitude in the cortically hypoaroused group. This was interpreted as indicating reduced frontal lateralisation of N1 in the maturational lag group, supporting its labelling, and anomalous lateralisation in the cortical hypoarousal group.

Nishina has already insisted that recognition of visual perception by the aperture problem depends in display time. In this paper, we discuss how other experimental parameters, e.g., radius, distance between circles, and speed of bar depend with recognition rate by measurement analysis of the perception. We simultaneously estimate the reaction latency of the perception by electroencephalograms(EEG) analysis, and we localize the brain activity area by equivalent current dipole(ECD). We then discuss the relationship between the reaction latency of the visual evoked potential(VEP), event related potential(ERP) and the localized equivalent current dipole(ECD) in the visual pathway. By these discussion, we concluded that perception would be localized with the prefrontal lobe.

For more than two decades, several research groups have tried to build a device called 'brain computer interface' (BCI) to make it available for people having several disabilities such as the locked in syndrome through the use of the recording of electroencephalography activity while the patients are being visually stimulated. Aim. To obtain a P300 component elicited by intensifications of images arranged in a matrix in an oddball paradigm in two selection modes: assigned and free. Subjects and methods. A 5 x 5 matrix for communication purposes was used to visually stimulate 12 volunteers while their event related potentials were recorded in three leads (Fz, Cz and Pz). Off-line analyses were performed to obtain the P300 component which was elicited by targets images intensified randomly by rows or columns. Results. In both modalities assigned and free, all volunteers generated a reliable P300 component. Confirmation of the selected images was made through a comparison of the P300 when each target, row and column matched. In the free selection mode, higher amplitude and a broader activation including frontal leads was observed. No significant differences in the P300 latency were found. Conclusion. In all volunteers the elicited P300 allows the identification of the selected images in the 5 x 5 matrix. In the present study the use of drawings representing ideas instead of letters might increase the communication rate in a P300based BCI.

Recorded in parallel sessions, the slow-wave late positive potential (LPP) and visual cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were both modulated by the rated intensity of picture arousal. The amplitude of the LPP correlated significantly with BOLD intensity in lateral occipital, inferotemporal, and parietal visual areas across picture contents. Estimated strength of modeled regional sources did not correlate significantly with regional BOLD intensity. These data suggest that the enhanced positive slow wave seen over posterior sites during emotional picture processing represents activity in a circuit of visual cortical structures, reflecting a perceptual sensitivity to the motivational relevance of visual scenes.

According to the ideomotor framework of action control, intention-based actions primarily refer to anticipated action effects (in other words response-stimulus [R-S] bindings), whereas stimulus-based actions are commonly assumed to be more strongly determined by stimulus-response [S-R] bindings. We explored differences in the functional signatures of both modes of action control in a temporal bisection task. Participants either performed a choice response by pressing one out of two keys in response to a preceding stimulus (stimulus-based action), or pressed one out of two keys to produce the next stimulus (intention-based action). In line with the ideomotor framework, we found intention-based actions to be shifted in time towards their anticipated effects (the next stimulus), whereas stimulus-based actions were shifted towards their preceding stimulus. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in the EEG revealed marked differences in action preparation for the two tasks. The data as a whole provide converging evidence for functional differences in the selection of motor actions as a function of their triggering conditions, and support the notion of two different modes of action selection, one being exogenous or mainly stimulus-driven, the other being endogenous or mainly intention-driven.

A neural mass model of spectral responses in electrophysiology	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CONNECTIONS; TRANSITION	We present a neural mass model of steady-state membrane potentials measured with local field potentials or electroencephalography in the frequency domain. This model is an extended version of previous dynamic causal models for investigating event-related potentials in the time-domain. In this paper, we augment the previous formulation with parameters that mediate spike-rate adaptation and recurrent intrinsic inhibitory connections. We then use linear systems analysis to show how the model's spectral response changes with its neurophysiological parameters. We demonstrate that much of the interesting behaviour depends on the non-linearity which couples mean membrane potential to mean spiking rate. This non-linearity is analogous, at the population level, to the firing rate-input curves often used to characterize singlecell responses. This function depends on the model's gain and adaptation currents which, neurobiologically, are influenced by the activity of modulatory neurotransmitters. The key contribution of this paper is to show how neuromodulatory effects can be modelled by adding adaptation currents to a simple phenomenological model of EEG. Critically, we show that these effects are expressed in a systematic way in the spectral density of EEG recordings. Inversion of the model, given such non-invasive recordings, should allow one to quantify pharmacologically induced changes in adaptation currents. In short, this work establishes a forward or generative model of electrophysiological recordings for psychopharmacological studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Auditory processing is enhanced in blind compared to sighted people, and the enhancement might reflect encroachment of auditory transmission onto visual cortex. To address this issue, we recorded the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) correlated with auditory related paradoxical visual awareness in a subject with traumatic total late-onset blindness. We found that (1) there was auditory related brain activity over the occipital visual scalp regions starting from a very early stage (< 80 ms) and (2) this occipital activity was significantly different between "visually aware" and "visually unaware" responses in the P1 (40-80 ms) component following meaningful stimuli. There was also a significant difference between responses with and without visual awareness in the N1 (100-120 ms) component following either tones or meaningful stimuli. The phosphenes accompanying auditory stimuli in the ERP experiment were always perceived to be directly in front of the subject and this was reproduced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the blind primary visual cortex and by sudden sounds delivered to the side or behind the subject. The TMS induced phosphenes were restricted to the central part of the space and were, at least qualitatively, the same as those induced by sounds. The results are clear evidence that human perceptual functions can be reorganized after sudden, late-onset, total ocular blindness.

The relative and absolute timing of these stages and the degree to which they occur parallel or in serial order has traditionally been investigated with behavioural methods, mainly reaction times. This classical mental chronometry has over the past decades been complemented with neurophysiological approaches, using event-related potentials (ERPs), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This review highlights the contributions and limitations of these techniques and focuses on recent advances in the combination of ERPs and fMRI to elucidate working memory and number processing. It will be argued that similar design principles as established for behavioural studies of mental chronometry should apply to neurophysiological investigations as well.

To make BCIs practical, the classifiers for discriminating different brain states must have the ability of session-to-session transfer. This paper proposes an algorithm for classifying single-trial ECoG during motor imagery of different sessions. Three features, derived from two physiological phenomena, movement-related potentials (MRP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD), and extracted by common spatial subspace decomposition (CSSD) and waveform, mean, are combined to perform classification tasks. The specific signal processing methods utilized are described in detail. The algorithm was successfully applied to Data Set I of BCI Competition III, and achieved a classification accuracy of 91% on test set.

Therefore, high speed signal processing is of great importance in BCI systems. In this study, we suggest and calculate a time pattern for information variations within the EEG signal recorded during mental tasks. Therefore, it is possible to limit the length of the EEG signal from beginning up to the information maximization point, hence reducing the processing time. In this work Wavelet entropy is employed for information content evaluation of the EEG signal.	[Abdollahi, F.; Setarehdan, S.

In a series of behavioral, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments we examined the influence of working memory (WM) load related to a relevant visual stimulus on the processing of irrelevant backgrounds. We further addressed two open questions about the mechanism of load-dependent modulation: (i) is this modulation dependent on regional activity (i.e. phasic)? (ii) At what processing stage does this modulation take place? Load was manipulated by a WM task and concurrently the processing of irrelevant visual objects was assessed with fMRI and EEG. To examine the dependency of this modulation on intrinsic activity, we varied the activity level of visual areas by presenting objects with different levels of degradation. Activity in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) increased with object visibility and was phasically modulated by WM load. Event related potentials revealed that this phasic modulation occurred similar to 170 ms after stimulus onset, indicative of an early selection under high load. The results indicate a phasic modulatory effect of WM load on visual object processing in the LOC that is comparable to the effects found for perceptual load manipulations.

Correlations between the Content of Toxic and Essential Metals in the Organism and Characteristics of EEG Potentials in Youths under Conditions of an Urban Environment	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; evoked potentials; event-related potentials; toxic and essential metals		In 18- to 19-year-old students, the content of a number of microelements, as well as of calcium, in biologically stable tissues (hair samples) was measured using X-ray fluorescent analysis. In the tested persons, we observed a certain deficit of main elements (calcium, copper, and zinc), while in some persons the levels of toxic lead and strontium were exceeded. Correlation analysis of the parameters of EEG potentials (current EEG and evoked and event-related potentials, EPs and ERPs, respectively) showed the existence of a few significant (or close to those) correlations of the spectral powers of some rhythms and derivatives of a few indices of the background EEG and more numerous cases of correlations of the parameters of EPs and ERPs (latencies and amplitudes) with the contents of the studied elements. The physiological importance of metals, according to the number of characteristics of EEG potentials that correlate with their contents, can be arranged in descending order as follows: As, Zn > Ca > Cd > Pb > Sr. None of the studied parameters of EEG phenomena correlated with the level of copper. The strength of correlations varied from weak to mild (0.29 < R < 0.50). The densest correlations were observed for the concentrations of toxic lead and cadmium. With respect to the characteristics of ERPs, some of the elements under study demonstrated synergism (e.g., lead and arsenic), while others were in an antagonistic relation (cadmium and calcium).

Optimal sustained attention is linked to the spectral content of background EEG activity: greater ongoing tonic alpha (similar to 10 Hz) power supports successful phasic goal activation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; INCREASES; REFLECT	Efficient executive control frequently requires the timely activation or re-activation of a task-goal to enable purposeful behaviour. Additionally, more generalized factors such as alertness or neurological health will influence the efficiency with which control can be implemented. Goal-directed processes have been investigated by examining event-related potentials (ERPs), but much less is known about the involvement of background or 'tonic' processes reflected in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), and how these affect the phasic processes expressed in the broad-band ERP. Here, we investigate the relationship between a key attention-sensitive tonic process - the alpha rhythm - and relevant phasic processes observed during a sustained attention paradigm in neurologically healthy subjects. We report that subjects with relatively higher tonic alpha power (similar to 10 Hz) show a larger-amplitude late positive ERP component that is thought to index goal activation and has been found to predict good sustained attention performance as defined by correct response patterns. Source localization results suggest that the neural generators responsible for oscillatory alpha activity, which are found primarily in the parietal and occipital lobes, are distinct from those giving rise to the late positive component. The results are discussed in terms of increased alpha synchrony facilitating goal-directed behaviour.

Here, we implemented continuous and simultaneous EEG/fMR1 to identify BOLD signal changes related to P3b component of P300, and 64 channels of EEG were recorded in 11 subjects during Landot Ring task inside a 1.5 T functional magnet resonance (MR) scanner using an MR-compatible EEG recording system. Functional scanning by echoplanar imaging covered almost the entire cerebrum every 2 s, leaving gaps of 2 s without scanning. Off-line MR]l artifact subtraction software was applied to obtain continuous EEG data. Additionally, a P300 wave matched filter was constructed to inspect P300 wave occurrence following every target stimulus, target stimuli inspected to induce P300 were detected and their MRI scan number were then used as input for an event-related fMRI analysis. Finally MRI statistical parametric maps were constructed and corrected for multiple comparisons. By random effect group analysis, activations were detected in the right superior parietal lobule and bilaterally in inferior parietal lobule(p < 0.001, uncorrected). The results demonstrated the upper regions were sources of P3b component and involved in target detection in memory comparison task.

Lopes			Mu rhythm (de)synchronization and EEG single-trial classification of different motor imagery tasks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HAND MOVEMENT; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; ATTENTION; POTENTIALS; SELECTION; HUMANS; CORTEX; ALPHA	We studied the reactivity of EEG rhythms (mu rhythms) in association with the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue movement with 60 EEG electrodes in nine able-bodied subjects. During hand motor imagery, the hand mu rhythm blocked or desynchronized in all subjects, whereas an enhancement of the hand area mu rhythm was observed during foot or tongue motor imagery in the majority of the subjects. The frequency of the most reactive components was 11.7 Hz +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD). While the desynchronized components were broad banded and centered at 10.9 Hz +/- 0.9, the synchronized components were narrow banded and displayed higher frequencies at 12.0 Hz +/- 1.0. The discrimination between the four motor imagery tasks based on classification of single EEG trials improved when, in addition to event-related desynchronization (ERD), event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns were induced in at least one or two tasks. This implies that such EEG phenomena may be utilized in a multi-class brain-computer interface (BCI) operated simply by motor imagery. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, the brain responses of healthy subjects to auditory oddball paradigms, standard and deviant stimuli, recorded on an Fz electrode site were studied using a short-term version of the smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution (STSW) method. A smoothing kernel was designed to preserve the auto energy of the signal with maximum time and frequency resolutions. Analysis was conducted mainly on the time-frequency distributions (TFDs) of sweeps recorded during successive trials including the TFD of averaged single sweeps as the evoked time-frequency (ETF) brain response and the average of TFDs of single sweeps as the time-frequency (TF) brain response. Also the power entropy and the phase angles of the signal at frequency f and time t locked to the stimulus onset were studied across single trials as the TF power-locked and the TF phase-locked brain responses, respectively. TFDs represented in this way demonstrated the ERP spectro-temporal characteristics from multiple perspectives. The time-varying energy of the individual components manifested interesting TF structures in the form of amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) energy bursts. The TF power-locked and phase-locked brain responses provoked ERP energies in a manner modulated by cognitive functions, an observation requiring further investigation. These results may lead to a better understanding of integrative brain dynamics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the past, essentially in the last decade, various methods for extracting the structure in complex data have been developed and successfully exploited for visualization or classification purposes. Here we propose to use one of these methods, the Laplacian eigenmaps, on EEG data and prove that it provides an powerful approach to visualize and understand the underlying structure of evoked potentials or multitrial time series.

Here, we propose a simple and robust way to integrate functional MRI (fMRI) with single trial event-related potentials (ERP) to provide a more complete spatiotemporal characterization of evoked responses in the human brain. The idea behind the approach is to find brain regions whose fMRI responses can be predicted by paradigm-induced amplitude modulations of simultaneously acquired single trial ERPs. The method was used to study a variant of a two-stimulus auditory target detection (odd-ball) paradigm that manipulated predictability through alternations of stimulus sequences with random or regular target-to-target intervals. In addition to electrophysiologic and hemodynamic evoked responses to auditory targets per se, single-trial modulations were expressed during the latencies of the P2 (170-ms N2 (200-ms), and P3 (320-ms) components and predicted spatially separated fMRI activation patterns. These spatiotemporal matches, i.e., the prediction of hemodynamic activation by time-variant information from single trial ERPs, permit inferences about regional responses using fMRI with the temporal resolution provided by electrophysiology.

Temporal dynamics of access to consciousness in the attentional blink	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; TOP-DOWN; PHASE SYNCHRONY; ALPHA; EEG; TASK; MODULATION; CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE	Presentation of two targets in close temporal succession often results in an impairment of conscious perception for the second stimulus. Previous studies have identified several electrophysiological correlates for this so-called 'attentional blink'. Components of the event-related potential (ERP) such as the N2 and the P3, but also oscillatory brain signals have been shown to distinguish between detected and missed stimuli, and thus, conscious perception. Here we investigate oscillatory responses that specifically relate to conscious stimulus processing together with potential ERP predictors. Our results show that successful target detection is associated with enhanced coherence in the low beta frequency range, but a decrease in alpha coherence before and during target presentation. In addition, we find an inverse relation between the P3 amplitudes associated with the first and second target. We conclude that the resources allocated to first and second target processing are directly nlirrored by the P3 component and, moreover, that brain states before and during stimulus presentation, as reflected by oscillatory brain activity, strongly determine the access to consciousness. Thus, becoming aware of a stimulus seems to depend on the dynamic interaction between a number of widely distributed neural processes, rather than on the modulation of one single process or component.

EEG was recorded in 14 epilepsy surgery candidates during preoperative video-stereo-EEG monitoring. Subjects performed self-paced hand movements, with their right and left fingers in succession. EEG signals were obtained from a total of 501 contacts using depth electrodes located in primary and nonprimary cortical regions. In accordance with previous studies, BP was found consistently in the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex, the supplementary motor area (SMA), and in a few recordings also in the cingulate cortex and in the dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortex. ERD and ERS of alpha and beta rhythms were also observed in these cortical regions. The distribution of contacts showing ERD or ERS was larger than the distribution of those showing BP. In contrast to BP, ERD and ERS frequently occurred in the lateral and mesial temporal cortex and the inferior parietal lobule. The number of contacts and cortical regions showing ERD and ERS and not BP suggests that the two electrophysiological phenomena are differently involved in the preparation and execution of simple voluntary movements. Substantial differences between BP and ERD in spatial distribution and the widespread topography of ERD/ERS in temporal and higher-order motor regions suggest that oscillatory cortical changes are coupled with cognitive processes supporting movement tasks, such as memory, time interval estimation, and attention.

Both event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and induced band power (IBP) were investigated. We hypothesized that repeated presentations affect recollection rather than familiarity. For the 300- to 500-ms time window, an 'old/new' ERP effect was found for the first vs. second word presentations. The correct recognition of an 'old' word was associated with a more positive waveform than the correct identification of a new word. The old/new effect was most pronounced at and around the midline parietal electrode position. For the 500- to 800-ms time window, a linear repetition effect was found for multiple word repetitions. Correct recognition after an increasing number of repetitions was associated with increasing positivity. The multiple repetitions effect was most pronounced at the midline central (Cz) and fronto-central (FCz) electrode positions and reflects a graded recollection process: the stronger the memory trace grows, the more positive the ERP in the 500- to 800-ms time window. The ERP results support a dual-processing model, with familiarity being discernable from a more graded recollection state that depends on memory strengths. For IBP, we found 'old/new' effects for the lower-2 alpha, theta, and delta bands, with higher bandpower during 'old' words. The lower-2 alpha 'old/new' effect most probably reflects attentional processes, whereas the theta and delta effects reflect encoding and retrieval processes. Upon repeated word presentations, the magnitude of induced delta power in the 375- to 750-ms time window diminished linearly. Correlation analysis suggests that decreased delta power is moderately associated with faster decision speed and higher accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The frontal (Nogo) N2 component of the ERP was taken as an index of cognitive control, and examined in relation to both age and independent assessments of executive function (EF), including the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Stroop task, a delay discounting task, and backward digit span. Better performance on the IGT and the Stroop task was associated with smaller N2 amplitudes, over and above effects of age. N2 latencies decreased with age but were not predicted by EF Source modeling of the N2 revealed neural generators in areas suggestive of cingulate cortex and orbitoftontal cortex, and the locations of these generators varied systematically with EF (IGT and Stroop task): the cingulate generator was more anterior for good EF participants at all ages; the orbitoftontal generator was relatively left lateralized for younger and for poorer EF participants. Taken together, these findings suggest that age-related decreases in N2 amplitude, but not N2 latency, reflect the development of cognitive control and cannot be attributed solely to incidental changes that may affect assessments of the N2 (e.g., increases in skull thickness). Functionally relevant decreases in N2 amplitude may reflect changes in the regions of cortex giving rise to the N2. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast, fPCA factors conform to the spectral structure of empirical data, and a surface Laplacian (2-dimensional CSD) simplifies topographies by minimizing volume-conducted activity. Conciseness and interpretability of EEG and CSD fPCA solutions were compared for three common scaling methods. Methods: Resting EEG and CSD (30 channels, nose reference, eyes open/closed) from 51 healthy and 93 clinically-depressed adults were simplified as power, log power, and amplitude spectra, and summarized using unrestricted, Varimax-rotated, covariance-based fPCA. Results: Multiple alpha factors were separable from artifact and reproducible across subgroups. Power spectra produced numerous, sharply-defined factors emphasizing low frequencies. Log power spectra produced fewer, broader factors emphasizing high frequencies. Solutions for amplitude spectra showed optimal intermediate tuning, particularly when derived from CSD rather than EEG spectra. These solutions were topographically distinct, detecting multiple posterior alpha generators but excluding the dorsal surface of the frontal lobes. Instead a low alpha/theta factor showed a secondary topography along the frontal midline. Conclusions: CSD amplitude spectrum fPCA solutions provide simpler, reference-independent measures that more directly reflect neuronal activity. Significance: A new quantitative EEG approach affording spectral components is developed that closely parallels the concept of an ERP component in the temporal domain.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the processing of auditory information during sleep in patients with insomnia through the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs). Design: A mixed design was used in which subject group was a between-subject factor and sleep stage and type of tone presented were within-subject factors. Participants: Fifteen patients with primary insomnia and 15 normal sleepers (controls) were studied. Measurements and Results: An odd-ball paradigm was conducted to evoke ERPs throughout the night. Patients with insomnia showed larger N1 and smaller P2 to rare tones, smaller N350 to standard tones, and slower P900 to both tones during the first 5 minutes of continuous stage 2 sleep. No consistent ERP differences were detected between the 2 groups when the waveforms were averaged across the whole night. Conclusions: Patients with insomnia showed an enhancement in attention and a reduction in the inhibitory process that normally facilitates sleep onset in the beginning part of sleep. The results partially support the hyperarousal theory, ie, enhanced information processing during the initiation of sleep is a contributing factor for insomnia.

J	Konareva, IN				Konareva, I. N.			Correlations between the Level of Aggressiveness of Personality and Characteristics of Event-Related EEG Potentials	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related EEG potentials (ERPs); readiness potential; contingent negative variation; potential P300; aggressiveness; hostility; Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI)		In a group of 76 adults of both sexes, we examined interrelations between the level of aggressiveness of the individual (diagnosed using the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory) and parameters of event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) recorded under conditions of two behavioral test acts including a motor component. Within the framework of task A, the subject must push a button with the shortest delay after an executory signal preceded by a warning signal; the time of sensorimotor reaction was measured. Under these conditions, we recorded the contingent negative variayion (CNV) and the P300 potential. In the case of task B, it was necessary to measure a definite time interval limited by two pushings of the button. Under these conditions, the readiness potential (RP) was recorded in addition to the CNV and P300. The C3 and C4 leads were used (according to the 10-20 system); the time constant of an amplification tract was 10 sec. Despite natural broad interindividual variability, high amplitudes of the recorded ERPs (RP, CNV, and P300) in general corresponded to lower indices by scales of the Buss-Durkee inventory and smaller values of the indices of aggressiveness and hostility. These interrelations are, probably, based on the fact that both characteristics of aggressiveness of the personality and EEG amplitude parameters are to a considerable extent determined by hereditary factors. It is believed that the respective peculiarities of the neurodynamic constitution of the individual are to a great extent dependent on the specificities of organization and functioning of a few neurotransmitter (in particular, aminergic) and neurohumoral systems.

The time course of visual word recognition as revealed by linear regression analysis of ERP data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						visual word recognition; lexical decision; word frequency; lexicality; LSA; source estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORTHOGRAPHIC SIMILARITY; NEUROMAGNETIC EVIDENCE; LEXICAL ACTIVATION; SEMANTIC MEMORY; HIGH-FREQUENCY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; FORM AREA; BRAIN; LENGTH	EEG correlates of a range of psycholinguistic word properties were used to investigate the time course of access to psycholinguistic information during visual word recognition. Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word-pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ins after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ins. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages (> 200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.

J	Nieuwand, MS; Van Berkum, JJA				Nieuwand, MS; Van Berkum, JJA			Testing the limits of the semantic illusion phenomenon: ERPs reveal temporary semantic change deafness in discourse comprehension	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						semantic illusion; change deaffiess; discourse comprehension; EEG; N400; animacy	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENTENCE; CONTEXT; INTEGRATION; MEMORY; CONSTRAINTS; EXPECTANCY; DOMAIN	In general, language comprehension is surprisingly reliable. Listeners very rapidly extract meaning from the unfolding speech signal, on a word-by-word basis, and usually successfully. Research on 'semantic illusions' however suggests that under certain conditions, people fail to notice that the linguistic input simply doesn't make sense. In the current event-related brain potentials (ERP) study, we examined whether listeners would, under such conditions, spontaneously detect an anomaly in which a human character central to the story at hand (e.g., "a tourist") was suddenly replaced by an inanimate object (e.g., "a suitcase"). Because this replacement introduced a very powerful coherence break, we expected listeners to immediately notice the anomaly and generate the standard ERP effect associated with incoherent language, the N400 effect. However, instead of the standard N400 effect, anomalous words elicited a positive ERP effect from about 500-600 ms onwards. The absence of an N400 effect suggests that subjects did not immediately notice the anomaly, and that for a few hundred milliseconds the comprehension system has converged on an apparently coherent but factually incorrect interpretation. The presence of the later ERP effect indicates that subjects were processing for comprehension and did ultimately detect the anomaly. Therefore, we take the absence of a regular N400 effect as the online manifestation of a temporary semantic illusion. Our results also show that even attentive listeners sometimes fail to notice a radical change in the nature of a story character, and therefore suggest a case of short-lived 'semantic change deafness' in language comprehension.

Subjects performed a visual attention task for 3 h without rest. Subjective levels of fatigue, performance measures and EEG were recorded. Subjective fatigue ratings, as well as theta and lower-alpha EEG band power increased, suggesting that the 3 h of task performance resulted in an increase in fatigue. Reaction times, misses and false alarms increased with time on task, indicating decreased performance efficiency in fatigued subjects. Subjects were unable to inhibit automatic shifting of attention to irrelevant stimuli, reflected by a larger negativity in the N1 latency range for irrelevant, compared to relevant stimuli. This difference in negativity was unaffected by time on task. However, N1 and N2b amplitude did change with time on task: NI amplitude decreased, and the difference in N2b amplitude between relevant and irrelevant stimuli (larger N2b amplitude evoked by relevant stimuli) decreased with time on task. The results indicate a dissociation in the effects of mental fatigue on goal-directed (top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) attention: mental fatigue results in a reduction in goal-directed attention, leaving subjects performing in a more stimulus-driven fashion.

For this purpose, 36 psychiatric out-patients with personality disorders-24 of whom showed ADHD-related psychopathology during childhood assessed by the German short form of the Wender Utah Rating Scale-and 24 healthy controls were investigated electrophysiologically by means of a cued Go-NoGo task (Continuous Performance Test). Topographical analyses were conducted to individually quantify the NoGo anteriorisation (NGA), a neurophysiological correlate of prefrontal response control that has been suggested to reflect activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. ADHD patients exhibited a significantly reduced mean NGA and diminished amplitudes of the Global Field Power, as well as a reduced increase of fronto-central P300 amplitudes, in NoGo-trials compared with the healthy controls, whereas patients with personality disorders alone did not differ from the control group in any of the electrophysiological parameters. The results indicate that ADHD-related psychopathology is associated with prefrontal brain dysfunction, probably related to processes of response inhibition and/or cognitive response control.

However, examinations of the effect of attention on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) have proven equivocal. The current experiment therefore utilized EEG to examine the effect of attention on the ASSR in healthy humans (n = 15). Auditory click trains in the beta (20Hz) and gamma (40 Hz) ranges were randomly presented binaurally in an oddball discrimination paradigm (each frequency served as the oddball (target) in each of two blocks). A Fast Fourier Transform was used to assess the effect of attention on the ASSR (signal power), and phase consistency across trials was assessed using the phase-locking factor (PLF). As expected, both 20 and 40Hz targets elicited a robust P300 response, with maximal amplitudes over parietal regions. For the ASSR, it was found that EEG signal power was larger to 40Hz targets compared to 40Hz frequent stimuli across all frontocentral electrodes. No differences in signal power were observed during 20 Hz stimulation. Finally, increased PLF values were observed for 40 Hz targets compared to frequent trials. These results provide evidence that selective attention can enhance signal power and phase-locking of the ASSR. particularly to auditory stimulation in the gamma range. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The estimation scheme is based on classical covariance component estimation using restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). We have focused previously on the estimation of spatial covariance components under simple assumptions about the temporal correlations. Here we extend the scheme using temporal basis functions to place constraints on the temporal form of the responses. We show how the same scheme can estimate evoked responses that are phase-locked to the stimulus and induced responses that are not. For a single trial the model is exactly the same, In the context of multiple trials, however, the inherent distinction between evoked and induced responses calls for different treatments of the underlying hierarchical multitrial model. We derive the respective models and show how they can be estimated efficiently using ReML. This enables the Bayesian estimation of evoked and induced changes in power or, more generally, the energy of wavelet coefficients.

J	Naruse, Y; Matani, A; Hayakawa, T; Fujimaki, N				Naruse, Yasushi; Matani, Ayumu; Hayakawa, Tomoe; Fujimaki, Norio			Influence of seamlessness between pre- and poststimulus alpha rhythms on visual evoked potential	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						electroencephalography; alpha rhythm; alpha ringing; phase angle; visual evoked potential; phase resetting; phase synchronization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL; STIMULUS ONSET; PHASE; MEMORY; ERP; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE	The influence of seamlessness between the prestimulus alpha rhythm and poststimulus alpha ringing on the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) was investigated. Subjects passively viewed a series of 1000 flash stimuli with their eyelids closed, and their VEPs were recorded. The instantaneous phase angle of the alpha rhythm in each subject was calculated by using a two-cycle complex exponential sequence. VEPs were classified into four subsets according to seamlessness: how well the phase angle of the prestimulus alpha rhythm and the backward-extrapolated phase angle from poststimulus alpha ringing were synchronized. VEPs of each subset were averaged. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that seamlessness significantly affected the amplitude of P100. Moreover, the level of seamlessness significantly affected the phase locking index. Two models for the generating evoked potentials have been proposed; one is the phase resetting model (Makeig, S., Westerfield, M., Jung, T.P., Enghoff, S., Townsend, J., Courchesne, E., Sejnowski, T.J., 2002. Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses. Science 295, 690-694) and the other is the evoked model (Makinen, V., Tiitinen, H., May, P., 2005. Auditory event-related responses are generated independently of ongoing brain activity. Neuroimage 24, 961-968). These results suggest that alpha ringing is possibly generated by the phase-resetting alpha rhythm and support the phase resetting model. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Results for target letters showed a decrease in the amplitude of alpha-band (10-11 Hz) activity and an increase in theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (40-44 Hz) activities around 350 ms after stimulation. P2 and late positive component presented a higher amplitude to target than to repeated nontarget letters. Alpha reduction was inversely related to theta and late positive component increase. Moreover, gamma oscillation amplitude was directly related to theta amplitude. The findings suggest the importance of occipitoparietal alpha reduction for the development of task-related neuronal activity.

These features are sub-served by neural pathways that might give flexibility and selectivity to the cerebral anticipatory processes. In this line, the present high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) study tested the hypothesis that the anticipatory cortical processes are stronger for painful thermal (biologically relevant) than electrical ("artificial") stimuli with similar intensity. EEG data ( 128 electrodes) were recorded in normal subjects during the expectancy of painful electrical or laser stimuli (visual omitted stimulus paradigm; interval between two painful stimuli: 16s), delivered over the median nerve region of the right arm (nonpainful stimuli as controls). After each stimulus, the subject reported the perceived stimulus intensity. Surface Laplacian estimation of the EEG data spatially enhanced the anticipatory stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), which reflects motivational relevance of the stimulus. Subjects perceived no difference in the intensity of the electrical versus laser stimuli in both painful and nonpainful conditions. However, the anticipatory SPN appeared over large scalp regions before painful laser but not electrical stimulation. The same was true for the nonpainful stimulations. The present results suggest that the motivational anticipatory cortical processes are induced by nonpainful and painful biologically/ecologically relevant laser stimuli rather than by "artificial" electrical stimuli with similar intensity.

We performed a magnetoencephalography study measuring brain activity in response to visual stimuli. Using a measure termed the phase-preservation index we investigated the phase of oscillatory alpha activity (8-13 Hz) before and after the stimulus. We found that in single trials the alpha oscillations after visual stimuli preserve their phase relationship with respect to the phase before the stimuli. This finding argues against phase-resetting of ongoing oscillations as being responsible for visually evoked responses. The event-related field can be explained primarily by stimulus-locked activity in the theta band that is absent before the stimulus. These findings suggest that different neuronal events are responsible for generating the ongoing oscillations and the visually evoked responses.

J	Wascher, E				Wascher, E			The timing of stimulus localisation and the Simon effect: an ERP study	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Simon effect; perceptual grouping; ERP; ERL; LRP; PCN; N2pc	S-R COMPATIBILITY; EVENT-RELATED LATERALIZATIONS; VISUAL-SEARCH; RESPONSE SELECTION; TASK; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; MODEL; POTENTIALS; OVERLAP	The Simon effect, an acceleration of responses at the same side that a stimulus is presented, is assumed to be the consequence of an automatic response activation evoked by the processing of the irrelevant stimulus location. This activation has been reported to decline as responses become slower. Consequently, the Simon effect decays over time. However, it remains unclear when this activation starts and what process initiates it. Up to now, the decaying hypothesis and its temporal properties have been based on indirect evidence. In the present study we tested the timing of the decay of the Simon effect more directly by combining a localisation task and a Simon task in an EEG study. It can be shown that the response activation is evoked by visual spatial processing, and that the size of the Simon effect steadily decreases as a function of the time between this localisation process and the manual response. However, this finding only holds if the encoding of relevant stimulus features follows the localisation process unequivocally.

Twenty participants (18-30 years) performed an easy and a difficult visual Go/Nogo task with simultaneous EEG recording after a quiet night and then during three nights when aircraft noise was presented with equivalent noise levels of 39, 44, and 50 dBA, respectively, between 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Based on subjective sleep quality rating, participants were separated into "good" versus "bad" sleepers. The performance and inhibition-related components (N2, P3) of event-related potentials were analysed. The N2 and P3 amplitudes were smaller and latencies were prolonged in the difficult than in the easy task. This effect was more pronounced for Nogo than for Go trials. The Nogo-P3 amplitude was smaller in Noise than in "Quiet" conditions in the difficult task only. In the difficult task, the Nogo-P3 latency was prolonged in bad sleepers than in good sleepers. The Nogo-P3 amplitude was reduced in Noise as compared to "Quiet" conditions in bad sleepers only. Sleep quality in bad sleepers worsened steadily with increasing noise levels. No effects of noise or subjective sleep quality on performance were found. Inhibitory processes appear to be selectively impaired after nocturnal noise exposure. The task difficulty and perceived sleep quality are important factors modulating noise effects. The results suggest that nocturnal traffic noise increase physiological costs for inhibitory functioning on the day even if no overt performance decrement is observed.

Individuals with high and low alexithymia scores were selected according to the scores on the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. EEG was recorded from alexithymic and nonalexithymic persons viewing emotionally negative or neutral stimuli. Nonalexithymic persons exhibited increased gamma band power and phase synchronization at the 400-450-ms time window when processing emotionally negative stimuli. Neither enhanced gamma band power nor phase synchronization was observed in alexithymic persons in the negative emotion condition. These results suggest that gamma band activity reflects emotional processing, and alexithymic persons may have a deficit in communication between brain regions or in the utilization of memory or emotional information during the processing of emotional stimuli.

This raises the question which signatures of neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range.

These reversals prefer certain positions of the Necker cube and can be studied without external reference of the perception. Functional MRI revealed six bilaterally active regions in the visual, parietal, and premotor cortex. A new method determined phase-locked electroencephalography-activations in the regions of interest and showed a significant stimulus-locked activity that started in the left Brodmann area 18. This activity started 38 ms after passing the symmetric position of the Necker cube and spread along the dorsal stream. We suggest that a further portion of the event-related potential signal reflects additional top-down processing, dependent on the position of the Necker cube.

To investigate the separate, and possibly interacting, effects of these diagnoses, an event-related brain potential (ERP) measure of auditory information processing (P50 sensory gating paradigm) and neuropsychological measures were administered to healthy control participants with either (1a) no history of alcohol abuse/dependence, or (1b) a remote history of alcohol abuse/dependence, and patients with schizophrenia with either (2a) no history of alcohol abuse/dependence, or (2b) a remote history of alcohol abuse/dependence. Schizophrenia was associated with impaired P50 sensory gating and poorer performance across neuropsychological scores compared to measurements in healthy control participants. Those with a positive alcohol history had impaired gating ratios in contrast to those with a negative alcohol history. There were additive effects of schizophrenia diagnosis and alcohol history for P50 sensory gating and for neuropsychological scores: attention, working memory, and behavioral inhibition. For executive attention and general memory there was an interaction, suggesting that the combination of schizophrenia and history of alcohol abuse results in greater impairment than that predicted by the presence of either diagnosis alone.

It has been explained both as an oculomotor reflex and as a manifestation of the orienting response. To clarify which explanation is more appropriate, we investigated a possible habituation of this effect. Visual and auditory distractors were presented at gaze-contingent intervals during the perception of meaningful pictures. Both reflexlike and modifiable components were present in the visual distractor effect, with latencies of about 110 and 180 ms, respectively. The influence of visual and auditory distractors on saccades preceded the earliest changes in cortical ERPs. Only for long-term habituation in the visual modality was a correlation with ERPs (N1) found.

Overall, response times were faster and midline P3 amplitudes were larger for the active than for the sedentary participants. P3 latencies discriminated between active and sedentary individuals on trials in which multiple task sets were maintained in memory and task switches occurred unpredictably but not in blocks of trials in which a single task was repeatedly performed.

J	Bagshaw, AP; Warbrick, T				Bagshaw, Andrew P.; Warbrick, Tracy			Single trial variability of EEG and fMRI responses to visual stimuli	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BOLD-FMRI; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; ACTIVATION; AMPLITUDE; MRI; RECORDINGS	Recent EEG-fMRI studies have suggested a novel method of data fusion which uses single trial (ST) estimates of event-related potentials in the fMRI analysis. This is potentially very powerful, but rests on the assumption that the ST variability observed in EEG is reflected in the fMRI signal. The current study investigated this assumption and compared two different data processing strategies for each modality. Five subjects underwent separate EEG and fMRI sessions with checkerboard stimuli at two contrasts. EEG data were preprocessed using wavelet denoising and independent component analysis (ICA), whilst the general linear model and ICA were used for fMRI. Amplitudes and latencies of the P1 and N2 components of the visual evoked potential (VEP) were calculated for each trial. For fMRI, the amplitudes and latencies of the ST haemodynamic responses (HR) were calculated. Within modality, the results for the two processing methods were significantly correlated in the majority of data sets. Across modality, the average amplitudes of the VEPs and HRs were also significantly correlated. Examination of ST variability demon strated that the amplitudes of the mean VEPs and HRs are both influenced by the latency variability of the ST responses to a greater extent than the amplitude variability. For high contrast stimuli the latency variability in EEG and fMRI was significantly correlated, with a similar trend seen for the low contrast stimuli. The results confirm the validity of examining both the EEG and fMRI signals on an ST basis and suggest an underlying neuronal origin in both modalities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Changes in cortical electrical potentials and magnetic fields in the very low frequency range are relevant parameters to characterize these events, which up to now have only been recorded invasively. In this study, we proved whether a non-invasive combined MEG/EEG recording technique is able to quantitatively monitor cortical infraslow activity in humans. Methods: We used repetitive very slow and slow right finger movements as a physiological motor activation paradigm to induce cortical infraslow activity. Infraslow fields were recorded over the left hemisphere using a modulation-based MEG technique. EEG was performed using 16 standard Ag-Cl electrodes that covered the left motor cortex. Results: We recorded stable focal motor-related infraslow magnetic field changes in seven out of seven subjects. We also found correlating infraslow electrical. potential changes in three out of seven subjects. Slow finger movements generated significantly stronger field and potential changes than very slow movements. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of combined non-invasive electrical potential and magnetic field measurements to localize and quantitatively monitor physiological, low amplitude, infraslow cortical activity in humans. This specific combination of simultaneous recording techniques allows to benefit from the specific physical advantages of each method. Significance: This combined non-invasive MEG-EEG methodology is able to provide important information on infraslow neuronal activity originating from tangentially and radially oriented sources. Moreover, this dual approach has the potential to separate neuronal from non-neuronal DC-sources, e.g., radially to the head orientated DC-currents across the skin/scalp/skull/dura occurring during cerebral hypercapnia or hypoxia.

A left/right self-paced typing,exercise is analyzed by extending the usual autoregressive (AR) model for EEG feature extraction with an AR with exogenous input (ARX) model for combined filtering and feature extraction. The ensemble averaged Bereitschaftspotential (an event related potential preceding the onset of movement) forms the exogenous signal input to the ARX model. Based on trials with six subjects, the ARX case of modeling both the signal and noise was found to be considerably more effective than modeling the noise alone (common in BCI systems) with the AR method yielding a classification accuracy of 52.8 +/- 4.8% and the ARX method an accuracy of 79.1 +/- 3.9% across subjects. The results suggest a role for ARX-based feature extraction in BCIs based on evoked and event-related potentials.

Method: 16 undergraduate students were taken part in the research. Three tasks including number recognizing, simple subtracting and complex arithmetic calculating were designed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during each task. ERPs were extracted from EEG data, and then the features of ERPs were analyzed. Brain electrical activity mappings (BEAM) was used to find out active area related with each task. Result: ERPs evoked by number recognizing and calculating have positive and negative components. Both of them have similar wave form. BEAM shows that three tasks all activate the areas in parietal lobe. As the difficulty of the calculation increasing, more areas in brain cortex are activated. The amplitude of P300 in the frontal region increase with the task difficulties. Conclusion: The early ERPs components reflect mental processes for identification of physical attributes of digits. Parietal lobe is the function domain of event related with number. In calculating course, left parietal area is more active than right.

As a result electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often significantly distorted, causing problems for analysis and interpretation by clinicians, and also the contamination of the EEG with potentials that originate from movements of the eyelid or eyeball are a nuisance for researchers who investigate the electrophysiology of the brain. Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially those arising from eye movements and blinks. The purpose of this article is to present a survey of the published literature in dealing with ocular artifacts in the EEG, focusing on the relative merits and demerits of a variety of EOG correction procedures.

The aim of the present intracerebral ERP study was to contribute knowledge of the sources of the Ne/ERN, with a particular focus on the involvement of a frontomedian wall (FMW) in the genesis of this negativity. Seven patients with intractable epilepsy participated in the study. Depth electrodes were implanted to localize the seizure origin prior to surgical treatment. A total of 574 sites in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes were investigated. A simple Go/NoGo task was performed and EEG epochs with correct and erroneous motor responses were averaged independently using the response as the trigger. Ne/ERN was generated in multiple cortical structures, with the most consistent involvement being that of the FMW structures. Ne/ERN generators were revealed there in both the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but also in the pre-SMA and in the parts of the medial frontal gyrus adjacent to the ACC. Different timing of activations between the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate Ne/ERN sources was observed in this study. Other neural sources of the Ne/ERN were found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in the orbitofrontal cortex, in the lateral temporal neocortex, and in one isolated case in the supramarginal gyrus. Our findings support the key role of the FMW in the genesis of Ne/ERN. At the same time, our findings suggest a different functional significance for the rostral and caudal ACC involvement in error processing. In addition to the FMW, the other prefrontal cortical sites, the lateral temporal neocortex, and the supramarginal gyrus seem to represent integral components of the brain's error monitoring system.

The aim of the present EEG study was to probe the cerebellar role in the control of such SSAER. For this purpose, we investigated changes in SSAERs due to transient disruption of the cerebellar hemisphere by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). SSAERs to click-trains of three different frequencies in the gamma-band (32, 40 and 47 Hz) were recorded from 45 scalp electrodes in six healthy volunteers immediately after 1-Hz rTMS and compared to baseline SSAERs assessed prior to magnetic stimulation. Cerebellar rTMS contralateral to the stimulated ear significantly reduced the amplitude of steady-state responses to 40-Hz click-trains and showed a tendency to reduce the amplitude to 32-Hz click-trains. No effects were observed for 47-Hz click-trains, nor for magnetic stimulation of the cerebellum ipsilateral to auditory stimulation or after sham stimulation. Our results suggest that interference with cerebellar output by rTMS modifies functional activity associated with cortical auditory processing. The finding of maximum effects on 40-Hz SSAERs provides support to the notion that the cerebellum is part of a distributed network involved in the regulation of cortical oscillatory activity and points at some frequency-specificity for the control of auditory-driven neuronal oscillations.

Rapid targeting followed by sustained deployment of visual spatial attention	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						attentional deployment; cued attention; event-related potential; visual spatial attention	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SHIFTS; BRAIN	We investigated preparatory attention processes when a spatial discrimination was required at a cued location, by measuring electroencephalography following a central symbolic cue to deploy spatial attention. Electroencephalography activity in response to the cue revealed three cue-related activations: an early-onset positivity following the PI at posterior scalp sites contralateral to the cued location, followed by cue-related frontal scalp activity and later-onset sustained activity at posterior scalp sites contralateral to the cued location. The early contralateral positivity may reflect rapid targeting of the cued location. Our results also extend the findings of cue-related frontal activity followed by posterior activity contralateral to the cued location, found with nonspatial feature discriminations, to a task requiring a spatial discrimination.

The role of cingulate cortex in the detection of errors with and without awareness: a high-density electrical mapping study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical arousal; ERP; error positivity; error processing; error-related negativity	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL SYSTEM; POTENTIALS; NEGATIVITY; COMPONENTS; MECHANISMS	Error-processing research has demonstrated that the brain uses a specialized neural network to detect errors during task performance but the brain regions necessary for conscious awareness of an error are poorly understood. In the present study we show that two well-known error-related event-related potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) have a differential relationship with awareness during performance of a manual response inhibition task optimized to examine error awareness. While the ERN was unaffected by the participants' conscious experience of errors, the Pe was only seen when participants were aware of committing an error. Source localization of these components indicated that the ERN was generated by a caudal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while the Pe was associated with contributions from a more anterior ACC region and the posterior cingulate-precuneus. Tonic EEG measures of cortical arousal were correlated with individual rates of error awareness and showed a specific relationship with the amplitude of the Pe. The latter finding is consistent with evidence that the Pe represents a P3-like facilitation of information processing modulated by subcortical arousal systems. Our data suggest that the ACC might participate in both preconscious and conscious error detection and that cortical arousal provides a necessary setting condition for error awareness. These findings may be particularly important in the context of clinical studies in which a proper understanding of self-monitoring deficits requires an explicit measurement of error awareness.

Within the 2-stimulus paradigm, a central fixation point (S1) was followed 2.5 s later by a peripheral cue (S2) presented at 4 degrees to the left or right of S1 in random order. The EEG was recorded from 40 electrodes applied over both hemispheres using a DC amplifier. With increasing age, pro- and anti-saccadic reaction times became faster, this effect being slightly more pronounced during childhood for the anti-saccade task. ICA revealed a lateral-posterior sCNV in younger children, and the known anterior-central sCNV in late adolescents. By contrast, the gaze maintenance negativity (GMNb), an anterior-central negativity accompanying the excursion of the eye, was present in all age groups. Our results underline the importance of topographical approaches in developmental ERP research and the usefulness of ICA. They suggest major task-dependent developmental differences in the spatial modulation of frontal-lobe sensitive ERP components. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The search to identify the dynamic connectivity of brain signals within different frequency bands, in order to uncover the transient cooperation between different brain sites, converges at the potential of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models and their derived parameters. In fact, MVAR parameters provide a whole battery of so-called coupling measures including classic coherence (COH), partial coherence (pCOH), imaginary part of coherence (iCOH), partial-directed coherence (PDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and full frequency directed transfer function (ffDTF). All of these approaches have been developed to quantify the degree of coupling between different EEG recording positions, with the specific aim to characterize the functional interaction between neural populations within the cortex. This work addresses the application of MVAR models to event-related brain processes, including different statistical approaches, and reviews most relevant findings in the expanding field of coupling analysis. Finally, we present several examples of coupling patterns associated with certain types of movement imagery.

If placebo analgesia is due in part to an attenuation of early nociceptive processing, then pain-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs) should be reduced with placebo. In this study, we tested for placebo effects in P2 laser-evoked potentials at midline scalp electrodes. We found that placebo treatment produced significant decreases in P2 amplitude, and that P2 placebo responses were large enough to reflect a meaningful difference in nociceptive processing. However, we also found evidence that the very robust placebo-induced decreases in reported pain are not solely explained by early reductions in P2. N2 amplitude was affected by neither placebo nor reduction of laser intensity. These results suggest that placebo treatment affects early nociceptive processing, but that another component of placebo effects in reported pain occurs later, either in evaluation of pain or cognitive judgments about pain reports.

Detection of novelty involves the frontal lobes. The presentation of rare, novel stimuli elicits an event-related potential (novel P3), which maximizes over anterior regions of the scalp. We hypothesized that TSD would impair novelty detection, resulting in a smaller novel P3 over the frontal region, with a topographic shift toward posterior areas. Methods: An auditory novelty oddball task was administered to a TSD group after 36 h of waking and again following recovery sleep, and to a control group after 12 h of waking. EEG was recorded from Fz, Cz and Pz. Results: A large anterior P3 was elicited in the control group. In the TSD group, this novel P3 was smaller at Fz. A later novel positivity appeared in parietal areas. The novel P3 returned to baseline levels and the late novel P3 was difficult to observe following recovery sleep. Conclusions: TSD appears to compromise the usual automatic detection of novelty probably due to frontal deactivation. Participants may compensate by relying on posterior brain mechanisms involving active memory comparison. The late novel P3 component may also reflect a secondary effortful attempt to encode and to categorize novel stimuli. Significance: This study suggests that TSD may compromise cognitive functioning in different regions of the brain. The detection of novelty, probably mediated by the frontal lobes, is particularly at risk. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The sample consisted of 42 volunteer participants (between 19 and 37 years of age with at least 9 years of education). There were 22 females and 20 males. Data were collected under the oddball paradigm. Auditory stimulation (10 ms r/f time, 50 ms duration, 65 dB SPL) consisted of target (2000 Hz; p=.20) stimuli that occurred randomly within a series of standard stimuli (1000 Hz; p=.80). Gamma responses were studied in the amplitude frequency characteristics, in the digitally filtered event-related potentials (f-ERPs) and in the distributions which were obtained using the recently developed time-frequency component analysis JFCA) technique. Participants were classified into G+ and G- groups with a criterion of full agreement between the results of an automated gamma detection technique and expert opinion. The 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA on f-ERPs and 2 x 2 x 2 multivariate ANOVA on TFCA distributions showed the main effect of gamma status and gender as significant, and the interaction between gamma status and gender as nonsignificant. Accordingly, individual difference in gamma status is a reliable phenomenon, but this does not depend on gender. There are conflicting findings in the literature concerning the effect of gender on ERP components (N100, P300). The present study showed that if the gamma status is not included in research designs, it may produce a confounding effect on ER-P parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Independent component analysis and clustering improve signal-to-noise ratio for statistical analysis of event-related potentials	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ICA; signal-to-noise ratio; effect size; channel pooling; N170	MISALLOCATION; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; VARIANCE; ACCOUNT	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new method of using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of Event-Related Potential (ERP) measurements while permitting standard statistical comparisons to be made despite the inter-subject variations characteristic of ICA. Methods: Per-subject ICA results were used to create a channel pool, with unequal weights, that could be applied consistently across subjects. Signals derived from this and other pooling schemes, and from unpooled electrodes, were subjected to identical statistical analysis of the N170 own-face effect in a Joe/No Joe face recognition paradigm wherein participants monitored for a target face (Joe) presented amongst other unfamiliar faces and their own face. Results between the Joe, unfamiliar face and own face conditions were compared using Cohen's d statistic (square root of signal-to-noise ratio) to measure effect size. Results: When the own-face condition was compared to the Joe and unfamiliar-face conditions, the channel map method increased effect size by a factor ranging from 1.2 to 2.2. These results stand in contrast to previous findings, where conventional pooling schemes failed to reveal an N170 effect to the own-face stimulus (Tanaka JW, Curran T, Porterfield A, Collins D. The activation of pre-existing and acquired face representations: the N250 ERP as an index of face familiarity. J Cogn Neurosci 2006;18:1488-97). Consistent with conventional pooling schemes, the channel map approach showed no reliable differences between the Joe and Unfamiliar face conditions, yielding a decrease in effect size ranging from 0.13 to 0.75. Conclusions: By increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the measured waveforms, the channel pool method demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to the neurophysiological response to own-face relative to other faces. Significance: By overcoming the characteristic inter-subject variations of ICA, this work allows classic ERP analysis methods to exploit the improved signal-to-noise ratio obtainable with ICA.

J	Rodin, E; Funke, M				Rodin, Ernst; Funke, Michael			Cerebral electromagnetic activity in the subdelta range	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetoelectroencephalography-EEG; subdelta frequencies; glia; respiration	MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	The frequency range between 0.1 and 0.9 Hz was investigated with magnetoelectroencephalography-EEG coregistration in 10 adult patients with epilepsy and five children with other neurologic conditions. In all instances, a dominant rhythm between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz could be observed in the waking and sleeping states. It showed a waxing and waning quality and was unrelated to eye opening or closing but increased in amplitude during sleep. The maximum was usually in the occipital areas but occasionally in the frontal regions. The rhythm was more persistent and better seen in the magnetoelectroencephalogram, but subdelta activity was also discernible in the EEG. The magnetoelectroencephalographic rhythmicity and frequency suggested possible respiration artifact. Two normal control subjects were therefore investigated by electroencephalography while respirations were monitored. A clear relation to respiration was established. It persisted during breath-holding, albeit at lower amplitude. Larger amplitude transients occurred before and at the cessation of breath-holding as well as hyperventilation. An observed frequency increase before voluntary hyperventilation suggests a relation to the readiness potential and event-related desynchronization as well as synchronization. Subdelta frequencies, which can be readily recorded without special DC amplifiers, provide additional information for clinical as well as research data. They may also be an interface between autonomic and voluntary functions, especially in regard to respiration.

N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate dysfunction is suggested to underlie these deficits. However, the role of NMDA receptors in involuntary attention is poorly understood. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate whether a single dose of memantine would affect MMN/MMNm in healthy subjects studied with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Monaural left-ear auditory stimuli were presented in a passive oddball paradigm with infrequent deviant tones differing in frequency and duration. Neuronal activity was recorded in 13 healthy subjects after oral administration of 30 mg of memantine or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. MMNm was analyzed using equivalent current dipoles. MMN was evaluated from frontocentral electrodes. Memantine lowered subjects' arousal level as measured by visual analog scales, and enhanced the amplitude of MMN in EEG. No differences in MMN latency were observed in MEG or EEG. Memantine did not affect the location, strength, amplitude or latency of MMNm, P1m, and N1m components. No changes in amplitude or latency were observed for PI and N1 peaks. These results indicate that memantine affects involuntary attention without otherwise changing auditory processing of the stimuli. As memantine-induced changes in MMN were detected only in EEG, we suggest that the effect is mostly related to the frontal cortex. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the test-retest reliabilities and heritabilities of three ERP components in healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. Methods ERP components (P300, P50 and MMN) were recorded using a 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 40 healthy monozygotic twin pairs, 19 of them on two separate occasions, and 30 dizygotic twin pairs. Zygosity was determined using DNA genotyping. Results High reliabilities were found for the P300 amplitude and its latency, MMN amplitude, and P50 suppression ratio components. ICC = 0.86 and 0.88 for the P300 amplitude and P300 latency respectively. Reliability of MMN peak amplitude and mean amplitude were 0.67 and 0.66 respectively. P50 T/C ratio reliability was 0.66. Model fitting analyses indicated a substantial heritability or familial component of variance for these ERP measures. Heritability estimates were 63 and 68% for MMN peak amplitude and mean amplitude respectively. For P50 T/C ratio, 68% heritability was estimated. P300 amplitude heritability was estimated at 69%, and while a significant familiality effect was found for P300 latency there was insufficient power to distinguish between shared environment and genetic factors. Conclusions The high reliability and heritability of the P300 amplitude, MMN amplitude, and P50 suppression ratio components supports their use as candidate endophenotypes for psychiatric research.

J	Fuentemilla, LI; Marco-Pallares, J; Grau, C				Fuentemilla, LI; Marco-Pallares, J; Grau, C			Modulation of spectral power and of phase resetting of EEG contributes differentially to the generation of auditory event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							N1 WAVE; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ALPHA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INHIBITION; COMPONENTS	Nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the genesis of event-related potentials (ERPs) are a matter of debate among neuroscientists. Specifically, the debate lies in whether ERPs arise due to the contribution of a fixed-polarity and fixed-latency superimposed neuronal activity to background electroencephalographic oscillations (evoked model) and/or due to a partial phase synchronization of the ongoing EEG (oscillatory model). The participation of the two mechanisms can be explored by the spectral power modulation and phase coherence of scalp EEG rhythms, respectively. However, an important limitation underlies their measurement: the fact that ail added neural activity will be relatively phase-locked to stimulus, thus enhancing both spectral power and phase synchrony measures and making the contribution of each mechanism less clear-cut. This would not be relevant in the case that an increase in phase concentration was not accompanied by any concurrent spectral power modulation, thus opening the way to an oscillatory-based explanation. We computed event-related spectral power modulations and phase coherence to an auditory repeated-stimulus presentation paradigm with tone intensity far from threshold (90 dB SPL), in which N1 decreases its amplitude (N1 gating) as an attenuation brain process. Our data indicate that evoked and oscillatory activity could contribute together to the non-attenuated NI, while NI to repeated stimuli could be explained by partial phase concentration of scalp EEG activity without concurrent power increase. Therefore, our results show that both increased spectral power and partial phase resetting contribute differentially to different ERPs. Moreover, they show that certain ERPs could arise through reorganization of the phase of ongoing scalp EEG activity only. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Response inhibition in psychopathy: The frontal N2 and P3	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						inhibitory control; violent offenders; antisocial behavior; impulsivity; EEG; ERPs	ANTERIOR CINGULATE FUNCTION; GO/NOGO TASK; CRIMINAL PSYCHOPATHS; ERROR-DETECTION; ERP COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; CORTEX; SOCIALIZATION; ABNORMALITIES	Psychopathy has been associated with atypical function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and adjacent brain regions and with abnormalities in performance monitoring, which is thought to rely on these structures. The ACC and adjacent regions are also involved in the generation of two characteristic components of the event-related potential: the frontal N2 and P3. Both components are enhanced when a response is withheld (NoGo trial) within a series of positive-responses (Go trials) and are considered an index of response inhibition. We recorded event-related potentials while violent offenders who varied on the dimension of psychopathy and non-offender controls performed a Go/NoGo task. The offenders made more errors of commission on NoGo trials but this effect was unrelated to level of psychopathy within the group and, inconsistent with a previous report, they produced the enhanced frontal N2 and P3 effect in response to NoGo relative to Go conditions. We conclude that the neural processes involved in response inhibition are not abnormal in psychopaths when both stimuli and context are affectively neutral and suggest that a more nuanced perspective regarding impulsivity in this population be considered.

To induce helplessness, an insolvable social discrimination test in combination with false feedback was used. The EEG was recorded from 60 scalp locations, while two standard odors were presented via a constant-flow olfactometer. Helplessness attenuated olfactory stimulus processing at an early perceptual stage: the P2 and P3-1 amplitudes were reduced in response to both odors. Furthermore, the early potentials (N1, P2 and P3-1) of the chemosensory event-related potential (CSERP) appeared with longer latencies when subjects received negative feedback. The state effects of helplessness resemble the deviations in the CSERP found in depressed patients, suggesting a general mood effect. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Along with studies using alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine test (AMPT) and phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion test (APTD), the tryptophan depletion test (ATDT) represents the currently most established human challenge tool for the assessment of brain serotonin functioning. Neurophysiological studies in healthy and clinical samples may contribute to the search for a non-invasive and reliable biological marker of monoaminergic vulnerability or dysfunction. In the design of these studies, various biochemical and methodological aspects have to be taken into account. This article focuses on electrophysiological methodology and results of monoamine depletion studies (i.e., electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, polysomnography, auditory evoked potentials and startle response).

This subjective impression has been measured objectively using Libet's clock and is on average about 300 ms prior to EMG onset. The EEG shows activity prior to movement, and by the voltage measurement, there is a rising negativity called the Bereitschaftspotential beginning about 1.5 s prior to EMG onset. This indicates that the brain mechanisms for generating a voluntary movement begin prior to the subjective intention, that is, unconsciously. If it were possible to detect relevant EEG signals with single events in real time, then it would be possible to identify that movement is being prepared prior to the subjective experience. Work in our laboratory has been making progress in accomplishing this aim. Such a signal could also be used to drive a brain-computer interface.

Recent studies of medications are characterized by large, rigorously diagnosed samples of children, adolescents and adults with ADHD, use of standardized rating scales and extensive safety data. These studies confirm a robust treatment effect for the Food and Drug Administration approved agents ranging from 0.7 to 1.5. The most common short term side effects to the most commonly used agents include insomnia, loss of appetite, and headaches. Despite public controversy and labeling changes to warn of extremely rare cardiovascular and psychiatric side effects, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that medication for ADHD increases risk for sudden death, mania or psychosis. A wide variety of neuroimaging techniques including electrocephalogram (EEG) power, event related potentials (ERP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) are beginning to examine the mechanisms of action of medications for ADHD, and implicating the catecholamines and prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices as prime sites of actions for these agents.

J	Slawecki, CJ; Purdy, RH; Ehlers, CL				Slawecki, CJ; Purdy, RH; Ehlers, CL			Electrophysiological effects of allopregnanolone in rats with a history of ethanol exposure	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						allopregnanolone; ethanol; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; cortex; hippocampus	POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; OPERATED CHLORIDE CHANNELS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; GABA-A RECEPTOR; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; ALCOHOL; EEG; WITHDRAWAL; SLEEP	Background: Sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effects of allopregnanolone (ALLO) is enhanced during the early phase of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. However, it is unclear whether this enhanced sensitivity generalizes to ALLO's neurobehavioral effects during protracted abstinence. The purpose of this study was to examine the neurophysiological effects of ALLO in rats with a history of chronic EtOH exposure after a protracted period of abstinence. Methods: Male Wistar rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 14 hr/day for 5 weeks. Blood EtOH levels were maintained between 200 and 250 mg/dl. The effects of ALLO (0.0-10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on motor activity, the electroencephalogram (EEG), and auditory event-related potentials then were assessed after 6 to 8 weeks of abstinence from EtOH. Results: ALLO's effects on the EEG were consistent with previous studies and were unaffected by EtOH exposure. ALLO increased high-frequency EEG power and shifted peak EEG frequencies in a benzodiazepine- and barbiturate-like manner in both the cortex and the hippocampus. The effects of ALLO on event-related potentials were attenuated in rats with a history of EtOH exposure. Low doses of ALLO (1 and 5 mg/kg) reduced cortical P1 amplitude in response to the standard tone but only in the control group. ALLO also increased N1 amplitude in the hippocampus of the control group while having no significant effect in EtOH-exposed rats. Low doses of ALLO (1 and 5 mg/kg) were found to increase motor activity. Conclusions: These data indicate that a history of EtOH exposure attenuates some of the neurophysiological effects of ALLO in a manner consistent with cross-tolerance. Taken together, these data suggest that increased sensitivity to ALLO's neurobehavioral effects is limited to the early phases of EtOH withdrawal and may not extend to more protracted periods of abstinence.

A self-paced brain interface system that uses movement related potentials and changes in the power of brain rhythms	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Self-paced brain interface systems; Multiple neurological phenomena; Movement-related potentials; Mu rhythms; Beta rhythms	BCI COMPETITION 2003; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMPUTER INTERFACE; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; NEURAL CLASSIFIERS; MOTOR IMAGERY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; MU-RHYTHM; EEG	Movement execution results in the simultaneous generation of movement-related potentials (MRP) as well as changes in the power of Mu and Beta rhythms. This paper proposes a new self-paced multi-channel BI that combines features extracted from MRPs and from changes in the power of Mu and Beta rhythms. We developed a new algorithm to classify the high-dimensional feature space. It uses a two-stage multiple-classifier system (MCS). First, an MCS classifies each neurological phenomenon separately using the information extracted from specific EEG channels (EEG channels are selected by a genetic algorithm). In the second stage, another MCS combines the outputs of MCSs developed in the first stage. Analysis of the data of four able-bodied subjects shows the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with a scheme where the features were all combined in a single feature vector and then classified.

Frontal white matter volume and delta EEG sources negatively correlate in awake subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Alzheimer's disease (AD); electroencephalography (EEG); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA)	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; REACTION TIME TASKS; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL CHOLINERGIC FIBERS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TERM DONEPEZIL THERAPY	Objective: A relationship between brain atrophy and delta rhythmicity (1.5-4 Hz) has been previously explored in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects [Fernandez A, Arrazola J, Maestu F, Amo C, Gil-Gregorio P, Wienbruch C, Ortiz T. Correlations of hippocampal atrophy and focal low-frequency magnetic activity in Alzheimer disease: volumetric MR imaging-magnetoencephalographic study. Am J Neuroradiol. 2003 24(3):481-487]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such a relationship does exist not only in AD patients but also across the continuum of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods: Resting, eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 65 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by LORETA. Cortical EEG sources were correlated with MR-based measurements of lobar brain volume (white and gray matter). Results: A negative correlation was observed between the frontal white matter and the amplitude of frontal delta sources (2-4 Hz) across MCI and AD subjects. Conclusions: These results confirmed for the first time the hypothesis that the sources of resting delta rhythms (2-4 Hz) are correlated with lobar brain volume across MCI and AD subjects. Significance: The present findings support, at least at group level, the 'transition hypothesis' of brain structural and functional continuity between MCI and AD.

In order to study the time-course and temporal aspects of awareness, we examined electrophysiological correlates of conscious vision in two masking experiments. The differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) between unmasked (consciously recognized) and masked (unrecognized) stimuli were considered to be electrophysiological correlates of awareness. Two attentional conditions (global, local) were included to examine the relationship between the scope of attention and awareness. Two ERP-deflections were found to correlate with awareness. First, awareness was associated with a posterior negative amplitude shift 130-320 ms after the stimulus. This effect was present in both attention conditions, suggesting that it emerges independent of the scope of attention. Second, ERPs to unmasked stimuli became more positive as compared with masked stimuli around 400 ms, peaking at parietal sites. This effect was attenuated in the local attention condition, although the participants were aware of the stimuli, suggesting that the late positivity does not directly correlate with visual awareness. The results imply that the earlier negativity is the earliest and most direct correlate of visual awareness.

Recent studies have questioned the benign nature of BECTS, as they have revealed neuropsychological deficits in many domains including language. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the epileptic discharges during the night have long-term effects on auditory processing, as reflected on electrophysiological measures, during the day, which could underline the language deficits. In order to address these questions we recorded base line electroencephalograms (EEG), sleep EEG and auditory event related potentials in 12 children with BECTS and in age- and gender-matched controls. In the children with BECTS, 5 had unilateral and 3 had bilateral spikes. In the 5 patients with unilateral spikes present during sleep, an asymmetry of the auditory event related component (P85-120) was observed contralateral to the side of epileptiform activity compared to the normal symmetrical vertex distribution that was noted in all controls and in 3 the children with bilateral spikes. In all patients the peak to peak amplitude of this event related potential component was statistically greater compared to the controls. Analysis of subtraction waveforms (deviant - standard) revealed no evidence of a mismatch negativity component in any of the children with BECTS. We propose that the abnormality of P85-120 and the absence of mismatch negativity during wake recordings in this group may arise in response to the long-term effects of spikes occurring during sleep, resulting in disruption of the evolution and maintenance of echoic memory traces. These results may indicate that patients with BECTS have abnormal processing of auditory information at a sensory level ipsilateral to the hemisphere evoking spikes during sleep.

Brief arousals during sleep had been observed for many years, but the evolution of sleep medicine in the 1980s directed new attention to these events. Early studies at that time in animals and humans linked brief EEG arousals and associated fragmentation of sleep to daytime sleepiness and degraded performance. Increasing interest in scoring of EEG arousals led the ASDA to publish a scoring manual in 1992. The current review summarizes numerous studies that have examined scoring reliability for these EEG arousals. Validity of EEG arousals was explored by review of studies that empirically varied arousals and found deficits similar to those found after total sleep deprivation depending upon the rate and extent of sleep fragmentation. Additional data from patients with clinical sleep disorders prior to and after effective treatment has also shown a continuing relationship between reduction in pathology-related arousals and improved sleep and daytime function. Finally, many suggestions have been made to refine arousal scoring to include additional elements (e.g., CAP), change the time frame, or focus on other physiological responses such as heart rate or blood pressure changes. Evidence to support the reliability and validity of these measures is presented. It was concluded that the scoring of EEG arousals has added much to our understanding of the sleep process but that significant work on the neurophysiology of arousal needs to be done. Additional refinement of arousal scoring will provide improved insight into sleep pathology and recovery.

By using the same set of words in different linguistic tasks, we found variations of cortical asymmetry between dyslexic individuals and controls starting with the N420, a component supposed to index the phonological processing during reading. Whereas in controls this component was left lateralized, in disabled readers it was more distributed across hemispheres. The observed lack of lateralization in dyslexic individuals was also found in the later slow negative wave that developed in the 700 to 1500-ms time interval. We postulate that the altered asymmetry is related to an impairment of the grapheme-phoneme conversion mechanism. The findings would therefore support the hypothesis of a phonological deficit underlying this learning disability. NeuroReport 17:429-433 (c) 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The principal mathematical techniques applied to the EEG are reviewed. Development. After the introduction of digital EEG, new mathematical tools have been developed for the EEG analysis. Nowadays there are several techniques that analyse the EEG signal in different ways, getting a better understanding of the EEG: development of nest, montages; artifact removal; analysis in time domain, phase coherence and synchrony; source analysis; epileptic seizures detection and prediction; superposition of electrical activity and other neuroimaging techniques. Although they have demonstrated their efficacy, the comparison between them is not always easy. Conclusions. The development of mathematical tools for EEG analysis has improved the knowledge of the electric cerebral activity in normal and pathological conditions. They study many different aspects of the EEG signal. Their continuous development will produce an increase the knowledge of the normal and pathological cerebral functions.

We were specifically interested in latency and amplitude variability of the P3 component in patients with schizophrenia. For this purpose we developed a method for analyzing single-trial ERPs based on a wavelet smoothing algorithm, which is presented in detail. This method was applied to data from schizophrenic patients and healthy controls in an auditory Go/Nogo task. We found a significant increase of latency variability in the schizophrenic group at electrode Fz (frontal midline) and increased amplitude variability at electrode Pz (parietal midline). These results support the concept of increased cortical noise in patients with schizophrenia. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Omega-3 supplementation on some cognitive and physiological parameters in healthy subjects. Materials and methods Subjects were tested at the beginning of the experiment and after 35 days. In this period they were supplemented with Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A group was supplemented with olive oil (placebo). Tests involving different types of attention were used, i.e. Alert, Go/No-Go, Choice and Sustained Attention. For each test, the reaction time, the event-related potentials by electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electromyography (EMG) of the forefinger flexor muscle were recorded. The Profile of Mood States test (POMS) was also administered. Results Blood analyses showed that after Omega-3 supplementation the arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio (AA/EPA) was strongly reduced. The mood profile was improved after Omega-3 with increased vigour and reduced anger, anxiety and depression states. This was associated with an effect on reactivity with a reduction of reaction time in the Go/No-Go and Sustained Attention tests. The latency of EMG activation was concomitantly reduced in the same tests plus Choice. An EEG frequency shift towards the theta and alpha band were recorded in all the tests after Omega-3. Conclusion Omega-3 supplementation is associated with an improvement of attentional and physiological functions, particularly those involving complex cortical processing. These findings are discussed in terms of the influence of Omega-3 on the central nervous system.

Attentional modulation can arise when the internal attentional state (current task) of the observer alters visual processing of the same stimuli. This can influence visual cortex, boosting neural responses to an attended stimulus. Emotional modulation can also arise, when affective properties (emotional significance) of stimuli, rather than their strictly visual properties, influence processing. This too can boost responses in visual cortex, as for fear- associated stimuli. Both attentional and emotional modulation of visual processing may reflect distant influences upon visual cortex, exerted by brain structures outside the visual system per se. Hence, these modulations may provide windows onto causal interactions between distant but interconnected brain regions. We review recent evidence, noting both similarities and differences between attentional and emotional modulation. Both can affect visual cortex, but can reflect influences from different regions, such as fronto-parietal circuits versus the amygdala. Recent work on this has developed new approaches for studying causal influences between human brain regions that may be useful in other cognitive domains. The new methods include application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) measures in brain-damaged patients to study distant functional impacts of their focal lesions, and use of transcranial magnetic stimulation concurrently with fMRI or EEG in the normal brain. Cognitive neuroscience is now moving beyond considering the putative functions of particular brain regions, as if each operated in isolation, to consider, instead, how distinct brain regions (such as visual cortex, parietal or frontal regions, or amygdala) may mutually influence each other in a causal manner.

At present it is not clear whether fear signals from body expressions may be encoded equally as rapid. To answer this question we investigated the early temporal dynamics of perceiving fearful body expression by measuring EEG. Participants viewed images of whole body actions presented either in a neutral or a fearful version. We observed an early emotion effect on the P1 peak latency around 112 ms post stimulus onset hitherto only found for facial expressions. Also consistent with the majority of facial expression studies, the N170 component elicited by perceiving bodies proved not to be sensitive for the expressed fear. In line with previous work, its vertex positive counterpart, the VPP, did show a condition-specific influence for fearful body expression. Our results indicate that the information provided by fearful body expression is already encoded in the early stages of visual processing, and suggest that similar early processing mechanisms are involved in the perception of fear in faces and bodies.

The electroencephalograms were recorded the auditory sensory memory that elicited the mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity (LDN), as well as involuntary attention switch that elicited the P3a and early MMN were analyzed. The results indicated that children with high intelligence had comparatively larger MMN, LDN, early MMN, P3a amplitudes, and earlier peak latency in LDN than average children. The enhanced neural function of the intellectually gifted children might be due to more spatially and temporally coordinated neural network, faster neural processing speed and more efficient neural activation functions.

The present study aimed to elucidate the time course of this process. Twelve subjects performed an updating task, in which a filled circle was shown before a horizontal saccade, requiring updating of stimulus location, and a control task without visual stimulation before the saccade. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) were recorded while subjects performed the tasks and LORETA source analysis was performed on event-related potential (ERP) components. ERP amplitudes were more positive in the updating condition in comparison to the control condition in two latency windows. An early positive wave starting at about 50 ms after saccade offset and originating in the posterior parietal cortex contralateral to saccade direction probably reflects the integration of saccade-related and visual information and thus the updating process. A shift of the representation of the to-be-updated stimulus to the opposite hemisphere is reflected in a later component starting approximately 400 ms after saccade offset, which is related to memory and originates in the PPC ipsilateral to saccade direction and thus contralateral to the spatial location of the updated visual stimulus.

Here, we investigated whether anticipatory processes in reaction-time procedures are governed by similar mechanisms of interval timing. Weused a choice reaction task with two different, temporally regular stimulus presentation regimes, both with occasional deviant interstimulus intervals. Temporal preparation was shown in the form of adjustments in time course of slow brain potentials, such that they reached their maximum amplitude just before a new trial, independent of the duration of the interstimulus interval. Preparation was focused on a brief time window, demonstrated by a drop in amplitude of slow potentials as the standard interval had elapsed in deviant interstimulus intervals. Implicit timing influencing perceptual processing was shown in reduced visual-evoked responses to delayed stimuli after a deviant interstimulus interval and in a reduction of EEG alpha power over the visual cortex at the time when the standard interval had elapsed. In contrast to explicit timing tasks, the slow brain potential manifestations of implicit timing originated in the lateral instead of the medial premotor cortex. Together, the results show that temporal regularities set up a narrow time window of motor and sensory attention, demonstrating the operation of interval timing in reaction time performance. The divergence in slow brain potential distribution between implicit and explicit timing tasks suggests that interval timing for different behaviors relies on qualitatively similar mechanisms implemented in distinct cortical substrates.

Short trains (5 pulses at 10 Hz) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were applied to the right FEF during the cueing period of a covert attentional task while event-related potentials (ERPs) were simultaneously recorded from lateral posterior electrodes, where visual components are prominent. FEF TMS significantly affected the neural activity evoked by visual stimuli, as well as the ongoing neural activity recorded during earlier anticipation of the visual stimuli. The effects of FEF TMS started earlier and were greatest for brain activity recorded ipsilaterally to FEF TMS and contralaterally to the visual stimulus. The TMS-induced effect on visual ERPs occurred at the same time as ERPs were shown to be modulated by visual attention. Importantly, no similar effects were observed after TMS of a control site that was physically closer but not anatomically interconnected to the recording sites. The results show that the human FEF has a causal influence over the modulation of visual activity in posterior areas when attention is being allocated.

BOLD fMRI does not measure neural activity directly, but relies on a cascade of physiological events linking neural activity to the generation of MRI signal. However, most of the disease and pharmacological studies performed so far have interpreted changes in BOLD fMRI as "brain activation," ignoring the potential confounds that can arise through drug- or disease-induced modulation of events downstream of the neural activity. This issue is especially serious in diseases (like multiple sclerosis, brain tumours and stroke) and drugs (like anaesthetics or those with a vascular action) that are known to influence these physiological events. Here we provide evidence that, to extract meaningful information on brain activity in patient and pharmacological BOLD fMRI studies, it is important to identify, characterise and possibly correct these influences that potentially confound the results. We suggest a series of experimental measures to improve the interpretability of BOLD fMRI studies. We have ranked these according to their potential information and current practical feasibility. First-line, necessary improvements consist of (1) the inclusion of one or more control tasks, and (2) the recording of physiological parameters during scanning and subsequent correction of possible between-group differences. Second-line, highly recommended important aim to make the results of a patient or drug BOLD study more interpretable and include the assessment of (1) baseline brain perfusion, (2) vascular reactivity, (3) the inclusion of stimulus-related perfusion fMRI and (4) the recording of electrophysiological responses to the stimulus of interest. Finally, third-line, desirable improvements consist of the inclusion of (1) simultaneous EEG-fMRI (2) cerebral blood volume and (3) rate of metabolic oxygen consumption measurements and, when relevant, (4) animal studies investigating signalling between neural cells and blood vessels.

Residual dependency estimation of independent components applied to EEG event related potentials associated with emotional processing	2007 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-16	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 22-26, 2007	Lyon, FRANCE	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Independent component analysis can be employed as an exploratory method in electroencephalographic (EEG) data analysis. However, the assumption of statistical independence among the estimated components is not always fulfilled by ICA-based numerical methods. Furthermore it may happen that one physiological source can be split in two or more components. As a consequence, the estimated components must be further investigated to assess the existence of reciprocal similarities. In this work a method for finding residual dependency subsets of component is proposed. Firstly a hierarchical clustering stage is carried out to classify ICA results. Then the hierarchical tree is investigated at each level by two indices to evaluate the tightness of all clusters. At the same time clustered scalp projections are compared with a template, which is shaped by applying ensemble ICA to a training dataset. Results are shown on EEG data acquired in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) studies for emotional pictures processing. In this kind of experiment ERPs are measured whilst unpleasant and neutral images are shown to a subject. The clustering procedure and the performance indices succeeded in isolating compact groups of components. These components, taken together, reflect the brain's biopotentials related to emotional processing at different cortical areas.

The timing of this subjective impression has been measured using Libet's clock and is on average about 300 ms prior to EMG onset. EEG and MEG show activity prior to movement, and by the voltage measurement, there is a rising negativity called the Bereitschaftspotential beginning about 1.5 s prior to EMG onset. This indicates that the brain mechanisms for generating a voluntary movement begin prior to the subjective intention, that is, unconsciously. If it were possible to detect relevant EEG signals with single events in real time, then it would be possible to identify that movement is being prepared prior to, or at least simultaneously with, the subjective experience. Work in our laboratory has been making progress in identifying EEG and MEG activity indicating the intention to move and which movement will be made. Such signals could be used to drive a brain-computer interface.

Repetition suppression of induced gamma band responses is eliminated by task switching	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						human EEG; implicit memory; induced gamma band response; oscillations; sharpening	OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PRIMING TASK; MEMORY; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION	The formation of cortical object representations requires the activation of cell assemblies, correlated by induced oscillatory bursts of activity > 20 Hz (induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). One marker of the functional dynamics within such cell assemblies is the suppression of iGBRs elicited by repeated stimuli. This effect is commonly interpreted as a signature of 'sharpening' processes within cell-assemblies, which are behaviourally mirrored in repetition priming effects. The present study investigates whether the sharpening of primed objects is an automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing, or whether it depends on task demands. Participants performed either a 'living/non-living' or a 'bigger/smaller than a shoebox' classification on repeated pictures of everyday objects. We contrasted repetition-related iGBR effects after the same task was used for initial and repeated presentations (no-switch condition) with repetitions after a task-switch occurred (switch condition). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analysis by examining other brain responses known to be modulated by repetition-related memory processes (evoked gamma oscillations and event-related potentials; ERPs). The results obtained for the 'no-switch' condition replicated previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs at 200-300 ms after stimulus onset. Source modelling showed that this effect was distributed over widespread cortical areas. By contrast, after a task-switch no iGBR suppression was found. We concluded that iGBRs reflect the sharpening of a cell assembly only within the same task. After a task switch the complete object representation is reactivated. The ERP (220-380 ms) revealed suppression effects independent of task demands in bilateral posterior areas and might indicate correlates of repetition priming in perceptual structures.

Other studies on event-related potentials showed that somatosensory N140 was enhanced when attention of human subjects was directed to tactile stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesized that N140 would be modulated when human subjects performed tactile cross-modal delay tasks. Scalp-event-related potentials were recorded from normal subjects performing either a tactile-tactile unimodal, or a tactile-visual cross-modal delayed matching-to-sample task. Identical tactile stimuli were used in both tasks. N140 component evoked by the tactile stimuli was enhanced in the cross-modal task. Enhancement of this component was also observed in control cross-modal tasks. The results suggest that tactile-visual cross-modal association affects tactile sensory-perceptual processes in humans.

Motor procedural learning and auditory discrimination tasks were administered pre- and post-condition. Both groups reported improved alertness post-nap, but not post-reading. Non-habitual nappers fell asleep faster and tended to have greater sleep efficiency, but did not differ from habitual nappers on other sleep architecture variables. Habitual nappers had greater alpha and theta EEG power in stage 1, and greater delta, alpha and sigma power in stage 2 sleep. Motor performance deteriorated for non-habitual nappers who napped, but improved for all others. The number of sleep spindles and sigma power (13.5-15 Hz) significantly predicted motor performance following the nap, for habitual nappers only. Results indicate that motor learning was consolidated in a brief nap and was associated with stage 2 spindles, but only for those who habitually take naps. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been suggested that the auditory evoked gamma-band response (GBR) is affected by attention and apart from auditory cortex activity a frontal or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) generator could be involved. It was the aim of the present study to address three questions: (1) is there a neural generator of the early evoked GBR in the dorsal (d)ACC? (2) Are there different activation patterns in the dACC and the auditory cortex areas in response to task difficulty? (3) Is it possible to detect an influence of early ACC-gamma-band activity (GBR timeframe) to later auditory information processing (N1 timeframe)? In the present EEG/ERP-study we have investigated 30 healthy subjects using six auditory reaction tasks with increasing difficulty and mental effort demands. In the MANOVA analysis we found a significant main effect of task difficulty on both the GBR amplitude (F = 7.75; p < 0.001) and the auditory evoked N1 potential (F = 7.00; p < 0.001) with higher amplitudes in the more difficult tasks. In the LORETA region of interest (ROI) analysis, this effect was only due to increased dACC-activity during the GBR-timeframe. For the ROI analysis during the NI timeframe, in addition to a strong effect of task difficulty in the dACC a similar main effect was found in the auditory association area 22. These findings are in line with a top-down influence of dACC-activity to the auditory association area 22 during the earIv evoked GBR. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although this phenomenon has been intensively studied and it has been found that the post-capillary venous expansion is an intrinsically nonlinear mechanical process, the existence of an additional neural basis for the nonlinearity has not been clearly shown. In this paper, we assessed the correlation between the electric and vascular indices by performing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI recordings in humans during a series of visual stimulation (i.e., radial checkerboard). With changes of the visual stimulation frequencies (from 0.5 to 16 Hz) and contrasts (from 1% to 100%), both the event related potentials (ERPs) and hemodynamic responses show nonlinear behaviors. In particular, the mean power of the brain electric sources and the neuronal efficacies (as originally defined in the hemodynamics model [Friston et al. Neuroimage, 12, 466-477, 2000], here represent the vascular inputs) in primary visual cortex consistently show a linear correlation for all subjects. This indicates that the hemodynamic response nonlinearity found in this paper primarily reflects the nonlinearity of underlying neural activity. Most importantly, this finding underpins a nonlinear neurovascular coupling. Specifically, it is shown that the transferring function of the neurovascular coupling is likely a power transducer, which integrates the fast dynamics of neural activity into the vascular input of slow hemodynamics.

Ventral and dorsal regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been associated with response inhibition and self-control-key components of emotion regulation. Our research program aims to explore differences among aggressive and normal children in the activation of these cortical regions during emotional episodes, to the extent possible using electrophysiological techniques, to identify diagnostic subtypes, gain insights into their interpersonal difficulties, and help develop effective treatment strategies. This report reviews several recent studies investigating individual and developmental differences in cortical mechanisms of emotion regulation, corresponding with different patterns of interpersonal behavior. Our methods include event-related potentials (ERPs) and cortical source modeling, using dense-array electroencephalography (EEG) technology, as well as video-taped observations of parent-child interactions, with both normal and aggressive children. By relating patterns of brain activation to observed behavioral differences, we find (i) a steady decrease in cortical activation subserving self-regulation across childhood and adolescence, (ii) different cortical activation patterns as well as behavioral constellations distinguishing subtypes of aggressive children, and (iii) robust correlations between the activation of cortical mediators of emotion regulation and flexibility in parent-child emotional communication in children referred for aggressive behavior problems. These findings point toward models of developmental psychopathology based on the interplay among biological, psychological, and social factors.

Unfortunately, neurological examination does not always agree with the neuropsychological evaluation in determining the cognitive profile of the patient. On the other hand, psychophysiological techniques such as event-related potentials (ERPs) can help in evaluating cognitive impairment in different pathologies. Behavioural responses and EEG signals were recorded during the experiment in three experimental groups: 1) a relapsing-remitting group ( RRMS), 2) a benign multiple sclerosis group (BMS) and 3) a Control group. The paradigm employed was a spatial attention task with central cues ( Posner experiment). The main aim was to observe the differences in the performance ( behavioural variables) and in the latency and amplitude of the ERP components among these groups. Results: Our data indicate that both MS groups showed poorer task performance ( longer reaction times and lower percentage of correct responses), a latency delay for the NI and P300 component, and a different amplitude for the frontal NI. Moreover, the deficit in the BMS group, indexed by behavioural and pyschophysiological variables, was more pronounced compared to the RRMS group. `Conclusion: The present results suggest a cognitive impairment in the information processing in all of these patients. Comparing both pathological groups, cognitive impairment was more accentuated in the BMS group compared to the RMSS group. This suggests a silent deterioration of cognitive skills for the BMS that is not usually treated with pharmacological or neuropsychological therapy.

More and more evidences were found that both EEG and ERP signals are also chaotic signal from the nonlinear dynamics system. A novel model based on the time-varying coupled map lattice model is proposed for investigating the nonlinear dynamics of EEG under specified cognitive tasks. Moreover, the time-variant largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) is defined for the purpose of defining quantitative parameters to reveal the global characters of system and extract new information involved in the system. Both simulations and real ERP signals were examined in terms of LLE parameter for studying the signal's dynamic structure. Several experimental results show that the brain chaos changes with time under different attention tasks of the information processing. The influence of the LLE with the different attention tasks occurs in P2 period.

No gold standard exists to detect minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Event-related evoked potentials (P300 latency) were proposed as the best tool to assess this condition. EEG spectral analysis and psychometric evaluation are also used to assess minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Aims. The present study aims at comparing these three techniques. Patients. Eighty-six cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy were studied. Methods. Patients underwent EEG spectral analysis, psychometric evaluation and P300. P300 latency was age-adjusted; psychometric tests were age- and education-adjusted. Values >2Z were considered to be altered. The alteration of at least two psychometric tests was considered for cognitive impairment. Results. At least one of the three indexes was altered in 61% (CI95% = 49-71) patients; EEG spectral analysis was altered in 41% (CI95% = 30-52%) patients, psychometric performance in 34% (CI95% = 24-45%) and P300 latency in 13% (CI95% = 7-22%). P300 latency was altered only in the patients having EEG spectral analysis or psychometric alterations, but for two cases. Psychometric performance and EEG spectral analysis, but not P300 latency, were correlated with indexes of liver function. Conclusions. P300 latency provided little additional information and was less related to liver function than EEG spectral analysis and psychometrical investigation.

In the present study, the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 was administered alone or in combination with a moderate dose of ethanol to determine whether it interacted with the neurobehavioral effects of ethanol. Method: Male Wistar rats were implanted with cortical recording electrodes and a lateral ventricular cannula. The effects of 1 nmol BIBP3226, 0.75 g/kg ethanol and the combination (BIBP3226 + EtOH) on neurophysiological activity and locomotion were then assessed. Results: Ethanol significantly increased 1-2 Hz parietal cortical power and this effect was partially antagonized by BIBP3226. Peak frequencies in the parietal cortical 6-8 Hz and 8-16 Hz bands were also altered by ethanol, but these effects were not reversed by BIBP3226. BIBP3226 or ethanol, when administered alone, did not alter motor activity or cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) but administration of BIBP3226 + EtOH reduced motor activity, reduced parietal cortical N1 ERP amplitude and increased frontal cortical N1 ERP latency. Conclusions: In the present study, the most prominent effect of antagonizing central NPY Y1 receptors was a facilitation of the effects of ethanol. In particular, the effects of combined administration of BIBP3226 and ethanol are indicative of enhanced sedation and possibly cognitive impairment.

Adult listeners (N=16) heard a repeated standard (the syllable 'da') that was interrupted infrequently by a phonetically different 'deviant' syllable ('ba'). The acoustic difference between standard and deviant was manipulated to create both acoustically Strong and Weak deviant stimuli. Mismatch negativities in response to the Strong deviant were significantly greater than those for the Weak deviant, in spite of the fact that both represented stable instances of the phonetic category. The data suggest that the mismatch negativity component can be strongly influenced by sensory factors beyond what is predicted by overt categorization and discrimination judgments.

We investigated early emotion discrimination deficits in PD by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods: Emotional pictures were presented to 14 PD patients and 14 healthy controls in a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm (three frames per second) while EEG was recorded. In addition, valence and arousal ratings were obtained for a representative subsample of 54 pictures. Results: PD patients rated pictures of highly arousing content as less exciting than did healthy controls. Pictures of high compared to low emotional arousal were associated with a pronounced relative negative shift in the ERP waveform over parietal and occipital sites developing about 220 ms after picture onset. This early posterior negativity (EPN) did not differ between PD and control group. Conclusions: This dissociation of affective ratings and early ERP components supports the view that PD is associated with blunted emotional responses, but there is no evidence for a deteriorated early visual processing of emotional stimuli. Significance: Frequently reported deficits in emotion discrimination are likely not due to deficits in early emotion processing. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Developing a reliable machine learning method plays a very crucial role in this issue. For a typical problem in BCI, ERP detection task, the major method is to classify the input EEG time series into two classes; with a desired ERP/Cognitive Component and without that desired ERP/Cognitive Component. Any powerful feature extraction or classifier block that can do this task accurately, can be of a great help. In this study, a new classifier based on modular learning strategy and a new wavelet for feature extraction, will be introduced and compared with some other classifiers in two states; with GA and without GA, which shows a an improvement in classification accuracy.

A meta-analysis of quantitative EEG power associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; electroencephalography; meta-analysis; rating scales; sensitivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-DEPENDENT DECLINE; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RATING-SCALE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PROBLEM CHILDREN; DRUG-TREATMENT; 2 SUBTYPES	A meta-analysis was performed on quantitative EEG (QEEG) studies that evaluated attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using the criteria of the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) edition). The nine eligible studies (N = 1498) observed QEEG traits of a theta power increase and a beta power decrease, summarized in the theta/beta ratio with a pooled effect size of 3.08 (95% confidence interval, 2.90, 3.26) for ADHD versus controls (normal children, adolescents, and adults). By statistical extrapolation, an effect size of 3.08 predicts a sensitivity and specificity of 94%, which is similar to previous results 86% to 90% sensitivity and 94% to 98% specificity. It is important to note that the controlled group studies were often with retrospectively set limits, and that in practice the sensitivity and specificity results would likely be more modest. The literature search also uncovered 32 pre-DSM-IV studies of ADHD and EEG power, and 29 of the 32 studies demonstrated results consistent with the meta-analysis. The meta-analytic results are also supported by the observation that the theta/beta ratio trait follows age-related changes in ADHD symptom presentation (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.996, P = 0.004). In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports that a theta/beta ratio increase is a commonly observed trait in ADHD relative to normal controls. Because it is known that the theta/beta ratio trait may arise with other conditions, a prospective study covering differential diagnosis would be required to determine generalizability to clinical applications. Standardization of the QEEG technique is also needed, specifically with control of mental state, drowsiness, and medication.

EEG analysis using wavelet-based information tools	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; epileptic seizures; information theory; wavelet analysis; signal entropy; statistical complexity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRANSIENT DOMINANCE; STATISTICAL MEASURE; ENTROPY; COMPLEXITY	Wavelet-based informational tools for quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) record analysis are reviewed. Relative wavelet energies, wavelet entropies and wavelet statistical complexities are used in the characterization of scalp EEG records corresponding to secondary generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures. In particular, we show that the epileptic recruitment rhythm observed during seizure development is well described in terms of the relative wavelet energies. In addition, during the concomitant time-period the entropy diminishes while complexity grows. This is construed as evidence supporting the conjecture that an epileptic focus, for this kind of seizures, triggers a self-organized brain state characterized by both order and maximal complexity.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between driver's driving style and driver's ERP response. In our research, a virtual reality (VR) driving environment is developed to provide stimuli to subjects. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to decompose the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The power spectrum analysis of ICA components and correlation analysis are employed to investigate the EEG activities related to driving style. Experimental results demonstrate that we may classify the drivers into aggressive or gentle styles based on the observed ERP difference corresponding to the proposed unexpected obstacle dodging tasks.

It is designed for use across the lifespan and has a large normative database of over 1,000 subjects. This study was a preliminary evaluation of "NeuroMarker" in subjects spanning four decades. Twenty-one healthy subjects (12-57 years) were tested at baseline and four weeks later. From the "Neuromarker" battery, the authors analyzed EEG data ( eyes open and closed) and ERPs elicited during auditory oddball (N100, P200, N200, P300) and working memory (P150, P300) tasks. Concomitant neuropsychological data, acquired using a touch-screen system, comprised measures of sensori-motor, attention, verbal, executive, and memory function. Test-retest data were examined using analyses of variance and correlational procedures ( corrected for multiple comparisons), with parallel analyses of age. EEG data did not differ across sessions, and showed high test-retest reliability (.71-.95), particularly for theta and delta (>.85). ERP components also showed sound reliability, particularly for sites where components are maximal: fronto-central N100 (.76-.77), centro-parietal P300 (.78-.81) to oddball targets, N100 and P200 (.74-.86) to oddball non-targets, and P150 amplitude and latency (.84.93) to working memory stimuli. Neuropsychological tests showed a similarly sound level of consistency (on average, .70), with the most consistent tests tapping simple motor function, estimated intelligence, switching of attention (Part 2), verbal interference response time and memory intrusions (.71-.89). Age and sex did not have a differential impact on reliability for EEG, ERP, or neuropsychology measures. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the "NeuroMarker" battery is reliable for test-retest assessments. The results suggest that the standardized approach has utility for providing sensitive clinical and treatment evaluations across age groups.

These brain oscillations have been studied extensively in the resting electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as in the underlying evoked oscillations that make up the event-related potentials (ERPs). There are several approaches to elucidate the possible mechanisms of these brain oscillations. One approach is to look at the neurophysiology and neurochemistry involved in generating and modulating these oscillations. Another more recent approach is to examine the genetic underpinnings of these neural oscillations. It is proposed that the genetic underpinnings of these oscillations are likely to stem from regulatory genes which control the neurochemical processes of the brain, and therefore influence neural function. Genetic analyses of human brain oscillations may identify genetic loci underlying the functional organization of human neuroelectric activity. Brain oscillations represent important correlates of human information processing and cognition. They represent highly heritable traits that are less complex and more proximal to gene function than either diagnostic labels or traditional cognitive measures. Therefore these oscillations may be utilized as phenotypes of cognition and as valuable tools for the understanding of some complex genetic disorders. Genetic loci that have been recently identified regarding both resting and evoked brain oscillations involving the GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems of the brain are discussed. It is concluded that the advent of genomics and proteomics and a fuller understanding of gene regulation will open new horizons on the critical electrical events so essential for human brain function.

In the current study, we used a multivariate analysis to disentangle the effects of these correlated variables. During retrieval, power of left-parietal theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations increased in proportion to how well a test item was remembered, and theta in central regions correlated with decision making. We also studied how these oscillatory dynamics complemented event-related potentials. These findings are the first to demonstrate that distinct patterns of theta oscillations can simultaneously relate to different aspects of behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neuro-oscillations were recorded by high-density 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were required to perform two tasks: simple tapping of the index finger and thumb and a complex Luria finger apposition task. Both tasks were performed unimanually and bimanually. There were no significant group differences in the task-related power (TRPow) within alpha 1 (mu1) or in beta 1 frequencies (beta 1). In contrast, there were significant group differences in the alpha 2 (mu2) and beta 2 frequencies (beta 2). Patients had less desychronisation than controls at the electrodes covering the central regions of the scalp. Alpha 2 and beta 2 frequencies have been associated with task-specific sensorimotor integration and motor function, respectively. This activity difference in patients with Parkinson's disease may be due to deficits in sensorimotor integration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twelve naive subjects performed self-paced movements consisting of three key strokes with either hand. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The exploration was performed offline on single trial EEG data. We proposed that a successful computational procedure for classification would consist of spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection, and pattern classification. A systematic investigation was performed with combinations of spatial filtering using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), common spatial patterns analysis (CSP), and surface Laplacian derivation (SLD); temporal filtering using power spectral density estimation (PSD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT); pattern classification using linear Mahalanobis distance classifier (LMD), quadratic Mahalanobis distance classifier (QMD), Bayesian classifier (BSC), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A robust multivariate feature selection strategy using a genetic algorithm was employed. Results: The combinations of spatial filtering using ICA and SLD, temporal filtering using PSD and DWT, and classification methods using LMD, QMD, BSC and SVM provided higher performance than those of other combinations. Utilizing one of the better combinations of ICA, PSD and SVM, the discrimination accuracy was as high as 75%. Further feature analysis showed that beta band EEG activity of the channels over right sensorimotor cortex was most appropriate for discrimination of right and left hand movement intention. Conclusions: Effective combinations of computational methods provide possible classification of human movement intention from single trial EEG. Such a method could be the basis for a potential brain-computer interface based on human natural movement, which might reduce the requirement of long-term training. Significance: Effective combinations of computational methods can classify human movement intention from single trial EEG with reasonable accuracy. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Each of these has been proposed as a possible neural index of the orienting reflex (OR), but none has clearly met the criteria required for identification as an OR. The skin conductance response (SCR) is the most extensively examined index of the OR, and was used here as an OR 'yard-stick'. The primary aim of this study was to determine if any of the components of the LPC show stimulus-response relationships analogous to those of the SCR. Methods: ERPs and SCRs were simultaneously recorded from 72 subjects during an ERP dishabituation paradigm, in which a habituation stimulus (SI) was presented for a series of trials, during which a different Stimulus (S2) was interpolated. This sequence was presented in a series of trains, allowing across-train LPC and SCR exploration as a function of trial. The sensitivity of these components to stimulus intensity and significance, other stimulus dimensions important in defining the OR, was also examined. We utilised a PCA with varimax rotation to separate the ERP components underlying the LPC. Results: Four factors extracted appeared to correspond to the classic Slow Wave, the P3b, the Novelty P3 and the P3a. While the LPC exhibited a stimulus-response relationship analogous to the SCR, each of the separate components was differentially sensitive to aspects of the stimulus manipulations examined here. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that the LPC is an adequate EEG index of the OR. However, the underlying components of the LPC examined here-which we consider to be the classic slow wave, P3b, Novelty P3 and P3a-cannot be used interchangeably as OR indices. Significance: This study clarifies links between the autonomic OR and its CNS correlates. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To examine whether schizophrenic patients have abnormalities in frequency-domain, event-related alpha attenuation, as well as in time-domain EEG phenomena, such as event-related potential, we compared alpha power change and P300 elicited simultaneously in response to the presentation of target tones in an auditory oddball paradigm between patients with schizophrenia and normal control subjects. In both patients and controls, alpha power was smaller during the time window of 512 ms following targets than following non-targets, particularly at the parietal and the posterior temporal locations (Pz, T5, and T6). The size of alpha attenuation measured as percent reduction in alpha power produced by targets relative to non-targets was smaller in patients than in controls at the posterior temporal locations. The size of alpha attenuation showed no correlation with P300 amplitude or latency in either patients or controls. Furthermore, in patients, the size of alpha attenuation showed no correlation with symptom severity, while P300 amplitude was correlated negatively with the positive subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. These findings suggest that the symptom-independent reduction in event-related alpha attenuation in schizophrenia may be useful as an electrophysiological index of the impairment of neural processes distinct from that indexed by symptom-dependent P300 abnormalities.

To further explore the functional role of oscillatory synchrony during language processing, we quantified event-related EEG power changes induced by the presentation of open-class (OC) words and closed-class (CC) words in a wide range of frequencies (from I to 30 Hz), while subjects read a short story. Word presentation induced three oscillatory components: a theta power increase (4-7 Hz), an alpha power decrease (10-12 Hz), and a beta power decrease (16-21 Hz). Whereas the alpha and beta responses showed mainly quantitative differences between the two word classes, the theta responses showed qualitative differences between OC words and CC words: A theta power increase was found over left temporal areas for OC words, but not for CC words. The left temporal theta increase may index the activation of a network involved in retrieving the lexical-semantic properties of the OC items.

Multichannel EEG recordings and pain ratings were obtained during the presentation of 800 painful electrical intramuscular and intracutaneous stimuli each to the left in. erector spinae and the left in. extensor digitorum. Perception and pain thresholds were not significantly different between the two groups, though patients showed significantly more perceptual sensitization. Across all stimulation conditions, a larger EEG component 80 milliseconds after stimulation was observed in the CLBP group. No significant group differences were found for the N150. The component 260 milliseconds after stimulus onset was significantly smaller in the CLBP group. N80, N150, and perceptual sensitization were significantly positively correlated. These results indicate enhanced perceptual sensitization and enhanced processing of the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain, as expressed in the N80 component, in CLBP patients. This may be one neurophysiologic basis of sensitization and the chronicity process. The lower P260 component in the patients may be explained in terms of tonic pain inhibiting phasic pain or may be related to the affective distress observed in this patient group.

An automatic identification and removal method for eye-blink artifacts in event-related magnetoencephalographic measurements	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						MEG; eye-blink artifact; noise reduction; ICA; PCA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG; SEPARATION; POTENTIALS; REGRESSION	While measuring event-related magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals using visual stimuli, eye blinks were inevitable and generated large magnetic artifacts. Since trials containing eye blinks were excluded from the analyses, the signal-to-noise ratio of the event-related signals was decreased. In this study, we propose a method to identify the eye blink magnetic artifacts and remove them automatically using independent component analysis preprocessed by principal component analysis. The method evaluates the spatiotemporal similarity between independent components and both MEG and electro-oculogram data based on a newly devised cost function. Testing of the method on event-related MEG signals measured by a 306-channel whole-head system in a visual perception task led to the successful identification and removal of eye-blink artifacts in all trials containing eye blinks from all the seven subjects.

Wiegand and E. Wascher (2005) used the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) to investigate the mechanisms underlying spatial stimulus-response (S-R) correspondence. The authors compared spatial S-R correspondence effects obtained with horizontal and vertical S-R arrangements. In some relevant previous investigations on spatial S-R correspondence with the LRP, researchers preferred to use the vertical S-R layout to circumvent methodological issues related to the LRP and horizontal S-R layouts. K. Wiegand and E. Wascher (2005) do not address these complications, and they make comparisons between electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected with horizontal and vertical S-R arrangements that do not take into account the limitations inherent to the LRP derivation. This methodological weakness renders unsound the neurophysiological support for their views on the nature of spatial S-R compatibility effects. In this article, the author discusses the limitations and possibilities of lateralized event-related potentials (ERPs) in the investigation of spatial S-R correspondence effects.

[2000a,b, 2004] and to further investigate the possible effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by mobile phones (MP) on the event-related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) EEG (electroencephalogram) responses during cognitive processing. Two groups, both consisting of 36 male participants, were recruited. One group performed an auditory memory task and the other performed a visual working memory task in six exposure conditions: SHAM (no EMF), CW (continuous wave EMF) and PM (pulse modulated EMF) during both left- and right-side exposure, while the EEG was recorded. In line with our previous studies, we observed that the exposure to EMF had modest effects on brain oscillatory responses in the alpha frequency range (similar to 8-12 Hz) and had no effects on the behavioural measures. The effects on the EEG were, however, varying, unsystematic and inconsistent with previous reports. We conclude that the effects of EMF on brain oscillatory responses may be subtle, variable and difficult to replicate for unknown reasons. Bioelectromagnetics 28:296-308, 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss.

Here, we studied the interconnection of slow shifts (0.01 Hz high-pass) in surface EEG and hippocampal shifts as emerging in an event-related EEG biofeedback paradigm. Hippocampal EEG activity was monitored by depth electrodes implanted in four epilepsy patients for presurgical evaluation. Trials were sorted according to the near-DC shifts occurring at the surface position Cz, which was the feedback electrode, into positive, indistinct (i.e., small or biphasic) and negative shifts. We found significant hippocampal near-DC shifts being positively or negatively correlated to the shifts in surface EEG in all four patients. The amplitudes of the hippocampal near-DC shifts were several times larger than the surface shifts. The polarity of the shifts appears to depend on the location of the electrode contacts with respect to the hippocampal subfields. The finding that neocortical and hippocampal near-DC shifts are interconnected may open new perspectives for the prediction and control of mediotemporal lobe seizures. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate four of these correction techniques (Verleger, Gasser, & Mocks, 1982 [VGM]; Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1983 [GCD]; Semlitsch, Presslich, Schuster, & Anderer, 1986 [SPSA]; Croft & Barry, 2000 [CB]). Blinks, vertical eye movements (VEM), and horizontal eye movements (HEM) from 26 subjects were corrected using these techniques, and eye movement event-related potentials computed to aid validation. HEMs were corrected better by CB, VGM/GCD then SPSA, VEMs by CB, VGM/GCD then SPSA, and blinks by CB, SPSA, GCD and then VGM, with the advantage of CB substantial for blinks (eta(2) >.72), VEMs (eta(2) >.60), and HEMs (eta(2) >.27). It is argued that the CB procedure adequately accounts for ocular artifact in the EEG. Reasons for the limitations of the other procedures are discussed.

Up to now, these methods are the only possible solution to noninvasively investigate cortical activities with both high spatial and time resolutions. However, the application of these methods is hindered by the fact that they have not been rigorously evaluated nor compared. In this paper, the performances of several source localization methods (moving dipoles, minimum Lp norm, and low resolution tomography (LRT) with Lp norm, p equal to 1, 1.5, and 2) were evaluated by using simulated scalp EEG data, scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and upper limb motor-related potentials (MRPs) obtained on human subjects (all with 163 scalp electrodes). By using simulated EEG data, we first evaluated the source localization ability of the above methods quantitatively. Subsequently, the performance of the various methods was evaluated qualitatively by using experimental SEPs and MRPs. Our results show that the overall LRT Lp norm method with p equal to I has a better source localization ability than any of the other investigated methods and provides physiologically meaningful reconstruction results. Our evaluation results provide useful information for choosing cortical source localization approaches for future EEG/MEG studies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study was designed to assess cognitive function by comparing groups of 20 older individuals (69.20 +/- 1.3 years active group) who regularly engage in moderate physical activity with 20 subjects (66.90 +/- 1.1 years inactive group) who do comparatively little exercise. Subjects performed a somatosensory oddball task composed of pressing a button with their right foot as fast as possible following an electrical stimulus applied to the right index finger, and not responding to an electrical stimulus applied to the left index finger. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at the frontal (Fz), central (Cz), and parietal (Pz) sites according to the International 10-20 system referenced to linked earlobes. The RT was faster for the active group than for the inactive group, and the P3 amplitude of the active group was significantly larger than that of the inactive group. Moreover, the P3 amplitude for the active group was maximum at Pz and significantly larger than at Fz and Cz, but for the inactive group it was identical between Fz and Pz. The results suggest that habitual moderate exercise exerts positive influences in older adults not only on response processing, but also on cognitive processing.

We consider here the use of wavelet coefficients as features for discriminating between a person's quick and late reaction. Our motivation is the relation between the brain rhythms (certain frequency bands of the EEG signals) and a person's ongoing cognitive processes. We demonstrate that wavelet coefficients of specific EEG channels, scales and lime shifts have an enhanced discriminating, capability and present art algorithm for predicting a person's quick or late reaction in an oddball experiment. The results are compared with those acquired with equivalent time domain features and are found superior for a number of cases.

We investigated whether this accumulation is reflected in the amplitude of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by auditory stimuli with durations of 400-600 ms. In a duration discrimination paradigm, we found more negative amplitudes to physically identical stimuli when they were judged as longer than the memorized standard duration (500 ms) as compared to being classified as shorter. This sustained negativity was already developing during the first 100 ms after stimulus onset. It could not be explained as a bias to respond with a particular hand (lateralized readiness potential), but rather reflects a processing difference between the tones to be judged as shorter or longer. Our results are in line with models of time processing which assume that higher numbers of accumulated pulses of a temporal processor result in an increase in perceived duration.

Twelve subjects completed interleaved no-go-, pro-, and antitrials, whereas 64-channel electroencephalography was recorded. Principle component and distributed source analyses were used to evaluate the spatial distribution and time course of cortical activity supporting cue evaluation and response selection. By 158 ms poststimulus, visual cortex activity was lower for no-go trials than it was for both pro- and antitrials, consistent with an early sensory filter on the no-go cue. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity at 158 ms was highest during antitrials, consistent with this brain region's putative involvement in executive control. At 204 ms poststimulus, however, PFC activity was the same for pro- and antitrials, consistent with an ostensible role in response selection. PFC activity at 204 ms also was robustly inversely correlated (r = -0.75) with visual cortex activity on antitrials, perhaps indicating top-down modulation of early sensory processing that would decrease the probability of an error response. These data highlight how a distributed neural architecture supports the evaluation of stimuli and response choices.

Five min of the resting spontaneous EEG and the ER-P in an auditory oddball task were recorded at P4 site in 16 early AD patients and 16 age-matched normal subjects. EEG and ERP were analyzed to compute their 28 statistical and 2 nonlinear features as well as 88 spectral features and 10 ERP features, to make a feature pool for each 30-s segment of the recording data. The combined GA/ANN was applied to find the minimal set of the dominant features from the feature pool that are most efficient to classify into two groups automatically. The effective 35 features were found and used as inputs of the artificial neural network. The recognition rate of ANN fed by these input was 81.9% for untrained data set. These results suggest that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for early detection of AD and that single channel EEG data might be enough to recognize AD. This approach could be extended to a reliable classification system using EEG recording that can discriminate between groups. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated brain activity differences between successive maintenance and manipulation of the visual stimulus and the once transformed representations using electroencephalography (EEG) in a multi-stage sequential manipulation task. The task required the subjects to memorize a presented object which possessed four features (color, shape, direction and speed of motion) and transform the feature of the representation twice. Wavelet analysis showed strong gamma-band (> 30 Hz) activity elicited in the frontal and parietal regions during two successive mental manipulation tasks of the visual stimulus. Interestingly, gamma activity in the frontal and parietal regions was stronger during the second manipulation. Our results suggest that successive mental manipulations of the once transformed representation may impose higher demand on the fronto-parietal networks. On the other hand, while the frontal theta activity was enhanced throughout maintenance and manipulation periods, the activity during maintenance of one-time manipulated representation was higher than that of the physically presented stimulus, suggesting that the frontal regions are further recruited in maintenance of manipulated images.

As no efficient device can record hand intrinsic behaviour, it is difficult to get its neuro-physiological models of sensory-motor coordination. In this paper, we offer a system to acquire the kinematics and kinetics information of human hand movement through handwriting. Joined with human being, a Eye-Brain-Hand to Computer (EBH-C) Interaction system is presented. In this human-in-the-loop-testing system, human beings acquire image, voice or text from computer by eyes or ears then write them down. The core part of the system, named as F-Tablet (TM), is able to acquire the trajectory and three-axis forces of pen-tip directly and simultaneously. With the help of this system, we designed an experiment to evaluate the handwriting movements and forces controlling ability of different ages. Some experiment results were present. Aided with conventional analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the whole procedures of information transmitting, acquired by eyes and ears, processed by brain, outputted and actuated by hand, can be recorded.

We designed a task that required discriminating faces by their spatial configuration and, after extensive training, prosopagnosic MZ significantly improved at face identification. Event-related potential results revealed that although the N170 was not selective for faces before training, its selectivity after training was normal. fMRI demonstrated increased functional connectivity between ventral occipital temporal face-selective regions (right occipital face area and right fusiform face area) that accompanied improvement in face recognition. Several other regions showed fMRI activity changes with training; the majority of these regions increased connectivity with face-selective regions. Together, the neural mechanisms associated with face recognition improvements involved strengthening early face-selective mechanisms and increased coordination between face-selective and nonselective regions, particularly in the right hemisphere.

In childhood headaches, neurophysiological examinations are of interest for potential clinical use because they are noninvasive and are scarcely influenced by environmental factors or drug use. Electrophysiological studies in childhood headache principally explored the role of electroencephalographic (EEG) evaluations in migraine, while less evidence has been reported about other neurophysiological techniques, such as evoked potentials, event-related potentials, and, less often, transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this brief review, we point out our attention to the aid of neurophysiological methods in the clinical diagnosis of pediatric headaches. Although many examinations are actually of little value in the clinical setting, they may have a potential role in some clinical subgroups or in monitoring and evaluating the effects of pharmacological treatment.

Steady state visual-evoked potentials (ssVEPs) can be recorded using an intensity modulated stimulus, resulting in an evoked brain response at a known frequency, i.e. the stimulation frequency. Given this property, the ssVEP is ideally suited for examining the relationship between single-trial fluctuations in phase/amplitude and the evoked brain potential resulting from averaging across trials. To address this issue, the current study investigated the contribution of single trial power and intertrial phase locking to ssVEP generation by presenting a peripheral flicker. Further, transient stimuli were presented during flicker and at three increasing latency lags following flicker offset to examine (1) to what extent a stimulus can disturb the ssVEP oscillation and (2) how phase alignment during P1-N1-P2 time windows is affected during presence of evoked oscillations. The former assessment evaluates the stability of ssVEPs and the latter the phase alignment processes to transient stimuli under experimentally induced background oscillations. We observed that ssVEPs are a result of phase alignment rather than single trial amplitude modulation. In addition, ssVEP oscillations were not disturbed by transient stimuli. Finally, phase alignment in P1-N1-P2 time windows was distorted during and shortly after steady state stimulation.

Here the working hypothesis was that a specific pattern of pre- and poststimulus theta (about 4-6 Hz) and alpha (about 6-12 Hz) rhythms is differently represented during conscious compared with unconscious visuospatial processes. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data (128 channels) were recorded in normal adults during a visuospatial task. A cue stimulus appeared at the right or left (equal probability) monitor side for a "threshold time" inducing about 50% of correct recognitions. It was followed (2 s) by visual go stimuli at spatially congruent or incongruent position with reference to the cue location. Left (right) mouse button was clicked if the go stimulus appeared at the left (right) monitor side. Then, subjects said "seen" if they had detected the cue stimulus or "not seen" if missed (self-report). Sources of theta and alpha rhythms during seen and not seen EEG epochs were estimated by low-resolution electromagnetic brain topography software. Results showed that the prestimulus "low-band" (about 6-10 Hz) alpha rhythms in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas were stronger in power in the seen than in the not seen trials. After the visual stimulation, the power of the "high-band" (about 10-12 Hz) alpha rhythms in parietal and occipital areas decreased more in the seen than in the not seen trials. The present results suggest that visuospatial consciousness covary-presumably with a facilitatory effect-with the power of both pre- and poststimulus alpha rhythms.

One important stimulus property is spatial frequency (SF). Therefore, we studied the influence of SF on human alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) responses in a choice reaction task. Since real world images contain multiple SFs, an SF mixture was also examined. Event related potentials were modulated by SF around 80 and 300 ms. Evoked gamma responses were strongest for the low SF and the mixture stimulus; alpha responses were strongest for high SFs. The results link evoked and induced alpha and evoked gamma responses in human EEG to different modes of stimulus processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Components measured during wakefulness which are reflective of arousal state or the automatic switching of attention are sensitive to prior sleep disruption. Components reflecting active attentional influences during the waking state appear to be preserved in a rudimentary form during REM steep, but in a way that highlights the differences in the neurochemical environment between wakefulness and REM steep. Certain ERP components only appear within steep. These begin to emerge at NREM steep onset and may reflect inhibition of information processing and thus have utility as markers of the functional status of steep preparatory mechanisms. These large amplitude NREM components represent synchronized burst firing of large number of cortical cells and are a reflection of the nervous system's capacity to generate delta frequency EEG activity. As such they are useful in assessing the overall integrity of the nervous system in populations not showing substantial amounts of SWS as measured using traditional criteria. While requiring care in their interpretation, ERPs nonetheless provide a rich toot to investigators interested in probing the nervous system to evaluate daytime functioning in the face of steep disruption, the ability of the sleeping nervous system to monitor the external environment, and the ability of the nervous system to respond to stimuli in a manner consistent with the initiation or maintenance of steep.

The current investigation (n = 120) aimed to test recent findings in this area, namely that N100 amplitude and latency would decrease, and that P300 latency and reaction time (RT) would increase under active relative to sham exposure during an auditory task. Visual measures were also explored. A double blind, counterbalanced, crossover design was employed where subjects attended two sessions I week apart. In both sessions participants (1) performed auditory and visual oddball tasks while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded with a MP set to sham exposure mounted over the temporal region, and (2) performed the same tasks while the handset was set to active/sham. When active, the MP transmitted for 30 min at 895 MHz (average power 250 mW, pulse modulated at 217 Hz, average SAR 0.11 W/kg). Paired t-tests compared difference scores from the sham/sham session to those from the sham/active condition. The study was designed to detect differences of 1 of a standard deviation with a power of 0.80. There was no 4 significant difference between exposure conditions for any auditory or visual event related potential (ERP) component or RT. As previous positive findings were not replicated, it was concluded that there is currently no evidence that acute MP exposure affects these indices of brain activity.

There is a marked inter-individual EEG and EP variability, which reflects the state heterogeneity. Four clinical applications are described: (1) the identification of primary midbrain dysfunction-and, therefore, a possible reversibility-in post-traumatic states; (2) the identification of the permeability of sensory channels; (3) quantitative follow-up; and (4) individual assessment of cognitive functions and/or consciousness. Regarding this last issue, the loss of primary cortical EPs, although rarely observed, constitutes one major argument against consciousness. Conversely, cognitive EPs definitely proved the persistence of cognitive functions in several vegetative patients. Whether these cognitive functions are conscious or not remains a matter of debate.

In the present study, we focused on the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal working memory. We hypothesized that in performance of the tactile crossmodal working memory task, there would be sequentially discrete task-correlated neural activities representing the processes of crossmodal working memory. Scalp-recorded event-related potentials were collected from 15 electrodes in humans performing each of four tasks: tactile-tactile unimodal delayed matching-to-sample task, tactile-visual crossmodal delayed matching-to-sample task, tactile unimodal control spatial task, and tactile crossmodal control spatial task. Two positive event-related potential peaks were observed during the delay of the task. One peak (late positive component-1) was at about 330 ms after the onset of the tactile stimulus, and the other (late positive component-2) was at about 600 ms. Late positive component-1 was observed in all four tasks. There was no significant difference in late positive component-1 either between the unimodal tasks, or between the crossmodal tasks, but late positive component-1 was significantly larger in the crossmodal tasks than that in the unimodal tasks, and showed a specific pattern of larger activity over parietal areas than activity over frontal areas. Late positive component-2 was not observed in the unimodal matching task but was observed in all other three tasks over parietal areas. During the late delay (1000 ms-1500 ms), significant differences in negative potentials (late negative component) were found between the tasks. The present study shows sequential changes in event-related potentials during the retention period of working memory tasks. It indicates that in performance of a crossmodal working memory task, there are sequentially discrete to different cognitive functions, such as crossmodal transfer of information, and the working memory of the stimulus.

The idea is to shuffle the Huffman tree using an encryption key generated by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded when the user perceives a common black and white line picture. As different persons have different thought processes, the generated key is unique to each individual and hence the encryption is robust to fraudulent attacks as compared to other encryption systems. Further, as Huffman free is used to encode the data during encryption, the method achieves both compression and enciyption. This pilot study has shown the huge potential of the method as it is impossible to be compromised.	[Ravi, K. V.

A widely adopted model holds that MMN has main generators in the superior temporal planes bilaterally, which are responsible for the sensory memory part of change detection, as well as frontal lobe sources responsible for triggering an attention shift upon change detection. Whereas the temporal sources have been documented in numerous studies across species and methodologies, much less is known about the frontal sources. The present review examines the current state of the evidence for their existence, location, and possible function. It confirms that the frontal generator is still a less consistent finding in MMN research than the temporal generator. There is clear evidence from scalp EEG and, especially, current source density studies for the existence of an MMN generator that is functionally distinct from the main supratemporal generator of the MMN. Evidence from fMRI, PET, optical imaging, EEG source imaging, and lesion studies implicates mainly the inferior frontal and possibly also the medial frontal cortex. However, these results should be taken with caution because of the paucity of support from more direct measures like intracranial recordings and MEG, and the negative findings from several fMRI and PET, as well as EEG source imaging studies. Recent studies also raise questions about the exact role of the frontal generator in triggering an attention shift. Delineating the exact cortical locations of frontal MMN generators, the conditions under which they are activated and, consequently, their function, remains an acute challenge.

Previous electrophysiological and PET data indicated that some PVS patients have partially intact cortical processing functions. However, it remains unclear whether the reported patients were representative for PVS population or just some exceptional cases. Methods: Event-related brain responses to stimuli of different complexity levels, recorded in 98 patients with extremely severe diffuse brain injuries, 50 of which in PVS. Four main indicators of cortical functions were: (i) N1-P2 complex as an index of simple, undifferentiated cortical processing; (ii) mismatch negativity as an index of pre-attentive, probably unconscious, cortical orientation; (iii) P3 wave as an index of deep cortical analysis of physical stimuli, and (iv) brain responses to semantic stimuli. Results: Cortical responses were found in all PVS patients with a background EEG activity > 4 Hz. All responses investigated, including those to semantic stimuli that indicated comprehension of meaning, occurred significantly above chance, though less frequently than in patients with severe brain injuries who were conscious. Conclusions: Cortical responses were lacking in most patients with severe EEG slowing (< 4 Hz). Follow-up data revealed that the presence of a mismatch negativity, a short disease duration, and the traumatic etiology were related to a better outcome. Significance: The data show that in a subpopulation of PVS patients with preserved thalamocortical feedback connections, remaining cortical information processing is a consistent finding and may even involve semantic levels of processing.

Wavelet packet transformation is applied to extract different kinds of dynamic EEG rhythms accurately. This paper presents a wavelet packet entropy method in the processing of EEG signal. Relative wavelet packet energy and two kinds of wavelet packet entropy are calculated as the quantitative parameter to study the complexity of the EEG signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method excels the Wavelet decomposition in that it can isolate specific EEG and ERP rhythms more accurately. The proposed method is also useful for the processing of other non-stationary signals.

To this end, 19 data sets from 14 patients with prolonged bursts of focal or generalised interictal epileptiform activity lasting up to 15 s were analysed. To determine whether the inclusion of the durations of the epileptic events in the general linear model resulted in increased statistical significance of activated regions, statistical maps were generated with and without the event durations. The mean differences when including the durations were a 14.5% increase in peak t value and a 29.5% increase in volume of activation. This suggests that when analysing EEG-fMRI data from patients with prolonged bursts of interictal epileptiform activity, it is better to include the event durations. To determine whether the amplitudes and latencies of the measured responses were consistent with the general linear model, the haemodynamic response functions for bursts of different durations were calculated and compared with the model predictions. The measured amplitude of the response to the shortest duration events was consistently larger than predicted, which is consistent with studies in normal subjects. For the two data sets with the widest range of event durations, the measured amplitudes increased with the durations of the events without evidence of the plateau that was expected from the general linear model. There were no consistent differences between the measured and modelled latencies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition to their vital clinical utility.. electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the electrophysiological correlates of functional brain activation in greater detail than non-invasive recordings. The proximity of ECoG electrodes to the cortical sources of EEG activity enhances their spatial resolution, as well as their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for high-frequency EEG activity. ECoG recordings have.. therefore.. been used to study the event-related dynamics of brain oscillations in a variety of frequency ranges, and in a variety of functional-neuroanatomic systems, including somatosensory and somatomotor systems, visual and auditory perceptual systems, and cortical networks responsible for language. These ECoG studies have confirmed and extended the original non-invasive observations of ERD/ERS phenomena in lower frequencies, and have discovered novel event-related responses in gamma frequencies higher than those previously observed in non-invasive recordings. In particular, broadband event-related gamma responses greater than 60 Hz, extending up to similar to 200 Hz, have been observed in a variety of functional brain systems. The observation of these "high gamma" responses requires a recording system with an adequate sampling rate and dynamic range (we use 1000 Hz at 16-bit A/D resolution) and is facilitated by event-related time-frequency analyses of the recorded signals. The functional response properties of high-gamma activity are distinct from those of ERD/ERS phenomena in lower frequencies. In particular, the timing and spatial localization of high-gamma ERS often appear to be more specific to the putative timing and localization of functional brain activation than alpha or beta ERD/ERS. These findings are consistent with the proposed role of synchronized gamma oscillations in models of neural computation, which have in turn been inspired by observations of gamma activity in animal preparations, albeit at somewhat lower frequencies. Although ECoG recordings cannot directly measure the synchronization of action potentials among assemblies of neurons, they may demonstrate event-related interactions between gamma oscillations in macroscopic local field potentials (LFP) generated by different large-scale populations of neurons engaged by the same functional task. Indeed, preliminary studies Suggest that such interactions do occur in gamma frequencies, including high-gamma frequencies, at latencies consistent with the timing of task performance. The neuronal mechanisms underlying high-gamma activity and its unique response properties in humans are still largely unknown, but their investigation through invasive methods is expected to facilitate and expand their potential clinical and research applications, including functional brain mapping, brain-computer interfaces, and neurophysiological studies of human cognition.

BOLD responses to stimuli: Dependence on frequency, stimulus form, amplitude, and repetition rate	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BALLOON MODEL; BLOOD-FLOW; EEG; PARAMETERS; DYNAMICS	A quantitative theory is developed for the relationship between stimulus and the resulting blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI signal. The relationship of stimuli to neuronal activity during evoked responses is inferred from recent physiology-based quantitative modeling of evoked response potentials (ERPs). A hemodynamic model is then used to calculate the BOLD response to neuronal activity having the form of an impulse, a sinusoid, or an ERP-like damped sinusoid. Using the resulting equations, the BOLD response is analyzed for different forms, frequencies, and amplitudes of stimuli, in contrast with previous research, which has mostly concentrated on sustained stimuli. The BOLD frequency response is found to be closely linear in the parameter ranges of interest, with the form of a low-pass filter with a weak resonance at approximately 0.07 Hz. An improved BOLD impulse response is systematically obtained which includes initial dip and post-stimulus undershoot for some parameter ranges. It is found that the BOLD response depends strongly on the precise temporal course of the evoked neuronal activity, not just its peak value or typical amplitude. Indeed, for short stimuli, the linear BOLD response is closely proportional to the time-integrated activity change evoked by the stimulus, regardless of amplitude. It is concluded that there can be widely differing proportionalities between BOLD and peak activity, that this is the likely reason for the low level of correspondence seen experimentally between ERP sources and BOLD measurements and that non-BOLD measurements, such as ERPs, can be used to correct for this effect to obtain improved activity estimates. Finally, stimulus sequences that optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in event-related BOLD fMRI (efMRI) experiments are derived using the hemodynamic transfer function. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Genetic association of the cystatin C gene with late-onset Alzheimer disease. Arch. Neurol. 57, 1579-1583). In the present multicentric electroencephalographic (EEG) study, we analyzed the effects of CST3 haplotypes on resting cortical rhythmicity in subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with the hypothesis that sources of resting EEG rhythms are more impaired in carriers of the CST3 B haplotype than non-carriers. We enrolled a population of 84 MCI subjects (42% with the B haplotype) and 65 AD patients (40% with the B haplotype). Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in all subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results showed that the amplitude of alpha 1 (parietal, occipital, temporal areas) and alpha 2 (occipital area) was statistically lower in CST3 B carriers than noncarriers (P < 0.01). Whereas there was a trend towards statistical significance that amplitude of occipital delta sources was stronger in CST3 B carriers than in non-carriers. This was true for both MCI and AD subjects. The present findings represent the first demonstration of relationships between the AD genetic risk factor CST3 B and global neurophysiological phenotype (i.e., cortical delta and alpha rhythmicity) in MCI and AD subjects, promting future genotype - EEG phenotype studies for the early prediction of AD conversion in individual MCI subjects.

The study was conducted on twenty adults who looked at emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful) or neutral faces. The results showed that motivational significance of the stimulus can modulate the power synchronization (event-related desynchronization (ERD) decrease) within the frequency band of delta and theta. We propose that delta and theta respond to variations in processing stage of emotional face: whereas, delta reflects updating of the stimulus, theta responds to the emotional significance of face. The findings revealed that emotional discrimination by theta is observable mainly within 150-250 time interval and that it is more distributed on anterior regions, whereas delta is maximally synchronized within 250-350 interval and more posteriorly distributed for all the stimulus type. Finally, a right-hemisphere dominance was found for theta during emotional face comprehension. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

Methods: The EEG from eight patients was analysed by an automated method which detects epochs with a single underlying source having a dipolar potential distribution. The EEG with the highlighted detections was then rated by a clinical neurophysiologist (EEGer) with respect to epileptiform activity. Results: Although EEGer-marked events and computer detections often coincided, in five out of the eight patients, a substantial number of other detections were found to arise from the same area as the marked events. The morphology of a high proportion of these other detections did not resemble typical epileptiform activity and had a frequency content mainly in the delta and theta ranges. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first study to use an automated technique to demonstrate the presence of non-epileptiform activity arising from the same area as the epileptiform activity in the EEG of paediatric patients with focal epilepsy. This slow wave activity is likely to be related to the underlying epileptogenic process. Significance: This paper suggests a technique for automated detection of focal activity arising from epileptogenic foci. It also provides a new perspective on extracting clinical useful information from slow-wave background EEG activity. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Neuroimaging methods in affective neuroscience: Selected methodological issues	UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review	Symposium on Understanding Emotions	SEP, 2004	Freudental Castle, Constance, GERMANY	Heidelberg Acad Sci & Humanities, Unit Konstanz, Ctr Junior Researchers	Freudental Castle	EEG; MEG; fMRI; average reference; sensor standardization; proportional global signal scaling; SPM of EEG/MEG distributed source estimations	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HUMAN-BRAIN; AVERAGE REFERENCE; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; FLEETING IMAGES; EMOTION; EEG; POTENTIALS	A current goal of affective neuroscience is to reveal the relationship between emotion and dynamic brain activity in specific neural circuits. In humans, noninvasive neuroimaging measures are of primary interest in this endeavor. However, methodological issues, unique to each neuroimaging method, have important implications for the design of studies, interpretation of findings, and comparison across studies. With regard to event-related brain potentials, we discuss the need for dense sensor arrays to achieve reference-independent characterization of field potentials and improved estimate of cortical brain sources. Furthermore, limitations and caveats regarding sparse sensor sampling are discussed. With regard to event-related magnetic field (ERF) recordings, we outline a method to achieve magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensor standardization, which improves effects' sizes in typical neuroscientific investigations, avoids the finding of ghost effects, and facilitates comparison of MEG waveforms across studies. Focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we question the unjustified application of proportional global signal scaling in emotion research, which can greatly distort statistical findings in key structures implicated in emotional processing and possibly contributing to conflicting results in affective neuroscience fMRI studies, in particular with respect to limbic and paralimbic structures. Finally, a distributed EEG/MEG source analysis with statistical parametric mapping is outlined providing a common software platform for hemodynamic and electromagnetic neuroimaging measures. Taken together, to achieve consistent and replicable patterns of the relationship between emotion and neuroimaging measures, methodological aspects associated with the various neuroimaging techniques may be of similar importance as the definition of emotional cues and task context used to study emotion.

In this paper we examine the role that impaired rapid auditory processing (RAP) might play during early language acquisition. Using behavioral measures we have demonstrated that RAP abilities in infancy are critically linked to later language abilities for both non-speech and speech stimuli. Variance in infant RAP thresholds reliably predict language outcome at 3 years-of-age for infants at risk for LLI and control infants. We present data here describing patterns of electrocortical (EEG/ERP) activation at 6 month-of-age to the same non-verbal stimuli used in our behavioral studies. Well-defined differences were seen between infants from families with a history of LLI (FH+) and FH- controls in the amplitude of the mismatch response (MMR) as well as the latency of the N-250 component in the 70 ms ISI condition only. Smaller mismatch responses and delayed onsets of the N250 component were seen in the FH+ group. The latency differences in the N250 Component, but not the MMR amplitude variation, were significantly related to 24-month language outcome. Such converging tasks provide the opportunity to examine early precursors of LLI and allow the opportunity for earlier identification and intervention. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The translation of these EEG signals to control signals of a device is based on a good classification of various kinds of imagination. We have developed a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis approach for classifying motor imagery tasks. Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) were constructed based on wavelet decomposition and event-related (de) synchronization patterns were extracted from symmetric electrode pairs. The weighted energy difference of the electrode pairs was then compared to classify the imaginary movement. The present method has been tested in nine human subjects and reached an averaged classification rate of 78%. The simplicity of the present technique suggests that it may provide an alternative method for EEG-based BCI applications.

However, EEG signals are highly contaminated with various artifacts, both from the subject and from equipment interferences. Among these various kinds of artifacts, ocular noise is the most important one. Since many applications such as BCI require online and real-time processing of EEG signal, it is ideal if the removal of artifacts is performed in an online fashion. Recently, some methods for online ocular artifact removing have been proposed. One of these methods is ARMAX modeling of EEG signal. This method assumes that the recorded EEG signal is a combination of EOG artifacts and the background EEG. Then the background EEG is estimated via estimation of ARMAX parameters. The other recently proposed method is based on adaptive filtering. This method uses EOG signal as the reference input and subtracts EOG artifacts from recorded EEG signals. In this paper we investigate the efficiency of each method for removing of EOG artifacts. A comparison is made between these two methods. Our undertaken conclusion from this comparison is that adaptive filtering method has better results compared with the results achieved by ARMAX modeling.

Seventeen participants learned associations either between words and spatial positions or between words and faces. Each word was associated with either one or two positions or faces. In a cued recall test, one day later, participants saw two words and had to decide whether these were linked to each other via an associated spatial position or a face. Slow event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG were recorded from 61 scalp electrodes during both acquisition and recall. Response times increased monotonically with the number of faces and positions to be reactivated. Negative slow ERPs showed a comparable topography during anticipation learning and cued recall, but dissociated topographically for positions and faces. The maximum of the negativity increased when items were presented repetitively (compared to the first presentation) during learning, and also with the number of the to-be-reactivated associations during retrieval. These results are consistent with an information-processing model that assumes material-specific cortical representations of episodic memory contents, which are established as localized cortical cell assemblies during encoding, and which are being reactivated during recall.

Only when presented upright they are perceived as severely distorted. Common theories explain this effect by the loss of configural information for inverted faces. We investigated neural correlates of Thatcherization using event related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen right-handed participants performed identity classifications on Thatcherized or original familiar faces, presented either for 34 ms or 200 ms at an orientation of either 0 degrees, 90 degrees or 180 degrees. For the occipito-temporal N170, we found (1) strong non-linear effects of orientation and (2) interactions between Thatcherization and orientation: Thatcherization resulted in larger N170 for upright faces, but smaller N170 for inverted faces. The novel finding of N170 effects of Thatcherization in inverted faces suggests differences in the neural encoding of Thatcherized and original inverted faces, even though Thatcherization escapes subjective perception in inverted faces.

Using them in combination has the potential to allow imaging with the spatial resolution of fMRI and the temporal resolution of EEG. However, although considerable data are available concerning their concordance in studies involving event-related potentials (ERPs), less is known about how well they, agree in epilepsy. To this end, 17 patients were selected from a database of 57 who had undergone an EEG-fMRI scanning session followed by a separate EEG session outside of the scanner. Spatiotemporal dipole modelling was compared with the peak and closest EEG-fMRI activations and deactivations. On average, the dipoles were 58.5 mm from the voxel with the highest positive t value and 32.5 mm from the nearest activated voxel. For deactivations, the corresponding values were 60.8 and 34.0 mm. These values are considerably higher than is generally observed with ERPs, probably as a result of the relatively widespread field, which can lead to artificially deep dipoles, and the occurrence of EEG-fMRI responses remote from the presumed focus of the epileptic activity. The results suggest that EEG and MEG inverse solutions for equivalent current dipole approaches should not be strongly constrained by EEG-fMRI results in epilepsy, and that the use of distributed source modelling will be a more appropriate way of combining EEG-FMRI results with source localisation techniques.

At the behavioral level, SD resulted in a reduction of the lag (negative asynchrony) between produced forces and acoustic stimuli at higher movement tempos. Principal component analysis of the accompanying MEG activity showed that auditory- and motor-evoked fields were attenuated after SD and revealed an anterior shift of power towards more frontal channels. These results were interpreted in terms of a change of central processing of afferent sensory input due to SD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The new method shows a significant improvement in P300 detection which is a common approach in BCI systems. The proposed model uses more than one scalp electrode and combines the outputs with a fuzzy technique, to detect P300 cognitive component.

Light-headedness (coded as dizziness), seen only at higher doses, was the most common drug related adverse event. Pharmacokinetic results indicated ispronicline to be absorbed fairly rapidly, with Tmax of 1-2 hours and cleared fairly promptly, with T1/2 elimination of 5-7 hours. Data generated on Pharmaco EEG indicated ispronicline entered the brain and caused a shift in power from lower to higher frequencies, suggesting the potential for a beneficial effect on cognition.

In the present study, we tested whether feedback also modulates the organization of neuronal oscillations. Ten college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits and revised them on the basis of an exogenous performance feedback. The EEG signal time-locked to feedback was convolved with a family of complex wavelets. The time-varying spectral entropy of the resulting time-frequency representation was then computed. The results showed that feedback differentially modulated spectral organization at frontal and posterior scalp regions around 200 ms and in the 300-500 ms range. Spatio-temporal principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that feedback-specific modulations essentially resulted from the interplay between fronto-polar, fronto-central, and parieto-occipital components. Functional and methodological implications were discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our objective was to assess neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might distinguish subtypes of externalizing children from each other and from their normal age mates. Children with pure externalizing (EXT) problems were compared with children comorbid for externalizing and internalizing (MIXED) problems and with age-matched controls. Only boys were included in the analysis because so few girls were referred for treatment. We used a go/no-go task with a negative emotion induction, and we examined dense-array EEG data together with behavioral measures of performance. We investigated two event-related potential (ERP) components tapping inhibitory control or self-monitoring-the inhibitory N2 and error-related negativity (ERN)-and we constructed source models estimating their cortical generators. The MIXED children's N2s increased in response to the emotion induction, resulting in greater amplitudes than EXT children in the following trial block. ERN amplitudes were greatest for control children and smallest for EXT children with MIXED children in between, but only prior to the emotion induction. These results were paralleled by behavioral differences in respons 6 time and performance monitoring. ERP activity was localized to cortical sources suggestive of the dorsal anterior cingulate for control children, posterior cingulate areas for the EXT children, and both posterior cingulate and ventral cingulate/prefrontal regions for the MIXED children. These findings highlight different mechanisms of self-regulation underlying externalizing subtypes and point toward distinct developmental pathways and treatment strategies.

Our results reveal an early transient activation of inferotemporal cortex, which was accompanied by the onset of a sustained activation of posterior parietal cortex. We furthermore observed late transient responses in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and late sustained activity in medial frontal and premotor areas. We propose that these neural signatures reflect the cognitive stages of task processing, perceptual evaluation ( inferotemporal cortex), storage buffer operations ( posterior parietal cortex), active retrieval ( ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), and action selection ( medial frontal and premotor cortex). This is also supported by their differential temporal contribution to specific subcomponents of the P300 cognitive potential.

Some of them leave stable traces, and others fade away quickly. Recent advances in functional imaging methods allow researchers to contrast neuronal patterns of remembered against not remembered events at initial encoding. Research on young adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), intracranial, and standard electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings has identified differences between remembered and not remembered items in patterns of medio-temporal and prefrontal brain activity. However, little is known about the ways in which such neuronal patterns of successful encoding evolve across the lifespan as a function of maturation, senescence, and the accumulation of experience. Here, we first review empirical evidence on neuronal correlates of successful memory from middle childhood to old age. Based on the observation that associative and strategic components of episodic memory seem to follow different age gradients, we propose a conceptual framework for predicting age changes in neuronal patterns of successful encoding.

Visual P2 component is related to theta phase-locking	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						theta; oscillations; PLI; total power; phase-locking	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; MECHANISMS; COMPLEX; ALPHA	In this study we investigated the hypothesis whether P2-related differences tested in a visual priming paradigm are associated with theta phase-locking. We recorded the EEG from 31 electrodes and calculated phase-locking index and total power differences for frequencies between 2 and 20 Hz. ERPs (event-related potentials) were analyzed for P1, N1 and P2 components. P2 showed strongest task-related amplitude differences between congruent and incongruent targets. A source analyses was performed for the P2 component using sLoreta that revealed local generators of the P2 in parieto-occipital regions. Phase-locking analyses showed specific effects in the theta range (4-6 Hz) appearing in time windows at around the P2 component. We draw the conclusion that phase-locked theta reflect top-down regulation processes mediating information between memory systems and is in part involved in the modulation of the P2 component.

Event-related potentials time-locked to the onset of gestures and probe words were measured in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants judged the congruency between gestures and cartoons. Gestures elicited an N400-like component (gesture N450) that was larger for incongruent than congruent items, as well as a late positivity that was larger for congruent items. In Experiment 2, participants assessed the relatedness between probe words and preceding cartoon-gesture pairs. N450 effects to gestures were observed without overlapping positivity. These findings suggest that iconic gestures are subject to semantic processes analogous to those evoked by other meaningful representations, such as pictures and words.

Middle latency auditory evoked potential anaesthesia correlates of consciousness: Practicality & constraints	2005 27TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-7	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2005	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Chinese Acad Engn Sci			BISPECTRAL INDEX; AWARENESS; RESPONSES; BRAIN; DEPTH	The hypothesis of this study is that significant differentiation of consciousness (CO) and unconsciousness (UNCO) is possible, using individual ML+AEP (10-140 msec) latency measures, within the context of a practical routine clinical depth of anaesthesia monitoring device. We have assessed individual latency band measures of the middle-latency auditory evoked potential (ML+AEP) as candidates to measure depth of CO or UNCO amongst a group of anaesthetised surgical patients. We have also compared ML+AEP correlates with conventional auditory evoked potential (AEP) index and bispectral index (BIS). This study investigates amplitude measures, limits and the practicality of using a single EEG channel ML+AEP recording system. ML+AEP amplitude-related correlates were assessed against CO and UNCO events during anaesthesia. ML+AEP measures were computed for each of the following AEP component-related latency time bins (LTB): Na;15-25msec, Pa;25-35 msec, TP41;35-45 msec; Pb/P1;45-55 msec, N1;80-100 msec, < N1;0-80 msec, > N1;80-140 msec, and ML+AEP;0-140 msec. Twenty patients (aged 28-68 yrs) undergoing day surgery had their electroencephalography (EEG) monitored during binaural auditory stimulus presentation (6.8 clicks per second). The AEP grand mean waveform (AEP.,) was computed for each consecutive stimulus AEP event, by way of averaging the previous 256 AEPs. The mean and SD amplitude associated with each of the ML+AEP ranges were computed for the whole study period and also for the predetermined events 1 to 13 (CO:1;2;3;12;13 and UNCO:411). Results included BIS data, measures derived from the AEP(DA), across both the ML+AEP range (0-140 msec), and also individual LTB segments. For each respective AEP LTB the mean and SD for AEP power distribution (A-EPPD) and AEP Differential analysis (AEP(DA)) was computed. Two-sample t-tests were performed in order to test the hypothesis that AEPDA and AEP(PA) indices measured across ML+AEP LTB (during surgical procedure) present significant differences between CO and UNCO. Significant (P < 0.05) values were derived for all computed AEP LTB correlates, and also for all AEP(PD) LTB except Pa, TP41 and N1. Overall the P-values resulting from the application of the AEP(DA) method were much lower than those of the AEP(PD) method. Conclusion: While the practical limitations and constraints of AEP-based anaesthesia monitoring cannot be overlooked, individual AEP component-related correlates and particularly those related to waveform deflection or AEP Differential analysis (AEPDA) were shown to be candidates for depth of consciousness measures.

This phenomenon has raised questions and doubts about possible effects on users' brains. This literature review focuses on the human electrophysiological and neuro-metabolic effects of mobile phone (MP)related electromagnetic fields (EMFs) published in the last 10 years. To this end, all relevant papers have been reported and, subsequently, a literature selection has been carried out by taking several criteria into account, such as: blind techniques, randomization or counter-balancing of conditions and subjects, detail of exposure characteristics and the statistical analyses used. As a result, only the studies meeting the selection criteria have been described, evaluated and discussed further. The main goal of this review is to provide a clear scenario of the most reliable experiments carried out over the last decade and to offer a critical point of view in their evaluation. It is concluded that MP-EMFs may influence normal physiology through changes in cortical excitability and that in future research particular care should be dedicated to both methodological and statistical control, the most relevant criteria in this research field.

In order to do so, 12 young adults underwent two functional imaging acquisitions (EEG then fMRI). During each session, two experimental conditions were applied: a Piaget-like task with number/length interference (INT), and a reference task with number/length covariation (COV). To succeed at Piaget's numerical task, which children under the age of 7 years usually fail, the subjects had to inhibit a misleading strategy, namely, the visuospatial length-equals-number bias, a quantification heuristic that is often relevant and that continues to be used through adulthood. Behavioral data confirmed that although there was an automation in the young adult subjects as assessed by the very high number of accurate responses (> 97%), the inhibition of the "length equals number strategy" had a cognitive cost, as the reaction times were significantly higher in INT than in COV (with a difference of 230 ms). The event-related potential results acquired during the first session showed electrophysiological markers of the cognitive inhibition of the number/length interference. Indeed, the frontal N2 was greater during INT than during COV, and a P3(late)/P6 was detected only during INT. During the fMRI session, a greater activation of unimodal areas (the right middle and superior occipital cortex) and in the ventral route (the left inferior temporal cortex) was observed in INT than in COV. These results seem to indicate that when fully automated in adults, inhibition processes might take place in unimodal areas.

A time-frequency representation method was applied to EEG data in order to obtain stimulus related early evoked (phase-locked) gamma band activity (29-45 Hz) and was analyzed within a 0-150 ms time window range. Significant reduction of the early evoked gamma band response in the frontal and parietal regions during target stimulus processing was observed in HR subjects compared to LR subjects. Additionally, the HR group showed less differentiation between target and non-target stimuli in both frontal and parietal regions compared to the LR group, indicating difficulty in early stimulus processing, probably due to a dysfunctional frontoparietal attentional network. The results indicate that the deficient early evoked gamma band response may precede the development of alcoholism and could be a potential endophenotypic marker of alcoholism risk.

A group of twenty-four animals was used for assessing object recognition. In another group of eight rats, an electrode was implanted into the dorsal hippocampus to record an electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory evoked potentials (AEP). In both groups, animals were treated with saline, 0.1 mg/kg scopolamine, 0.1 mg/kg methylscopolamine, 3 mg/kg donepezil, donepezil combined with scopolamine, 0.1 mg/kg nicotine, and nicotine combined with scopolamine. Scopolamine, but not methylscopolamine, impaired object recognition. Both donepezil and nicotine reversed this impairment. The NI and N2 components of the AEP became closer to baseline after scopolamine, which was not reversed by donepezil or nicotine. Scopolamine increased the theta frequency in the EEG. When combined with donepezil, theta increased even more. Conversely, nicotine reversed the theta increment to control level. It is suggested that scopolamine caused a decrement in arousal in this study. Furthermore, the current results suggest a relation between EEG and object memory after cholinergic drug treatment. However, there was a clear dissociation between memory performance and EEG after combined treatment with drugs, which makes additional research where EEG and performance measures are co-registered imperative.

Rapid and slow brain systems of abstract and concrete words differentiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						word processing; event-related potentials; brain semantic systems; implicit and explicit brain functions; microstates analysis	CONTEXT-AVAILABILITY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; MODEL; IMAGEABILITY	Previous studies have repeatedly found that late (300-800 ms) components of event-related potentials (ERP) reflected semantic analysis, i.e. the differentiation between abstract and concrete words. However, the human brain may detect the meaning of the words much earlier. This study investigated the brain mechanisms of the processing of abstract and concrete written words in four experimental conditions: i) Simple Reading, during which volunteers were required to silently read words; ii) Simple Classification, during which volunteers were required to classify the presented word into the abstract and concrete categories; and iii) Cued and iv) Uncued Selective Classification conditions, during which subjects had to classify only the words typed in a particular colour. 19-channel EEG was recorded during the experiment from 13 subjects. The ER-P to abstract and concrete words differed not only at the late but also at early (40-100 ms) latencies in the Simple Reading and Classification conditions, as well as for the words that should not be explicitly classified in the Cued Selective Classification condition. This means that semantic analysis can occur in a manner which is both very rapid and implicit. Moreover, increasing task demands can even suppress this rapid semantic analysis. The functional microstate analysis revealed a topographical difference in response to abstract and concrete words, which indicated that at least partly distinct brain networks are involved in the processing of words during both early (implicit differentiation) and late (explicit classification) latencies.

Design: Event-related potentials to tone stimuli were compared between conditions with and without the experience of hypnagogic imagery. To control the arousal level when the tone was presented, a certain criterion named the electroencephalogram stage was used. Stimuli were presented at electroencephalogram stage 4, which was characterized by the appearance of a vertex sharp wave. Setting: Data were collected in the sleep laboratory at Hiroshima University. Participants: Eleven healthy university and graduate school students participated in the study. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Experiments were performed at night. Reaction times to tone stimuli were measured, and only trials with shorter reaction times than 5000 milliseconds were analyzed. Electroencephalograms were recorded from Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, T5 and T6. There were no differences in reaction times and electroencephalogram spectra between the conditions of with and without hypnagogic imagery. These results indicated that the arousal levels were not different between the 2 conditions. On the other hand, the N550 amplitude of the event-related potentials in the imagery condition was lower than in the no-imagery condition. Conclusions: The decrease in the N550 amplitude in the imagery condition showed that experiences of hypnagogic imagery exert some influence on the information processes of external tone stimuli. It is possible that the processing of hypnagogic imagery interferes with the processing of external stimuli, lowering the sensitivity to external stimuli.

The fMRI data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping with SPM2. LORETA was applied to grand averaged ERP data to localize intracranial sources. Statistical analysis was implemented to compare spatiotemporal activation of fMRI and EEG. The fMRI results are in accordance with EEG source localization to some extent, while part of mismatch in localization between the two methods was also observed. In the future we should apply the method for simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI to our study.

The spatial part (i.e., topography) is obtained by independent component analysis (ICA). We propose a frequency prewhitening procedure as a pre-processing step before ICA, which gives access to high frequency activity. The time-frequency part is obtained with a novel iterative procedure, which is an extension of the matching pursuit procedure. The method is evaluated on a simulated dataset presenting both low-frequency evoked potentials and high-frequency oscillatory activity. We show that the method is able to recover well both low-frequency and high-frequency simulated activities. There was however cross-talk across some recovered components due to the correlation introduced in the simulation.

Included in the study were 18 early-stage Parkinson disease patients without dementia and 17 age-matched patient controls without neurological disease. Visual inspection revealed increased amplitude, slower frequency, increased amount, and less occipital dorninancy of alpha wave in Parkinson disease patients compared with controls. Amplitude spectra calculated with fast Fourier transform revealed slower occipital lead peak frequency in Parkinson disease patients. EEG findings in Parkinson disease without dementia demonstrated statistically significant differences from controls. Increased background activities possibly contribute to a higher amplitude of P3.

In this work, an algorithm based on gradient boosting is presented, that detects event-related potentials in single electroencephalogram (EEG) trials. The algorithm is used to detect the P300 in the human EEG and to build a brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically a spelling device. Important features of the method described here are its high classification accuracy and its conceptual simplicity. The algorithm was tested with datasets recorded in our lab and one benchmark dataset from the BCI Competition 2003. The number of correctly inferred symbols with the P300 speller paradigm varied between 90% and 100%. In particular, all of the inferred symbols were correct for the BCI competition dataset.

Clinical and psychophysiological study of patients with panic attacks with or without agoraphobic disorders	ZHURNAL NEVROLOGII I PSIKHIATRII IMENI S S KORSAKOVA			Russian	Article						EEG; evoked potentials; P300; panic disorders; agoraphobia; cognitive functions	POTENTIALS	Seventy-seven patients with panic attacks (PA) with or without agoraphobic disorders and 28 healthy controls have been studied using clinico-neurological and psychological methods as well as EEG and auditory event-related evoked potentials (EP) recording. PA patients with agoraphobic disorders featured a significant decrease of density of a-rhythm power and an increase of beta-rhythm power in the right hemisphere that reflected a substantial activation of the ascending mesencephalic reticular formation. At the same time, a significant increase of G-rhythm power in temporal areas of the right hemisphere was characteristic of patients without agoraphobia that suggested reinforcement of activity of temporal-limbic structures. Patients with agoraphobia demonstrated lower P300 wave amplitude, marked disturbances of its habituation, more impaired attention and higher level of anxiety and depression as compared to those without agoraphobia.

High-resolution spatio-temporal neuronal activation in the visual oddball task: a simultaneous EEG/fMRI study	2007 JOINT MEETING OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON NONINVASIVE FUNCTIONAL SOURCE IMAGING OF THE BRAIN AND HEART AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUNCTIONAL BIOMEDICAL IMAGING			English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Meeting of the 6th Symposium on Noninvasive Functional Source Imaging of the Brain and Heart/International Conference on Functional Biomedical Imaging	OCT 12-14, 2007	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			RARE TARGET; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; ARTIFACT; STIMULI; P300	The combined use of EEG and fMRI allows for the fusion of electrophysiological and hemodynamic information in the study of human cognitive functions. In order to investigate cerebral activity during a visual oddball task, simultaneous EEG/fMRI recording from 10 healthy subjects was performed. A devoted data-analysis method based on trial-by-trial coupling of concurrent EEG and fMRI for the high-resolution spatio-temporal analysis of P300 neuronal activation was developed. Our results obtained from fMRI data showed the involvement of inferior and medial frontal gyrus, cingulated motor area, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule in the oddball task; furthermore, activations were generally right lateralized, in accordance with previous findings. Using the high temporal resolution of EEG, we could separate neuronal activations specifically related to P300 activity, and therefore study the activation timing. We found that the detection of rare targets, that is able to elicit the P300 component, stimulates a limbic-parieto-frontal circuit, with latencies ranging between 300 and 400 ms. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach might be extended to other event-related experimental paradigms, and might represent an valuable tool for a clearer understanding of the cerebral mechanisms underlying a wide range of cognitive functions.

Following an ERD that occurs shortly before and during the movement, bursts of beta oscillations (beta ERS) appear within a 1-s interval after movement offset. Such a post-movement beta ERS has been reported after voluntary hand movements, passive movements, movement imagination, and also after movements induced by functional electrical stimulation. The present study compares ERD/ERS patterns in paraplegic patients (suffering from a complete spinal cord injury) and healthy subjects during attempted (active) and passive foot movements. The aim of this work is to address the question, whether patients do have the same focal beta ERD/ERS pattern during attempted foot movement as healthy subjects do. The results showed midcentral-focused beta ERD/ERS patterns during passive, active, and imagined foot movements in healthy subjects. This is in contrast to a diffuse and broad distributed ERD/ERS pattern during attempted foot movements in patients. Only one patient showed a similar ERD/ERS pattern. Furthermore, no significant ERD/ERS patterns during passive foot movement in the group of the paraplegics could be found. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Improved test-retest reliability of 50-ms paired-click auditory gating using magneto encephalography source modeling	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory gating; reliability; source modeling; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography	P50 SUPPRESSION; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MEG; LOCALIZATION; DYSFUNCTION; EEG; METAANALYSIS	Used to study filtering abnormalities in schizophrenia, the paired-click paradigm suffers from poor test-retest reliability of the gating ratio, calculated from the P50 component of the ERP recorded at Cz approximately 50 ms following each of two stimuli. This study sought to improve reliability by assessing 50-ms gating at primary auditory cortices (PAC), the main generators of the P50 Cz component. MEG source modeling was used, taking advantage of the tangentially oriented PAC sources. Ten healthy subjects underwent three sessions, during which Cz-based and PAC-derived gating was measured. Unlike Cz P50, gating ratios at bilateral PACs achieved an intraclass coefficient of .8 or greater. Variability of gating within the same subject was also significantly smaller for bilateral PACs than for Cz P50. Paired-click gating ratio reliability can be improved by examining the individual PACs rather than composite scalp-recorded activity.

One of the primary goals of research in our laboratories is to study age-related alterations in neural mechanisms that underlie a wide range of cognitive processes so that we may generate a unifying principle of cognitive aging. Top-down modulation is the mechanism by which we enhance neural activity associated with relevant information and suppress activity for irrelevant information, thus establishing a foundation for both attention and memory processes. We use three converging technologies of human neurophysiology to study top-down modulation in aging: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Using these tools we have discovered that healthy older adults exhibit a selective inability to effectively suppress neural activity associated with distracting information and that this top-down suppression deficit is correlated with their memory impairment. We are now further characterizing the basis of these age-related alterations in top-down modulation and investigating interventions to remedy them.

The exploration of brain responses following inputs or in the context of state changes is crucial for a better understanding of the basic principles governing large-scale neuronal dynamics. State-of-the-art techniques allow EEG activity-from DC (direct current) up to high frequencies in the gamma range-to be acquired simultaneously with fMRI data. In the interleaved mode, spiking activities can also be assessed during concurrent fMRI The utilization of fMRI evidence to better constrain solutions of the inverse problem of source localization of EEG activity is an exciting possibility. Nonetheless, this approach should be applied cautiously since the degree of overlap between underlying neuronal activity sources is variable and, for the most part, unknown. The ultimate goal is to make joint inferences about the activity, dynamics, and functions by exploiting complementary information from multimodal data sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Preliminary experiments were performed on eight healthy volunteers to determine the optimal methods of presentation of visual stimuli and an off-line analysis of electroencephalography signals. Three clinical experiments were performed online on 17 healthy volunteers, 5 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 1 patient with olivopontocerebellar atrophy. First, one of four vertically aligned short expressions ("yes definitely," "yes," "no," and "don't know") was presented in a random sequence to determine the target. Second, a systematic table of SO Japanese syllables, and third, 16 pictorial symbols in four columns were presented, with each column presented at random. The target was identified by the maximum sum of the 2-5 Hz power spectrum after fast Fourier transform of averaged ERPs. A high correct response rate was obtained in the clinical experiments of almost 100% in "yes or no" and pictorial symbol paradigms using seven averaged samples. These results indicate that such devices may be used to communicate with patients who have lost all ability to interact other than directly via the brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ERPs were recorded during a standard two-tone discrimination task (oddball task). The treatment was conducted as a monotherapy during 6 weeks, with citalopram dosage of 20 mg/day. Compared to controls, patients differed significantly by the reduced P300 amplitude and the alteration of its habituation. These patients also demonstrated more pronounced anxiety, depression, autonomic dysfunction, alexithymia and attention insufficiency. High efficacy of the medication was detected in 80,7% of patients. The data obtained demonstrate disturbances of cognitive function in PD patients as well as qualitative psychoneurophysiologic differences of patients before and after the treatment which were most striking for the wave amplitude and for the alteration of its habituation. It is concluded that P300 evaluation may be used as a diagnostic tool and should be taken into account in the choice of effective therapy for PD patients.

In particular, although humans can discriminate the locations of sounds as close as 1-10 degrees apart, such resolution has not been shown in auditory cortex of humans or animals. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) event related brain potential to measure the neural response to spatial change in humans in narrow 10 degree spatial steps. Twelve participants were tested using a dense array EEG setup while watching a silent movie and ignoring the sounds. The MMN was reliably elicited by infrequent changes of spatial location of sounds in free field. The MMN amplitude was linearly related to the degree of spatial change with a resolution of at least 10 degrees. These electrophysiological responses occurred within a window of 100-200 milliseconds from stimulus onset, and were localized to the posterior superior temporal gyrus. We conclude that azimuthal spatial displacement is rapidly, accurately and automatically represented in auditory sensory memory in humans, at the level of the auditory cortex.

Successful stops have been associated with event-related potentials (ERPs) featuring a larger frontocentral positivity relative to failed stops. The functional interpretation of this stop-P3 has been disputed, because stop-ERPs are distorted by overlap from ERPs elicited by preceding go-stimuli. We effectively removed confounding potentials with the,adjacent response filter method (ADJAR)'. Confirming an interpretation in terms of response inhibition, the stop-P3 remained and overlap removal resulted in a more anterior distribution. As a new finding, the NI was larger on trials with successful stops, which suggests that inhibitory performance at least partly depended on the ability to switch attention to the stop-signal. Finally, the parietal P3 tended to peak earlier for successful than for failed stops.

Through repetitive practice, such stimulus-response associations can be learned and performed automatically. The aim of the present EEG study was the illustration of learning dependent modifications in neuronal pathways during short-term practice of visuomotor associations. Participants performed a visuomotor association task including four visual stimuli, which should be associated with four keys, learned by trial and error. We assumed that distinct cognitive processes might be dominant during early learning e.g., visual perception and decision making. Advanced learning, however, might be indicated by increased neuronal activation in integration- and memory-related regions. For assessment of learning progress, visual- and movement-related brain potentials were measured and compared between three learning stages (early, intermediate, and late). The results have revealed significant differences between the learning stages during distinct time intervals. Related to visual stimulus presentation, Low Resolution Electromagnetic Brain Tomography (LORETA) revealed strong neuronal activation in a parieto-prefrontal network in time intervals between 100-400 ms post event and during early learning. In relation to the motor response neuronal activation was significantly increased during intermediate compared to early learning. Prior to the motor response (120-360 ms pre event), neuronal activation was detected in the cingulate motor area and the right dorsal premotor cortex. Subsequent to the motor response (68-430 ms post event) there was an increase in neuronal activation in visuomotor- and memory-related areas including parietal cortex, SMA, premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parahippocampal cortex. The present study has shown specific time elements of a visuomotor-memory-related network, which might support learning progress during visuornotor association learning.

The application is based on the event-related potential called P300 to perform button selections on media and communication programs such as the mp3 player, video player, photo gallery and e-book. One of the key issues in such system is the usability. We study how various tasks affect the application operation, in particular, how typical mental activities cause false trigger during the operation of the application. We study the false acceptance rate under the conditions of closing eyes, reading a book, listening to music and watching a video. Data from 5 subjects is used to obtain the false rejection rate and false acceptance rate of the BCI system. Our study shows that different mental activities show different impacts on the false acceptance performances.

Application of a hybrid wavelet feature selection method in the design of a self-paced brain interface system	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; BCI; IMAGINATION; FILTER; RHYTHM	Background: Recently, successful applications of the discrete wavelet transform have been reported in brain interface ( BI) systems with one or two EEG channels. For a multi-channel BI system, however, the high dimensionality of the generated wavelet features space poses a challenging problem. Methods: In this paper, a feature selection method that effectively reduces the dimensionality of the feature space of a multi-channel, self-paced BI system is proposed. The proposed method uses a two-stage feature selection scheme to select the most suitable movement-related potential features from the feature space. The first stage employs mutual information to filter out the least discriminant features, resulting in a reduced feature space. Then a genetic algorithm is applied to the reduced feature space to further reduce its dimensionality and select the best set of features. Results: An offline analysis of the EEG signals ( 18 bipolar EEG channels) of four able-bodied subjects showed that the proposed method acquires low false positive rates at a reasonably high true positive rate. The results also show that features selected from different channels varied considerably from one subject to another. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method effectively reduces the high dimensionality of the feature space. The variability in features among subjects indicates that a user-customized BI system needs to be developed for individual users.

Here, adults with attention-deficit/hype ractivity disorder-inattentive type, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type and controls performed a simple reaction time laterality task (the Poffenberger) during 128-channel electroencephalography recording. Visual-evoked potentials were used to calculate interhemispheric transfer times. As expected for controls, mean right-to-left transfer time was faster than mean left-to-right transfer. No significant asymmetry was, however, found for clinical groups. Compared with controls, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined participants demonstrated significantly faster left-to-right transfer, whereas attention-cleficit/hyperactivity disorder-inattentive participants had significantly slower right-to-left transfer. These findings support the existence of functional differences between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subtypes, and suggest that the right hemisphere dysfunction theory of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may only be applicable to those without hyperactive symptoms.

Two mechanisms (additive activity and phase reset) have been debated and considered as the only possible explanations for evoked responses. Here we present theoretical and empirical evidence of a third mechanism contributing to the generation of evoked responses. Interestingly, this mechanism can be deduced entirely from the characteristics of spontaneous oscillations in the absence of stimuli. We show that the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal alpha oscillations at rest are associated with changes in the mean value of ongoing activity in magnetoencephalography, a phenomenon that we term baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations. When stimuli modulate the amplitude of alpha oscillations, baseline shifts become the basis of a novel mechanism for the generation of evoked responses; the averaging of several trials leads to a cancellation of the oscillatory component but the baseline shift remains, which gives rise to an evoked response. We propose that the presence of baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations can be explained by the asymmetric flow of inward and outward neuronal currents related to the generation of alpha oscillations. Our findings are relevant to the vast majority of electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic studies involving perceptual, cognitive and motor activity.

They appear to reflect movement control mechanisms, which remain partially unclear. With the aim of better understanding their sources and significance, we recorded MRCPs and sensorimotor rhythms during and after self-paced movement using intracerebral electrodes in eight epileptic subjects investigated by stereoelectroencephalography. The results showed that: (i) there is a strong spatial relationship between the late components of movement - the so-called motor potential (MP) and post-movement complex (PMc) - and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) within the 40-60 Hz band, as the MP/PMc always occurred in contacts displaying gamma ERS (the primary sensorimotor areas), whereas mu and beta reactivities were more diffuse; and (ii) MPs and PMc are both generated by the primary motor and somatosensory areas, but with distinct sources. Hence, this could mean that kinesthesic sensory afferences project to neurons other than those firing during the pyramidal tract volley. The PMc and low gamma ERS represent two electrophysiological facets of kinesthesic feedback from the joints and muscles involved in the movement to the sensorimotor cortex. It could be suggested that gamma oscillations within the 40-60 Hz band could serve to synchronize the activities of the various neuronal populations involved in control of the ongoing movement.

The characteristics of these brain signals, such as latency, location, strength, and variation, can give useful insights of the person's condition. In particular, the signals' characteristics can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of some specific psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia of various stages, and can be a useful factor for their treatment. In this paper we employ a new filtering algorithm, incorporating prior knowledge of the shape of such components. Then we employ a novel localization algorithm to track the location of the P300 components trial by trial.

NFB was given in twenty 30-min sessions to 11 LD children to reduce their abnormally high theta/alpha ratios (Experimental Group). Another five LD children with the same characteristics received a placebo treatment (Control Group). In the Control Group no changes in behavior or EEG current source were observed. In the Experimental Group, immediately after treatment children showed behavioral and cognitive improvements, but current source analysis showed few modifications; however, 2 months after treatment many changes occurred: a decrease in current of frequencies within the theta band, mainly in left frontal and cingulate regions, and enhancement in current of frequencies within the alpha band, principally in the right temporal lobe and right frontal regions, and of frequencies within the beta band, mainly in left temporal, right frontal and cingulate cortex regions. In conclusion, NFB is a possibly efficacious treatment for LD children with an abnormally high theta/alpha ratio in any lead. The changes observed in EEG current sources may reflect the neurophysiological bases of the improvement that children experienced in their behavioral and cognitive activities.

In order to investigate the viability of nonlinear approaches in EEG detection and assess the performance comparison, we applied three classifiers (linear logistic regression model, Laplacian classifier, and spectral maximum mutual information projection) in the detection tasks. The EEG was recorded using 32 electrodes during the rapid image presentation (50ms/100ms per image). Subjects were instructed to push a button when they recognize a target image. The results suggest that while the detection of single trial EEG-based recognition is possible, taking advantage of the nonlinear techniques requires data representation that would overcome the non-stationarity of the EEG signals.

Many experimental protocols concerning specific EEG frequencies have been introduced and NF has been successfully applied to various clinical practices including epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcoholic abuse, etc. In addition to clinical application, NF has also contributed to research of the EEG such as the introduction of sensorimotor rhythm. In our previous works, a portable NF system had been developed, which consists of a portable EEG amplifier, a headband with dry electrodes placed on Fp1 and Fp2 sites, and various types of training programs such as car-racing, arrow-shooting, meditation, etc. And an EEG-analysis program based on time-frequency analysis had also been developed for evaluating performance of NF training. Especially, eight quotients, designated as brain quotients, play an important role in evaluation process, which characterize behaviors of EEG rhythms effectively. In this work, we extended the previous one to nonlinear dynamical analysis of the EEG for a better evaluation of the effect of NF training on brain functions. For this purpose, we calculated the correlation dimension (CD) and the Lyapunov exponent (LE) indicating the complexity and the level of chaos of the EEG, respectively. We obtained distributions of CD and LE for age groups from 10s to 60s and correlations between the nonlinear and the linear (brain quotients) coefficients. We also discussed reliability of our portable EEG measurement system by comparing with a generally used system. Finally, we suggested a proper index reflecting attention by considering event-related potential components, alpha rhythm, and sensorimotor rhythm.

The P3 (P300) response was evoked using a three-stimulus visual oddball paradigm and a phenotype that relates to the energy in the theta band (4-5 Hz) was analyzed. Studies have shown that similar electrophysiological measures represent cognitive correlates of attention, working memory, and response selection; a role has been suggested for the ascending cholinergic pathway in the same functions. The results of our genetic association tests, combined with knowledge regarding the presence of presynaptic cholinergic M2 autoreceptors in the basal forebrain, indicate that the cognitive processes required by the experiment may in part be mediated by inhibitory neural networks. These findings underscore the utility of electrophysiology and neurogenetics in the understanding of cognitive function and the study of brain-related disorders.

As reported earlier, our experiments demonstrate that very high information transfer rates can be achieved using the readiness potential (RP) when predicting the laterality of upcoming left-versus right-hand movements in healthy subjects. A more recent study showed that the RP similarily accompanies phantom movements in arm amputees, but the signal strength decreases with longer loss of the limb. In a complementary approach, oscillatory features are used to discriminate imagined movements (left hand versus right hand versus foot). In a recent feedback study with six healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control, three subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm), and further two subjects above 24 and 15 bpm, while one subject could not achieve any BCI control. These results are encouraging for an EEG-based BCI system in untrained subjects that is independent of peripheral nervous system activity and does not rely on evoked potentials even when compared to results with very well-trained subjects operating other BCI systems.

The recent expanding research on auditory cortical event-retated potentials (AERPs) for assessing sound discrimination abilities in children and infants has indicated that several methodological issues need to be addressed before it can be implemented in clinical practice. Latencies, polarities, and amplitudes of the responses change with gestational age and during infancy. Thus, the maturation of the infant must be considered when designing stimulus paradigms and interpreting the responses. Of healthy newborn infants, only about 80% will show mismatch negativity, the automatic change detection of the auditory stimuli. Currently, the AERP method cannot be applied in clinical practice in the neonatal period, although the findings in healthy newborns at risk for dyslexia are promising. Further research will elucidate the possibility of developing AERPs as a possible early screening method during infancy for later dyslexia or cognitive dysfunction.

Specific cue reactivity on computer game-related cues in excessive gamers	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cue reactivity; computer game addiction; EEG; late positive complex	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS	It has been posited that excessive computer game playing behavior, referred to as computer game addiction, meets criteria that have been internationally established to define drug addiction. Nevertheless, there have been no psychophysiological investigations of the underlying mechanisms available to support the characterization of excessive computer gaining as behavioral addiction. To investigate whether excessive computer gaming parallels learning processes in development and maintenance (which are assumed to underlie drug addiction), the authors obtained a psychophysiological assessment of the (learned) emotional processing of computer game-relevant and -irrelevant cues. For this purpose, electroencephalographic recordings in excessive and casual computer game players were conducted. Significant between-group differences in event-related potentials evoked by computer game related-cues were found at parietal regions and point to an increased emotional processing of these cues in excessive pathological players compared with casual players. These results are in concordance with the suggestion that addiction is characterized and maintained through sensitization of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system along with incentive salience of specific addiction-associated cues.

J	Jacques, C; d'Arripe, O; Rossion, B				Jacques, Corentin; d'Arripe, Olivier; Rossion, Bruno			The time course of the inversion effect during individual face discrimination	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						EEG; ERP; face processing; inversion effect; N170; adaptation	VISUAL-ADAPTATION; INVERTED FACES; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; REPETITION; COMPONENT; ACCOUNT; BRAIN; SPEED	Human faces look more similar to each other when they are presented upside down, leading to an increase in error rate and response time during individual face discrimination tasks. This face inversion effect ( FIE) is one of the most robust findings in the face processing literature. Recent neuroimaging studies using adaptation to face identity have shown that the "fusiform face area" was the primary neural source of the behavioral FIE. However, the time course of the FIE, that is, when inversion affects the coding of facial identity in the human brain, remains unclear. Here, we addressed this question by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) on the scalp during an adaptation paradigm with upright and inverted faces. Subjects were presented first with an adapting face stimulus for 3,000 ms, followed by a second face of either the same identity or a different identity. Starting at about 160 ms after stimulus onset, the ERP response to the second face stimulus was markedly reduced over occipitotemporal electrode sites when it was identical to the adapting face, during the N170 time window. When the exact same stimuli were presented upside down, the reduction of signal was smaller and took place about 30 ms later, in line with the behavioral effect of inversion. This result shows that face inversion affects the early encoding of face identity in the occipitotemporal cortex at about 160 ms. Because inversion is known to disrupt massively the integration of facial features, these observations provide indirect evidence that individual faces are processed holistically as early as 160 ms after stimulus onset.

The power in the beta band (13-25 Hz) decreases during preparation and execution of movement, but during recovery it reaches a level higher than that in the reference period (not affected by the event). These effects are known as event-related beta desynchronization and beta rebound. The power in the gamma band (> 30 Hz) increases significantly just before the onset of the movement. This effect is known as event-related gamma synchronization. There are numerous observations concerning these effects but the underlying physiological mechanisms and functional role are not clear. We propose a lumped computational model of a cortical circuit. The model consists only of a pyramidal and an interneuronal population. Each population represents averaged properties of constituting neurons. The output of the model represents a local field potential, with a power spectrum peak either in the beta or in the gamma band. The model elucidates the mechanisms of transition between slower and faster rhythms, gamma synchronization and beta desynchronization and rebound effects. The sufficient conditions to observe the effects in the model are changes of the external excitation level and of the connection strength between excitatory and inhibitory populations attributed to short-time plasticity. The present model presents the role of the pyramidal neurons to interneuron connection in the oscillatory behavior of the two populations. We conclude that the pronounced facilitation of the pyramidal to fast spiking interneuron connections, initiated by robust excitation of the motor cortex neurons, may be essential for the effect of beta rebound. Further experiments concerning short-time plasticity during behavioral tasks would be of great value in studies of functional local cortical circuits. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stimuli were of three types: pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. A three-phase pattern was found. The first phase, an amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli higher than to neutral and pleasant stimuli, was produced at 160 ms after stimulus onset, the prefrontal cortex being the origin of this phase. The second phase, characterized by maximal amplitudes in response to positive stimuli, was produced at 400 ms, originating in the visual cortex. Finally, the third phase, another amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli, was produced at 680 ms, and its source was located in the left precentral gyrus. Present data show that the cortical response to sustained emotional visual stimulation presented within indirect tasks provides information on attention-, motivation- and motor-related biases that complement information obtained under other experimental conditions.

Thus, these models challenge holistic views of number representation as well as traditional accounts of the classical problem size effect in simple arithmetic (i.e. the finding that large problems are answered slower and less accurate than small problems). Empirical data supporting this view are still scarce. Methods: Data of 24 participants who performed a multiplication verification task with Arabic digits (e.g. 8 x 4 = 36 - true or false?) are reported. Behavioral (i.e. RT and errors) and EEG (i.e. ERP) measures were recorded in parallel. Results: We provide evidence for neighborhood-consistency effects in the verification of simple multiplication problems (e.g. 8 x 4). Behaviorally, we find that decade-consistent lures, which share their decade digit with the correct result (e.g. 36), are harder to reject than matched inconsistent lures, which differ in both digits from the correct result (e.g. 28). This neighborhood consistency effect in product verification is similar to recent observations in the production of multiplication results. With respect to event-related potentials we find significant differences for consistent compared to inconsistent lures in the N400 (increased negativity) and Late Positive Component (reduced positivity). In this respect consistency effects in our paradigm resemble lexico-semantic effects earlier found in simple arithmetic and in orthographic input processing. Conclusion: Our data suggest that neighborhood consistency effects in simple multiplication stem at least partly from central (lexico-semantic') stages of processing. These results are compatible with current models on the representation of simple multiplication facts - in particular with the Interacting Neighbors Model - and with the notion of decomposed representations of two-digit numbers in general.

It has long been known that cortical activity begins to increase up to 2 s prior to voluntary self-initiated movement. This increasing premovement activity measured in EEG is known as the Bereitschaftspotential or readiness potential. Modern functional brain imaging methods, using event-related and time-resolved functional MRI techniques, are beginning to reveal the role of the SMA, and in particular the more anterior pre-SMA, in premovement activity associated with the readiness for action. In this paper we review recent studies using event-related time-resolved fMRI methods to examine the time-course of activation changes within the SMA throughout the preparation, readiness and execution of action. These studies suggest that the preSMA plays a common role in encoding or representing actions prior to our own voluntary self-initiated movements, during motor imagery, and from the observation of others' actions. We suggest that the pre-SMA generates and encodes motor representations which are then maintained in readiness for action. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To increase the technique's clinical potential, it is important to consider ways of optimising the yield of each experiment while minimizing the risk of false-positive activation. Head motion can lead to severe image degradation and result in false-positive activation and is usually worse in patients than in healthy subjects. We performed general linear model fMRI data analysis on simultaneous EEG-fmRI data acquired in 34 cases with focal epilepsy. Signal changes associated with large inter-scan motion events (head jerks) were modelled using modified design matrices that include 'scan nulling' regressors. We evaluated the efficacy of this approach by mapping the proportion of the brain for which F-tests across the additional regressors were significant. In 95% of cases, there was a significant effect of motion in 50% of the brain or greater; for the scan nulling effect, the proportion was 36%; this effect was predominantly in the neocortex. We conclude that careful consideration of the motion-related effects in fMRI studies of patients with epilepsy is essential and that the proposed approach can be effective. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between subjective impulsivity, theta/beta EEG ratio, and inhibitory control in healthy individuals. In 15 high and 14 low impulsive healthy volunteers (as assessed by the 17 questionnaire), resting state EEG was recorded during an eyes open condition to obtain estimates for theta and beta activity. Subsequently, a stop-signal task was presented where participants responded to go-signals and had to stop their initiated response to stop-signals. Stopping performance and EEG activity were compared between the impulsive groups as well as between high vs. low theta/beta ratio groups. Results showed that subjective impulsivity was not related to stopping behavior or to theta/beta ratio. In contrast to our expectations that individuals with high theta/beta ratios would show relatively long stopping reaction times, analyses revealed that the low theta/beta ratio group had longer stopping reaction times. Given that increased theta/beta ratio may reflect reduced cortical inhibition over subcortical drives, it is proposed that healthy individuals with relative high theta/beta ratios are more motivated to maximize inhibition-related performance.

Behavioural and ERP indices of response inhibition during a Stop-signal task in children with two subtypes of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						AD/HD; subtypes; children; ERP; response inhibition; stop signal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; MOTOR CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; ADHD; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENT; MODEL; BOYS	Previous research has shown that children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder of the Combined Type (AD/HDcom) have problems with response inhibition, with poorer task performance and atypical inhibition-related ERPs relative to control subjects, while little is known about response inhibition in children with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder of the Predominantly Inattentive Type (AD/HDin). In this study children with AD/HDin (N = 12), AD/HDcom (N = 13) and age-matched controls (N = 13) aged between 8 and 14 years completed a Stop-signal task, with visual Go and auditory Stop-signal stimuli, while EEG was recorded. The results indicated that the groups did not differ on any inhibitory task performance measure, but the AD/HD groups showed more errors of omission to Go stimuli than controls. ERPs to the visual Go stimuli differed between children with AD/HD in and controls (increased central N1 and N2, decreased central P2 and increased parietal P3), while the AD/HDcom group showed only minor scalp distribution differences for N2 and P3. The AD/HDin group showed amplitude differences from controls to Stop signals (larger central N I and parietal P3; reduced midline N2) and did not show a Successful vs. Failed inhibition effect for P3. The AD/HDcom group showed reduced parietal P3 to Stop signals, with the Trial Type effect present for N2 but not P3. These data suggest that the apparent atypical inhibitory processing at N2 and P3 may stem, at least in part, from atypical early sensory/alerting processing of all stimuli in children with AD/HDin.

As there are no consistent structural disturbances, clinical neurophysiology methods seem particularly suited to study its pathophysiology. This chapter will focus on a review of neurophysiological studies that have provided an insight into migraine pathogenesis. The results are in part contradictory, which may be due to the methodology, patient selection or timing of study. Nonetheless, quantitative electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings during migraine attacks provide strong, though indirect, evidence favouring the occurrence of spreading cortical depression during attacks of migraine with, and possibly without, aura. Evoked cortical potential and nociceptive blink reflex studies demonstrate that lack of habituation during repetitive stimulation is a reproducible CNS dysfunction interictally in both migraine with and without aura. Transcranial magnetic stimulations show excitability changes of the visual cortex. The interictal migrainous CNS dysfunction is likely to play a role in migraine pathogenesis, has a familial character and undergoes periodic modulations with quasi-normalisation just before, during an attack and after treatment with certain prophylactic agents. In addition, neurophysiological methods have revealed subclinical abnormalities of cerebellar function and neuromuscular transmission, which may improve phenotyping of migraineurs for genetic and therapeutic studies.

Recently, the wavelet-based coherence is suggested for this purpose due to that it can capture the time-varying characteristics of signals from which the Fourier transform would suffer. However, the quantitative comparison between Fourier- and wavelet-based coherence is less addressed. In this paper we used simulated signals under various signal-to-noise ratios and real evoked electrophysiological signals to assess the coherence estimation of these two methods. Our results showed that Fourier-based coherence is more affected by the Guassian noise than wavelet-based coherence, in particular at the frequency band of 18-50 Hz.

Six subjects performed voluntary finger movements while DC coupled EEG was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) averaged on the movements were analysed both before and after independent component analysis (ICA) combined with dipole source analysis (DSA) of the independent components. Both a simple topographic analysis of undecomposed ERPs and the ICA/DSA analysis suggested that the original hypothesis was inadequate. The major departure from its predictions was that, while activity over many brain regions did appear at the expected times, it also appeared at unexpected times. Overall, the results suggest that the neuroscientific 'standard model', in which neural activity occurs sequentially in a series of discrete local areas each specialized for a particular function, may reflect the true situation less well than models in which large areas of brain shift simultaneously into and out of common activity states.

Methods: The method of the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) is a frequency-domain approach, based on a multivariate autoregressive modeling of time series and on the concept of Granger causality. Since the spreading of the potential from the cortex to the sensors makes it difficult to infer the relation between the spatial patterns on the sensor space and those on the cortical sites, we propose the use of the DTF method on cortical signals estimated from high resolution EEG recordings, which exhibit a higher spatial resolution than conventional cerebral electromagnetic measures. The simulation study was followed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results obtained for different levels of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and temporal length, as they have been systematically imposed on simulated signals. The whole methodology was then applied to high resolution EEG data recorded during a visually paced finger movement. Results: The statistical analysis performed returns that during simulations, DTF is able to estimate correctly the imposed connectivity patterns under reasonable operative conditions, i.e. when data exhibit a SNR of at least 3 and a length of at least 75 s of non-consecutive recordings at 64 Hz of sampling rate, equivalent, more generally, to 4800 data samples. Conclusions: Functional connectivity patterns of cortical activity can be effectively estimated under general conditions met in any practical EEG recordings, by combining high resolution EEG techniques, linear inverse estimation and the DTF method. Significance: The estimation of cortical connectivity can be performed not only with hemodynamic measurements, by using functional MRI recordings, but also with modem EEG recordings treated with advanced computational techniques.

Sixteen physicians recruited from the university hospitals participated in the study. Each participant served as his own control. All participants underwent two test sessions including the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), and the Continuous Attention Test (CAT). The CAT items were used as stimuli in event-related potential (ERP) recordings. EEG was recorded from 21 electrodes, according to the international 10-20 system. The sources of bioelectrical activity were computed with low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Estimated sleep time was significantly shorter on nights spent on duty than on nights of normal sleep at home. Sleep loss resulted in significant increase in SSS and BDI scoring, and impairment of immediate recall. Performance on the CAT remained relatively intact. Under the sleep loss condition compared to baseline, significant differences in brain activity occurred only for targets. Within the P I time frame, sleep loss led to greater activation in the right Brodmann's area 9/10. For the N1 component, significant differences were localized on the lateral surface of the right frontal lobe, in Brodmann's areas 8 and 9. No significant effects of sleep deprivation on the P3 component were found. Our results are consistent with earlier data indicating that increased activation of the prefrontal cortex allows the maintainance of performance during periods of sleep loss.

J	Lange, K; Braun, C; Godde, B				Lange, K; Braun, C; Godde, B			Coordinate processing during the left-to-right hand transfer investigated by EEG	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						coordinate transformation; intermanual transfer; inter-hemispheric projection; EEG; coherence; motor learning	EVENT-RELATED COHERENCE; INTERMANUAL TRANSFER; ASYMMETRICAL TRANSFER; INTERLIMB TRANSFER; REPRESENTATION; DYNAMICS; TRANSFORMATIONS; MOVEMENTS; TARGETS; MEMORY	Information about visuomotor tasks is coded in extrinsic, object-centered and intrinsic, body-related coordinates. For the reproduction of a trained task in mirror orientation with the opposite untrained hand, acquired extrinsic coordinates must be transformed. In contrast, intrinsic coordinates have to be modified during the execution of the originally oriented task. As shown recently, processes of coordinate transformations during the right-to-left hand transfer are associated with movement preparation and occur preferentially in the left hemisphere. Here, movement-related potentials, EEG power, and EEG coherence were recorded during the repetition of a drawing task previously trained by the nondominant left hand (Learned-task) and its execution in original and mirror orientation by the right hand (Normal- and Mirror-task). To identify EEG correlates of coordinate processing during intermanual transfer rather than effects due to the use of the right versus left hand, only those EEG data were analyzed which differed between the Normal- and Mirror-tasks. Whereas the Normal-task did not differ from the Learned-task in any of these predefined EEG parameters, beta coherence increased in the Mirror-task in the period ranging from 1 to 2 s after movement onset. These increases were especially prominent between hemispheres but were also observed symmetrically in the parieto-frontal electrode pairs of both hemispheres. Behavioral data revealed that the performance in the Learned- and both transfer tasks improved after left-hand training. Results of the present study indicate that coordinate transformation during the left-to-right hand transfer occurs in the phase of movement execution and affects predominantly extrinsic coordinates. Intrinsic coordinates are presumably mainly used in their original form. The modification of extrinsic coordinates is accompanied by increased information flow between both hemispheres; thereby inter-hemispheric connections-as mediated via the corpus callosum-seem to play a central role.

While the measurement of ERPs in a laboratory setting and classifying those ERPs is trivial, such a task presents major challenges in a "real world" setting where the EEG signals are recorded when subjects freely move their eyes and the sensory inputs are continuously, as opposed to discretely presented. Here we demonstrate that with the aid of second-order blind identification (SOBI), a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm: (1) we can extract ERPs from such challenging data sets; (2) we were able to obtain meaningful single-trial ERPs in addition to averaged ERPs; and (3) we were able to estimate the spatial origins of these ERPs. Finally, using back-propagation neural networks as classifiers, we show that these single-trial ERPs from specific brain regions can be used to determine moment-to-moment changes in cognitive processing load during a complex "real world" task.

Specifically, we sought evidence for a contralaterally dominant component of the beta ERD that is limited to trials in which motor selection is possible prior to any imperative cue to move, with attendant behavioural advantage. Methods: We measured reaction time and assessed the lateralization of beta ERD in 12 healthy volunteers as they performed pre-cued choice reaction time tasks, in which warning S1 cues were either fully predictive about the laterality of a subsequent imperative S2 signal or provided no laterality information. We calculated 'lateralized ERD index' (LERDI), a parallel measure to the lateralized readiness potential in the time domain. Results: Trials with 100% S1-S2 congruency produced significantly shorter reaction times than trials with 50% S1-S2 congruency, where laterality information was unreliable. Beta LERDI indicated significantly greater lateralisation of the ERD in the warning-go interval and of event-related synchronization (ERS) following movement in the 100% condition than in the 50% condition. The lateralization of the beta ERD with respect to hand persisted, even when subjects were instructed to make movements of opposite laterality to those prompted. Conclusions: Lateralized EEG changes occur in the beta band in the S1-S2 interval prior to movement, but only when informative warning cues allow early motor selection, as suggested by the shortening of reaction time. Furthermore, the enhanced contralateral ERS with 100% S1-S2 congruency suggests that this phenomenon is at least partly independent of afferent feedback, as the same movement was made in the 100 and 50% conditions. Significance: Lateralized suppression of beta power prior to externally generated movements is associated with motor selection. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Synchronization in the alpha frequency range is taken to be a marker of cognitive inactivity, active inhibition of sensory information, or a means of inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas. Here we propose all alternative interpretation which posits that higher alpha power during reference interval signifies higher readiness of alpha system to information processing. Predictions derived from the inhibition and alertness hypotheses were tested during presentation of acoustic stimuli (tone 1000 Hz) and neutral words to 30 males (18-25 years) with different levels of trait anxiety. Oil the whole, predictions derived from the inhibition theory were not confirmed and findings more corresponded to the alertness hypothesis. High-anxiety subjects showed higher alpha power during reference interval simultaneously with higher magnitude of event-related desynchronization and higher amplitude of phase-locked alpha responses. These findings are discussed in terms of functional significance of alpha band synchronization and desynchronization. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Holle, H; Gunter, TC				Holle, Henning; Gunter, Thomas C.			The role of iconic gestures in speech disambiguation: ERP evidence	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CONVERSATIONAL HAND GESTURES; LEXICAL AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC INFORMATION; CONTEXT; COMPREHENSION; ACTIVATION; DOMINANCE; MEANINGS; MEMORY	The present series of experiments explored the extent to which iconic gestures convey information not found in speech. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded as participants watched videos of a person gesturing and speaking simultaneously. The experimental sentences contained an unbalanced homonym in the initial part of the sentence (e.g.,She controlled The ball...) and were disambiguated at a target word in the subsequent clause (which during the game ... vs. which during the dance ...). Coincident with the initial part of the sentence, the speaker produced an iconic gesture which supported either the dominant or the Subordinate meaning. Event-related potentials were tirne-locked to the onset of the tat-get word. in Experiment I., participants were explicitly asked to judge the congruency between the initial homonym-gesture combination and the Subsequent tat-get word. The N400 at tat-get words was found to be smaller after a congruent gesture and larger after an incongruent gesture, suggesting that listeners can use gestural information to disambiguate speech. Experiment 2 replicated the results using a less explicit task, indicating that the disambiguating effect of gesture is somewhat task-independent. Unrelated grooming movements were added to the paradigm in Experiment 3. The N400 at subordinate targets was found to be smaller after subordinate gestures and larger after dominant gestures as well as grooming, indicating that an iconic gesture can facilitate the processing of a lesser frequent Word meaning. The N400 at dominant targets no longer varied as a function of the preceding gesture in Experiment 3, suggesting that the addition of meaningless movements weakened the impact of gesture. Thus, the integration of gesture and speech in comprehension does not appear to be an obligatory process but is modulated by situational factors such as the amount of observed meaningful hand movements.

Using a measure of phase-ordered beta and gamma EEG oscillations in response to painful electric stimulation, we recently found that somatosensory event-related phase-ordered gamma oscillations (38-42 Hz), elicited by the onset of painful stimuli over Cz scalp site, were linearly related to pain perception. In the present study, 38 subjects were engaged in a painful stimulus detection task using an oddball paradigm. This task was performed under a condition in which subjects were required simply to count the number of target stimuli (pain condition) and under another condition in which subjects were required to produce an obstructive mental imagery of painful stimulus perception (obstructive imagery). Only EEG responses to standard stimuli were analyzed in this study. Correlation analysis of sweeps for each individual revealed brief intervals of phase ordering of EEG patterns in the beta and gamma bands. The frequencies of interest were the betal (26-30 Hz), beta2 (30-34 Hz), gammal (3438 Hz), gamma2 (38-42 Hz) and gamma3 (42-46 Hz) bands. Obstructive imagery treatment., compared to pain condition, significantly reduced pain perception. This reduction was paralleled by significant decreases of evoked phase-ordered gamma2 and gamma3 patterns over Cz scalp site. Phase-ordered oscillations at Cz scalp site, for both gamma2 and gamma3 bands, significantly predicted pain ratings during pain condition. Phase-ordered oscillation scores, obtained for these gamma bands over parietal and frontal scalp sites, resulted the best predictor of pain ratings during obstructive imagery. This study provides evidence for the role of gamma oscillations in the subjective experience of pain. Further, it has provided support for the view that pain reduction during obstructive mental imagery is the product of an inhibitory process involving frontal and parietal cortical regions.

Here, We used morphing techniques to produce synthetic faces with graded perceivable gender and independent component analysis (ICA) of multifocal EEG to unravel neural signals correlated to processing and perception of face gender. We investigate possible neural correlates of face perception using scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) and dipole source analysis in a group of health observers. We isolated one signal source localised to the right parieto-temporal region with a latency of about 170 ms. whose latency Correlates with perceived facial masculinity. In conclusion, our data prove that the right parieto-temporal regions play a fundamental role in face-gender masculinity processing and perception in humans. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli were presented alone and simultaneously in four experimental sessions. Target stimuli were applied in the visual modality to study cross-modal effects on object recognition. Subjects' task was to indicate the recognition of the target by pressing a button. EEG was recorded from 31 scalp electrodes. Significant decrease in reaction time confirmed that multisensory integration took place in multimodal stimulus condition. Recognition of the target was significantly improved in audiovisual and audio-somatosensory-visual conditions reflected by significantly decreased reaction time compared with unimodal visual and somatosensory-visual conditions. Analysis of event-related potentials revealed that P300 latency showed clear relationship to behavioral data. Results indicate that audiovisual cross-modal integration is more efficacious in visual object recognition task than somatosensory-visual integration. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits, and revised them on the basis of an exogenous performance feedback. The EEG signal was convolved with a family of complex wavelets and induced brain potentials were extracted in the alpha range (8-13 Hz). The time-varying modulation of alpha activity time-locked to positive and negative feedback was analyzed in the 350-700 ms time-window. The results showed differential feedback-induced modulations of upper-alpha rhythms (>= 10 Hz) between 450 and 700 ms in parieto-occipital and central regions, and of lower-alpha rhythms (< 10 Hz) between 350 and 450 ms in central regions.

We obtain high accuracies by using an SVM classifier and a novel feature. These techniques enable us to maintain fast performance without sacrificing the accuracy, thus making the speller usable in an online mode. In order to further improve the usability, we perform various studies on the data with a view to minimizing the training time required. We present data collected from nine healthy subjects, along with the high accuracies (of the order of 95% or more) measured online. We show that the training time can be further reduced by a factor of two from its current value of about 20 min. High accuracy, fast learning, and online performance make this P300 speller a potential communication tool for severely disabled individuals, who have lost all other means of communication and are otherwise cut off from the world, provided their disability does not interfere with the performance of the speller.

The 10 and 20 Hz ERD differentiate weak and strong somatosensory stimuli but not fine intensity gradations, and the ipsilateral ERD is especially sensitive to habituation. Stimulus anticipation, motor imagery, action viewing as well as voluntary movements modulate the stimulus-related changes of cortical oscillations. Noxious laser stimuli, selectively activating A delta and/or C fibers, and innocuous warm and cold Stimuli are associated with 10 and 20 Hz ERD but not with the post-stimulus 20 Hz ERS suggesting that the post-stimulus ERS is only related to neuronal transmission in the lemniscal system. It is proposed that phase-unlocked cortical oscillations modulate the preparedness of a particular sensory channel for upcoming somatosensory processing.

Mechanisms of evoked and induced responses in MEG/EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; NEURAL MASS MODEL; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SINGLE NEURONS; BRAIN; GAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Cortical responses, recorded by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, can be characterized in the time domain, to study event-related potentials/fields, or in the time-frequency domain, to study oscillatory activity. In the literature, there is a common conception that evoked, induced, and on-going oscillations reflect different neuronal processes and mechanisms. In this work, we consider the relationship between the mechanisms generating neuronal transients and how they are expressed in terms of evoked and induced power. This relationship is addressed using a neuronally realistic model of interacting neuronal subpopulations. Neuronal transients were generated by changing neuronal input (a dynamic mechanism) or by perturbing the systems coupling parameters (a structural mechanism) to produce induced responses. By applying conventional time-frequency analyses, we show that, in contradistinction to common conceptions, induced and evoked oscillations are perhaps more related than previously reported. Specifically, structural mechanisms normally associated with induced responses can be expressed in evoked power. Conversely, dynamic mechanisms posited for evoked responses can induce responses, if there is variation in neuronal input. We conclude, it may be better to consider evoked responses as the results of mixed dynamic and structural effects. We introduce adjusted power to complement induced power. Adjusted power is unaffected by trial-to-trial variations in input and can be attributed to structural perturbations without ambiguity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Quantitative electroencephalography features and cognitive impairment in alcoholic patients	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						alcoholism; attention; cognitive impairmen; event related p300 potentials; qEEG; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; WHITE-MATTER; EEG; BRAIN; NEUROMETRICS; POTENTIALS; DIAGNOSIS; COCAINE; ATROPHY	Aim. To determine the exact relation between the characteristics of quantitative electroencephalogram analyses and the estimators of the cognitive status in alcoholic patients undergoing withdrawal. Subjects and methods. The study examined 49 patients diagnosed with alcoholism (DSM-IV) after 10 days of withdrawal, as well as the correlation between the band width measures from the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) analysis and the characteristics of the visual and auditory cognitive evoked potentials (P300) and from the findings of the attention and memory tests. Results. The patients were divided into two groups: group one, which displayed an overall increase in the delta and theta absolute powers with frontal predominance, and group two, with reduced delta and theta absolute powers. Latency of the P300 wave was delayed in patients, particularly in those in group one, but regional absence of the P300 wave was morefrequent in group two. Results of attention and memory tests were abnormal in patients, especially those in group one. Conclusions. The findings in the two groups appear to reflect different stages in the progression of alcoholism: the first only involved cortical dysfunction due to metabolic causes and the second possibly had added cortical atrophy. They might also represent two types of biological response by their nervous systems to the same pathogenic agent. These findings suggest that it is advisable to conduct follow-up studies involving qEEG, cognitive tests and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in this kind of patient.

A linear and a nonlinear transformation based on wavelet transform are presented. They result in a statistical error model and an entropy function related to the Gibbs function and describe changes in midlatency auditory evoked potentials induced by general anaesthesia. The same transformations were calculated using 12 common wavelets. We present a method to compare the two defined parametrizations with respect to their ability to discriminate two defined states which is responsive and unresponsive depending on the wavelet used for the analysis. Auditory evoked potentials of 60 patients undergoing general anaesthesia were analysed. We propose the defined statistical error model and the entropy function as a very robust measure of changes in auditory evoked potentials. The influence of the wavelets suggest that for each parametrization the goodness of the wavelet should be validated.

The present study utilized the N400 event-related electroencephalographic potential to index semantic processing in 133 adults with (n =49) or without (n =84) a history of alcohol and/or cocaine dependence. The contributions of age, gender, and comorbid marijuana and nicotine dependence, and antisocial symptomology to N400 decrements were either covaried or controlled. Methods: A continuous series of 300 stimuli was presented for 150 ms each (interstimulus interval =1475 ms) on a computer screen. The series was arranged such that a word (approximately 17% of stimuli) immediately preceded presentations of its antonym (primed condition; approximately 17% of stimuli), or a semantically unrelated word (unprimed condition; approximately 17% of stimuli). The remaining 50% of stimuli consisted of unpronounceable letter combinations (non-word condition). EEG responses to the antonyms, unrelated words, and letter jumbles were retained for analysis. Throughout the task, the subject pressed response keys to discriminate words from non-words. Results: Analyses revealed a detrimental effect of alcohol dependence on N400 amplitude and no significant main or interactive effects of cocaine dependence. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that alcohol-dependent individuals may exhibit verbal processing decrements. These findings also challenge hypotheses suggesting that the combined use of cocaine and alcohol is more deleterious to brain function than alcohol use alone. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Functional neural dynamics underlying auditory event-related N1 and N1 suppression response	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FRONTAL COMPONENTS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; EEG; CORTEX; WAVE; LOCALIZATION; INTEGRATION; MODULATION	Presenting tone triplets of identical stimuli preceded by silent intervals of 30 s produces a series of three N1 averaged event-related potentials (ERPs), the first being of greater amplitude (non-suppressed N1) than the second and third ones (suppressed N1). Maximal statistically independent components (ICs) of single-trial multi-electrode scalp EEG responses to triplets were obtained by ICA algorithm, and then each IC was searched for underlying brain structures by LORETA inverse solution, and for oscillatory contributions by time-frequency analysis. Non-suppressed N1 cortical mechanisms were broken down into five ICs, grouped in two time-windows (early-onset and late-onset) involving the participation of temporal, frontal and parietal structures, and sub-serving EEG oscillatory contributions of power enhancement and putative phase concentration of mainly theta, alpha and low beta bands. Suppressed N1 was due to the modulation of two above-mentioned early-onset ICs, involving temporal structures only, and mainly sub-serving oscillatory contributions of phase concentration of theta and alpha. Present results, showing quantifiable changes of IC descriptors - i.e. time window of activation, implied structures and oscillatory contributions - extracted from two distinct brain functional situations (non-suppressed versus suppressed N1), give support to the view that ICA is not merely a statistical "latent variables" model when applied to ERPs, but could help to capture underlying specific function subunits of brain dynamics.

The effects of dexmedetomidine/remifentanil and midazolam/remifentanil on auditory-evoked potentials and electroencephalogram levels in healthy subjects	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; ICU PATIENTS; CONTROLLED INFUSION; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; BISPECTRAL INDEX; SEDATION; PROPOFOL; SLEEP; REMIFENTANIL	Avoidance of excessively deep sedation levels is problematic in intensive care patients. Electrophysiologic monitoring may offer an approach to solving this problem. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to different sedation regimens vary, we assessed electrophysiologic responses to two sedative drug regimens in 10 healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (dex/remi group) and midazolam/remifentanil (mida/remi group) were infused 7 days apart. Each combination of medications was given at stepwise intervals to reach Ramsay scores (RS) 2, 3, and 4. Resting EEG, bispectral index (BIS), and the N100 amplitudes of long-latency auditory-evoked potentials (ERP) were recorded at each level of sedation. During dex/remi, resting EEG was characterized by a recurrent high-power low-frequency pattern which became more pronounced at deeper levels of sedation. BIS Index decreased uniformly in only the dex/remi group (from 94 +/- 3 at baseline to 58 +/- 14 at RS 4) compared to the mida/remi group (from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 10; P = 0.029 between groups). The ERP amplitudes decreased from 5.3 +/- 1.3 at baseline to 0.4 +/- 1.1 at RS 4 (P = 0.003) in only the mida/remi group. We conclude that ERPs in volunteers sedated with dex/remi, in contrast to mida/remi, indicate a cortical response to acoustic stimuli, even when sedation reaches deeper levels. Consequently, ERP can monitor sedation with midazolam but not with dexmedetomidine. The reverse is true for BIS.

The Mismatch Negativity (MMN), a neurophysiological brain response recorded in the EEG and MEG, is elicited by attended and unattended stimuli alike. Recent studies investigating the cognitive processes underlying spoken language processing found that even under attentional withdrawal, MMN size and topography reflect the activation of memory traces for language elements in the human brain. Familiar sounds of one's native language elicit a larger MMN than unfamiliar sounds, and at the level of meaningful language units, words elicit a larger MMN than meaningless pseudowords. This suggests that the MMN reflects the activation of memory networks for language sounds and spoken words. Unattended word stimuli elicit an activation sequence starting in superior-temporal cortex and rapidly progressing to left-inferior-frontal lobe. The spatio-temporal patterns of cortical activation depend on lexical and semantic properties of word stems and affixes, thus indicating that the MMN can give clues about lexico-semantic information processing stored in long term memory. At the syntactic level, MMN size was found to reflect whether a word string conforms to abstract grammatical rules. This growing body of results suggests that lexical, semantic and syntactic information can be processed by the central nervous system outside the focus of attention in a largely automatic manner. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of generator activations underlying the MMN to speech may be an important tool for investigating the brain dynamics of spoken language processing and the activated distributed cortical circuits acting at long-term memory traces.

Oscillatory brain activity in the human EEG during indirect and direct memory tasks	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						human EEG; induced gamma band response; oscillations; indirect memory; direct memory	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; VISUAL CONTRAST STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Up to today, the neuronal bases of activating and establishing a memory trace are not well understood. Several findings point towards the idea that the activation of an engram is mirrored in induced oscillatory bursts in the gamma frequency range (> 20 Hz; induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). In the present study, we further investigated this hypothesis. Volunteers performed two tasks on repeated pictures of familiar and unfamiliar objects. They either made a familiarity decision with repetition being task irrelevant (indirect memory task), or a recognition judgment with repetition being task relevant (direct memory task). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analyses by investigating other brain responses known to be modulated by mnemonic manipulations, namely, evoked gamma oscillations, lower frequency oscillations, and event-related potentials (ERPs). The results obtained for the indirect task replicated previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs for repeated familiar stimuli and an increase of iGBRs for repeated unfamiliar objects. These effects might be linked to the 'sharpening' of a cell assembly representing a familiar object and to the formation of a new object representation for unfamiliar stimuli, respectively. In contrast, the direct task revealed no repetition-related modulations of iGBRs. Thus, modulations of iGBRs are not a mere automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing but might rather mirror changes within cortical object representation according to use-dependent plasticity principles. Furthermore, evoked gamma responses, lower frequency bands, and late components of the ERPs correlated with more specific subprocesses during mnemonic functioning. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study of the K-complex was almost immediately taken up by many notable figures in early electroencephalography research, such as Robert Schwab, Mary Brazier, and W. Gray Walter. More than 200 papers have been published in the years since these early studies, including major reviews in 1956 by Roth et al and in 1985 by Peter Halasz. More recently, K-complex study has been taken up by event-related potentials researchers such as Ken Campbell and animal neurophysiologists such as Florin Amzica and Mircea Steriade. The present paper provides a historical and thematically based review of the K-complex literature and attempts to integrate the various theoretical positions and neurophysiologic data. Specifically, K-complexes are discussed in terms of their relationship to other electroencephalographic phenomena, their relationship to autonomic activation, their role in the study of information processing during sleep, and what is understood of their underlying neurophysiology.

Previously, somatosensory gamma oscillations have only been evoked by electrical stimuli. We conjectured that a natural proprioceptive stimulus also would be able to evoke gamma oscillations. EEG was recorded using 64 channels in 14 healthy subjects. In each of three runs a stimulus of 100 g load increment in each hand was presented in 120 trials. Data were wavelet transformed and runs collapsed. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) was computed as the best measure of precision of evoked oscillations. The window of interest was 25-75 Hz and 0-200 ms. ITPC maxima were determined by visual inspection and these results were compared to results of multi-way factor analyses. The predicted 40 Hz activity was observed 60 ms after stimulus onset in the parietal region contralateral to stimulus side and additionally an unexpected 20 Hz activity was observed slightly lateralized in the frontal central region. The gamma phase locking may be a manifestation of early somatosensory feature integration. The analyses suggest that the high frequency activity consists of two distinct underlying oscillatory processes, in need of further investigation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG was recorded from six adolescents with autism and eight controls matched on chronological age, and verbal and nonverbal mental age, whilst identifying the presence or absence of an illusory Kanizsa shape. Although there were no reaction time or accuracy differences between the groups there were significant task-related differences in cortical activity. Control participants showed typical gamma-band activity over parietal regions at around 350 msec post onset of shape trials, similar to gamma patterns found in previous studies with non-impaired adults. In contrast, autistic participants showed overall increased activity, including an early 100 msec gamma peak and a late induced peak, 50 to 70 msec earlier than that shown by the control group. We interpret the abnormal gamma activity to reflect decreased "signal to noise" due to decreased inhibitory processing. In this experiment we did not establish a link between altered perception and abnormal gamma, as the autistic participants' behaviour did not differ from the controls. Future work should be designed to replicate this phenomenon and establish the perceptual consequences of altered gamma activity.

S	Bastiaansen, M; Hagoort, P		Neuper, C; Klimesch, W		Bastiaansen, Marcel; Hagoort, Peter			Oscillatory neuronal dynamics during language comprehension	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review						language comprehension; unification; syntax; semantics; neuronal synchronization; oscillatory dynamics; EEG power; EEG coherence	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIPPOCAMPAL MEMORY SYSTEM; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; WORD FORM AREA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; FIELD POTENTIALS	Language comprehension involves two basic operations: the retrieval of lexical information (Such as phonologic, syntactic, and semantic information) from long-term memory, and the unification of this information into a coherent representation of the overall utterance. Neuroimaging studies using hemodynamic measures such as PET and fMRI have provided detailed information on which areas of the brain are involved in these language-related memory and unification operations. However, much less is known about the dynamics of the brain's language network. This chapter presents a literature review of the oscillatory neuronal dynamics of EEG and MEG data that can be observed during language comprehension tasks. From a detailed review of this (rapidly growing) literature the following picture emerges: memory retrieval operations are mostly accompanied by increased neuronal synchronization in the theta frequency range (4-7 Hz). Unification operations, in contrast, induce high-frequency neuronal synchronization in the beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (above 30 Hz) frequency bands. A desynchronization in the (upper) alpha frequency band is found for those Studies that use secondary tasks, and seems to correspond with attentional processes, and with the behavioral consequences of the language comprehension process. We conclude that it is possible to capture the dynamics of the brain's language network by a careful analysis of the event-related changes in power and coherence of EEG and MEG data in a wide range of frequencies, in combination with subtle experimental manipulations in a range of language comprehension tasks. It appears then that neuronal synchrony is a mechanism by which the brain integrates the different types of information about language (such as phonological, orthographic, semantic, and syntactic information) represented in different brain areas.

However, several fMRI and positron emission tomography studies of cognitive tasks have found increased bilateral activity in elderly subjects. Changes in coherence with aging during a cognitive task were investigated to see if EEG coherence was present in older adults. An auditory oddball task, which is a widely used test for cognitive function, was used. Eleven young adults (27.8 +/- 4.8 years, six females) and 10 older adults (61.3 +/- 4.6 years, six females) were studied, and both interhemispheric and long- and short-range intrahemispheric coherence were considered. Higher interhemispheric coherence was found in the older subjects in the delta band. Short intrahemispheric coherence was also increased in the theta, delta, and alpha bands. Higher coherence, although not significantly different, was also found for all other coherence types and bands, except for long intrahemispheric coherence in the low gamma band. The results presented here provide the first evidence that aging is associated with increased EEG coherence during a relatively easy cognitive task.

The present research evaluates a set of analysis methods that have recently been used to provide evidence for this hypothesis. To evaluate these methods, we apply each of them to two simulated data sets: one set that includes theta phase resetting and a second that comprises phasic peaks embedded in EEG noise. The results indicate that the analysis methods do not effectively distinguish between the two simulated data sets. In particular, the simulated data set constructed from phasic peaks, though containing no synchronization of ongoing EEG activity, demonstrates properties previously interpreted as supporting the synchronized oscillation account of the ERN. These findings suggest that the proposed analysis methods cannot provide unambiguous evidence that the ERN is generated by phase resetting of ongoing oscillations.

The aims were to find out whether the intact movements were associated with a physiological time-varying pattern of activity in the motor-related cortical areas and whether the primary motor area (MI) activation followed a somatotopic distribution. Event-related potentials to self-initiated lip movements were analyzed by means of cortical source imaging of EEG recorded from seven tetraplegic subjects and seven control subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected on individual MRI and the time-varying electrophysiologic activity (cortical current density, CCD) was estimated on these ROIs and subjected to across-subject analysis. A significant, bilateral movement-related pattern of MI activation was detected during motor task execution in SCI patients as well as in controls. The site of local maxima activation displayed a symmetrical discrete distribution within MI, consistently with a putative somatotopic lip representation, in all the subjects. The supplementary motor area proper (SMAp) was always coactivated with MI and coactivation was characterized by a time course with typical premotion and motion phases over both motor areas. A clear-cut temporal delay between the SMAp and MI activation did not occur either in SCI patients or in controls. These findings obtained with noninvasive neuroelectrical source imaging document that in chronic SCI subjects "executive" motor areas are engaged with a preserved temporal and spatial pattern during preparation and execution of intact movements.

We studied non-phase-locked changes in cortical oscillatory activity in a S1-centred double-stimulus go/no go paradigm with random interstimulus interval. Methods: About 58 reference-free EEG channels were analyzed by means of Gabor transforms in a group of 10 healthy subjects. A 2000 Hz tone (S1go, 84% probability) indicated the subject to make a brisk wrist extension after a second 2000 Hz tone (S2go). The S1-S2 interval was either 1.5, 3 or 4.5 s. A 1000 Hz tone (SI no go, 16% probability) indicated the subject not to move (and wait for another S1 tone). Results: A frontal 15 Hz synchronization was observed after S I in all conditions. No further significant changes were observed in the no go condition. A small pre-S2 alpha and beta desynchronization could be observed only in the 3 and 4.5 s-interval go conditions, being larger in the latter. Conclusions: These results suggest that the predictability of the timing of a movement influences the appearance of the pre-movement oscillatory changes; not only motor planning (the 'go' decision) is necessary, but also an estimation of when to move. Significance: Our findings provide new insight on the relationship between the decision-making process, movement, and cortical oscillatory activity.

They result from a population of abnormally hyperactive and hypersynchronous neurons. It is not easy to determine the location of the cerebral generators and the other brain regions that may be involved as a result of this abnormal activity. The possibility to combine EEG recording with functional MRI (fMRI) scanning opens the opportunity to uncover the regions of the brain showing changes in the fMRI signal in response to epileptic spikes seen in the EEG. These regions are presumably involved in the abnormal neuronal activity at the origin of epileptic discharges. This paper reviews the methodology involved in performing such studies, particularly the challenge of recording a good quality EEG inside the MR scanner while scanning is taking place, and the methods required for the statistical analysis of the combined EEG and fMRI time series. We review the results obtained in patients with different types of epileptic disorders and discuss the difficult theoretical problems raised by the interpretation of an increase (activation) and decrease (deactivation) in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, both frequently seen in response to spikes.

To answer this open question we investigated the alpha and beta band task-related spectral power decreases (TRPow) in the deafferented patient G.L. and compared the results to those of six healthy subjects. The patient has been deafferented up to the nose for 24 years but her motor fibers are unaffected and she can perform complex motor tasks under visual control. We recorded EEG (58 scalp positions) as well as the exerted force during a visuomotor task. The subjects had to maintain in precision grip an isometric force at 15% of the maximal voluntary contraction. In the patient we found a significantly higher alpha band spectral power during rest and larger alpha TRPow decreases during the motor task when compared to the healthy subjects' data. In contrast, we did not observe any significant differences between patient and controls for the beta band TRPow. The results indicate an altered functional alpha band network state in the patient, probably due to the chronic deafferentation leading to a deep 'idling' state of the contraiateral sensorimotor area.

EEG changes and balance deficits following concussion: One piece of the puzzle	FOUNDATIONS OF SPORT-RELATED BRAIN INJURIES			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Concussion in Athletics	APR 29-30, 2004	Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA		Penn State Univ	balance; concussion; diffuse axonal injury (DAI); electroencephalogram (EEG); low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA); traumatic brain injury (MTBI); movement-related; cortical potential (MRCP	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CLOSED-HEAD INJURY; BIOPHYSICAL LINKAGE; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; POSTURAL STABILITY; COLLEGIATE; PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY; SPORTS	This chapter explores the contribution that electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and balance testing can make in the areas of concussion assessment and return to play decisions. Current literature in these areas and empirical research that combines these assessment tools is reviewed. Research findings support the view that it is not symptom resolution, rather resolution of the concussion pathology that should determine whether an athlete is ready to return to competition. The current gold standard measures used for evaluation of both concussion severity and return to play rely heavily on measures of loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia. The limitations of these current standards are discussed and a proposal is made concerning how concussion assessment might be improved through the addition of functional motor tests and objective EEG measures that reflect cortical functioning. The combination of electroencephalographic recordings and motor testing allows practitioners to assess two crucial elements of athletic functioning. First, basic physical capabilities of an athlete are assessed via balance testing. Second, neuronal functioning of the cortex is assessed in both resting and task conditions to determine whether the athlete has returned to pre-injury levels of cortical functioning. New research in the field is revealing that by challenging concussed people to perform postural tasks while simultaneous electroencephalographic recordings are taken, insights into long lasting cognitive functional deficits can be revealed. Research applied to frequency analysis, event-related potentials, movement related cortical potentials and injury source localization associated with the electroencephalograph recordings will be presented and commented on. The goal of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview of the current state of research in concussion assessment and diagnosis and to lead the reader through the groundbreaking work being performed using functional testing paradigms during electroencephalographic recordings. The reader will be left with an understanding of why the combination of motor and cerebral testing is essential in performing a sensitive and reliable measure of concussion severity and return to play readiness.

Characteristic EEG spatial patterns make MI tasks substantially discriminable. Multi-channel EEGs are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification and therefore MI-based BCI is still in the stage of laboratory demonstration, to some extent, due to the need for constantly troublesome recording preparation. This paper presents a method for channel reduction in NH-based BCI. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method was employed to analyze spatial patterns of imagined hand and foot movements. Significant channels were selected by searching the maximums of spatial pattern vectors in scalp mappings. A classification algorithm was developed by means of combining linear discriminant analysis towards event-related desynchronization (ERD) and readiness potential (R-P). The classification accuracies with four optimal channels were 93.45% and 91.88% for two subjects.

We have designed a unilateral repetitive fingertapping task to delineate the anterior and posterior cortex contributions to unilateral finger movement. Sixteen right handed college students participated in this study. Event related potentials (ERPs) and the strength of event related coherence (ERCoh) were analyzed to examine the antero-postero dominance of cortical activity in the phase of early visual process (75-120ms), pre-execution (175-260ms), execution (310-420ms) and postexecution (420-620ms). Results showed that the occipital (Oz, O1 and O2), frontal (Fz, F3, and F4), fronto-central (Fz, Cz, F3 and C3), and parietal regions were the most pronounced in the early visual, pre-execution, execution, and postexecution phases, respectively. Moreover, among four interhemispheric pairs only the Coh ( C3 and C4) was significantly correlated to reaction time (RT) of tapping in the execution phase. In conclusion, the aforementioned variability of electrophysiological data ( ERPs and coherence) and the change of anteropostero regional dominance with time reflect the relative importance of different mechanisms in different phases. The mechanisms of visual processing, motor planning, motor execution and feedback reward were operational, respectively.

B.; Wessberg, Johan			Evolutionary optimization of classifiers and features for single-trial EEG Discrimination	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; HAND MOVEMENTS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; IMAGINATION	Background: State-of-the-art signal processing methods are known to detect information in single-trial event-related EEG data, a crucial aspect in development of real-time applications such as brain computer interfaces. This paper investigates one such novel approach, evaluating how individual classifier and feature subset tailoring affects classification of single-trial EEG finger movements. The discrete wavelet transform was used to extract signal features that were classified using linear regression and non-linear neural network models, which were trained and architecturally optimized with evolutionary algorithms. The input feature subsets were also allowed to evolve, thus performing feature selection in a wrapper fashion. Filter approaches were implemented as well by limiting the degree of optimization. Results: Using only 10 features and 100 patterns, the non-linear wrapper approach achieved the highest validation classification accuracy (subject mean 75%), closely followed by the linear wrapper method (73.5%). The optimal features differed much between subjects, yet some physiologically plausible patterns were observed. Conclusion: High degrees of classifier parameter, structure and feature subset tailoring on individual levels substantially increase single-trial EEG classification rates, an important consideration in areas where highly accurate detection rates are essential. Also, the presented method provides insight into the spatial characteristics of finger movement EEG patterns.

Recent studies have used wavelets and other signal processing methods to analyze EEG signals in an attempt to find a non-invasive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and had varying degrees of success. These studies have traditionally used automated classifiers such as neural networks; however the use of an ensemble of classifiers has not been previously explored and may prove to be beneficial. In this study, multiresolution wavelet analysis is performed on event related potentials of the EEG which are then used with the ensemble of classifiers based Learn++ algorithm. We describe the approach, and present our promising preliminary results.

The method can be applied for transient activity (e.g. event-related potentials) as well as for oscillatory activity (e.g. gamma bursts), and for both evoked or induced activity. In order to benefit from all the structure present in the data, the method account-Is for (i) spatial structure of the data via multivariate decomposition, (ii) time-frequency structure via atomic decomposition and (iii) reproducibility across trials via a constraint on parameter dispersion. Moreover, a novel iterative method is introduced for estimating the initial time-frequency atoms used in the non-linear fit. Numerical experiments show that the method is robust to low signal-to-noise conditions, and that the introduction of the constraint on parameter dispersion significantly improves the quality of the fit.

Methods: Eight patients with LGI1-related ADTLE belonging to a family with predominantly aphasic seizures were studied. Sixty-five individuals without epilepsy served as controls. AEPs (N1-P2 amplitudes) to binaural tones were recorded over the left and the right hemispheres. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) to monaural rarefaction clicks also were analyzed. Group differences were statistically assessed with Student's t test and repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Left N1-P2 AEP amplitudes were moderately reduced in ADTLE patients (p = 0.005). No group differences in BAEP were found, indicating unaffected cochlear system and auditory brainstem pathways. Conclusions: A moderate, but highly significant reduction in N1-P2 AEP amplitudes over the left hemisphere was demonstrated in patients with ADTLE. This finding corresponds to the cardinal symptom of aphasia in this family, and also to the generally prevailing left-sided EEG abnormalities in this condition. The background for this electrophysiologic lateralization in LGI1-related epilepsy is unknown. It may be related to a specific function of LGI1 in the dominant hemisphere.

In order to demonstrate that the paradigm and stimulus set yield reliable results both were employed in two electrophysiological investigations in two independent laboratories. Participants were required to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar stimuli. The pattern of results was very consistent across laboratories. Early event-related potentials were not influenced by the stimulus type suggesting that physical stimulus properties did not. p confound object familiarity. Induced gamma band activity was stronger for familiar than for unfamiliar objects, supporting the notion of gamma activity as a signature of cortical networks underlying object representations.

EEG synchrony reflects the coordination among neuronal network. As usual, phase synchronization methods are used to detect the phase difference between narrowband signals from two different electrodes, and are applied to clinic such as the localization of epilepsy. In this paper, we combined a filter bank with a phase synchronization method and applied the method to event related EEG of cognitive task to obtain a dynamic spatial-temporal synchronization distribution in different rhythm. The results showed that the synchronal activities of neurons did match ERP component in the cognitive experiment. It gave explanations to interaction of the underlying neutonal networks and to information processing mechanism in cognitive process in some sense.

The complexity of short-duration (similar to s) epochs of EEG data were analysed using SampEn along with the surrogate technique. Individual tasks consisted of an auditory discrimination task and two motor tasks of varying difficulty. Dual task conditions were combinations of one auditory and one motor task. EEG entropies were significantly lower in dual tasks compared to that in the single tasks. The results of this study have demonstrated that entropy measurements can be a useful alternative and nonlinear approach to analyzing short duration EEG signals on a time scale of seconds.

J	Ford, JM; Mathalon, DH				Ford, JM; Mathalon, DH			Corollary discharge dysfunction in schizophrenia: Can it explain auditory hallucinations?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th World Congress of Psychophysiology of the International-Organization-of-Psychophysiology	SEP 18-23, 2004	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Int Org Psychophysiol		schizophrenia; corollary discharge; N1; EEG coherence	CORTICAL RESPONSIVENESS; POTENTIAL STUDY/; SPEECH; PET; PERCEPTION; SYNCHRONY; DISORDERS; COHERENCE; CORTEX; VOICE	Failure of corollary discharge, a mechanism for distinguishing self-generated from externally generated percepts, has been posited to underlie certain positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations. Although originally described in the visual system, corollary discharge may exist in the auditory system, whereby signals from motor speech commands prepare auditory cortex for self-generated speech. While associated with sensorimotor systems, it might also apply to inner speech or thought, regarded as our most complex motor act. In this paper, we describe the results of a series of studies in which we have shown that: (1) event-related brain potentials (ERPs) can be used to demonstrate the corollary discharge phenomenon during talking, (2) corollary discharge is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, (3) EEG gamma band coherence between frontal and temporal lobes is greater during talking than listening and is disrupted by distorted feedback during talking in normals, and (4) patients with schizophrenia do not show this pattern for EEG gamma coherence. While these studies have identified ERPs and EEG gamma coherence indices of the efference copy/corollary discharge system and documented abnormalities in these systems in patients with schizophrenia, we have so far had limited success in establishing a relationship between these neurobiologic indicators of corollary discharge abnormality and reports of hallucinations in patients.

We investigated the generators of the P3 and positive slow wave (PSW) in the evoked responses to probes recorded during auditory working memory tasks to find out whether there is dissociation between functional networks involved in the generation of the P3 and PSW and between spatial and nonspatial auditory processing within this time window. Methods: Whole-head magneto-(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG); analysis of MEG data using minimum-norm current estimates. Results: The associative temporal, occipito-temporal and parietal areas contributed to the generation of the slow evoked responses. The temporal source increased while the occipito-temporal source diminished activity during transition from the P3 to PSW. The occipito-temporal generator of the P3 was activated more during the spatial than nonspatial task, and the left temporal generator of the PSW tended to be more strongly activated during the nonspatial task. Conclusions: These findings indicate that partially distinct functional networks generate the P3 and PSW and provide evidence for segregation of spatial and nonspatial auditory information processing in associative areas beyond the supratemporal auditory cortex. Significance: The present results support the dual-stream model for auditory information processing. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Graded cue information in dichotic pitch: effects on event-related potentials	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory; dichotic pitch; electroencephalogram; human; object-related negativity	PERCEPTUAL SEGREGATION; EEG	To determine whether electroencephalogram components elicited by dichotic pitch stimuli are all-or-none threshold-like responses or graded responses that depend on the saliency of the stimuli, we recorded electroencephalograms while participants listened to dichotic pitch stimuli constructed with different signal-to-background ratios.The object-related negativity and P400 components were largest when the dichotic pitch was most salient (high signal-to-background ratio), and decreased in amplitude with decreasing signal-to-background ratio. These results are similar to those reported for mistuned harmonics, thereby providing additional evidence that the object-related negativity and P400 components observed for these disparate stimulus types reflect similar processing.They also support the notion that the object-related negativity and P400 amplitudes are dependent on the level of relevant cue-based stimulus information.

Here we report a neural index of gender difference in empathy-related processing in a complex social situation. Using electroencephalography, we measured the neural activity of perceptions to one's own and another's monetary gain or loss, while individuals played a 'competitive' two-person gambling game, in which one's monetary gain resulted in the other's loss. The medial-frontal negativity (MFN), a component within 300 ms latency reflecting an emotional categorization of the event, showed a significant gender difference in perceiving an opponent's, but not a self-performed outcome. When females perceive the opponent's outcomes, the MFN was elicited, indicating that another's loss was categorized as negative, even though it resulted in a benefit to them. On the contrary, the males did not elicit discernable MFN to the opponent's outcomes. Together with the fact that the affect score has a negative linear correlation with the MFN, this indicated that the MFN was sensitive to socio-emotional processing. These results suggest that individual differences in complex social behavior result from rapid neural activity in response to external stimuli.

Methods: Reaction times (RTs), accuracy and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during the execution of a visual Simon task in 17 cirrhotic patients and 10 healthy controls. Amplitude and latency of the P1 and N1 (indexes of bottom-up processes) and of the N2pc (index of top-down processes) were measured. Results: Patients were slower than controls, and patients with minimal HE (MHE) were slower than patients without MHE. The distribution analysis of RTs showed that the Simon effect decays with slower RTs in all the groups and that the shape of the distribution was different in MHE patients. No differences were found between cirrhotic patients and controls for PI and NI amplitude and latency. In contrast, N2pc latency was delayed in cirrhotic patients compared to controls independently of MHE. Conclusions: In the extrastriate cortex of cirrhotic patients without HE, top-down processes are altered whereas bottom-up processes are preserved. Significance: The analysis of exogenous and endogenous visual components of ERPs provides a model to study the functional dissociation between top-down and bottom-up processes inside the extrastriate cortex.

Non-invasive electrophysiological brain recordings were made during a behavioural study of selective attention in which participants received either energising or placebo drinks. We tested specifically whether energising drinks have significant effects upon behavioural measures of performance during a task requiring sustained visual selective attention, as well as on accompanying components of the event-related potential (ERPs) related to information processing in the brain. Forty healthy volunteers were blindly assigned to receive either the energising drink or a similar-tasting placebo drink. The behavioural task involved identifying predefined target stimulus among rapidly presented streams of peripheral visual stimuli, and making speeded motor responses to this stimulus. During task performance, accuracy, reaction times and ongoing brain activity were stored for analysis. The energising drink enhanced behavioural performance both in terms of accuracy and speed of reactions. The energising drink also had significant effects upon the event-related potentials. Effects started from the enhancement of the earliest components (C1/P1), reflecting early visual cortical processing in the energising-drink group relative to the placebo group over the contralateral scalp. The later N1, N2 and P3 components related to decision-making and responses were also modulated by the energising drink. Energising drinks containing caffeine and glucose can enhance behavioural performance during demanding tasks requiring selective attention. The behavioural benefits are coupled to direct effects upon neural information processing.

J	Dorokhov, VB; Verbitskaya, YS				Dorokhov, VB; Verbitskaya, YS			Changes in components of the auditory long-latency evoked potentials at different stages of the slow-wave sleep	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						slow-wave sleep stages; sleep onset; event-related potentials	VERTEX SHARP WAVES; NREM SLEEP; K-COMPLEXES; INHIBITION; ONSET; STATE	In accordance with the present views, during sleep, analysis of external stimuli continues at the subconscious level, because the need to estimate the biological significance of external stimuli in order to maintain a flexible contact of a sleeping subject with the environment persists during sleep. It is known that new components of the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) appear as sleep deepens. However, the common procedure of analysis of event-related potentials averaged for a group of subjects has some drawbacks because of the interindividual variability of the event-related potentials. Therefore, an additional analysis of the interindividual variability of the AEP shape and component structure can simplify the detection of individual components of group-averaged AEP at different stages of the slow-wave sleep. The AEPs were recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 26) during falling asleep in the evening from eight EEG derivations (F3, F4. C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02) in reference to a linked mastoid electrode. Computer-generated sound stimuli (50 ms-pulses with the frequency of 1000 Hz, 60 dB HL) were presented binaurally through earphones with interstimulus intervals of 20-40 s. Selective summation of AEPs for all the subjects was performed for each stage of the slow-wave sleep individually for each of the eight derivations. It was shown that the account made for interindividual variability of the AEP shape facilitated the identification of individual components of the group-averaged AEP typical of wakefulness (P], NI, P300) and those which appeared during sleep onset and at different stages of the slow-wave sleep (P2, N350, P450, N550, N900).

Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in I 1 full-term sleeping newborn infants mostly in active sleep (67 % of the time). Pure tones were presented through loudspeakers in an oddball paradigm with a 800-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Each stimulus block contained a standard (p = 0.76) of 250, 1000, or 4000 Hz in frequency (in separate blocks) and deviants with a frequency change of either 5% or 20% of the standard (p = 0.12 of each). Results: A positive ERP deflection was found at 200-300 ms from stimulus onset in response to the 20% deviation from the 250, 1000, and 4000 Hz standard frequencies. The amplitude of the response in the 200-300 ms time window was significantly larger for the 20% than 5% deviation. Conclusions: We observed in newborn infants automatic frequency discrimination as reflected by a positive MMR. The newborns were able to discriminate frequency change of 20% in the 250-4000-Hz frequency range, whereas the discrimination of the 5% frequency change was not statistically confirmed. Significance: The present data hence suggest that the neonatal frequency discrimination has lower resolution than that in adult and older children data.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether DS patients have similar impairment of preattentive auditory processing as observed in AD. Sinusoidal tones were presented to DS patients and healthy controls, and evoked auditory evoked fields (AEF) were measured with a whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. Patients with DS had significantly delayed and attenuated N100m, and delayed but not attenuated P50m responses over both hemispheres. Present results indicate that preattentive auditory processing underlying stimulus detection is impaired in DS. Given that anticholinergic drugs modulate AEFs, degeneration of cholinergic system in DS could contribute to the damaged auditory processing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Subjects performed a grasping and transportation task in which actions were cued either with the immediate action goal (the part of the object to grasp) or with the final action goal of the movement (the end position for transportation). Slow wave potentials dissociated between processes supporting immediate and final goals: reaching for the object was accompanied by the development of a parietaloccipital slow wave that peaked in congruency with the grasping event, whereas transport of the object towards the final goal location was found accompanied by slow wave components developing over left frontal regions with a peak towards the movement end. Source localization of cueing differences indicated activation centered around the parieto-occipital sulcus during reaching of the immediate action goal, followed by enhanced activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex during transport to the final action goal. These results suggest the existence of separate neural controllers for immediate and final action goals during the execution of goal-directed actions with objects. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Long-range phase synchronization is often observed by scalp EEG measurements during cognitive tasks and is considered to provide a possible neural principle for the functional integration of distributed neural activities. Synchronization could be reflected at the neuron firing level or at the local field potential and could appear in the scalp EEG under certain conditions on neural spatial and temporal coherence. To examine if phase synchronization is concerned with the integration of distant regions, we proposed a method to extract brain activities associated with task-dependent phase synchronization by combining simultaneous fMRI and EEG. By applying this method in a mental arithmetic task, we found a dominant task-dependent increase of phase synchronization around 14 Hz (in beta frequency) across bilateral parietal sites that were associated with both negative and positive BOLD responses. Functional connectivity analyses of these regions demonstrated that an increase in hemispheric beta synchronization was associated with a linking between the cross-hemispheric regions (left angular gyrus and right superior parietal gyros) and also among the anterior-posterior regions (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen, and right superior temporal gyrus). These findings indicate that the positive BOLD regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule) are linked with other negative BOLD regions. We also discussed the possible importance of beta synchronization in the formation of a working memory network. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the experiments, a large amount of images were displayed at a very high presentation rate, named rapid serial visual presentation. The EEG was recorded using 32 electrodes during the rapid image presentation. Subjects were instructed to click the mouse when they recognize a target image. The results demonstrated that the boosting method improves the detection performance compared with the base classifier by approximately 3% as measured by area under the ROC curve.

This study examined the relationship between interoceptive sensitivity and both the subjective emotional experience and the processing of emotional pictures. According to their results in a heartbeat detection task subjects were classified as good (N = 17) or poor (N = 20) heartbeat perceivers. Event-related potentials were recorded while subjects viewed pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures and SAM ratings were examined. Good heartbeat perceivers showed significantly greater P300 and slow wave amplitudes for emotional pictures at antero- inferior, medial and posterior electrode sites and experienced a greater arousal for emotional pictures compared to poor heartbeat perceivers. The heartbeat perception score correlated significantly positive both with emotional P300 and slow wave amplitudes as well as with the arousal ratings for emotional pictures. The results indicate that there is a significant and strong association between interoceptive sensitivity and the intensity of emotional experience as well as the central processing of emotional stimuli.

Active suppression and withdrawal of activation have been proposed as underlying mechanisms in isotonic and isometric relaxation. Methods: Experiment 1 investigated isotonic wrist extension/release from extension. Experiment 2 investigated isometric activation/relaxation of a pinch grip. Tasks were performed with left and right hands and cued auditorily at variable intervals. EEG was recorded from 128 electrodes and processed to derive the LRP timelocked to the onset and offset of muscle contraction. Results: LRPs for isotonic activation and relaxation were of identical amplitude at electrodes overlying the motor cortex, but differed at frontal locations due to higher amplitude re-afferent activity during activation. The isometric LRP was significantly smaller during relaxation than during activation, without differences in scalp distribution. Conclusion: The LRP findings confirm differences between isotonic and isometric relaxation, which may be partly explained by the need to suppress a stretch reflex in the former condition. The presence of an LRP associated with isometric relaxation reveals active preparation in the motor cortex, indicating that muscle relaxation in the isometric task cannot be explained solely by withdrawal of activation. Significance: High-density LRP recordings isolate different cortical mechanisms underlying the termination of muscle contraction. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Dynamic causal modeling of evoked responses in EEG and MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; neural networks; nonlinear dynamics; causal modeling; Bayesian inference	GRANGER CAUSALITY; BRAIN-STEM; TOP-DOWN; FMRI; CORTEX; ATTENTION; FACE; REPRESENTATION; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Neuronally plausible, generative or forward models are essential for understanding how event-related fields (ERFs) and potentials (ERPs) are generated. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme, in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among well-defined neuronal subpopulations. In a previous paper, we simulated ERPs using a hierarchical neural-mass model that embodied bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections among remote regions. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian procedure to estimate the parameters of this model using empirical data. We demonstrate this procedure by characterizing the role of changes in cortico-cortical coupling, in the genesis of ERPs. In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the face-selective N170, could be explained by category-specific differences in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework.

We used ICA to determine the brain responses to painful stimulation of the oesophagus. Methods: Twelve subjects with a median age of 41 years were included. With a nasal endoscope, two series of 35 electrical stimuli at the pain threshold were given to the distal oesophagus and the EEG was subjected to ICA. The sessions were separated by 30 minutes. For each component head models, event related images, spectral perturbation, coherence analysis, and dipoles were extracted. The most valid components were found according to time/frequency information and reliability in both experiments. Results: Reliable components with the most valid dipoles were found in the thalamus, insula, cingulate gyrus, and sensory cortex. Time locked activities were consistent with upstream activation of these areas, and cross coherence analysis of the sources demonstrated dynamic links in the beta (14-25 Hz) and gamma (25-50 Hz) bands between the suggested networks of neurones. The thalamic components were time and phase locked intermittently, starting around 50 ms. In the cingulate gyrus, the posterior areas were always firstly activated, followed by the middle and anterior regions. Components with dipoles in the sensory cortex were localised in several regions of the somatosensory area. Conclusions: The method gives new information relating to the localisation and dynamics between neuronal networks in the brain to pain evoked from the human oesophagus, and should be used to increase our understanding of clinical pain.

This study describes this dynamics with a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. We recorded depth EEG of epileptic patients performing a face detection task and found that the stimuli induced strong modulations in the gamma band (40 Hz to 200 Hz) in selective occipital, parietal and temporal sites, in particular the fusiform gyros, the lateral occipital gyros and the intra-parietal sulcus. Occipito-temporal sites were the first to be activated, closely followed by the parietal sites, while portions of the primary visual cortex seemed to deactivate temporarily. Some of those effects were found to be correlated across distant sites, suggesting that a coordinated balance between regional gamma activations and deactivations could be involved during visual perception.

Full automaticity marks the performance of the expert. Research on changes in brain activity from novice to skilled performance has been consistent with this behavioral characterization, showing that a highly practiced skill often requires less brain activation than before practice. Moreover, the decrease in brain activity with practice is most pronounced in the general or executive control processes mediated by frontal lobe networks. Consistent with these human cognitive neuroscience findings, animal neurophysiological evidence suggests that two elementary learning systems support different stages of skill acquisition. One system supports rapid and focused acquisition of new skills in relation to threats and violations of expectancies. The other involves a gradual process of updating a configural model of the environmental context. We collected dense array electroencephalography as participants performed an arbitrary associative ("code learning") task. We predicted that frontal lobe activity would decrease, whereas posterior cortical activity would increase, as the person gains the knowledge required for appropriate action. Both predictions were confirmed. In addition, we found that learning resulted in an unexpected increase in activity in the medial frontal lobe (the medial frontal negativity or MFN). Although preliminary, these findings suggest that the specific mechanisms of learning in animal neurophysiology studies may prove informative for understanding the neural basis of human learning and executive cognitive control.

From previous work in our laboratory, an increase in skin conductance level (SCL) and EEG alpha frequency, together with a global decrease in alpha power, were used as markers of arousal increase, and we sought to identify these effects with caffeine ingestion. Methods: We examined the effect of a single oral dose of caffeine (250 mg) in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled repeated-measures cross-over study. Eighteen healthy university students (mean age 21 years; 13/18 females) participated in two sessions I1week apart. EEG and autonomic data (SCL, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and respiration rate) from a 2 min eyes-closed epoch, commencing approximately 30 min after ingestion of caffeine or placebo, were examined. Results: Caffeine was associated with increased SCL, a global reduction in EEG power in the alpha band, and a global increase in alpha frequency. There were no cardiovascular effects. Conclusions: The positive results are consistent with recent electrodermal and EEG studies of arousal and Suggest that caffeine may be utilised as a task-free means of manipulating arousal in future investigations. Further work is necessary to clarify the absence of cardiovascular effects, and to integrate those data with emerging conceptualisations of arousal and activation. Significance: The present data support the use of caffeine as a simple tool to explore the role of arousal in both normal and atypical functioning, and this may be useful in determining the validity and importance of supposed hyper- or hypo-arousal in such syndromes as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).

The first study examines the use of information extracted from different neurological phenomena and the second study examines the wavelet coefficients extracted from a single neurological phenomenon. The analysis of the data of two subjects shows that both are successful at yielding low false positive rates. These studies also show that for each subject, a unique set of features and EEG channels lead to superior performance.

Recently, advances on information theory and nonlinear dynamical systems theory have allowed the study of various types of synchronization from time series. In this work, we first describe the multivariate linear methods most commonly used in neurophysiology and show that they can be extended to assess the existence of nonlinear interdependences between signals. We then review the concepts of entropy and mutual information followed by a detailed description of nonlinear methods based on the concepts of phase synchronization, generalized synchronization and event synchronization. In all cases, we show how to apply these methods to study different kinds of neurophysiological data. Finally, we illustrate the use of multivariate surrogate data test for the assessment of the strength (strong or weak) and the type (linear or nonlinear) of interdependence between neurophysiological signals.

In addition, there exist more evidences that both EEG and ERP signals are chaotic signal produced by the nonlinear dynamics system. To investigate the time-varying nonlinear dynamics of the EPP under specified cognitive tasks, a novel model based on the time-variant coupled map lattice system is proposed for this purpose. The time-variant largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) is also defined as the quantitative parameters to reveal the global characters of system and discover new information. Several simulations and real ERP signals under different fixed location cue were examined in terms of LLE spectra for studying the signal's dynamic complexity. The experimental results show that the brain chaos changes with time under different attention tasks of the information processing. The influence of the LLE with the scopes size of cues mainly occurs in P2 period. No simple linearly relationship between the scopes of cues and the influence of complexity is found.

The averaged EEG source images coincided well with simultaneously acquired fMRI activations. Strong correlation was found between the cortical source images of VEPs recorded inside and outside the scanner. Application of fMRI prior information strengthened correlation between estimated source images as well as resulted in source estimates with higher spatial resolution. The present results demonstrate that reliable cortical source images can be acquired during simultaneous fMRI scanning and they may be used for multimodal functional source imaging studies.

However, these repetition effects seem to be dependent on stimulus familiarity. We investigate the spatiotemporal correlates of repetition priming in cortical word-recognition networks and their modulation by stimulus familiarity (i.e., words vs pseudowords). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging results show reduced activation for repeated words in occipitotemporal cortical regions. Electroencephalogram recordings reveal a significant reduction of induced gamma-band responses (GBRs) between 200 and 350 ms after stimulus onset, accompanied by a decrease in phase synchrony between electrode positions. Pseudoword repetition, in contrast, leads to an activation increase in the same areas, to increased GBRs, and to an increased phase coupling. This spatiotemporal repetition by stimulus type interaction suggests that qualitatively distinct mechanisms are recruited during repetition priming of familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Repetition of familiar stimuli leads to a "sharpening" of extrastriate object representations, whereas the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli results in the "formation" of a novel cortical network by means of synchronized oscillatory activity. In addition to isolating these mechanisms, the present study provides the first evidence for a possible link between induced electrophysiological and hemodynamic measures of brain activity.

In an acquisition phase, either one stimulus or two stimuli became associated with a noun. During retrieval, probe stimuli comprising noun pairs were presented, and participants had to recall the respective associations and decided whether the nouns are linked to each other via a commonly associated stimulus. With this design, the quality and quantity of recalled associations was systematically varied, whereas the triggering stimuli and response requirements were held constant in all experimental conditions. Recall time proved to be directly related to the number of associations fanning out from a retrieval cue. Correspondingly, the hemodynamic response (blood oxygen level-dependent [BOLD] signal) and the amplitude of slow negative EEG potentials increased monotonically with the number of associations in both left anterior and bilateral posterior cortical areas. These effects were consistently observed with content-specific topographies for the two distinct materials. Furthermore, the multimethod approach revealed a close temporal link between response times and event-related slow potential changes on the one side and a close topographical and amplitude correspondence between slow potentials and BOLD signal changes on the other. The integrated results suggest that the neuronal dynamics of associative memory retrieval are equivalent for different types of associations, but that the structural basis is clearly content-specific.

Electrophysiological correlates of word repetition spacing: ERP and induced band power old/new effects with massed and spaced repetitions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; induced band power; upper alpha; theta; word recognition; continuous recognition task; recall	RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; BRAIN	The EEG was recorded in 21 participants who were required to make 'old' vs. 'new' decisions during a continuous recognition memory task with massed word repetitions (i.e., immediate repetitions) and spaced word repetitions (i.e., with six intervening words). After completion of the recognition task, they were given an unexpected free recall task. Behavioral measures revealed better recognition but worse free recall with massed repetitions, and worse recognition but better free recall with spaced repetitions. The ER-P data revealed that for the 350- to 450-ms time window (representing the N400) the repetition effect was widely distributed across central and parietal scalp sites and was larger with massed than with spaced word repetitions. Peak latencies of the late positive complex (LPC) at Pz were shorter for massed than for spaced repetitions. Mean area around peak measures at Pz indicated that the LPC repetition effect was also larger with massed than with spaced repetitions. In the frequency domain, we found a theta (4-6 Hz) induced band power (IBP) repetition effect for massed repetitions, with theta power in the 250- to 625-ms time window being larger to repeated words than to new words. For spaced repetitions, we found an upper alpha (10-12 Hz) IBP repetition effect with the upper alpha power in the 625- to 1000-ms time window being smaller to repeated words than to new words. With spaced repetitions, we further found that larger LPC and theta IBP repetition effects were associated with smaller recall performance enhancements. The results mainly support a deficient processing account of the spacing effect. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Van Strien, Jan W.; Verkoeijen, Peter P. J.

Healthy volunteers performed both face-comparison and pattem-comparison tasks during the same experiment. Two cues switched their attention between the tasks, while the two consecutive stimuli contained both faces (familiar and nonfamiliar faces in separate series) and patterns superimposed. It seems that the face familiarity influences multiple sites in ERPs. In addition to differences on latencies later than 300 ins in frontal and occipitoparietal areas, we found differences in the 180-280 ms interval (frontocentral and posterior temporal areas), and even earlier, in 80-170 ms. The differences in 340-600 ms were highly reduced when attention was not directed to faces. The differences in 180-280 ms were present; however, they were observed in smaller areas. The locations for differences in 80-170 ins were task-specific. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All these methods are tested and compared on several ARX, Poisson and nonlinear models, and on neurophysiological data (depth EEG). The results show that LGC, DCOH and PDC are not very robust in relation to nonlinear linkages but they seem to correctly find linear linkages if only the autoregressive parts are nonlinear. PNGC is extremely dependent on the choice of parameters. Moreover, LGC and PNGC may give misleading results in the case of causality on a spectral band, which is illustrated by our neurophysiological database.

Methods. - Event-Retated Potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a sample of 30 university students white they performed a computerized version of the WCST ERCoh was calculated for frontal and parietal electrodes for two specific moments: immediately before the response and after the feedback cues. Results. - Bad performers presented significantly reduced ERCoh at the right frontal region (in alpha, beta-1 and beta-2 bands), while no consistent group differences emerged for parietal ERCoh. Furthermore, the strength of functional coupling (ERCoh) between midfrontal and right-frontal electrodes was a good predictor of WCST behavioural parameters, such as the percentage of perseverative errors or the number of categories achieved. Conclusions. - The results suggest that the right prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in executive functions, such as planning and foresight, tapped by the WCST Although the specificity of the WCST to explore frontal lesions has been recently questioned, the present findings support that prefrontal areas are specifically involved in the successful resolution of the test by healthy subjects.

J	Rosenfeld, JP; Skogsberg, KR				Rosenfeld, JP; Skogsberg, KR			P300-based Stroop study with low probability and target Stroop oddballs: The evidence still favors the response selection hypothesis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potential; Stroop task; P300 amplitude and latency; reaction time	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; P300 COMPONENT; INTERFERENCE; CONFLICT; STIMULI; CORTEX; TIME; TASK; ERP	This paper addresses the issue of the locus of action in cognitive processing during Stroop effects. It uses the P300 latency to assess stimulus processing effects, but, for the first time, under conditions in which Stroop stimuli are rare and target stimuli. The study was also concerned with demonstrating that apparent P300s during verbal responding are in fact uninterpretable due to contamination of EEG by speech-related artifact. Three studies were presented. In Study 1, there were 3 blocks, each containing 1 of 3 types of rare Stroop stimuli (p=.15), congruent, neutral, and incongruent. There were also 3 response modes: button press (BUTTON), speaking aloud (VERBAL), and speaking to self (SILENT). Three sessions were used, each for a different response style. The only task was to name the color on each trial. In the 2 non-verbal blocks, Reaction Time (RT) varied by stimulus type; congruent < neutral < incongruent. P300 latency was the same across blocks in these nonverbal conditions in which one saw the classic Pz > Cz > Fz distribution. The much larger, speech artifact-contaminated "P300s" in the VERBAL blocks did suggest a Stroop effect, especially at Fz and Cz, where "P300s" were larger than at Pz. In Study 2, there were 2 response modes, VERBAL and SILENT, and only two rare Stroop stimuli; neutral and incongruent, I per block. In each of these blocks, one word-color combination was a designated target requiring a unique response. The subject was to name the color followed by a yes or no to categorize the target or non-target. Again the RT for incongruents was greater than RT for neutrals, without a parallel effect in P300 latency. Again, the rostral ERPs appeared artifactual in the VERBAL condition. Study 3 was a replication of the second study, except that motivated subjects, versus Psychology pool recruits, were used. The latency-RT correlation still failed to obtain. Thus, using classic P300-eliciting antecedents - rare and target (Stroop) stimuli-this study supports the view that the locus of Stroop interference is in response processing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We assess the evidence that a simple type of learning-priming-can occur without consciousness. Although priming has been shown to be a small but persistent phenomenon in surgical patients (Merikle & Daneman, 1996) there is reason to question whether it occurs implicitly due to problems in detecting awareness using typical clinical signs. This paper reviews the published studies on priming during anesthesia that have included a measure of awareness or of anesthetic depth. We conclude that perceptual priming, but not conceptual priming, takes place in the absence of conscious awareness. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: SEPs were recorded in 60 severe TBI with duration of acute coma> 7 days. N20-P25 amplitudes, their side-to-side asymmetry and CCT were measured. SEPs on each hemisphere were classified as normal (N), pathological (P) or absent (A). 'Awakening' and disability were assessed after at least 12 months using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). SEP predictive value was compared with GCS and EEG reactivity. Results: Seventy-five percent regained consciousness. 29/60 had a good outcome (GOS 4-5) and 31/60 had a bad outcome (GOS 1-3). According to the ROC curve, SEP findings were classified in 3 grades. Grade I (NN, NP) had PPV of 93.1% for 'awakening' and 86.2% for good outcome. Grade III (AA) had PPV of 100% forbad outcome and 72.7 % for 'awakening'. Grade II (PP, NA, PA) was associated with the wider range of outcome. A multivariate analysis including SEP grading, GCS and EEG reactivity did not increase the percentage of cases prognosticated by SEP alone. Conclusions: We confirm the high predictive value of SEPs in TBI, which is greater than GCS and EEG reactivity. Indeed, SEP grades I and III were able to predict the correct prognosis in more than 80% of severe TBI. Therefore, SEPs should be used more widely in the prognosis of severe TBI. Significance: Differently from post-anoxic, in post-traumatic coma the presence of normal SEPs has a favourable predictive value both for 'awakening' and disability. We think that in literature enough attention has still not been paid to this finding. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this pilot study 12 subjects ( 7 male, 5 female, average age 43.9-years-old) underwent recording of auditory and visual P300 cognitive evoked potentials prior to liver transplantation and again 3-6 months subsequent to transplantation. Significant increases ( p< 0.01) in P300 visual amplitude, as well as significant decreases in visual ( p< 0.01) and auditory latencies ( p< 0.01) were observed following transplantation. Auditory amplitudes increased but not to a statistically significant degree. P300 cognitive evoked potentials may provide a useful tool for monitoring the cerebral status of liver transplantation patients if combined with established methods such as cognitive testing and EEG. Further research of their usage with these patients is warranted.

J	Li, L; Yao, DZ				Li, Ling; Yao, Dezhong			A new method of spatio-temporal topographic mapping by correlation coefficient of K-means cluster	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; k-means cluster; VEPs; correlated sources	VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COMPONENT IDENTIFICATION; EEG; ERP	It would be of the utmost interest to map correlated sources in the working human brain by Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). This work is to develop a new method to map correlated neural sources based on the time courses of the scalp ERPs waveforms. The ERP data are classified first by k-means cluster analysis, and then the Correlation Coefficients (CC) between the original data of each electrode channel and the time course of each cluster centroid are calculated and utilized as the mapping variable on the scalp surface. With a normalized 4-concentric-sphere head model with radius 1, the performance of the method is evaluated by simulated data. CC, between simulated four sources (s(1)-s(4)) and the estimated cluster centroids (c(1)-c(4)), and the distances (Ds), between the scalp projection points of the s(1)-s(4) and that of the c(1)-c(4), are utilized as the evaluation indexes. Applied to four sources with two of them partially correlated (with maximum mutual CC = 0.4892), CC (Ds) between s(1)-s(4) and Cl-C4 are larger (smaller) than 0.893 (0.108) for noise levels NSR <= 0.2; Applied to four sources with two of them completely correlated, CC (Ds) between SI-S4 and Cl-C4 are larger (smaller) than 0.97367 (0.1898) for a random noise level NSR <= 0.2; Applied to 128, 64 and 32 recording electrodes, CC (Ds) between s(1)-s(4) and Cl-C4 are larger (smaller) than 0.9557 (0.4251) for a random noise level NSR = 0.15; And applied to the cases of spatially overlapped scalp activities, CC (Ds) between s(1)-s(4) and c(1)-c(4) are larger (smaller) than 0.9083 (0.4329) for a random noise level NSR = 0.15. Finally, the method successfully decomposed the ERPs collected in a spatial selective attention experiment into three clusters located at left, right occipital and frontal. The estimated vectors of the contra-occipital area demonstrate that attention to the stimulus location produces increased amplitude of the PI and NI components over the contra-occipital scalp. The estimated vector in the frontal area displays two large processing negativity waves around 100 ms and 250 ms when subjects are attentive, and there is a small negative wave around 140 ms and a P300 when subjects are unattentive. The results of simulations and real Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) data demonstrate the validity of the method in mapping correlated sources. This method may be an objective, heuristic and important tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences.

(International Journal of Psychophysiology 27 (1997) 183-199) demonstrated that subjects with low ability to solve a complex visuo-spatial imagery task show higher activity in occipital, parietal and frontal cortex during task processing than subjects with high ability. This finding has been interpreted in the sense of the so-called "neural efficiency" hypothesis, which assumes that the central nervous system of individuals with higher intellectual abilities is functioning in a more efficient way than the one of individuals with lower abilities. Using a higher spatial resolution of SCP recordings, and by employing the source localization method of LORETA (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography), we investigated this hypothesis by performing an extended replication of Vitouch et al.'s study. SCPs during processing of a visuo-spatial imagery task were recorded in pre-selected subjects with either high or low abilities in solving the imagery task. Topographic and LORETA analyses of SCPs revealed that a distributed network of extrastriate occipital, superior parietal, temporal, medial frontal and prefrontal areas was active during task solving. This network is well in line with former studies of the functional neuroanatomy of visuo-spatial imagery. Contrary to our expectations, however, the results of Vitouch et al. as well as of other studies supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis could not be confirmed since no difference in brain activity between groups was observed. This inconsistency between studies might be due to differing task processing strategies. While subjects with high abilities in the Vitouch et al. study seemed to use a visuo-perceptual task solving approach, all other subjects relied upon a visuo-motor task processing strategy.

Methods: Congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted adults performed a somatosensory perception task (experiment 1), which required to discriminate tactile stimuli at different fingers, and a mental imagery task (experiment 2), in which a previously haptically encoded map had to be mentally scanned. The EEG was recorded with 61 electrodes and was analyzed with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Results: Results showed a significant reduction of alpha power in the blind compared to the sighted controls over parieto-occipital recording sites in both tasks. Conclusions: It is speculated that brain structures, which have been associated with the generation of posterior alpha rhythms in sighted adults, including the geniculo-cortical pathway, depend on visual input and might either be reorganized or atrophied following blindness from birth. Significance: The present study demonstrates that oscillatory activity of the brain might serve as a marker of cortical reorganization. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Twenty boys with AD/HD Combined type and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects, aged 8 to 13 years, participated in this study. EEG was recorded from 21 sites during an eyes-closed resting condition. Wave-shape coherence was calculated for eight intrahemispheric electrode pairs (four in each hemisphere), and eight interhemispheric electrode pairs, within each of the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. AD/HD children were tested both off and, 6 months later, on a therapeutic dose of methylphenidate. In intrahemispheric comparisons, AD/HD children had lower theta coherences at long inter-electrode distances, and reduced lateralisation at both long and short-medium inter-electrode distances than controls. For interhemispheric comparisons, AD/HD children showed increased coherences in the frontal regions for the low frequency bands (delta and theta), and reduced coherences in the alpha bands in all other regions. These EEG coherences suggest reduced cortical differentiation and specialisation in AD/HD, particularly in the frontal regions. Methylphenidate did not produce any changes in coherence values. The lack of sensitivity of coherence measures to methylphenidate in the present study suggests that eyes-closed resting EEG coherence measures are associated with structural connectivity of the underlying regions of the brain rather than the degree of functionality of these regions. These results suggest the existence of structural as well as functional brain dysfunction in AD/HD. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that cortical integration of sensory information may underlie conscious perception and may be disrupted by anesthetics. A critical role in frontal-posterior interactions has been proposed, and gamma (20-60 Hz) oscillations have also been assigned an essential role in consciousness. Here we investigated whether general anesthetics may interfere with the exchange of information encoded in gamma oscillations between frontal and posterior cortices. Bipolar electrodes for recording of event-related potentials (ERP) were chronically implanted in the primary visual cortex, parietal association and frontal association cortices of six rats. Sixty light flashes were presented every 5 s, and ERPs were recorded at increasing concentrations of halothane or isoflurane (0-2%). Information exchange was estimated by transfer entropy, a novel measure of directional information transfer. Transfer entropy was calculated from 1-s wavelet-transformed ERPs. We found that (1) feedforward transfer entropy (FF-TE) and feedback transfer entropy (FB-TE) were balanced in conscious-sedated state; (2) anesthetics at concentrations producing unconsciousness augmented both FF-TE and FB-TE at 30 Hz but reduced them at 50 Hz; (3) reduction at 50 Hz was more pronounced for FB-TE, especially between frontal and posterior regions; (4) at high concentrations, both FF-TE and FB-TE at all frequencies were at or below conscious-sedated baseline. Our findings suggest that inhalational anesthetics preferentially impair frontal-posterior FB information transfer at high gamma frequencies consistent with the postulated role of frontal-posterior interactions in consciousness.

Passive P300 auditory event related potential paradigm was applied every months for 6 months. Aachen subtests were used for evaluating comprehension. Only a minority of the patients displayed the P300 at the baseline. Those patients had the best outcome at the Aachen comprehension subtest. Latency and amplitude changed over time in an unpredictable way. The number of patients presenting with the P300 also fluctuated, since some patients could regain the potential, whereas some other patients could lose that from month to month. Passive P300 is a monitor of recovery following global aphasia. A single passive P300 recording is useful for prognostic purposes. Repairing mechanisms in the first 6 months have a non-linear trend.

Movement-related desynchronization-synchronization (ERD/ERS) in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						action myoclonus; ERD/ERS; EEG; progressive myoclonus epilepsies	SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONUS EPILEPSY; CORTICAL REFLEX MYOCLONUS; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; EXCITABILITY; TOPIRAMATE; REACTIVITY; VALPROATE	We studied changes in event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), presenting with prominent action myoclonus. We analyzed the movement-related ERD/ERS in alpha and beta frequency bands in 15 patients using self-paced finger extension as a motor paradigm and we compared the results with those obtained in 12 healthy volunteers. In all ULD patients, alpha- and beta-ERD regularly occurred with onset and location similar to that found in healthy controls, but the desynchronization of alpha activity was significantly greater than in controls (C3: -64.4 +/- 9.8% vs. -49.7 +/- 14.8%;p=0.004). Moreover, in the patients, both alpha- and beta-ERD spread toward frontal electrodes. In controls, the post-movement beta-ERS regularly occurred; it was absent in eight patients with severe action myoclonus, while, in seven patients with mild or moderate myoclonus, the beta-peak was significantly smaller with respect to that measured in controls (55.6 +/- 15.1% vs. 153.9 +/- 99.8%, p=0.006). The failure of beta-ERS well-correlated with motor impairment resulting from action myoclonus, whereas SSEPs and long-loop reflexes performed to detect signs of cortical hyperexcitability showed inconsistent changes. In ULD patients, ERD/ERS changes indicate an increased activation of motor cortex during movement planning and a great reduction of post-excitatory inhibition of motor cortex. The changes involving beta-ERS had a significant relationship with the functional disability in individual patients and might play a pathogenic role in the motor dysfunction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Synch before you speak: Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							COROLLARY DISCHARGE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; ABNORMALITIES; DYNAMICS; SPEECH	Objective: Synchronization of neural activity preceding self-generated actions may reflect the operation of the forward model, which acts to dampen sensations resulting from those actions. If this is true, pre-action synchrony should be related to subsequent sensory suppression. Deficits in this mechanism may be characteristic of schizophrenia and related to positive symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations. If so, schizophrenia patients should have reduced neural synchrony preceding movements, especially patients with severe hallucinations. Method: In 24 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 25 healthy comparison subjects, the authors related prespeech neural synchrony to subsequent auditory cortical responsiveness to the spoken sound, compared prespeech neural synchrony in schizophrenia patients and healthy comparison subjects, and related prespeech neural synchrony to auditory hallucination severity in patients. To assess neural synchrony, phase coherence of single-trial EEG preceding talking was calculated at a single site across repeated trials. To assess auditory cortical suppression, the N1 event-related brain potentials to speech sound onset during talking and listening were compared. Results: In healthy comparison subjects, prespeech neural synchrony was related to subsequent suppression of responsiveness to the spoken sound, as reflected in reduction of N1 during talking relative to listening. There was greater prespeech synchrony in comparison subjects than in patients, especially those with severe auditory hallucinations. Conclusions: These data suggest that EEG synchrony preceding speech reflects the action of a forward model system, which dampens auditory responsiveness to self-generated speech and is deficient in patients who hallucinate.

Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: Visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillation; 40 Hz; contrast; visual	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; REACTION-TIME; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VEP LATENCY; BOTTOM-UP; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERN	We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Creating enduring associations between arbitrary stimuli in this manner is also a prime example of what patients with amnesia find most difficult. To help develop a better understanding of this type of memory, we sought to obtain measures of the neural events responsible for successfully forming a new face-name association. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from high-density scalp EEG recordings in order to compare (1) memory for faces, (2) memory for names, and (3) memory for face-name: associations. Each visual face appeared simultaneously with a unique spoken name. Signals observed 200-800 ms after the onset of face-m me pairs predicted subsequent memory for faces, names, or face-name associations. Difference potentials observed as a function of subsequent memory performance were not identical for these three memory tests, nor were potentials predicting associative memory equivalent to the sum of potentials predicting item memory, suggesting that different neural events at the time of encoding are relevant for these distinct aspects of remembering people.

This paradigm is frequently used to assess the automatic number processing abilities of children. Currently it is unclear whether an equally refined evaluation of numerical magnitude occurs in both controlled (the numerical comparison task of the NSP) and automatic (the physical comparison task of the NSP) numerical comparison in both children and adults. One of our objectives was to respond this question by measuring the speed of controlled and automatic magnitude processing in children and adults in the NSP. Another objective was to determine how the immature executive functions of children affect their cognitive functions relative to adults in numerical comparison. Methods and results: The speed of numerical comparison was determined by monitoring the electroencephalographic (EEG) numerical distance effect: The amplitude of EEG measures is modulated as a function of numerical distance between the to-be-compared digits. EEG numerical distance effects occurred between 140-320 ms after stimulus presentation in both controlled and automatic numerical comparison in all age groups. Executive functions were assessed by analyzing facilitation and interference effects on the latency of the P3b event-related potential component and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Interference effects were more related to response than to stimulus processing in children as compared with adults. The LRP revealed that the difficulty to inhibit irrelevant response tendencies was a major factor behind interference in the numerical task in children. Conclusion: The timing of the EEG distance effect suggests that a refined evaluation of numerical magnitude happened at a similar speed in each age group during both controlled and automatic magnitude processing. The larger response interference in children than in adults suggests that despite the similar behavioural profile of children and adults, partially different cognitive processes underlie their performance in the NSP.

Our data suggest that caution is needed when using the NSP to compare behavioural markers of the numerical processing skills of children and adults.

Delta and theta event-related oscillations (ERO) are the major contributors to the P300 signal. The total and evoked power in delta and theta bands in the 300 to 700 ins post-stimulus window (corresponding to the zone of P300 maxima) was compared between adolescent offspring of alcoholics (high-risk) and age-matched normal controls (low-risk), to assess the utility of the risk markers. Methods: EEG was recorded during the performance of a visual oddball task. The S-transform algorithm decomposed the EEG signals into different frequency bands and the group differences in total and evoked power in the oscillatory responses during the P300 time window (300 to 700 ins) were analyzed using a multivariate design. Similar analysis was performed on P300 peak amplitude for the target. Results: The high-risk group showed significantly lower parietal post-stimulus evoked and total power in the delta band for targets. A decrease in total power was seen centrally and parietally in the theta band. The P300 peak amplitude in the parietal electrodes was also significantly lower in the high-risk group. Conclusions: The decreased total theta power and total and evoked delta power for visual targets in high risk individuals may serve as an endophenotypic marker in the development of alcoholism and other disinhibitory disorders. The differences seen between the offspring of alcoholics and controls may have a cholinergic basis. The ERO measures appear to be more robust than the P300 amplitude in differentiating the groups.

The psychological and neurophysiological concomitants of mindfulness forms of meditation	ACTA NEUROPSYCHIATRICA			English	Review						EEG; meditation; mindfulness; neuroimaging; Zen	DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; STRESS REDUCTION INTERVENTION; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; COGNITIVE THERAPY; COMMITMENT THERAPY; ZEN MEDITATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; VISUAL SENSITIVITY; CHRONIC PAIN	Objective: To provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the psychological and neurophysiological literature pertaining to mindfulness meditation. Methods: A search for papers in English was undertaken using PsycINFO (from 1804 onward), MedLine (from 1966 onward) and the Cochrane Library with the following search terms: Vipassana, Mindfulness, Meditation, Zen, Insight, EEG, ERP, fMRI, neuroimaging and intervention. In addition, retrieved papers and reports known to the authors were also reviewed for additional relevant literature. Results: Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions appear to be effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, psychosis, borderline personality disorder and suicidal/self-harm behaviour. Mindfulness meditation per se is effective in reducing substance use and recidivism rates in incarcerated populations but has not been specifically investigated in populations with psychiatric disorders. Electroencephalography research suggests increased alpha, theta and beta activity in frontal and posterior regions, some gamma band effects, with theta activity strongly related to level of experience of meditation; however, these findings have not been consistent. The few neuroimaging studies that have been conducted suggest volumetric and functional change in key brain regions. Conclusions: Preliminary findings from treatment outcome studies provide support for the application of mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of affective, anxiety and personality disorders. However, direct evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation per se in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is needed. Current neurophysiological and imaging research findings have identified neural changes in association with meditation and provide a potentially promising avenue for future research.

Hirnpotentialanderungen bei Willkurbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflugers Archiv 1965;284:1-17], various source localization techniques in normal subjects and epicortical recording in epilepsy patients have disclosed the generator mechanisms of each identifiable component of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) to some extent. The initial slow segment of BP, called 'early BY in this article, begins about 2 s before the movement onset in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with no site-specificity and in the SMA proper according to the somatotopic organization, and shortly thereafter in the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally with relatively clear somatotopy. About 400 ms before the movement onset, the steeper negative slope, called 'late BP' in this article (also referred to as NS'), occurs in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) and lateral premotor cortex with precise somatotopy. These two phases of BP are differentially influenced by various factors, especially by complexity of the movement which enhances only the late BP. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta frequency EEG band before self-initiated movements shows a different temporospatial pattern from that of the BP, suggesting different neuronal mechanisms for the two. BP has been applied for investigating pathophysiology of various movement disorders. Volitional motor inhibition or muscle relaxation is preceded by BP quite similar to that preceding voluntary muscle contraction. Since BP of typical waveforms and temporospatial pattern does not occur before organic involuntary movements, BP is used for detecting the participation of the 'voluntary motor system' in the generation of apparently involuntary movements in patients with psychogenic movement disorders. In view of Libet et al.'s report [Libet B, Gleason CA, Wright EW, Pearl DK. Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential). The unconscious initiation of a freely voluntary act. Brain 1983;106:623-642] that the awareness of intention to move occurred much later than the onset of BP, the early BP might reflect, physiologically, slowly increasing cortical excitability and, behaviorally, subconscious readiness for the forthcoming movement. Whether the late BP reflects conscious preparation for intended movement or not remains to be clarified. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This usage of vigilance implies both the degree of arousal on the sleep-wake axis and the level of cognitive performance. There are many interacting neural and neurotransmitter systems that affect vigilance. Most studies of vigilance have relied on states where the sleep-wake state is altered, e.g. drowsiness, sleep-deprivation, and CNS-active drugs, but there are factors ranging from psychophysics to motivation that may impact vigilance. While EEG is the most commonly studied physiologic measure of vigilance, various measures of eye movement and of autonomic nervous system activity have also been used. This review paper discusses the underlying neural basis of vigilance and its assessment using physiologic tools. Since, assessment of vigilance requires assessment of cognitive function this aspect is also discussed. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We show this peak in the mean response time locked to the button press to be principally composed of triphasic, primarily low-theta band (4.5 Hz) complexes preceding but only partially phase-locked to the button press, with larger complexes preceding quicker motor responses. For 10 of 15 subjects, independent component analysis of the unaveraged 31-channel data identified a temporally independent medial frontal EEG process contributing to these phenomena. Low-resolution tomographic modeling localized related components of two 253-channel data sets to medial frontal polar cortex (BA32/10). The far-frontal low-theta complexes and concomitant mean P3f positivity may index cortical activity induced by paralimbic processes involved in disinhibiting impulsive motor responses to rewarding or goal-fulfilling stimuli or events.

The present investigation aimed to demonstrate that, by means of slow evoked potentials and using the same set of words in different tasks, it is possible to activate cortical networks that are spatially and temporally distinguished. Twenty healthy subjects had to evaluate, in a word pair matching session, whether two words rhymed (phonological task), were semantically related (semantic task) or were written in the same letter case (orthographic task). Slow wave amplitude was computed in three relevant time windows: the last 0.5 s of first word presentation (W1), the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) and the terminal CNV (tCNV). During W1 and iCNN7 intervals, both the orthographic and the phonological tasks were left lateralized. Furthermore, the phonological task was more lateralized than the orthographic because of a greater inhibition of the right hemisphere, whereas the orthographic task was characterized by a greater bilateral posterior activation. During the tCNV, only the phonological task remained left lateralized while orthographic and semantic were bilaterally distributed. Although the use of the same set of words tends to activate widely overlapped networks, in the present research task manipulation was effective in demonstrating task dependent differences in brain lateralization. Thus, the present paradigm and the adopted tasks are especially suited for studying deficit and recovery of language in patients affected by linguistic disorders such as developmental dyslexia and aphasia.

Here we test the possibility of modifying ongoing activity associated with working memory by tDCS. The concept of working memory applies to a system that is capable of transiently storing and manipulating information, as an integral part of the human memory system. We applied anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current ( tDCS) stimulation ( 260 mu A) bilaterally at fronto-cortical electrode sites on the scalp over 15 min repeatedly ( 15 sec-on/15sec-off) as well as sham-tDCS while subjects performed a modified Sternberg task. Results: Reaction time linearly increased with increasing set size. The slope of this increase was closely comparable for real and sham stimulation indicating that our real stimulation did not effect time required for memory scanning. However, reaction time was slowed during both anodal and cathodal stimulation as compared to placebo ( p < 0.05) indicating that real stimulation hampered neuronal processing related to response selection and preparation. Conclusion: Intermittent tDCS over lateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task impairs central nervous processing related to response selection and preparation. We conclude that this decrease in performance by our protocol of intermittent stimulation results from an interference mainly with the temporal dynamics of cortical processing as indexed by event-related sustained and oscillatory EEG activity such as theta.

The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between interoceptive awareness and emotion-related brain activity. 44 participants (16 male, 28 female) first underwent a heartbeat perception task and then were categorised either as good (n = 22) or poor heartbeat perceivers (n = 22). A total of 60 different pictures (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral) from the International Affective Picture System served as emotional stimuli. EEG (61 electrodes) and EOG were recorded during slide presentation. After each slide, the subjects had to rate emotional valence and arousal on a 9-point self-report scale. Good heartbeat perceivers scored the emotional slides significantly more arousing than poor heartbeat perceivers; no differences were found in the emotional valence ratings. The visually evoked potentials of good and poor heartbeat perceivers showed significant differences in the P300 and in the slow-wave latency ranges. Statistical analyses revealed significantly higher P300 mean amplitudes for good heartbeat perceivers (averaged across all 60 slides) than for poor heartbeat perceivers. In the slow-wave range, this effect was found for affective slides only. Heartbeat perception scores correlated significantly and positively with both the mean arousal rating as well as with the mean amplitudes in the P300 time window and the slow-wave window. Our results demonstrate a strong relationship between the perception of cardiac signals and the cortical processing of emotional stimuli, as would be postulated for example by the James-Lange theory of emotions.

The precise nature of this interaction, however, is poorly understood. A positive correlation between BOLD-response and cortically generated local field potentials, which reflect the weighted average of synchronized dentrosomatic components of pyramidal synaptic signals, has been demonstrated. Likewise, positive BOLD-responses have been reported in conjunction with scalp-recorded synchronized electromagnetic activity by a number of groups. However, it is not yet clear how the opposite electromagnetic pattern, i.e. cortical clesynchronization, is related to the BOLD signal. To address this question, we conducted a combined event-related fMRl and 275 sensor whole-head MEG study during identical visual two-choice reaction time task conditions in 10 human subjects. We found complex sequences of MEG-synchronization and desynchronization across a wide frequency range in the visual and motor area in close correspondence with "locales" of positive BOLD-responses. These results indicate that a correspondence of positive BOLD-responses is not exclusively found for cortical synchronization but also for desynchronization, suggesting that the relationship between BOLD signals and electromagnetic activity might be more complex than previously thought.

The P3 produced by auditory stimuli presented in a passive and active condition: Modulation by visual stimuli	ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS			English	Article						ERP; P3; cross-modal attention; attentional resources; auditory modality; visual modality	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP; AMPLITUDE; INTERVAL; STARTLE; UTILITY; TASKS; WAVE	The aim of this study was to investigate how the processing of auditory stimuli is affected by the simultaneous presentation of visual stimuli. This was approached in an active and passive condition, during which a P3 was elicited in the human EEG by single auditory stimuli. Subjects were presented tones, either alone or accompanied by the simultaneous exposition of pictures. There were two different sessions. In the first, the presented tones demanded no further cognitive activity from the subjects (passive or 'ignore' session), while in the second session subjects were instructed to count the tones (active or 'count' session). The central question was whether inter-modal influences of visual stimulation in the active condition would modulate the auditory P3 in the same way as in the passive condition. Brain responses in the ignore session revealed only a small P3-like component over the parietal and frontal cortex, however, when the auditory stimuli co-occurred with the visual stimuli, an increased frontal activity in the window of 300-500 ms was observed. This could be interpreted as the reflection of a more intensive involuntary attention shift, provoked by the preceding visual stimulation. Moreover, it was found that cognitive load caused by the count instruction, resulted in an evident P3, with maximal amplitude over parietal locations. This effect was smaller when auditory stimuli were presented on the visual background. These findings might support the thesis that available resources were assigned to the analysis of visual stimulus, and thus were not available to analyze the subsequent auditory stimuli. This reduction in allocation of resources for attention was restricted to the active condition only, when the matching of a template with incoming information results in a distinct P3 component. It is discussed whether the putative source of this effect is a change in the activity of the frontal cortex.

The most common diagnostic subtypes of MCI have an episodic memory disorder (amnestic MCI) occurring either alone [single domain (SD)] or with other cognitive impairments [multiple domain (MD)]. Previous studies report increased amplitudes of auditory cortical potentials in MCI, but their relationships to MCI subtypes and clinical outcomes were not defined. We studied subjects with amnestic MCI (n = 41: 28 SD, 13 MD), Alzheimer's disease (n = 14), and both younger (n = 22) and age-matched older controls (n = 44). Baseline auditory sensory (P50, N100) and cognitive potentials (P300) were recorded during an auditory discrimination task. MCI patients were followed for up to 5 years, and outcomes were classified as (i) continued diagnosis of MCI (MCI-stable, n = 16), (ii) probable Alzheimer's disease (MCI-convert, n = 18), or other outcomes (n = 7). Auditory potentials were analysed as a function of MCI diagnosis and outcomes, and compared with young, older controls, and mild Alzheimer's disease subjects. P50 amplitude increased with normal ageing, and had additional increases in MCI as a function of both initial diagnosis (MD > than SD) and outcome (MCI-convert > MCI-stable). P300 latency increased with normal ageing, and had additional increases in MCI but did not differ among outcomes. We conclude that auditory cortical sensory potentials differ among amnestic MCI subtypes and outcomes occurring up to 5 years later.

Thus, investigating declarative memory formation during sleep may allow us to isolate mnemonic core processes. The most feasible approach to memory formation during sleep is the analysis of dream memories. Lesion and imaging studies have demonstrated that encoding of declarative memories, i.e. consciously accessible events and facts, depends on operations within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus, two substructures of the medial temporal lobe. Successful memory formation is accompanied by a transient rhinal-hippocampal interaction. Consequently, the ability to memorize dreams may be related to mediotemporal connectivity. Therefore, we recorded EEG during sleep from rhinal and hippocampal depth electrodes implanted in 12 epilepsy patients (eight women, mean age 41.1 +/- 6.4 years). They were awakened during rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and asked to recall their dream. Via coherence analyses we show that rhinal-hippocampal connectivity values are approximately twice as large for patients with good dream recall versus those patients with poor recall. This suggests that rhinal-hippocampal connectivity is a key factor in determining declarative memory formation.

EEG recordings (56 channels; EB-Neuro) were performed from 17 elite karate athletes, 14 amateur karate athletes, and 15 non-athletes, during the observation of pictures with basket and karate attacks. They clicked a right (left) keyboard button for basket or karate attacks at right (left) monitor side. Results pointed to no difference of late occipital VEPs/ERPs after basket versus karate attacks in the non-athletes (300-800 ms post-stimulus). In the amateur karate athletes, occipital VEPs/ERPs at 300-450 ms post-stimulus (P3-P4 components) were lower in amplitude for the karate than basket attacks. In the elite karate athletes, the occipital VEPs/ERPs further declined in amplitude at 300-450 ms post-stimulus (P3 and P4 components) and enhanced at about 800 ms post-stimulus ("N2'' component) for the karate than basket attacks. A control study showed that in 10 elite fencers, the same was true for the fencing compared to the karate attacks. These results support the hypothesis that peculiar mechanisms of occipital neural synchronization can be observed in elite athletes during visuo-spatial demands, possibly to underlie sustained visuo-spatial attention and self-control.

Since ACC is considered the generator of the error-related negativity (ERN), we expected the ERN to be sensitive to the degree of psychopathy among violent offenders. EEG was collected while offenders and controls responded to a standard letter flanker task and to a face flanker task that required discrimination between angry and fearful expressions. Offenders were as accurate as controls on the letter flanker task but made more errors in emotion discrimination on the face flanker task. ERNs elicited by letter flanker errors did not differ across groups but were markedly reduced in the offenders in the face flanker condition. These effects were related to the degree of psychopathy within the offender group. Source modelling of the ERN also indicated an atypical response for psychopaths when error monitoring required the discrimination of affectively based information. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Twenty-four subjects performed an index finger extension. They also received three types of electrical stimulation (cutaneous stimulation of the index finger, single and repetitive stimulation of the median nerve). An EEG was recorded using 38 scalp electrodes. Beta ERS was analyzed with respect to movement offset and the stimulus (or the last stimulus in the series, for repetitive stimulation). Results: Median nerve stimulation and finger extension induced more intense beta ERS than cutaneous stimulation. The magnitude of beta ERS induced by movement or by single median nerve stimulation were not different but post movement beta synchronization duration was longer than beta ERS induced by single median nerve stimulation and cutaneous stimulation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that beta ERS depends on the type and quantity of the afferent input. Significance: This work reinforces the hypothesis of a relationship between beta ERS and processing of afferent inputs. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this article, we assume a source model with more sources than sensors (M > N), only L < N of which are assumed to have a non-Gaussian distribution. We argue that this is a realistic source model for a variety of applications, and prove that for ICA algorithms designed for complete bases (i.e., algorithms assuming N=M) based on mutual information the mixture coefficients of the L non-Gaussian sources can be reconstructed in spite of the overcomplete mixture model. Further, it is shown that the reconstructed temporal activity of non-Gaussian sources is arbitrarily mixed with Gaussian sources. To obtain estimates of the temporal activity of the non-Gaussian sources, we use the correctly reconstructed mixture coefficients in conjunction with linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filtering. This results in estimates of the non-Gaussian sources minimizing the variance of the interference of other sources. The approach is applied to the denoising of Event Related Fields recorded by MEG, and it is shown that it performs superiorly to ordinary ICA.

The presentations involve studies using diverse neuroergonomic methods and application domains. The methods include neuroimaging and physiological techniques such as electro-encephalography (EEG), event-related brain potentials (ERPs), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCDS), near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS), and (in animals and patients with brain disorders) single-unit recordings. The use of virtual environments for detecting impairments in individuals with cognitive and brain disorders is also described. In addition, studies applying molecular genetic methods to the study of individual differences in cognition are presented. Finally, implications for neuroergonomics from nanotechnology and biotechnology are discussed.

We investigated the maturation of preparation processes towards a fast motor reaction in 74 healthy right-handed children aged 6 to 18 years and analyzed the topography of the late component of contingent negative variation (ICNV) in a 64-electrode high density sensor array. While adolescents from about 12 years on showed a bilaterally distributed centro-parietal maximum like adults do, younger children almost completely missed the negativity over the left central area contralaterally to the side of the anticipated movement. The reason, as revealed by current source density, was that only adolescents showed significant evoked activity of the left pre-/primary motor and supplementary/cingulate motor areas, while in contrast both age groups displayed significant current sinks over the right (ipsilateral) centrotemporal area and right posterior parietal cortex. Spatio-temporal source analysis confirmed that negativity over the right posterior parietal area could not be explained by a projection via volume conduction from frontal areas involved in motor preparation but represented an independent component with a different maturational course most likely related to sensory attention. Significant event-related desynchronization of alpha-power over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex was found in the younger age group, indicating that also 6- to 11-year-old children were engaged in motor preparation. Thus, the missing current sink over the contalateral sensorimotor cortex during late CNV in 6- to 11-year-old children might reflect the immaturity of a specific subcomponent of the motor preparation system which is related to evoked (late CNV) but not induced activity (alpha-ERD).

These impairments have been discussed as being associated with deficits in self-regulated action monitoring and anticipatory action plan generation. To study electrophysiological correlates of executive control - specifically action monitoring and action rule switching - under varying WM load, we used a paradigm derived from classic N-back (WM) tasks and requiring monitoring of simple actions. We focused on event-related changes in post-stimulus theta oscillatory activity during varying cognitive and WM demand in healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. The results show significant WM load and rule-switching-related increases of post-stimulus theta amplitude at fronto-central locations in controls. In patients with schizophrenia, there was no such modulation, but - apart from an increased early theta at left temporal locations - generally reduced late theta responses in all tasks and at all locations. Furthermore, the patients with schizophrenia showed significant differences in their error patterns, which imply differences in automation and anticipation of actions between controls and patients. These findings suggest that theta oscillations are involved in mediating frontal lobe activity and functions related to enhanced executive control. We conclude that the patients with schizophrenia showed deficits in acquiring a mental task set which appear to be associated with impairments in action monitoring and task-specific regulation of executive control.

What you see is not (always) what you hear: Induced gamma band responses reflect cross-modal interactions in familiar object recognition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; event-related potentials; EEG; gamma; human; multisensory; object recognition; oscillations; visual	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; HUMANS; CORTEX; BRAIN; TASK; REPETITION; SYNCHRONY; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Gamma-band responses (GBRs) are hypothesized to reflect neuronal synchronous activity related to activation of object representations. However, it is not known whether synchrony in the gamma range is also related to multisensory object processing. We investigated the effect of semantic congruity between auditory and visual information on the human GBR. The paradigm consisted of a simultaneous presentation of pictures and vocalizations of animals, which were either congruent or incongruent. EEG was measured in 17 students while they attended either the auditory or the visual stimulus and performed a recognition task. Behavioral results showed a congruity effect, indicating that information from the unattended modality affected behavior. Irrelevant visual information affected auditory recognition more than irrelevant auditory information affected visual recognition, suggesting a bias toward reliance on visual information in object recognition. Whereas the evoked (phase-locked) GBR was unaffected by congruity, the induced (non-phase-locked) GBR was increased for congruent compared with incongruent stimuli. This effect was independent of the attended modality. The results show that integration of information across modalities, based on semantic congruity, is associated with enhanced synchronized oscillations at the gamma band. This suggests that gamma-band oscillations are related not only to low-level unimodal integration but also to the formation of object representations at conceptual multisensory levels.

Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: Sound intensity modulates auditory evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillations; 40 Hz; phase-locking; sound intensity	CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIDDLE-LATENCY RESPONSE; OSCILLATING-POTENTIALS; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; VISUAL-STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; CORTEX; DEPENDENCE; PERCEPTION	We studied the effect of different sound intensities on the auditory evoked gamma-band response (GBR). Previous studies observed oscillatory gamma activity in the auditory cortex of animals and humans. For the visual modality, it has been demonstrated that the GBR can be modulated by top-down (attention, memory) as well as bottom-up factors (stimulus properties). Therefore, we expected to find a sound intensity modulation for the auditory GBR. 21 healthy participants without hearing deficits were investigated in a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal tones were presented at three systematically varied sound intensities (30, 45, 60 dB hearing level). The results of the auditory evoked potentials were predominantly consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, we observed an augmentation of the evoked GBR with increasing sound intensity. The analysis indicated that this intensity difference in the GBR amplitude most likely arises from increased phase-locking. The results demonstrate a distinct dependency between sound intensity and gamma-band oscillations. Future experiments that investigate the relationship between auditory evoked GBRs and higher cognitive processes should therefore select stimuli with an adequate sound intensity and control this variable to avoid confounding effects. In addition, it seems that gamma-band activity is more sensitive to exogenous stimulus parameters than evoked potentials. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we present event-related brain potentials (ERPs) obtained from sixteen healthy individuals while they discriminated complex instrumental tones (piano, trumpet, and violin) or simple sine wave tones that lack the principal features of timbre. Data analysis yielded enhanced NI and P2 responses to instrumental tones relative to sine wave tones. Furthermore, we applied an electrical brain imaging approach using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to estimate the neural sources of N1/P2 responses. Separate significance tests of instrumental vs. sine wave tones for NI and P2 revealed distinct regions as principally governing timbre perception. In an initial stage (N1), timbre perception recruits left and right (peri-)auditory fields with an activity maximum over the right posterior Sylvian fissure (SF) and the posterior eingulate (PCC) territory. In the subsequent stage (P2), we uncovered enhanced activity in the vicinity of the entire eingulate gyrus. The involvement of extra-auditory areas in timbre perception may imply the presence of a highly associative processing level which might be generally related to musical sensations and integrates widespread medial areas of the human cortex. In summary, our results demonstrate spatio-temporally distinct stages in timbre perception which not only involve bilateral parts of the peri-auditory cortex but also medially situated regions of the human brain associated with emotional and auditory imagery functions.

Methods: Two experiments were conducted. In the first, we assessed the use of independent component analysis (ICA) as a pre-processing filter. In the second, we explored the use of an optimized differential reference (ODR) for minimizing artifacts. Results: Both ICA and the ODR can minimize the artifact and allow measurement of CAEP responses. Conclusions: When using a large number of recording electrodes ICA can be used to minimize the implant artifact. When using a single electrode montage an optimized differential reference is adequate to minimize the artifact. Significance: The use of an optimized differential reference could allow cortical evoked potentials to be used in routine clinical assessment of auditory pathway development in children and adults fit with cochlear implants.

Dynamic sculpting of brain functional connectivity and mental rotation aptitude	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review						functional connectivity; synchronization; steady state visually evoked potential; partial coherence; mental rotation; aptitude	HUMAN WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; ALPHA POWER; EEG ALPHA; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; GAMMA	Changes in long-range synchronization are considered a key mechanism for the integration and segregation of cortical regions mediating cognitive processes. Such synchronization or functional connectivity is reflected in human electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence and in steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) coherence. In this chapter, the relationship between cognitive proficiency in the mental rotation task (MRT) and functional connectivity reflected in SSVEP event-related partial coherence is described. The capacity to estimate changing levels of functional connectivity with a relatively high temporal resolution makes it possible to examine the relationship between functional connectivity at various points in time and aptitude. In the current study, the relationships between functional connectivity and two mental rotation aptitude measures, mental rotation speed and mental rotation accuracy, are described. We observed that functional connectivity was correlated with proficiency and that this correlation was both positive and negative for various regions and points in time. It is suggested that cognitive aptitude is related to the brain's capacity to enhance functional connectivity or communication between cortical regions that are relevant to the cognitive demands while attenuating irrelevant communication. This capacity is termed functional connectivity sculpting, and it is proposed that functional connectivity sculpting may constitute an important functional component of the neural substrate of learning and aptitude.

Such integration can exist across a number of functional domains, with different frequency rhythms associated with each domain. Here, evidence is summarized which shows that delta oscillations depend on activity of motivational systems and participate in salience detection. Theta oscillations are involved in memory and emotional regulation. Alpha oscillations participate in inhibitory processes which contribute to a variety of cognitive operations such as attention and memory. The importance of inhibitory functions associated with alpha oscillations increases during the course of evolution. In ontogenesis, these functions develop later and may be more sensitive to a variety of detrimental environmental influences. In a number of developmental stages and pathological conditions, a deficient alpha and/or increased slow-wave activity are associated with cognitive deficits and a lack of inhibitory control. It is shown that slow-wave and alpha oscillations are reciprocally related to each other. This reciprocal relationship may reflect an inhibitory control over motivational and emotional drives which is implemented by the prefrontal cortex. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.

J	Hautus, MJ; Johnson, BW				Hautus, MJ; Johnson, BW			Object-related brain potentials associated with the perceptual segregation of a dichotically embedded pitch	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							AUDITORY SCENE ANALYSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTEX; EEG; REPRESENTATION; LOCALIZATION	The cortical mechanisms of perceptual segregation of concurrent sound sources were examined, based on binaural detection of interaural timing differences. Auditory event-related potentials were measured from 11 healthy subjects. Binaural stimuli were created by introducing a dichotic delay of 500-ms duration to a narrow frequency region within a broadband noise, and resulted in a perception of a centrally located noise and a right-lateralized pitch (dichotic pitch). In separate listening conditions, subjects actively discriminated and responded to randomly interleaved binaural and control stimuli, or ignored random stimuli while watching silent cartoons. In a third listening condition subjects ignored stimuli presented in homogenous blocks. For all listening conditions, the dichotic pitch stimulus elicited an object-related negativity (ORN) at a latency of about 150-250 ms after stimulus onset. When subjects, were required to actively respond to stimuli, the ORN was followed by a P400 wave with a latency of about 320-420 ms. These results support and extend a two-stage model of auditory scene analysis in which acoustic streams are automatically parsed into component sound sources based on source-relevant cues, followed by a controlled process involving identification and generation of a behavioral response.

J	Moore, RA; Gale, A; Morris, PH; Forrester, D				Moore, Roger A.; Gale, Anthony; Morris, Paul H.; Forrester, Dave			Theta phase locking across the neocortex reflects cortico-hippocampal recursive communication during goal conflict resolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						septo-hippocampal system; goal conflict; theta power; theta coherence	SUPRAMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; POTENTIALS; STIMULUS; RHYTHM	EEG theta coherence, EEG theta power and subjective levels of response were examined in a continuous monitoring target detection task where periodic goal conflicts were introduced as 34 participants progressed through a stimulus sequence leading to response. EEG theta coherence revealed increases in phase locking between cortical areas at specific task stages involving goal conflict. Theta power also increased at points of goal conflict. The temporal characteristics of subjective response (measured continuously throughout the task) indicated a delay between participants actually experiencing goal conflict and overt indications of conflict. The starting point for the study was based on a specific aspect of Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] behavioural inhibition system model-namely, septo-hippocampal system involvement in the resolution of goal conflicts. We drew on Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] suggestion that septo-hippocampal involvement in this process is reflected by EEG theta. While their theory explains many of our findings, we also drew upon Given's [Givens, B., 1996. Stimulus-evoked reseting of the dentate theta rhythm: relation to working memory. Neuroreport 8(1), 159-163] proposal that the dentate theta rhythm is reset by behaviourally relevant stimuli. We made further proposals based on Makeig et al.'s [Makeig, S., Westerfield, M., Jung, T.-P., Enghoff, S., Townsend, J., Courchesne, E., Sejnowski, T.J., 2002. Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses. Science 295, 690-694] view that specific stimulus events invoke concurrent phase resetting and transient frequency domain coherence across different areas of neocortex. Relations with Go/NoGo event related potentials (P300 and N2; e.g., [Bokura, H., Yamaguchi, S., Kobayashi, S., 2001. Electrophysio logical correlates of response inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. Clin. Neurophysiol. 112 (12), 2224-2232]) were also discussed, as well as parallels between our data and interpretation, and other theoretical models of theta (e.g., [Kahana, M.J., Selig, D., Madsen, J.R., 2001. Theta returns. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 11, 739-744]). Suggestions for further research were made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Franken, IHA; Nijs, I; Van Strien, JW				Franken, IHA; Nijs, I; Van Strien, JW			Impulsivity affects mismatch negativity (MMN) measures of preattentive auditory processing	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						impulsivity; mismatch negativity; auditory processing; preattentive	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; PERSONALITY; CHILDREN; P300; INHIBITION; GENERATORS	The current study addresses the relation between impulsive personality and mismatch negativity (MMN) as measure of auditory processing. In a sample of 33 normals, MMN was measured and related to self-reported measures of impulsive behavior. Participants were tested using a passive auditory oddball paradigm while EEG recordings were obtained. It was found that the negative MMN amplitude at the left lateral cluster was negatively correlated with self-reported impulsivity, with high impulsive individuals showing larger MMN amplitudes than low impulsive individuals. This indicates that impulsivity is related to preattentive auditory processing, a process that is not dependent on response execution. In addition to the well-known involvement of top-down control in impulsivity, these findings implicate that the cognitive bottom-up processing of incoming stimuli is associated with individual differences in impulsivity. Since the source of the MMN is thought to be located in the auditory cortex, this suggests involvement of "lower order" temporal lobe processes in impulsive behaviors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Alternative mechanisms for regulating racial responses according to internal vs external cues	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prejudice; stereotyping; brain; internal motivation; external motivation; regulation; control; automatic; anterior cingulate; rostral cingulate; ERPs		Personal (internal) and normative (external) impetuses for regulating racially biased behaviour are well-documented, yet the extent to which internally and externally driven regulatory processes arise from the same mechanism is unknown. Whereas the regulation of race bias according to internal cues has been associated with conflict-monitoring processes and activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), we proposed that responses regulated according to external cues to respond without prejudice involves mechanisms of error-perception, a process associated with rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activity. We recruited low-prejudice participants who reported high or low sensitivity to non-prejudiced norms, and participants completed a stereotype inhibition task in private or public while electroencephalography was recorded. Analysis of event-related potentials revealed that the error-related negativity component, linked to dACC activity, predicted behavioural control of bias across conditions, whereas the error-perception component, linked to rACC activity, predicted control only in public among participants sensitive to external pressures to respond without prejudice.

The accuracy of source estimates is dependent upon many variables, one of which is the accurate description of the scalp positions of the EEG sensors. The objective of the present research was to develop a photogrammatic method for sensor localization that is fast, accurate, and easy to use. Methods: With the novel photogrammetric method, multiple cameras were arranged in a geodesic array, and images of the sensors on the subject's head were acquired allowing for the reconstruction of the 3D sensor positions. Results: Data from the photogrammetric method were compared with data acquired with the conventional electromagnetic method. The accuracy of the photogrammatic method, quantified as RMS of the measured positions and the actual known positions, was similar (mean error= 1.27 mm) to the electromagnetic method (mean error= 1.02 mm), and both approximated the localization error of the calibration object (mean error=0.56 mm). Conclusions: Accurate determination of 3D sensor positions can be accomplished with minimal demands on the time of the subject and the experimenter using the photogrammetric method.

Method: Twenty-four children (mean age = 9.6 yr) and 27 adults (mean age = 19.3 yr) were grouped according to their fitness (high, low) such that four approximately equal groups were compared. Fitness was assessed using the Fitnessgram test, and cognitive function was measured by neuroelectric and behavioral responses to a stimulus discrimination task. Results: Adults exhibited greater P3 amplitude at Cz and Pz sites, and decreased amplitude at the Oz site compared with children. High-fit children had greater P3 amplitude compared with low-fit children and high- and low-fit adults. Further, adults had faster P3 latency compared with children, and high-fit participants had faster P3 latency compared with low-fit participants at the Oz site. Adults exhibited faster reaction time than children; however, fitness interacted with age such that high-fit children had faster reaction time than low-fit children. Conclusion: These findings suggest that fitness was positively associated with neuroelectric indices of attention and working memory, and response speed in children. Fitness was also associated with cognitive processing speed, but these findings were not age-specific. These data indicate that fitness may be related to better cognitive functioning in preadolescents and have implications for increasing cognitive health in children and adults.

By taking the average, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) is increased, however some important information such as the strength of an evoked response and its dynamics (trial-by-trial variations) will be lost. The single-trial data analysis, on the other hand, can avoid this problem but the poor SNR is necessary to be improved. This paper presents a robust multi-stage data analysis method for the single-trial Magnetoencephalograph (MEG) and Electroencephalograph (EEG) recorded data. In the pre-processing stage, a robust subspace method is firstly applied for reducing a high-level unique component (additive noise) in single-trial raw data. In the second stage, a parameterized t-distribution ICA method is applied for further decomposing the overlapped common components (sources). In the post-processing stage, the source localization or scalp mapping technique and post-averaging technique are applied for visualizing the dynamic brain activities. The results on single-trial MEG and EEG data analysis both illustrate the high performances not only in the visualization of the behavior and location but also in the visualization of the trial-by-trial variations of individual evoked brain response.

A new paradigm of personalized medicine is emerging, which proactively tailors treatment to each individual's biological and psychological profile. The first proof-of-concept phase of personalized medicine has now been achieved. However, it has thus far focused on the use of genomic markers and on disorders of the body. The complexity of the brain is likely to require a shift from a single genetic marker focus to a more integrated approach in which additional brain-related information (neuromarkers) is taken into account. Codevelopment of genomic neuromarkers with new compounds in a personalized medicine approach will lead to increased drug R&D and treatment benefits. The emerging genomic neuromarker potential has begun to be incorporated into the template for the next version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V). The statistical power of large subject numbers in databases in general (and standardized databases in particular) provides an ideal source for elucidating the best genomic-neuromarker profiles (explaining most of the main-effects variance), which will empower a brain-related personalized medicine into mainstream clinical practice.

J	Duzel, E; Neufang, M; Heinze, HJ				Duzel, E; Neufang, M; Heinze, HJ			The oscillatory dynamics of recognition memory and its relationship to event-related responses	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						evoked response; MEG; phase resetting; single-trial analyses	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; NOVELTY DETECTION; BRAIN DYNAMICS; THETA; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; SIGNAL	The large-scale neural dynamics underlying higher cognitive processes are characterized by at least three types of stimulus-response: (i) the resetting of ongoing oscillatory brain activity without concomitant changes in response amplitude (phase alignment response); (ii) the addition of response amplitude to the ongoing brain activity in a time-locked manner (evoked response); and (iii) the addition of response amplitude that is not time-locked (induced response). Recent animal studies identified evoked responses as a characteristic neural response during stimulus perception but leave open the possibility that higher cognition, such as memory, is characterized more predominantly by phase alignment and/or induced responses. Using whole-head single-trial magnetoencephalography data from eight healthy adults, we show that all three types of response are related to the discrimination of old and new stimuli in a visual word recognition memory paradigm. In four subjects, single-trial evoked responses were the single constituents of event-related field old/new differences that have been previously related to familiarity-based and recollection-based recognition memory. While these data show that the oscillatory brain dynamics underlying recognition memory are characterized by a complex mix of three types of stimulus-response, they also clearly implicate evoked responses in higher cognitive processes such as recognition memory.

The results show that good perceptual but not memory performance is related to low alpha amplitudes. In addition, we found that large phase resetting in the alpha band, and enhanced early components in the ER-P are related to good performance in the discrimination task. The conclusion of this study is that in contrast to memory performance which is related to large resting alpha activity low alpha amplitudes are an indicator for good perceptual performance.

This insight, which disciplines like physics have embraced for a long time already, is gradually gaining importance in the study of cognitive processes by functional neuroimaging. In this field, causal mechanisms in neural systems are described in terms of effective connectivity. Recently, dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced as a generic method to estimate effective connectivity from neuroirnaging data in a Bayesian fashion. One of the key advantages of DCM over previous methods is that it distinguishes between neural state equations and modality-specific forward models that translate neural activity into a measured signal. Another strength is its natural relation to Bayesian model selection (BMS) procedures. In this article, we review the conceptual and mathematical basis of DCM and its implementation for functional magnetic resonance imaging data and event-related potentials. After introducing the application of BMS in the context of DCM, we conclude with an outlook to future extensions of DCM. These extensions are guided by the long-term goal of using dynamic system models for pharmacological and clinical applications, particularly with regard to synaptic plasticity.

Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychological, genetics, and neurochemical studies have implicated dysfunction of fronto-strialal structures (lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and putamen) as likely contributing to the pathophysiology of ADHD. This review 1) provides an overview of the main imaging techniques being used to study ADHD; 2) discusses their relative strengths and weaknesses, highlighting how they can complement one another; 3) shows how the functional imaging literature, which has built on the structural imaging data, is now being used to test focused hypotheses regarding the neurobiological substrate of ADHD; and 4) suggests guidelines for improving future functional imaging studies. Although at present there are no accepted uses for functional imaging in diagnosing ADHD, this article mentions possible future clinical uses of imaging in ADHD.

In event-related brain potentials (ERPs), such sound changes typically elicit several responses, including an enhanced N1, the mismatch negativity (MMN), and the P3a. In the present study, subjects were presented with a repeating sound of 75 ms in duration, which was occasionally replaced, in separate blocks, by a 15-ms, 25-ms, or 35-ms sound (large, medium, and small change, respectively). In the baseline block, only the frequent 75-ms sound was presented. During the scanning, the subjects were instructed to ignore the sounds while watching a silent wildlife documentary. We assumed that in this condition, the MMN mechanism would contribute more to the observed activation than the other change-related processes. We expected sound changes to elicit fMRI activation bilaterally in the supratemporal cortices, where the electric MMN is mainly generated, and that the magnitude of this activation would increase, with the magnitude of sound duration change. Unexpectedly, however, we found that only blocks with medium duration changes (25 ms) showed significant activation in the supratemporal cortex. In addition, as reported in some previous EEG and fMRI studies, contrasts between different levels of sound duration change revealed additional activation in the inferior frontal cortex bilaterally. This activation tended to be greater for the small and medium changes than for the large ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EMG and EOG artifacts in brain computer interface systems: A survey	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						brain computer interface; brain interface; electrooculography; electromyography; artifact rejection; artifact removal	BCI COMPETITION 2003; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; EEG-BASED COMMUNICATION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THOUGHT TRANSLATION DEVICE; BOOSTING BIT RATES; DATA SET IIB	It is widely accepted in the brain computer interface (130) research community that neurological phenomena are the only source of control in any BCI system. Artifacts are undesirable signals that can interfere with neurological phenomena. They may change the characteristics of neurological phenomena or even be mistakenly used as the source of control in BCI systems. Electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography (EMG) artifacts are considered among the most important sources of physiological artifacts in BCI systems. Currently, however, there is no comprehensive review of EMG and EOG artifacts in BCI literature. This paper reviews EOG and EMG artifacts associated with BCI systems and the current methods for dealing with them. More than 250 refereed journal and conference papers are reviewed and categorized based on the type of neurological phenomenon used and the methods employed for handling EOG and EMG artifacts. This study reveals weaknesses in BCI studies related to reporting the methods of handling EMG and EOG artifacts. Most BCI papers do not report whether or not they have considered the presence of EMG and FOG artifacts in the brain signals. Only a small percentage of BCI papers report automated methods for rejection or removal of artifacts in their systems. As the lack of dealing with artifacts may result in the deterioration of the performance of a particular BCI system during practical applications, it is necessary to develop automatic methods to handle artifacts or to design BCI systems whose performance is robust to the presence of artifacts.

Gamma and beta neural activity evoked during a sensory gating paradigm: Effects of auditory, somatosensory and cross-modal stimulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; electrophysiology; event-related potentials; event-related oscillations; perception; stimulus salience	ORIENTING RESPONSE; BAND ACTIVITY; MIDDLE-LATENCY; N1 WAVE; PROCESSING RESOURCES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; FRONTAL COMPONENTS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Stimulus-driven salience is determined involuntarily, and by the physical properties of a stimulus. It has recently been theorized that neural coding of this variable involves oscillatory activity within cortical neuron populations at beta frequencies. This was tested here through experimental manipulation of inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Methods: Non-invasive neurophysiological measures of event-related gamma (30-50 Hz) and beta (12-20 Hz) activity were estimated from scalp-recorded evoked potentials. Stimuli were presented in a standard "paired-stimulus" sensory gating paradigm, where the S1 (conditioning) stimulus was conceptualized as long-ISI, or "high salience", and the S2 (test) stimulus as short-ISI, or "low salience". Three separate studies were conducted: auditory stimuli only (N = 20 participants), somatosensory stimuli only (N = 20), and a cross-modal study for which auditory and somatosensory stimuli were mixed (N = 40). Results: Early (20-150 ms) stimulus-evoked beta activity was more sensitive to ISI than temporally-overlapping gamma-band activity, and this effect was seen in both auditory and somatosensory studies. In the cross-modal study, beta activity was significantly modulated by the similarity (or dissimilarity) of stimuli separated by a short ISI (0.5 s); a significant cross-modal gating effect was nevertheless detected. Conclusions: With regard to the early sensory-evoked response recorded from the scalp, the interval between identical stimuli especially modulates beta oscillatory activity. Significance: This is consistent with developing theories regarding the different roles of tempo rally-overlapping oscillatory activity within cortical neuron populations at gamma and beta frequencies, particularly the claim that the latter is related to stimulus-driven salience.

Such implicit temporal preparation is reflected in slow brain potentials and electroencephalographic oscillations and is attributed to interval timing mechanisms that probably depend on intact basal ganglia function. We investigated implicit timing in Parkinson's disease using a choice reaction task with two temporally regular stimulus presentation regimes, both including occasional deviant interstimulus intervals. Control subjects, but not patients, demonstrated temporal preparation in the form of an adjustment in time course of slow brain potentials to the duration of the interstimulus interval. However, in both groups, timing perturbations were accompanied by a slow brain potential amplitude drop at the time of expected stimulus occurrence, demonstrating intact representation of time in patients. In patients, oscillatory activity in beta and alpha bands showed attenuated preparatory desynchronization and reduced postmovement event-related synchronization, reflecting abnormal engagement and disengagement of sensorimotor and parietal areas. The results demonstrate profoundly deficient temporal preparation with preserved encoding of temporal information, a dissociation that may be explained by impaired dopamine-dependent motor learning. The results are discussed in the context of recent work on oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia.

We tested this segregation with human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and separate electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in the same subjects who listened passively to four sequences of repetitive spatial animal vocalizations in an event-related paradigm. Transitions between sequences constituted either a change of auditory pattern, location, or both pattern + location. This procedure allowed us to investigate the cortical correlates of natural auditory "what" and "where" changes independent of differences in the individual stimuli. For pattern changes, we observed significantly increased fMRI responses along the bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus, the planum polare, lateral Heschl's gyrus and anterior planum temporale. For location changes, significant increases of fMRI responses were observed in bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus and planum temporale. An overlap of these two types of changes occurred in the lateral anterior planum temporale and posterior superior temporal gyrus. The analysis of source event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed faster processing of location than pattern changes. Thus, our data suggest that passive processing of auditory spatial and pattern changes is dissociated both temporally and anatomically in the human brain. The predominant role of more anterior aspects of the superior temporal lobe in sound identity processing supports the role of this area as part of the auditory pattern processing stream, while spatial processing of auditory stimuli appears to be mediated by the more posterior parts of the superior temporal lobe.

There have been reports that GSM exposure increases alpha band power, and does so only when the signal is modulated at low frequencies (Huber, R., Treyer, V., Borbely, A. A., Schuderer, J., Gottselig, J. M., Landolt, H.P., Werth, E., Berthold,T., Kuster, N., Buck, A and Achermann, P. Electromagnetic fields, such as those from mobile phones, alter regional cerebral blood flow and sleep and waking EEG. J Sleep Res 11, 289-295, 2002.) However, as that research employed exposure distributions that are not typical of normal GSM handset usage (deep brain areas were overexposed), it remains to be determined whether a similar result patterning would arise from a more representative exposure. In this fully counterbalanced cross-over design, we recruited 12 participants and tried to replicate the modulation linked post exposure alpha band power increase described above, but with an exposure source (dipole antenna) more closely resembling that of a real GSM handset. Exposures lasted for 15 minutes. No changes to alpha power were found for either modulated or unmodulated radiofrequency fields, and thus we failed to replicate the above results. Possible reasons for this failure to replicate are discussed, with the main reason argued to be the lower and more representative exposure distribution employed in the present study. In addition we investigated the possible GSM exposure related effects on the non-linear features of the resting electroencephalogram using the Approximate Entropy (ApEn) method of analysis. Again, no effect was demonstrated for either modulated or unmodulated radiofrequency exposures.

In contrast, those transformations are not needed for similar, but nonvisually guided, arm movements. According to previous studies, these transformations are carried out by neuronal populations located in the parietal and frontal cortical areas (the so-called "dorsal visual stream"). However, it is still debated whether these processes are mediated by the sequential and/or parallel activation of the frontoparietal areas. To investigate this issue, we designed a task where the same visual cue could represent either the target of a reaching/pointing movement or the go-signal for a similar but non-targeting arm movement. By subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from healthy subjects performing the two conditions, we identified the brain processes underlying the visuomotor transformations needed for accurate reaching/pointing movements. We then localized the generators by means of cortical current density (CCD) reconstruction and studied their dynamics from visual cue presentation to movement onset. The results showed simultaneous activation of the parietal and frontal areas from 140 to 260 ms. The results are interpreted as neural correlates of two critical phases of visuomotor integration, namely target selection and movement selection. Our findings suggest that the visuomotor transformation processes required for correct reaching/pointing movements do not rely on a purely sequential activation of the frontoparietal areas, but mainly on a parallel information processing system, where feedback circuits play an important role before movement onset.

In the present electroencephalogram (EEG) study we have analysed induced gamma band activity during the repetition of familiar (meaningful) and unfamiliar (meaningless) line drawings. Results showed a broad posterior distribution of induced gamma band responses (GBRs) after the initial presentation of a familiar stimulus. Repeated presentations of the same picture resulted in a decrease of GBRs, accompanied by a decrease in the number of electrode pairs exhibiting significant phase-locking values. These effects might be linked to a 'sharpening' mechanism within a cell assembly representing a familiar object. In contrast, the representation of primed unfamiliar stimuli was associated with an augmentation of gamma power and an increase in significantly phase-locked pairs of electrodes. These findings might be a signature of the formation of a new cortical network representing an object. Event related potentials (ERPs) showed a decrease in amplitude independent of the stimuli's associative content, and, thus, seem to play a complementary role in repetition priming as compared to high-frequency brain dynamics.

The present study examined emotion-cognition relationships by focusing on the influence of an emotional categorization task on the cognitive processing induced by an oddball-like paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from Subjects explicitly asked to categorize along the valence dimension (unpleasant, neutral or pleasant) deviant target pictures embedded in a train of standard stimuli. Late positivities evoked in response to the target pictures were decomposed into a P3a and a P3b and topographical differences were observed according to the valence content of the stimuli. P3a showed enhanced amplitudes at posterior sites in response to unpleasant pictures as compared to both neutral and pleasant pictures. This effect is interpreted as a negativity bias related to attentional processing. The P3b component was sensitive to the arousal value of the stimulation, with higher amplitudes at several posterior sites for both types of emotional pictures. Moreover, unpleasant pictures evoked smaller amplitudes than pleasant ones at fronto-central sites. Thus, the context updating process may be differentially modulated by the affective arousal and valence of the stimulus. The present study supports the assumption that, during an emotional categorization, the emotional content of the stimulus may modulate the reorientation of attention and the subsequent updating process in a specific way.

Sounds with intensity increasing smoothly over 125-1000 ms elicited a transient response in auditory cortex with a peak latency in the 200-600 ms range. Importantly, peak latency accurately predicted behavioural reaction time and was unaffected by attentional engagement. Peak amplitude was augmented when the study participants attended to the stimuli and when stimulus duration was decreased. For investigating the cause of these amplitude variations in the averaged response we designed a wavelet-based method for analysing single-trial responses. We found that attention affects the amplitude of the single-trial responses whereas the intensity slope of the stimulus modifies their latency distribution. The transient response reported here holds promise for rapid, objective hearing assessment not requiring a behavioural task. &COPY; 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We review the neural bases of temperamental reactivity and self-regulation and propose that these constructs provide a framework for examining individual differences and developmental change in emotion-cognition interactions across development. Studies are reviewed in which some well-documented contextual effects on the expression of temperament can be interpreted in terms of the influence of biological and non-biological factors on CNS functioning. We conclude with ideas regarding future directions for the study of individual differences and developmental change in cognition-emotion interactions as they are shaped throughout development.

The mismatch negativity (MMN) and N1/P2 were assessed using a multifeature paradigm, while subjects were attending to visual tasks with high or low attentional workload. Only the responses to duration change were affected by the stress manipulation. Cortisol levels during stress were inversely related to the MMN amplitudes of duration deviants. During anticipatory stress.. responses to the standard tones (general sound processing) increased, but their amplitude was not correlated with cortisol levels. We found that psychosocial stressor anticipation attenuates both general and deviance-specific sound processing, suggesting that cortisol interferes with cortical memory-trace formation.

J	Kirschfeld, K				Kirschfeld, K			The physical basis of alpha waves in the electroencephalogram and the origin of the "Berger effect"	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; MECHANISM; RESPONSES; HUMANS; RHYTHM; CAT; EEG	Synchronised activity, differing in phase in different populations of neurons, plays an important role in existing theories on the function of brain oscillations (e.g., temporal correlation hypothesis). A prerequisite for this synchronisation is that stimuli are capable of affecting (resetting) the phase of brain oscillations. Such a change in the phase of brain waves is also assumed to underlie the '' Berger effect '': when observers open their eyes, the amplitude of EEG oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) decreases significantly. This finding is usually thought to involve a desynchronisation of activity in different neurons. For functional interpretations of brain oscillations in the visual system, it therefore seems to be crucial to find out whether or not the phase of brain oscillations can be affected by visual stimuli. To answer this question, we investigated whether alpha waves are generated by a linear or a nonlinear mechanism. If the mechanism is linear - in contrast to nonlinear ones - phases cannot be reset by a stimulus. It is shown that alpha-wave activity in the EEG comprises both linear and nonlinear components. The generation of alpha waves basically is a linear process and flash-evoked potentials are superimposed on ongoing alpha waves without resetting their phase. One nonlinear component is due to light adaptation, which contributes to the Berger effect. The results call into question theories about brain-wave function based on temporal correlation or event-related desynchronisation.

Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from 68 channels were used to record auditory cortex responses to monaural stimulation from normal hearing participants (N= 16). White-noise stimuli and 1000 Hz tones were repeatedly presented to either the left or right ear. Source localization of the AEP N100 response was carried out with two symmetric regional sources placed into left and right auditory cortex. Regional source waveform amplitude and latency asymmetries were analyzed for tangential and radial activity explaining the N100, T-complex and P200 AEP components. Results: Regional source waveform analysis showed that early tangential activity in the N100 latency range exhibited larger contralateral amplitudes and shorter latencies for both tone and noise monaural stimuli. Lateralized activity was significantly greater when tones or noise was presented to the left compared to the right ear (p <.001). The ear difference in the degree of lateralization arose due to hemispheric asymmetry. Significantly more tangential activity in the N100 latency range was recorded in the right compared to the left hemisphere in response to stimulation by either tones or noise (p <.001). Neither the radial activity modelling the T-complex, nor activity modelling the P200, showed robust ear or hemisphere differences. Conclusions: Regional source waveform analysis revealed that the extent of auditory evoked potential asymmetries depends on the ear and hemisphere examined. These findings have implications for future studies utilizing AEP asymmetries to examine normal auditory function or experience-related changes in the auditory cortex. Significance: The right compared to the left auditory cortex may be more involved in processing monaurally presented tone and noise stimuli.

Results showed that the amplitude of the so-called visual "N1" component was larger for identification than for mere detection, replicating previous data obtained with static stimuli. However, we also found that: (i) the onset, peak and offset latencies of the visual NI to dynamic stimuli were significantly earlier in the detection task than in the identification task, and (ii) in both conditions, the coordinates of the equivalent current dipoles best explaining the visual N1 component were consistent with those of the human motion visual area MT+V5 in the extrastriate cortex. Alto-ether, these results indicate that dynamic stimuli may activate (at least partly) different pathways and processes in extrastriate cortex according to the nature of the task required on these stimuli.

Partial precues provided advance information about either mirror effectors or in-phase coordination of bimanual movements, while full precue specified both response parameters and neutral precue no movement information. Effects of precueing were assessed on reaction time (RT), contingent negative variation (CNV), and alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD). Information on coordination mode induced less efficient preparation than information on effectors, as revealed by longer RT, but paradoxically the CNV was found of larger amplitude for in-phase than for mirror precue. Full and in-phase precues were associated to largest cerebral activation, as reflected by CNV amplitude as well as beta ERD. It is suggested that with in-phase precueing, abstract programming of coordination and concrete preparation of possible effectors overlap, engaging more cerebral resources than when symmetric effectors are pre-specified. Alpha ERD underwent regional modulations dependent on the type of preparation, pointing out the role of the right parietal region in visuomotor transformation with full movement programming, and the preferential implication of the dominant hemisphere and medial brain regions in synchronization of both hand movements. Beta ERD topographical distribution suggested an increased implication of bilateral and medial motor regions in anticipation to the response signal with incomplete movement preparation.

Improving functional magnetic resonance Imaging motor studies through simultaneous electromyography recordings	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						fMRI; electromyography; motor behavior; component analysis; numerical simulation	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LOWER-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BRAIN ACTIVATION; NOISE-REDUCTION; STROKE; MRI; EEG; RECOVERY; CORTEX	Specially designed optoelectronic and data postprocessing methods are described that permit electromyography (EMG) of muscle activity simultaneous with functional MRI (fMRI). Hardware characterization and validation included simultaneous EMG and event-related fMRI in 17 healthy participants during either ankle (n = 12), index finger (n = 3), or wrist (n = 2) contractions cued by visual stimuli. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) were evaluated for their ability to remove residual fMRI gradient-induced signal contamination in EMG data. Contractions of ankle tibialis anterior and index finger abductor were clearly distinguishable, although observing contractions from the wrist flexors proved more challenging. To demonstrate the potential utility of simultaneous EMG and fMRI, data from the ankle experiments were analyzed using two approaches: 1) assuming contractions coincided precisely with visual cues, and 2) using EMG to time the onset and offset of muscle contraction precisely for each participant. Both methods produced complementary activation maps, although the EMG-guided approach recovered more active brain voxels and revealed activity better in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Furthermore, numerical simulations confirmed that precise knowledge of behavioral responses, such as those provided by EMG, are much more important for event-related experimental designs compared to block designs. This simultaneous EMG and fMRI methodology has important applications where the amplitude or timing of motor output is impaired, such as after stroke. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A dual paradigm was employed: a videogame and the simultaneous presentation of passive auditory oddball stimuli. We analyzed the data concerning ERD/ERS using both Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and wavelet transform (WT). In the FFT data, during the periods with appearance of Fm theta, apparent ERD of the theta band was observed at Fz and Cz. ERD when Fm theta was present was much more prominent than when Fm theta was absent. In the WT data, as in the FFT data, ERD was seen again, but in this case the ERD was preceded by ERS during both the periods with and without Fm theta. Furthermore, the WT analysis indicated that ERD was followed by ERS during the periods without Fm theta. However, during Fm theta, no apparent ERS following ERD was seen. In our study, Fm theta was desynchronized by the auditory stimuli that were independent of the video game task used to evoke the Fm theta. The ERD of Fm theta might be reflecting the mechanism of "positive suppression" to process external auditory stimuli automatically and preventing attentional resources from being unnecessarily allocated to those stimuli. Another possibility is that Fm theta induced by our dual paradigm may reflect information processing modeled by multi-item working memory requirements for playing the videogame and the simultaneous auditory processing using a memory trace. ERS in the WT data without Fm theta might indicate further processing of the auditory information free from "positive suppression" control reflected by Fm theta.

In this paper, we compare, on empirical grounds, two cornputationally different estimations of the surface Laplacian. Methods: Surface Laplacian was estimated from the same monopolar data set with both Hjorth's method [local; Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 39 (1975) 526] as modified by MacKay [Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 56 (1983) 696] and with spherical spline interpolation [global; Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 72 (1989) 184]. Results: The grand averages computed with the two methods proved to be very similar but differed markedly from the monopolar ones. The two different computations were highly correlated, presented low relative errors and allowed to evidence comparable experimental effects. Conclusions: These results suggest that Hjorth's method and spherical spline interpolation convey similar topographic and chronometric informations. Significance: We provide empirical evidence that local and global methods of surface Laplacian estimation are equivalent to improve the spatial resolution of EEG traces. Global methods allow to explore the scalp topography and local methods allow to spare time in electrode setting that can be useful for studies on special populations (i.e. children, aged subjects) and for clinical purposes.

Related MEG data sets are data sets that contain activity of the same sources or activity of sources that have proportional source amplitudes. The simultaneous model uses a set of common sources and a set of common source time functions (wave shapes) to model the measured data in each data set. The set of common sources contains all sources that are active in at least one of the data sets to be analyzed. The number of common spatial and temporal components is specified by the user. The model for each data set is a linear combination of these common spatial and temporal components. This linear combination is estimated in a coupling matrix. Unlike the Coupled Dipole Model, where the user selects certain entries of the coupling matrix to be zero, the entire coupling matrix is estimated in the ECDM. This yields a more objective and statistically transparent estimation method, of which the identifiability constraints do not depend on the user's chosen design as in the CDM. Cramer-Rao Bounds are derived for the ECDM, and the significance of the estimated source activity is computed and illustrated by confidence regions around estimated source time functions.

Subcortical visual dysfunction in schizophrenia drives secondary cortical impairments	BRAIN			English	Review						event-related potential; schizophrenia; EEG dipole source localization; magnocellular; dorsal stream	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OBJECT-RECOGNITION AREAS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; NMDA-RECEPTOR ACTIVITY; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; BACKWARD-MASKING; SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION	Visual processing deficits are an integral component of schizophrenia and are sensitive predictors of schizophrenic decompensation in healthy adults. The primate visual system consists of discrete subcortical magnocellular and parvocellular pathways, which project preferentially to dorsal and ventral cortical streams. Subcortical systems show differential stimulus sensitivity, while cortical systems, in turn, can be differentiated using surface potential analysis. The present study examined contributions of subcortical dysfunction to cortical processing deficits using high-density event-related potentials. Event-related potentials were recorded to stimuli biased towards the magnocellular system using low-contrast isolated checks in Experiment 1 and towards the magnocellular or parvocellular system using low versus high spatial frequency (HSF) sinusoidal gratings, respectively, in Experiment 2. The sample consisted of 23 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 non-psychiatric volunteers of similar age. In Experiment 1, a large decrease in the P1 component of the visual event-related potential in response to magnocellular-biased isolated check stimuli was seen in patients compared with controls (F = 13.2, P = 0.001). Patients also showed decreased slope of the contrast response function over the magnocellular-selective contrast range compared with controls (t = 9.2, P = 0.04) indicating decreased signal amplification. In Experiment 2, C1 (F = 8.5, P = 0.007), P1 ( F = 33.1, P < 0.001) and N1 (F = 60.8, P < 0.001) were reduced in amplitude to magnocellular-biased low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli in patients with schizophrenia, but were intact to parvocellular-biased HSF stimuli, regardless of generator location. Source waveforms derived from inverse dipole modelling showed reduced P1 in Experiment 1 and reduced C1, P1 and N1 to LSF stimuli in Experiment 2, consistent with surface waveforms. These results indicate pervasive magnocellular dysfunction at the subcortical level that leads to secondary impairment in activation of cortical visual structures within dorsal and ventral stream visual pathways. Our finding of early visual dysfunction is consistent with and explanatory of classic literature showing subjective complaints of visual distortions and is consistent with early visual processing deficits reported in schizophrenia. Although deficits in visual processing have frequently been construed as resulting from failures of top-down processing, the present findings argue strongly for bottom-up rather than top-down dysfunction at least within the early visual pathway. Deficits in magnocellular processing in this task may reflect more general impairments in neuronal systems functioning, such as deficits in non-linear amplification and may thus represent an organizing principle for predicting neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Vocalizations carry a symbolic representation of a message from the mind of the speaker to a listener (human or machine) who must decode the representation. Machine-based speech interpreters have libraries of sound templates and word and grammar logic systems that assist in decoding a message. Human listeners have some additional information to assist interpretation such as the context of a discourse: the current topic, the time, etc. Though human-to-human discourse is held as the model for delivery of a message from a human to a machine, even speech between humans is sometimes fraught with difficulty in passing meaning. Can we improve sending the meaning of a message from a speaker? In the mind of the speaker is located the content of a message. Can we access information related to that content and help deliver the message? The production of an utterance by the brain of a speaker involves the setting of a message, selection of vocabulary, determination of syntax, fixing of semantics and creation and execution of a motor program that activates the voice. We suggest that it will be possible to assist in content delivery of a message by accessing neural signals related to the production of an utterance. Since 1980, there have been research studies on electrical signals related to brain events related to speech. Current work on these evoked potentials (EPs) has required averaging. However, new techniques are increasing our ability to resolve signal components that are leading us to the "single shot": pattern detection in a single trial. These techniques include: increasing the number of electrodes and new computational methods such as trained neural networks. Importantly, the technique of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) has lead to the ability to discriminate the many signals that summate to create the potentials recorded at the surface of the scalp. ICA initially requires substantial training of a neural network system based on the signals of a large number of electrical sources. However it can then be used to discriminate features of the data set and match a template of those features to subsequent trials. We propose to use the utterance of a word as a timing signal to match ICA templates to the "pre-potential", the EEG signal preceding the utterance. A statistical match could be made with the pre-potential to candidate meanings for the utterance created by the SR system. Preliminary Results We have collected pilot EEG data from a subject who was triggered to utter the sound (tu(I)) at the presentation a visual cue of the randomly presented words "to" or "too". The subject was instructed to speak the word as soon as they saw it presented. The goal was to review the EEG related to the individual trial utterances and determine if there was a robust set of features related to the utterances that could discriminate the different words. EEG data were collected from 28 scalp electrodes and I EOG electrode. Averaged 2-sec EPs related to the visual stimulus presentations under the two different conditions were examined. EPs of two conditions differed largely at site CPz. However, the time courses of single-trials did not always resemble those of the averaged EPs. The trial-to-trial variability made it difficult to distinguish the brain responses under two conditions without further processing. A single-layer perceptron neural network was trained through supervised methods and found a linear boundary between two clusters ('to' and 'too'). The boundary based on the scalp EEG misclassified 19 of a total of 82 trails. ICA was applied to the concatenated 2-sec single-trial epochs from the subject and derived 29 temporally independent components. The averaged activations and scalp topographies of components 6, 8, and 16 suggested that they together account for the large differences in EPs at cite CPz. The trial-to-trial variability was reduced compared to the raw EPs since the contributions of other components were removed from (not projected to) the electrodes. Similarly, the activations of ICA components accounted for the differences in EPs at site T8 were projected and summed at the scalp electrodes. For each trial, the summed projections between 200 and 1400 ms following stimulus presentations at cites CPz and T8 were averaged. The clusters were tighter compared to those from site CPz alone. Again, a single-layer perceptron neural network was trained through supervised methods and found a linear boundary between two clusters ('to' and 'too'). The boundary based on the scalp EEG misclassified I I of a total of 82 traits (13%). Conclusions In this example, ICA separated the distinct brain processes into different independent components and extracted the signals of interest. Mathematically reducing the interference from the other brain or extra-brain activity generators improved the chance to detect small differences in EEG across conditions. It appears feasible that EPs can be used to assist speech recognition.

Thirty participants without any particular background in the fine arts were presented with various representational (semi-abstract) and abstract paintings dating from the 20th and 21st century in two experimental conditions, i.e. with or without stylistic information. The paintings had to be rated by the participants in terms of understanding and aesthetic qualities. In order to identify the cortical structures involved, the SCPs were subjected to current density analysis using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The comparison of representational and abstract paintings revealed significantly higher activation for representational artworks in several regions of the brain, predominantly in the left frontal lobe and bilaterally in the temporal lobes. According to the participants' reports, the representational artwork stimuli evoked more associations, accompanied by stronger activation of multimodal association areas in the temporal lobe. Furthermore, without stylistic information, the stimuli evoked stronger activation mainly in the left frontal and parietal lobes. Results also showed that stylistic information led to a better understanding of the paintings, but resulted in reduced cortical activation in the left hemisphere. This might have been due to less verbally oriented processing. These observations help explain the difficulties many beholders often have in appreciating abstract artworks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A better understanding of the neurophysiological processes underlying perceptual reversals might help to disentangle bottom-up from top-clown influences on multistable perception. Recently, we reported alpha activity decrease during multistable visual perception. The aim of the present study was to define more specifically the functional roles of the EEG alpha hand during the perception of Necker cube reversals by Subdividing the extended alpha band into three sub-bands (lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha, upper alpha). We employed a long-term recording condition, during which 10 healthy participants observed the Necker cube for approximately 60 min and responded by pressing a button to any perceived reversal. The results showed a reversal induced alpha desynchronization for the lower alpha hands, with the lower-2 alpha clesynchronization differing across the time course of the experiment. The upper alpha band demonstrated no reliable effects. It is concluded that the lower-1 alpha desynchronization reflects ail automatic arousal reaction which triggers attentional processing in a bottom-up manner, whereas the lower-2 alpha desynchronization is related to attentional processes that are achieved by top-down control with limited resources. The lack of reliable effects ill the Upper alpha hand is presumably due to the relatively low semantic task demands in Figure reversal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The bootstrap is well suited to the analysis of event-related MEG data since the experiments are repeated tens or even hundreds of times and averaged to achieve acceptable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The set of repetitions or epochs can be viewed as a set of independent realizations of the brain's response to the experiment. Bootstrap resamples can be generated by sampling with replacement from these epochs and averaging. In this study, we applied the bootstrap resampling technique to MEG data from somatotopic experimental and simulated data. Four ringers of the right and left hand of a healthy subject were electrically stimulated, and about 400 trials per stimulation were recorded and averaged in order to measure the somatotopic mapping of the fingers in the S1 area of the brain. Based on single-trial recordings for each finger we performed 5000 bootstrap resamples. We reconstructed dipoles from these resampled averages using the Recursively Applied and Projected (RAP)-MUSIC source localization algorithm. We also performed a simulation for two dipolar sources with overlapping time courses embedded in realistic background brain activity generated using the prestimulus segments of the somatotopic data. To find correspondences between multiple sources in each bootstrap, sample dipoles with similar time series and forward fields were assumed to represent the same source. These dipoles were then clustered by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm using their combined normalized time series and topographies as feature vectors.

Sixteen subjects (4 F, 18-38 y) viewed 4-digit problems on a computer, solved the problems, and pressed keys to respond (inter-trial interval = 1 s). Subjects performed until either they felt exhausted or three hours had elapsed. Pre- and post-task measures of mood (Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist, Visual Analogue Mood Scale) confirmed that fatigue increased and energy decreased over time. We examined response times (RT); amplitudes of ERP components N1, P2, and P300, readiness potentials; and power of frontal theta and parietal alpha rhythms for change as a function of time. Mean RT rose from 6.7 s to 7.9 s over time. After controlling for or rejecting sources of artifact such as EOG, EMG, motion, bad electrodes, and electrical interference, we found that frontal theta power rose by 29% and alpha power rose by 44% over the course of the task. We used 30-channel EEG frequency spectra to model the effects of time in single subjects using a kernel partial least squares (KPLS) classifier. We classified 13-s long EEG segments as being from the first or last 15 minutes of the task, using random sub-samples of each class. Test set accuracies ranged from 91% to 100% correct. We conclude that a KPLS classifier of multichannel spectral measures provides a highly accurate model of EEG-fatigue relationships and is suitable for on-line applications to neurological monitoring.

The main contribution of the BBCI, which is a non-invasive EEG-based BCI system, is the use of advanced machine learning techniques that allow to adapt to the specific brain signatures of each user with literally no training. In BBCI a calibration session of about 20min is necessary to provide a data basis from which the individualized brain signatures are inferred. This is very much in contrast to conventional BCI approaches that rely on operand conditioning and need extensive subject training of the order 50-100 hours. Our machine learning concept thus allows to achieve high quality feedback already after the very first session. This work reviews a broad range of investigations and experiments that have been performed within the BBCI project. In addition to these general paradigmatic BCI results, this work provides a condensed outline of the underlying machine learning and signal processing techniques that make the BBCI succeed. In the first experimental paradigm we analyze the predictability of limb movement long before the actual movement takes place using only the movement intention measured from the pre-movement (readiness) EEG potentials. The experiments include both off-line studies and an online feedback paradigm. The limits with respect to the spatial resolution of the somatotopy are explored by contrasting brain patterns of movements of left vs. right hand rsp. foot. In a second complementary paradigm voluntary modulations of sensorimotor rhythms caused by motor imagery (left hand vs. right hand vs. foot) are translated into a continuous feedback signal. Here we report results of a recent feedback study with 6 healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control: half of the subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm). Furthermore one subject used the BBCI to operate a mental typewriter in free spelling mode. The overall spelling speed was 4.5-8 letters per minute including the time needed for the correction errors.

Recent studies have used wavelets and other signal processing methods to analyze EEG signals in an attempt to find a non-invasive biomarker for AD. These studies had varying degrees of success, in part due to small cohort size. In this study, multiresolution wavelet analysis is performed on event related potentials of the EEGs of a relatively larger cohort of 44 patients. Particular emphasis was on diagnosis at the earliest stage and feasibility of implementation in a community health clinic setting. Extracted features were then used to train an ensemble of classifiers based stacked generalization approach. 'Ale describe the approach, and present our promising preliminary results.

Latency analysis of single auditory evoked M100 responses by spatio-temporal filtering	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS TRANSFORM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRIAL EEG; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; ERPS	Appropriate spatial filtering followed by temporal filtering is well suited for the single- trial analysis of multi- channel magnetoencephalogram or electroencephalogram recordings. This is demonstrated by the results of a single- trial latency analysis obtained for auditory evoked M100 responses from nine subjects using two different stimulation frequencies. Spatial filters were derived automatically from the data via noise- adjusted principle component analysis, and single- trial latencies were estimated from the signal phase after complex bandpass filtering. For each of the two stimulation frequencies, estimated single- trial latencies were consistent with results obtained from a standard approach using averaged evoked responses. The quality of the estimated single- trial latencies was additionally assessed by their ability to separate between the two different stimulation frequencies. As a result, more than 80% of the single trials can be classified correctly by their estimated latencies.

Automated single-trial measurement of amplitude and latency of laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) using multiple linear regression	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						nociceptive system; laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); automated measurement; single-trial analysis; EEG; pain	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; N1 WAVE; RESPONSES; HUMANS; COMPONENTS	Objective: Laser stimulation of A delta-fibre nociceptors in the skin evokes nociceptive-specific brain responses (laser-evoked potentials, LEPs). The largest vertex complex (N2-P2) is widely used to assess nociceptive pathways in physiological and clinical studies. The aim of this study was to develop an automated method to measure amplitudes and latencies of the N2 and P2 peaks on a single-trial basis. Methods: LEPs were recorded after Nd:YAP laser stimulation of the left hand dorsum in 7 normal volunteers. For each subject, a basis set of 4 regressors (the N2 and P2 waveforms and their respective temporal derivatives) was derived from the time-averaged data and regressed against every single-trial LEP response. This provided a separate quantitative estimate of amplitude and latency for the N2 and P2 components of each trial. Results: All estimates of LEP parameters correlated significantly with the corresponding measurements performed by a human expert (N2 amplitude: R-2 =0.70; P2 amplitude: R-2 =0.70; N2 latency: R-2 = 0.81; P2 latency: R 2 =0.59. All P < 0.0001). Furthermore, regression analysis was able to extract an LEP response from a subset of the trials that had been classified by the human expert as without response. Conclusions: This method provides a simple, fast and unbiased measurement of different components of single-trial LEP responses. Significance: This method is particularly desirable in several experimental conditions (e.g. drug studies, correlations with experimental variables, simultaneous EEG/fMRI and low signal-to-noise ratio data) and in clinical practice. The described multiple linear regression approach can be easily implemented for measuring evoked potentials in other sensory modalities. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Through a BCI based on Event Related Potentials (ERD and ERS), the operator is capable to select a position on the manipulator's workspace, that should be reached by the manipulator. A pose controller is executed on a remote PC and when new references are received, the controller calculates the necessary control actions so that the manipulator reaches the desired position. A bio-feedback link is closed through the operator watching to a visual interface, allowing him/her to visualize the manipulator's workspace and the movements being executed. Besides the application of the BCI, the paper also shows how versatile it is, stressing features like its easy integration with robotic devices, its low cost and the short training time it requires.

The EEG of subjects performing an alternating runs [Rogers, R.D., Monsell, S., 1995. Costs of a predictable switch between simple cognitive tasks. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 124, 207-231] task-switching task was analyzed using event-related potentials, the lateralized readiness potential, instantaneous amplitude and the phase-locking value [Lachaux, J.P., Rodriguez, E., Martinirie, J., Varela, F.J., 1999. Measuring phase synchrony in brain signals. Human Brain Mapping 8, 194-208]. The two tasks differed in the relevant modality (visual versus auditory) and the hand with which responses were to be given. The mixture model [de Jong, R., 2000. An intention driven account of residual switch costs. In: Monsell, S., Driver, J. (Eds.), Attention and Performance XVII: Cognitive Control. MIT Press, Cambridge] was used to assign pre-stimulus switch probabilities to switch trials based on reaction time; these probabilities were used to create a fast-slow distinction between trials on both switch and hold trials. Results showed both time- and time-frequency-domain effects, during the intervals preceding stimuli, of switching versus maintenance, response speed of the upcoming stimulus, and response hand. Of potential importance for task-switching theory were interactions between reaction time by switch-hold trial type that were found for a frontal slow negative potential and the lateralized readiness potential during the response-stimulus interval, indicating that effective preparation for switch trials involves different anticipatory activity than for hold trials. Theta-band oscillatory activity during the pre-stimulus period was found to be higher when subsequent reaction times were shorter, but this response speed effect did not interact with trial type. The response hand of the upcoming task was associated with lateralization of pre-stimulus mu- and beta-band amplitude and, specifically for switch trials, beta-band phase locking.

A short overview of important differences between single-channel, two-channel and multichannel data sets is presented and various coherence functions are reported. Causal relations between channels are investigated by means of the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and its dynamic version, the Short-Time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF). The introduced fort-nalisin was used to analyze 12-channel human electrocorticogram (ECoG) records. Preliminary results of a study of causal dependence in beta and gamma frequency bands in two patients performing a motor task are reported.

Derived from the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, such a statistical parametric map (SPM) ignores the spatial smoothing in hypothesis testing with distributed source models. For example, when intending to test a single voxel, actually an entire region of voxels is tested simultaneously. Because there are more parameters than observations, typically constraints are employed to arrive at a solution which spatially smooths the solution. If ignored, it can be concluded from the hypothesis test that there is activity at some location where there is none. In addition, an SPM on distributed source models gives the illusion of very high resolution. As an alternative, a multivariate approach is suggested in which a region of interest is tested that is spatially smooth. In simulations with MEG and EEG it is shown that clear hypothesis testing in distributed source models is possible, provided that there is high correspondence between what is intended to be tested and what is actually tested. The approach is also illustrated by an application to data from an experiment measuring visual evoked fields when presenting checker-board patterns.

The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 'detects' when an unpleasant event does not occur	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; contingency establishment; somatosensory event-related potential; lateralization; current source density; source analysis	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; CORTICAL NETWORK; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PARASYLVIAN CORTEX; NERVE-STIMULATION; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; SENSORY MEMORY	The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is implicated in contingency detection and the evaluation of emotionally significant stimuli. However, the mechanisms whereby an individual can effectively avoid painful or unpleasant events are not well understood. We therefore examined whether the absence of an unpleasant somatosensory stimulus could evoke a response in the human VLPFC as a correlate of contingency detection (the reeling that "I am safe") without any immediately preceding stimulus. In a differential trace-conditioning paradigm, the unpleasant stimulus followed the partially reinforced stimulus in 50% of trials after 3 s; it never occurred after the nonreinforced stimulus. High-resolution DC electroencephalography, current source density mapping, and spatio-temporal source analysis were performed. After the nonreinforced stimulus, a highly significant negativity over the VLPFC began about a second after the time for the unpleasant stimulus to occur had passed. We concluded that the VLPFC can be activated merely by a sequence of stimuli (with long interstimulus intervals) without any directly preceding stimulus, provided that this sequence creates the expectation that at a certain time an unpleasant stimulus might occur. This mechanism might allow for the detection of conditions under which harmful events could be avoided. Moreover, in reinforced trials, we found a highly significantly lateralized negativity (N700) that outlasted the strong, unpleasant somatosensory stimulus for about a second. Topography and source analysis pointed to prolonged activation of the somatosensory system. This processing stage preceded activation of the VLPFC. We concluded that N700 might provide important insights into the time course of somatosensory memory traces. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such feedback often follows when the movement is already over. We investigated the time-course of post-movement cortical motor processing by high-resolution analysis of lateralized post-movement potentials in forewarned and simple reaction time tasks. In both paradigms we could separate a post-movement component (motor postimperative negative variation-mPINV) peaking about 500 ms after the button press (confirmed by electromyogram and accelerometer). mPINV could not be sufficiently explained by motor cortex activity related to EMG output and/or by sensory feedback. mPINV was enhanced by long intertrial intervals and its lateralization changed with response movement side. Its scalp potential distribution resembled (pre-)motor cortex activity during preceding movement stages and differed from the frontal motor potential peak (proprioceptive and somatosensory reafferent feedback); suggesting post-movement activation of pre-/ primary motor cortex. Dipole source analysis yielded a single radial source near premotor cortex which explained lateralized mPINV almost completely. mPINV was present in simple reaction time tasks, indicating that mPINV is an independent component and does not represent delayed resolution of pre-movement negativity. An equivalent of "classical" PINV (cPINV) occurred later over prefrontal and anterior temporal sites in simple and forewarned reaction time tasks. Our results suggest that high-resolution analysis of lateralized movement-related potentials allows to image post-movement motor cortex activity and might provide insights into basic mechanisms of motor learning: A characteristic sequence might involve motor cortex activation (mPINV) before "higher order associative areas" come into play (cPINV).

Methods: Ten migraine patients were evaluated during the not-symptomatic phase and compared to seven age and sex matched controls. The dorsum of the right hand and the right supraorbital zone were stimulated by a painful CO, laser, in presence or in absence of a visual warning stimulus. An analysis time of 1 s after the stimulus was submitted to a time-frequency analysis by a complex Morlet wavelet and to a cross-correlation analysis, in order to detect the development of EEG changes and the most activated cortical regions. A parametric approach to measure predictability of short and noisy time series was applied, where time series were modeled by leave-one-out (LOO) error. Results: The averaged laser-evoked potentials features were similar between the two groups in the alerted and not alerted condition. A strong reset of the beta rhythms after the painful stimuli was seen for three groups of electrodes along the midline in patients and controls: the predictability of the series induced by the laser stimulus changed very differently in controls and patients. The separation was more evident after the warning signal, leading to a separation with P-values of 0.0046 for both the hand and the face. Discussion: As painful stimulus causes organization of the local activity in cortex, EEG series become more predictable after stimulation. This phenomenon was less evident in migraine, as a sign of an inadequate cortical reactivity to pain. Significance: The LOO method enabled to show in migraine subtle changes in the cortical response to pain. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Our main measures of interest were questionnaire outcomes, reaction times, error rates, and the error-related negativity ERP component. Questionnaire and behavioral results indicated increased perfectionism in patients with anorexia nervosa. In line with their perfectionism and controlled response style patients made significantly less errors than controls. However, when controlling for this difference in error rates, the EEG results demonstrated a reduced error-related negativity in the patient group. These seemingly contradictory outcomes of improved performance and reduced error monitoring are discussed in relation with indications of anterior cingulate cortex hypoactivity in anorexia nervosa patients.

J	Yeung, N; Ralph, J; Nieuwenhuis, S				Yeung, Nick; Ralph, Jason; Nieuwenhuis, Sander			Drink alcohol and dim the lights: The impact of cognitive deficits on medial frontal cortex function	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT; TASK; ERP; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings indicate that regions in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) are active following errors. Alcohol consumption reduces this error-related activity, perhaps suggesting that alcohol disrupts the operation of an error-monitoring system in the MFC. However, it could also be that alcohol consumption affects the MFC only indirectly, by impairing stimulus processing and thus making errors harder to detect. This interpretation leads to the prediction that stimulus degradation should likewise reduce error-related activity in the MFC. To test this hypothesis, behavioral and EEG data were collected as participants performed a speeded response task with either bright or very dim stimuli. The results using dim stimuli replicated the observed effects of alcohol consumption-with slowed responses accompanied by reduced error-related MFC activity. The sensitivity of the MFC to disrupted processing elsewhere in the brain suggests complications in interpreting evidence of disturbed MFC function.

Six healthy subjects (aged 24-34 years old) were investigated with 148-channel whole-head type magnetencephalography using an auditory oddball paradigm in passive mode. The authors also compared six stimulus combinations in order to find the optimal stimulus parameters for P300 magnetic field (P300m) in passive mode. Bilateral MUSIC peaks were located on the mesial temporal, superior temporal and parietal lobes. Interestingly, all MUSIC peaks in these regions emerged earlier in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere, suggesting that the right hemisphere has predominance over the left in the processing activity associated with P300m. There were no significant differences among the six stimulus combinations in evoking those P300m sources. The results of the present study suggest that the MUSIC algorithm could be a useful tool for analysis of the time-course of P300m.

Scalp EEG was recorded over the contralateral primary sensorimotor area (SM1(c)), and from the ipsilateral sensorimotor area (SM1(i)). The electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from the Extensor Digitorum Communis (Extensor), Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (Flexor), and First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI) muscles. We analyzed (1) handwriting performance, (2) changes in the TRPow confined to alpha and beta band, and (3) the EMG spectral power during both tasks, writing and isometric contraction. During writing, all patients developed writer's cramp. The handwriting in writer's cramp patients was associated with significantly less reduction of the beta-range TRPow and lower frequency of the TRPow reduction compared to controls. No significant differences between patients and controls for the alpha band TRPow reduction during handwriting were observed. During writing, the patients showed higher EMG spectral power than the controls but this difference was at the border of significance. The present results indicate disorder in the motor execution system, in writer's cramp patients, associated with impaired functional beta-network state of the contra- and ipsilateral sensorimofor cortices, most probably due to inadequate modulation of the intracortical inhibition associated with writing.

Methods: Ten right-handed adult native Hebrew speakers discriminated vowel-consonant-vowel (V-C-V) sequences /ada/ (deviant) and /aga/ (standard) in an active auditory 'Oddball' task, and the brain potentials associated with performance of the task were recorded from 21 electrodes. Stimuli were generated by fusing the acoustic elements of the V-C-V sequences as follows: base was always presented in front of the subject, and formant transitions were presented to the front, left or right in a virtual reality room. An illusion of a lateralized echo (duplex sensation) accompanied base fusion with the lateralized formant locations. Source current density estimates were derived for the net response to the fusion of the speech elements (F-complex) and for the MMN, using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Statistical non-parametric mapping was used to estimate the current density differences between the brain sources of the F-complex and the MMN. Results: Occipito-parietal regions and prefrontal regions were associated with the F-complex in all formant locations, whereas the vicinity of the supratemporal plane was bilaterally associated with the MMN, but only in case of front-fusion (no duplex effect). Conclusions: MMN is sensitive to the novelty of the auditory object in relation to other stimuli in a sequence, whereas the F-complex is sensitive to the acoustic features of the auditory object and reflects a process of matching them with target categories. Significance: The F-complex and MMN reflect different aspects of auditory processing in a stimulus-rich and changing environment: content analysis of the stimulus and novelty detection, respectively.

However, neurotransmitters interact and neuronal function and signals also reflect non-neuronal factors that should (but not necessarily are, or can) be taken into proper consideration in neuroscience. Examples in this regard are the CNS modulation by spontaneous or induced changes in metabolism (e.g. glucose, ammonia), blood flow, pO(2), pCO(2), hormones (thyroxine; sexual hormones, ATCH) and neurohormonal interaction, maturation, aging, temperature, light-dark regulation of serotonine, histamine and dopamine/melatonin/vitamin B12 secretion and interaction, etc. Hormones also regulate the (functional) maturation and differentiation between sexes both during development and in adult life. These factors interact with each other and individually or collectively can account for unexplained or underestimated individual variability; on occasions, may become critical variables in animal or human research. In specific instances, variability is the information of interest. However, physiological variability due to neuronal or non-neuronal factors can interact with the experimental setups or affect electrophysiological signals to extents that can result in biased findings in otherwise controlled studies. An "inverse problem" difficult to approach may ensue in both animal and human research; in several instances, the specificity of brain signals for the investigated function may require experimental validation.

As practice is considered a prerequisite for motor learning we expected that even the repetitive execution of a simple movement would rapidly induce changes in neural activations without changing performance. We used 64-channel event-related potential mapping to investigate these effects of movement repetition on corresponding brain activity in humans. Ten healthy right-handed young adults performed a power grip task under visual force control to ensure constant behaviour during the experimental session. The session consisted of two parts intersected by a break. For analysis each part was subdivided into two runs to control for potential attention or fatigue effects, which would be expected to disappear during the break. Microstate analysis revealed that distinct topographies and source configurations during movement preparation, movement execution and feedback integration are responsive to repetition. The observed patterns of changes differed for the three microstates, suggesting that different, repetition-sensitive neural mechanisms are involved. Moreover, this study clearly confirms that movement repetition, in the absence of skill learning, is capable of inducing changes in neural networks.

Treatment with dopaminergic drugs reduces the background level of beta frequency band synchronization in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but has not been shown to increase the proportion of beta activity that is suppressed before voluntary movement in PD. We assessed changes in the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band of local field potential signals from the region of the STN in 14 patients with PD as they performed self-paced movements of a joystick before and after levodopa administration. The dopamine precursor, levodopa, increased the duration and magnitude of the premovement beta ERD, but did not alter postmovement synchronization in the beta band. Both the latency and magnitude of the beta ERD inversely correlated with the degree of motor impairment. These findings suggest that the beta ERD recorded in the STN area reflects motor-preparative processes that are at least partly dependent on dopaminergic activity within the basal ganglia.

The following issues are discussed: definitions, morphology and topography of KC, the regular participation in NREM steep, elicitability features of evoked KC, autonomic and motor concomitants, relationship of KC with information processing during NREM steep, relationship of KC and deltas of NREM steep, and relationship of KC with steep cyclicity. KC is a complex multifunctional phenomenon of the sleeping brain involved in information processing and defence against the arousal effect of sensory stimuli. To put the old chap in a new garment, the relationship of KC with synchronisation-type and desynchronisation-type microarousals, and the 'cyclic alternating pattern', wilt be discussed, with an emphasis on the steep-protecting role of KC and synchronisation-type answers in sleep regulation executed by phasic events. Lastly, the role of KC providing gating functions in idiopathic generalized epilepsies and other, different, steep disorders are characterised. A 'theoretical epilogue' is appended to show some system theoretical and regulational aspects. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the parallel evolution of neuroscience; engineering, and rapid computing the era of clinical neuroprosthetics is approaching as a practical reality for people with severe motor impairment. Patients with such diseases as spinal cord injury; stroke, limb loss, and neuromuscular disorders may benefit through the implantation of these brain computer interfaces that serve to augment their ability to communicate and interact with their environment: In the upcoming years, it will be important for the neurosurgeon to understand what a brain computer interface is, its fundamental principle of operation; and what the salient surgical issues are when considering implantation. We review the current state of the field of motor neuroprosthetics research; the early clinical applications, and the essential considerations from a neurosurgical perspective for the future.

Dynamic causal modelling of evoked potentials: A reproducibility study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							AUDITORY-CORTEX; RESPONSES; BRAIN; FMRI	Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) has been applied recently to event-related responses (ERPs) measured with EEG/MEG. DCM attempts to explain ERPs using a network of interacting cortical sources and waveform differences in terms of coupling changes among sources. The aim of this work was to establish the validity of DCM by assessing its reproducibility across subjects. We used an oddball paradigm to elicit mismatch responses. Sources of cortical activity were modelled as equivalent current dipoles, using a biophysical informed spatiotemporal forward model that included connections among neuronal subpopulations in each source. Bayesian inversion provided estimates of changes in coupling among sources and the marginal likelihood of each model. By specifying different connectivity models we were able to evaluate three different hypotheses: differences in the ERPs to rare and frequent events are mediated by changes in forward connections (F-model), backward connections (B-model) or both (FB-model). The results were remarkably consistent over subjects. In all but one subject, the forward model was better than the backward model. This is an important result because these models have the same number of parameters (i.e., the complexity). Furthermore, the FB-model was significantly better than both, in 7 out of 11 subjects. This is another important result because it shows that a more complex model (that can fit the data more accurately) is not necessarily the most likely model. At the group level the FB-model supervened. We discuss these findings in terms of the validity and usefulness of DCM in characterising EEG/MEG data and its ability to model ERPs in a mechanistic fashion. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A brain response termed the early right anterior negativity (ERAN) is elicited when a harmonically incongruous chord is inserted within or at the end of a musical sequence. The present study was conducted to test whether the ERAN reflects the processing of harmony rather than the building of a tonal context and whether the ERAN is also elicited by violations of the tuning of the sounds upon which harmony is based. To this aim, ten subjects listened to musical sequences containing either expected chords only, a harmonically incongruous chord in one of three positions within the cadence, or a harmonically congruous but mistuned chord in one of the three positions. Simultaneously, the electroencephalograph (EEG) was recorded. Incongruous chords violating the rules of harmony elicited a bilateral early anterior negativity, the amplitude of which depended on the degree of the harmony violation. On the contrary, mistuned chords, violating the rule of relations between all the sounds in the sequences, elicited a bilateral fronto-central negativity (the mismatch negativity, or MMN). The MMN was not modulated by the position of the violation within the musical sequence and had a longer peak latency than the anterior negativity elicited by the harmony rule violations. In conclusion, violations of the harmony and tuning rules of Western tonal music were found to generate specific and distinct electric responses in the human brain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To study the underlying neuronal processes, participants were presented different types of dot patterns (Glass patterns) either forming a global structure or forming no global structure while EEG was recorded. Participants were naive about the pattern types and performed a demanding colour discrimination task. Following the experiment, the degree to which participants acquired awareness of the global visual structure was assessed. Early gamma-frequency band responses (gamma, 25-100 Hz) over occipital, parietal, and central areas were enhanced to circular Glass patterns as compared to random dot patterns at 90 ms post-stimulus. This effect was observed exclusively in participants who were subjectively aware of the global pattern structure. In this group of observers, the pattern effect built up gradually during the course of the experiment. The significance of enhanced early gamma responses to global patterns for the production of awareness of the pattern might lie in the increased impact of information conveyed by well synchronised neuronal assemblies to upstream cortical areas.

A variety of models are used in practice that range from conceptual models of functional anatomy to nonlinear mathematical models of hemodynamic responses (e.g. as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) and neuronal responses. In this review, we discuss the most important models used to analyse functional imaging data and demonstrate how they are interrelated. Initially, we briefly review the anatomical foundations of current theories of brain function on which all mathematical models rest. We then introduce some basic statistical models (e.g. the general linear model) used for making classical (i.e. frequentist) and Bayesian inferences about where neuronal responses are expressed. The more challenging question, how these responses are caused, is addressed by models that incorporate biophysical constraints (e.g. forward models from the neural to the hemodynamic level) and/or consider causal interactions between several regions, i.e. models of effective connectivity. Some of the most refined models to date are neuronal mass models of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. These models enable mechanistic inferences about how evoked responses are caused, at the level of neuronal subpopulations and the coupling among them.

Consistent with the view that the AB reflects a limited ability to consolidate information in working memory and that the P3 reflects working memory updating, increasing the amplitude of the P3 elicited by a first target (T1) by varying T1 probability (Experiment 1) or T1 cue validity (Experiment 2) led to an increase of the AB. Overall, the P3 elicited by T I was greater when T2 was not identified than when it was. However, the correlation between P3 and AB magnitude across participants was not significant, leaving open the question of how direct the relationship between the P3 and the AB is.

Specifically, we use the event related potentials recorded from the Pz and Cz electrodes of the EEG, which are further analyzed using multiresolution wavelet analysis. The proposed data fusion approach includes generating multiple classifiers trained with strategically selected subsets of the training data from each source, which are then combined through a weighted majority voting. Several factors set this study apart from similar prior efforts: we use a larger cohort, specifically target early diagnosis of the disease, use an ensemble based approach rather then a single classifier, and most importantly, we combine information from multiple sources, rather then using a single modality. We present promising results obtained from the first 35 (of 80) patients whose data are analyzed thus far.

Subsecond changes in top-down control exerted by human medial frontal cortex during conflict and action selection: A combined transcranial magnetic stimulation electroencephalography study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						presupplementary motor area; TMS; ERP; task switching; attention; conflict	MOTOR CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RULE USE; TASK; INFORMATION; ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; MOVEMENT	Action selection requires choosing one of all the possible conflicting action plans that are available. There is currently a debate as to whether the dorsal medial frontal cortex (dMFC) merely detects or actively resolves response conflict. We used combined on-line transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalographic recording (TMS-EEG) to test whether human dMFC plays a critical causal role in conflict resolution, and whether the mechanism for such a function is via interactions with primary motor cortex. In an Eriksen flanker task, subjects discriminated the direction of the centermost arrow in an array of five, responding with the left or right hand. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP), a measure of relative levels of activity in left and right motor cortices, was also recorded. Reaction times and error rates were higher on incongruent than congruent trials, and incongruent trials produced a positive LRP deflection reflecting initial partial activation of the incorrect response. On one-half of trials, repetitive TMS was applied to left dMFC starting 100 ms before visual stimulus onset and ending 100 ms afterward. TMS disrupted performance by selectively increasing error rates on contralateral (right hand) incongruent trials. TMS also only modulated the LRP on incongruent trials, causing an increased positive deflection (associated with preparation of the incorrect response) starting 180 ms after visual stimulus onset. TMS of a control site did not interfere with behavior or motor cortical activity. dMFC has a direct causal role in resolving conflict during action selection, and the mechanism involves the top-down modulation of primary motor cortical activity.

Starting from the dichotomy between the pragmatic models, for which metaphor is a semantic anomaly, and the direct access models, where metaphor is seen as similar to literal language, the cognitive and linguistic processes involved in metaphor comprehension are analyzed using behavioural data (RTs) and neuropsychological indexes (ERPs). 36 subjects listened to 160 sentences equally shared in the variables content (metaphorical vs literal) and congruousness (anomalous vs not semantically anomalous). The ERPs analysis showed two negative deflections (N3-N4 complex), that indicated different cognitive processes involved in sentence comprehension. Repeated measures ANOVA, applied to peak amplitude and latency variables, suggested in fact N4 as index of semantic anomaly (incongruous stimuli), more localized in posterior (Pz) area, while N3 was sensitive to the content variable: metaphor sentences had an ampler deflection than literal ones and posteriorly distributed (Oz). Adding this results with behavioral data (no differences for metaphor vs literal), it seems that the difference between metaphorical and literal decoding isn't for the cognitive complexity of decoding (direct or indirect access), but for its representation format, which is more iconic for metaphor (as N3 suggests).

With respect to past studies using different samples of stimuli for different tasks, in the present research we used the same sample of words and varied only the tasks. Results were consistent across experiments and showed in the Phonological and Semantic tasks a comparable NI 50 peaking over left posterior regions, but for the N350 a maximum at left frontal sites in the Phonological, and a bilateral frontal component in the Semantic task. Furthermore, compared with these tasks, the Orthographic task involved a cortical network confined to left posterior sites both in the early and late latencies, a network which was probably relevant for the discrimination of the visual features requested by the task rather than for the irrelevant linguistic features of the stimuli.

Matches with auditory long-term memory induce gamma activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillations; 40 Hz activity; auditory long-term memory	BAND ACTIVITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; WORKING-MEMORY; LEARNING-TASK; RESPONSES; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; ERP	In recent years the cognitive functions of human gamma-band activity (30-100 Hz) advanced continuously into scientific focus. Not only bottom-up driven influences on 40 Hz activity have been observed, but also top-down processes seem to modulate responses in this frequency band. Among the various functions that have been related to gamma activity a pivotal role has been assigned to memory processes. Visual experiments suggested that gamma activity is involved in matching visual input to memory representations. Based on these findings we hypothesized that such memory related modulations of gamma activity exist in the auditory modality, as well. Thus, we chose environmental sounds for which subjects already had a long-term memory (LTM) representation and compared them to unknown, but physically similar sounds. 21 subjects had to classify sounds as 'recognized' or 'unrecognized', while EEG was recorded. Our data show significantly stronger activity in the induced gamma-band for recognized sounds in the time window between 300 and 500 ins after stimulus onset with a central topography. The results suggest that induced gamma-band activity reflects the matches between sounds and their representations in auditory LTM. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kovacevic, N; McIntosh, AR				Kovacevic, Natasa; McIntosh, Anthony Randal			Groupwise independent component decomposition of EEG data and partial least square analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS	This paper focuses on two methodological developments for analysis of,neuroimaging data. The first is the derivation of robust spatiotemporal activity patterns across a group of subjects using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). In applications to ERP data, the space dimension is typically represented in terms of scalp electrodes. The signal recorded by high density electrode caps is known to be highly correlated due in part to volume conduction. Consequently, this redundancy is also reflected in spatiotemporal patterns characterizing signal differences across experimental conditions. We present an alternative spatial representation and signal compression based on PCA for dimensionality reduction and ICA conducted across all subjects and conditions simultaneously. The second advancement is the use of partial least squares (PLS) analysis to assess task-dependent changes in the expression of the independent components. In an application to empirical ERP data, we derive an efficient number of independent component maps. Comparative PLS analysis on the independent components versus original electrode data shows that task effects are not only preserved under compression, but also enhanced statistically.

The neural representation of odor is modulated by the presence of a trigeminal stimulus during odor encoding	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						olfaction; trigeminal; context; EEG; evoked potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN OLFACTORY CORTEX; EMOTIONAL RESPONSES; INDUCED ACTIVATION; NASAL-MUCOSA; HUMANS; MIXTURES; STIMULATION; BRAIN; PERCEPTION	Objectives: Odor perception does not simply consist in hierarchical processing from transduction to a single "true" cerebral representation. Odor sensation may be modulated by available sensory information during encoding. The present study set out to examine whether the presence of a pure trigeminal stimulus during odor encoding may modulate odor perception at both behavioral and cortical levels. Methods: Participants were tested in a 2-session within-subject design: first, an odor encoding session included a delay conditioning procedure in which relatively selective olfactory stimulants (phenyl ethyl alcohol or vanillin, Conditioned Stimulus+, CS+) were presented either with a pulse Of CO2 (Unconditioned Stimulus, US), or alone (Conditioned Stimulus-, CS-); then, in the second session, both pure odorants (CS+ and CS-) were presented alone. During this second session, olfactory event-related potentials were simultaneously recorded and analyzed at different electrode sites including Cz and Pz (sites known to have maximal amplitudes for trigeminal and olfactory stimuli, respectively). After each trial, subjects were asked to rate odor intensity and hedonics. Results: The results showed that CS+ intensity ratings increased in 8 subjects and decreased in 6. Cortically, a group effect was observed for P2 amplitude, which increased in the "CS+ intensity increase" group vs. the "CS+ intensity decrease" group at Cz (p < 0.05) but not at Pz (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This result suggests that the presence of a pure trigeminal Stimulus (CO2) during odor encoding alters the neural representation of a pure odor. Significance: The neural representation of odors comprises not only the odor itself but also contextual information (trigeminal in the present case) presented during encoding.

To study this phenomenon, stimulation techniques were developed to allow ortho- or retronasal presentation of chemosensory stimuli. Based on this technique, several studies were performed to investigate: (a) the subjects' ratings of stimulus intensity, hedonic characteristics of the stimuli, and stimulus quality; (b) the peripherally obtained electro-olfactogram; (c) EEG-derived olfactory event-related potentials; and (d) cerebral activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging;additional experiments investigated (e) the differential sensitivity of the nasal mucosa to trigeminal stimuli; and finally (f) clinical observations were obtained from patients with nasal polyposis with regard to ortho- or retronasal presentation of chemosensory stimuli. Summarizing these results, the studies indicate that there are perceptual differences in relation to ortho- and retronasal stimulus presentation. They appear to relate to: (i) contextual effects; (ii) subtle differences in nasal airflow, therefore access of stimuli to the olfactory epithelium may play a role in perceptual differences; in addition (iii) differential trigerninal sensitivities of the respiratory epithelium, possibly in combination with (iv) differential wiring of olfactory receptor neurons, may contribute to the observed differences in the perception of stimuli presented through the ortho- or retronasal routes.

The application of the RMM to scalp potential interpolation was detailed in Part 1. Using the RMM and the same four dipoles, the different methods of cortical mapping were compared and have shown the potentiality of this RMM for obtaining current and potential cortical distributions. The lead-field matrices are well-adapted tools, but the use of a square matrix of high dimension does not permit the inverse solution to be improved in the presence of noise, as a regularisation technique is necessary with noisy data. With the RMM, the transfer matrix and the cortical imaging technique proved to be easy to implement. Further development of the RMM will include application to more realistic head models with more accurate conductivities.

The present electrophysiological study aims at deciphering the spatiotemporal organization of the effect of selective attention on the representation of concurrent sounds in the human auditory cortex. Sound onset asynchrony was manipulated to induce the segregation of two concurrent auditory streams. Each stream consisted of amplitude modulated tones at different carrier and modulation frequencies. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in epileptic patients with pharmacologically resistant partial epilepsy, implanted with depth electrodes in the temporal cortex. Patients were presented with the stimuli while they either performed an auditory distracting task or actively selected one of the two concurrent streams. Selective attention was found to affect steady-state responses in the primary auditory cortex, and transient and sustained evoked responses in secondary auditory areas. The results provide new insights on the neural mechanisms of auditory selective attention: stream selection during sound rivalry would be facilitated not only by enhancing the neural representation of relevant sounds, but also by reducing the representation of irrelevant information in the auditory cortex. Finally, they suggest a specialization of the left hemisphere in the attentional selection of fine-grained acoustic information.

In this study, we used electrical spatiotemporal mapping to compare cortical activation during encoding and recognition in a 56-year-old patient with severe, chronic post-anoxic amnesia and an age-matched control group. Event-related potentials were recorded as the subjects performed a continuous recognition task composed of meaningful designs. Activation in the control group rapidly progressed through eight different electrocortical configurations over 700 ms after onset of new stimuli. In contrast, activation in the amnesic patient was highly monotonous: it showed varying electrocortical patterns only during the first 150 ms but then remained abnormally stable for the remainder of the analysed time window. Electrical source localisation revealed that the patient failed to activate distributed cortical networks and that his processing was confined to visual areas. The present study suggests that the rapid activation of distributed cortical networks is critical for efficient encoding. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This goal, however, can only be reached when measures of high temporal sensitivity are available that are unequivocally assigned to a particular cognitive process. The present study evaluates the peak latency of the posterior contralateral negativity (PCN) as a temporal measure of visual spatial processing. In three experiments, we show systematic variability of the PCN latency with task demands. In visual search, PCN latency varied in the same direction as response times with the number of distractors. These effects, however, were smaller than the effects observed on response times, indicating that the process underlying the PCN might contribute to but did not determine response time effects. In contrast, in attentional cueing tasks and a stimulus localization task, where stimulus detection was the primarily addressed process, PCN latency varied to the same amount as manual response times. Thus, it is suggested that the latency of the PCN provides a reliable and valid temporal measure of target localization.

J	Guntekin, B; Basar, E				Guentekin, Bahar; Basar, Erol			Brain oscillations are highly influenced by gender differences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						gender differences; brain oscillations; occipital cortex; EEG; visual evoked potentials	THETA; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; TASK	There are few studies describing gender differences in event related oscillations (EROS). In the present report we demonstrate that gender differences are apparent in EROS even during simple visual stimulation, possibly activating very basic sensory networks. The data of 32 (16 males) healthy subjects were recorded from thirteen different scalp locations (F-3, F-4, C-z, C-3, C-4, T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, P-3, P-4, O-1, O-2). Analysis was performed in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (5-8.5 Hz), alpha (9-13 Hz), beta (15-24 Hz), and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency ranges. The results showed that the maximum peak-to-peak delta response amplitudes for women were significantly higher than for men over occipital, parietal, central and temporal electrode locations. There were also differentiations in the beta and gamma oscillatory responses. These gender differences were most pronounced over the electrode Site O-2, that is, over primary visual areas. It is suggested that this study might serve as a standard to investigate gender differences in electrophysiology. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Feature extraction for single trial record of visual mismatch negativity by use of independent component analysis	2007 IEEE/ICME INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPLEX MEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering	MAY 23-27, 2007	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, ICME		independent component analysis (ICA); visual mismatch negativity; single trial data; selective averaging		Signal averaging method is usually utilized for extracting the characteristics of event related potentials (ERPs). However, the amplitude and duration of ERPs are not constant for each stimulus due to the fluctuation of the subject's state, accordingly the appropriate selection of available data is crucial for realizing the accurate averaging. Independent component analysis (ICA) is one of powerful tool for signal processing, and some application to analyze the neurological signal processing such as electroencephalogram (EEG), evoked potentials (EPs), ERPs and so on were done. In this study, ICA was applied to process the visual mismatch negativity (V-MMN) for extracting the features and for selecting the appropriate single trial data for averaging. From the grand average waveform of V-MMN, signal separation matrix was determined by use of ICA. Characteristic parameters for evaluating single trial data were calculated from the decomposed components of ERPs. Then, the available single trial data was selected based on the value of evaluation parameter. Waveforms of selective averaging method and conventional averaging method were compared and the effectiveness of the proposed method was examined.

In order to pick out the ABR from the background EEG activity that obscures it, stimulus-synchronized averaging of many repeated trials is necessary, typically requiring up to 2000 repetitions. This number of repetitions can be very difficult, time consuming and uncomfortable for some subjects. In this study, a method combining wavelet analysis and Bayesian networks is introduced to reduce the required number of repetitions, which could offer a great advantage in the clinical situation. 314 ABRs with 64 repetitions and 155 ABRs with 128 repetitions recorded from eight subjects are used here A wavelet transform is applied to each of the ABRs, and the important features of the ABRs are extracted by thresholding and matching the wavelet coefficients. The significant wavelet coefficients that represent the extracted features of the ABRs are then used as the variables to build the Bayesian network for classification of the ABRs. In order to estimate the performance of this approach, stratified ten-fold cross-validation is used.

One of the causes of variation is the overlap in P300 (P3A and P3B) components resulting in inaccurate latency determination. Recently, we have shown that identification of P3A and P3B components using source analysis techniques significantly reduces P300 latency variability in healthy younger subjects. Here, we included a novel paradigm to enhance sensitivity and investigated the efficiency of the source analysis technique in reducing the P300 latency variability in healthy older subjects. Data were recorded with a 128-channel EEG system in 28 healthy subjects (aged 53-82 years, 12 males). We used a standard two-tone and a novel three-tone auditory oddball paradigm and an established source analysis technique, and compared the latencies to those obtained with conventional P300 analysis. The source analysis method identified both P3A and P3B components in a substantially larger percentage of subjects (93% versus 32%) than the conventional method. Both for the standard and novel paradigm, the source analysis method yielded a later mean P3B latency (361.4 versus 344.2 milliseconds, P=0.0 17, and 374.4 milliseconds versus 354.3 milliseconds, P=0.014, respectively) with a smaller standard deviation (15.8 versus 26.2 milliseconds, P=0.013,and 18.9 versus 30.0 milliseconds, P=0.052, borderline significant, respectively) than the conventional P300 method, for subjects aged 50 to 70 years. When applying the source analysis technique, as in young healthy subjects, a considerable reduction of P300 latency variability was thus found in healthy older subjects aged 50 to 70 years for both paradigms. This may have important consequences for applications of clinical event-related potential research in the early diagnosis of dementia, because the first signs of this disease are mostly observed in this age category.

J	Will, U; Berg, E				Will, Udo; Berg, Eric			Brain wave synchronization and entrainment to periodic acoustic stimuli	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						synchronization; entrainment; brainwaves; auditory stimuli	DYNAMICS; EEG; POTENTIALS; SEQUENCES; RESPONSES; RHYTHM; SCALP	As known, different brainwave frequencies show synchronies related to different perceptual, motor or cognitive states. Brainwaves have also been shown to synchronize with external stimuli with repetition rates of ca. 10-40 Hz. However, not much is known about responses to periodic auditory stimuli with periodicities found in human rhythmic behavior (i.e. 0.5-5 Hz). In an EEG study we compared responses to periodic stimulations (drum sounds and clicks with repetition rates of 1-8 Hz), silence, and random noise. Here we report inter-trial coherence measures taken at the Cz-electrode that show a significant increase in brainwave synchronization following periodic stimulation. Specifically, we found (1) a tonic synchronization response in the delta range with a maximum response at 2 Hz, (2) a phasic response covering the theta range, and (3) an augmented phase synchronization throughout the beta/gamma range (13-44 Hz) produced through increased activity in the lower gamma range and modulated by the stimulus periodicity. Periodic auditory stimulation produces a mixture of evoked and induced, rate-specific and rate-independent increases in stimulus related brainwave synchronization that are likely to affect various cognitive functions. The synchronization responses in the delta range may form part of the neurophysiological processes underlying time coupling between rhythmic sensory input and motor output; the tonic 2 Hz maximum corresponds to the optimal tempo identified in listening, tapping synchronization, and event-interval discrimination experiments. In addition, synchronization effects in the beta and gamma range may contribute to the reported influences of rhythmic entrainment on cognitive functions involved in learning and memory tasks.

We hypothesized, that (i) auditory imagery should elicit proper auditory evoked effects (N1/P2 complex) and a late positive component (LPC). Generally, based on recent human brain mapping studies we expected (ii) to observe the involvement of different temporal and parietal lobe areas in imagery and in perception of acoustic stimuli. Furthermore we predicted (iii) that temporal regions show an asymmetric trend due to the different specialization of the temporal lobes in processing speech and non-speech sounds. Finally we sought evidence supporting the notion that short-term training is sufficient to drive top-down activity in brain regions that are not normally recruited by sensory induced bottom up processing. Methods: 18 non-musicians partook in a 30 channels based EEG session that investigated spatio-temporal dynamics of auditory imagery of "consonant-vowel" (CV) syllables and piano triads. To control for conditioning effects, we split the volunteers in two matched groups comprising the same conditions (visual, auditory or bimodal stimulation) presented in a slightly different serial order. Furthermore the study presents electromagnetic source localization (LORETA) of perception and imagery of CV-and piano stimuli. Results: Our results imply that auditory imagery elicited similar electrophysiological effects at an early stage (N1/P2) as auditory stimulation. However, we found an additional LPC following the N1/P2 for auditory imagery only. Source estimation evinced bilateral engagement of anterior temporal cortex, which was generally stronger for imagery of music relative to imagery of speech. While we did not observe lateralized activity for the imagery of syllables we noted significantly increased rightward activation over the anterior supratemporal plane for musical imagery. Conclusion: Thus, we conclude that short-term top-down training based auditory imagery of music and speech prompts involvement of distinct neural circuits residing in the perisylvian cortex.

However, such results if computed from scalp data are ambiguous since electric sources are spatially oriented. Non-ambiguous results can be obtained using calculated time series of strength of intracerebral model sources. This is illustrated applying LORETA modeling to EEG during resting and meditation. During meditation, time series of LORETA model sources revealed a tendency to decreased left-right intracerebral coherence in the delta band, and to increased anterior-posterior intracerebral coherence in the theta band. An alternate conceptualization of functional binding is based on the observation that brain electric activity is discontinuous, i.e., that it occurs in chunks of up to about 100 ms duration that are detectable as quasi-stable scalp field configurations of brain electric activity, called microstates. Their functional significance is illustrated in spontaneous and event-related paradigms, where microstates associated with imagery-versus abstract-type mentation, or while reading positive versus negative emotion words showed clearly different regions of cortical activation in LORETA tomography. These data support the concept that complete brain functions of higher order such as a momentary thought might be incorporated in temporal chunks of processing in the range of tens to about 100 ms as quasi-stable brain states; during these time windows, subprocesses would be accepted as members of the ongoing chunk of processing.

The neural mechanisms underlying EMDR remain unclear. However, prior behavioral work looking at the effects of bilateral EMs on the retrieval of episodic memories suggests that the EMs enhance interhemispheric interaction. The present study examined the effects of the EMs used in EMDR on interhemispheric electroencephalogram coherence. Relative to noneye-movement controls, engaging in bilateral EMs led to decreased interhemispheric gamma electroencephalogram coherence. Implications for future work on EMDR and episodic memory are discussed.

In this study, the working hypothesis was that a specific pattern of parieto-occipital activation is induced by conscious, as opposed to unconscious, visuo-spatial processes. Electroencephalographic data (128 channels) were recorded in 12 normal adults during a visuo-spatial task. A cue stimulus appeared on the right or the left (equal probability) monitor side for a 'threshold time' inducing similar to 50% of correct recognitions. It was followed (after 2 s) by visual go stimuli at spatially congruent or incongruent positions with reference to the cue location. The left (right) mouse button was clicked if the go stimulus appeared on the left (right) monitor side. Subjects were required to say 'seen' if they had detected the cue stimulus or 'not seen' if they missed it (self-report). 'Seen' and 'not seen' electroencephalographic trials were averaged separately to form visual evoked potentials. Sources of these potentials were estimated by LORETA software. Reaction time to go stimuli was shorter during spatially congruent than incongruent 'seen' trials, possibly due to covert attention on cue for self-report. It was also shorter during spatially congruent than incongruent 'not seen' trials, as an objective sign of unconscious processes. Cue stimulus evoked parieto-occipital potentials which has the same peak latencies in the 'seen' and 'not seen' cases. Sources of these potentials were located in occipital area 19 and parietal area 7. Source strength was significantly stronger in 'seen' than 'not seen' cases at similar to+300 ms post-stimulus. These results may unveil features of parieto-occipital activation accompanying visuo-spatial consciousness.

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this disorder a biophysical model of the cortex was used to fit and replicate the EEGs from 54 ADHD adolescents and their control subjects. The EEG abnormalities in ADHD were accounted for by the model's neurophysiological parameters as follows: (i) dendritic response times were increased, (ii) intrathalamic activity involving the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) was increased, consistent with enhanced delta-theta activity, and (iii) intracortical activity was increased, consistent with slow wave (< 1 Hz) abnormalities. The longer dendritic response time is consistent with the increase in the activity of inhibitory cells types, particularly in the TRN, and therefore reduced arousal. The increase in intracortical activity may also reflect an increase in background activity or cortical noise within neocortical circuits. hi terms of neurochemistry, these findings may be accounted for by disturbances in the cholinergic and/or noradrenergic systems. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to use a detailed biophysical model of the brain to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying ionic abnormalities in ADHD.

It has been suggested that the beneficial effect of nicotine replacement therapy may be mediated partly by the ability of nicotine to reduce distraction by such stimuli and thereby to facilitate attention to task-relevant stimuli. The present study tested the hypothesis that nicotine reduces distraction by aversive and smoking-related stimuli as indexed by the parietal P3b brain response to a task-relevant target digit. We assessed the effect of nicotine on distraction by emotionally negative, positive, neutral, and smoking-related pictures immediately preceding target digits during a rapid visual information processing task in 16 smokers in a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subjects design. The study included two experimental sessions. After overnight smoking deprivation ( 12+ hr), active nicotine patches were applied to participants during one of the sessions and placebo patches were applied during the other session. Nicotine enhanced P3b responses associated with target digits immediately subsequent to negative emotional pictures bilaterally and subsequent to smoking-related pictures only in the right hemisphere. No effects of nicotine were observed for P3bs subsequent to positive and neutral distractor pictures. Another measure of attention, contingent negative variation amplitude in anticipation of the target digits also was increased by nicotine, especially in the left hemisphere and at posterior sites. Together, these findings suggest that nicotine reduces the distraction by emotionally negative and smoking-related stimuli and promotes attention to task-related stimuli by modulating somewhat lateralized and task-specific neural networks.

The key problem causing these car accidents is mainly because that the drivers failed to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-fight experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. Three different feature extraction methods including Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE), Principlal Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) are applied to reduce the feature dimension and project the measured EEG signals to a feature space spanned by their eigenvectors. After that, the mapped data can be classified with fewer features and their classification results are compared by utilizing three different classifiers including Gaussian classifier (GC), k Nearest neighbor classification (KNNC), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Experimental results show that the successful rate of Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction combined with Gaussian classifier is higher more than 10% compared with other combinations. It also demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing single-trail ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.

We hypothesised that C-N should vary during cognitive processing, specifically during an oddball task. Methods: In 11 normal human subjects, we recorded from groups of EEG electrodes in the frontal (F), central-parietal (CP) and occipito-temporal (OT) regions during a visual oddball reward conditioning task and calculated C-N in each region. Three types of visual stimulus (abstract shapes, called neutral, reward and penalty) were presented randomly in three blocks of trials. During the first block, subjects did not know the significance of the stimulus shapes. For the subsequent (conditioning) blocks, subjects were informed that whenever they saw reward or penalty patterns, they would win or lose money, respectively. Results: In regions CP and OT, C-N was significantly larger in reward and penalty trials than in neutral during all blocks. During a trial, significant changes in C-N occurred around the ERP peaks N1 and P300 and the effects of reward conditioning on CN could be distinguished from penalty. Conclusions: Our findings support the above hypothesis, indicating that C-N correlates with both the sensory and cognitive components of stimulus processing. Significance: This study extends the scope of C-N in the analysis of cognitive processing. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is less clear, however, to what type of memory sub-processes theta is related. Using a continuous word recognition task with different repetition lags, we investigate whether theta reflects the strength of an episodic memory trace or general processing demands, such as task difficulty. The results favor the episodic trace decay hypothesis and show that during the access of an episodic trace in a time window of similar to 200-400 ms, theta power decreases with increasing lag (between the first and second presentation of an item). LORETA source localization of this early theta lag effect indicates that parietal regions are involved in episodic trace processing, whereas right frontal regions may guide the process of retrieval. We conclude that episodic encoding can be characterized by two different stages: traces are first processed at parietal sites at similar to 300 ms, then further processing takes place in regions of the medial temporal lobe at similar to 500 ms. Only the first stage is related to theta, whereas the second is reflected by a slow wave with a frequency of similar to 2.5 Hz.

To further investigate sensory gating function in panic disorder we performed a case-control study in a, sample of 28 patients with PD, compared to 28 normal subjects and 28 schizophrenic subjects evaluating auditory mid-latency evoked potential P50 in a double-click paradigm as a measure of sensory gating. PD subjects showed weaker sensory gating as evidenced by higher P50 ratios as compared to normal subjects (62.5% vs. 45.4%, p = 0.03) and higher S2 (test) amplitude (3.5 mu V vs. 2.1 mu V, p = 0.01). Schizophrenic subjects when compared to healthy controls showed higher P50 ratios as compared to normal subjects (79.2% vs. 45.4%, p < 0.01) and higher S2 amplitude (3.3 mu V vs. 2.1 mu V, p = 0.01), but were not statistically different from PD subjects (p > 0.1). The present study corroborates recent findings of sensory gating dysfunction in PD. Further studies are still necessary to better understand the pathophysiology of this neurophysiological dysfunction and its nature as a trait or a state marker. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We recorded the cortical brain activity from 40 subjects (M:F=20:20) during local and global stimuli cognition process. The stimuli were generated based on the modified version of Navon's hierarchical structured stimuli [1]. We found the differences in 4 similar to 8 Hz theta oscillation during the task between male and female groups in sLORETA patterns, particularly in the right temporal cortex. We also found the similar theta oscillation patterns in power spectrum analysis: higher synchronized theta activity between posterior parietal lobe and frontal lobe was found in female group than that of male group. These findings suggest higher dependence on local-global stimulation cognition and memory recall in female. We suggest that sLORETA can be a good tool for detecting local-global stimulus cognition and be a good diagnostic for the neuropsychiatric disorders related to the local-global processing such as Obsessive-compulsive disorder and Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Here we examined the response of two electrophysiological signals, the N170 ERP and induced gamma-band activity (>20 Hz), to face orientation and familiarity across two blocks, one in which the face identity was task-relevant and one in which it was not. N170 amplitude to inverted faces was higher than to upright faces and was not influenced by face familiarity or its task relevancy. In contrast, induced gamma activity was higher for upright than for inverted faces and for familiar than unfamiliar faces. The effect of face inversion was found in lower gamma frequency band (25-50 Hz), whereas familiarity affected amplitudes in higher gamma frequency band (50-70 Hz). For gamma, the relevance of face identity to the task modulated both inversion and familiarity effects. These findings pinpoint three functionally dissociated neural mechanisms involved in face processing, namely, detection, configural analysis, and recognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These changes can be recorded through electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's disease in the time interval between the surgery and the internalization of the connections to the batteries. Both baseline activity and movement-related changes are different in the 'on' and 'off' medication motor states. In the 'off' state a low frequency activity in the alpha-beta range (8-25 Hz) that dominates the spectrum is interrupted during the movement, while in the 'on' state baseline frequencies are higher and a peri-movement gamma increase (70-80 Hz) is usually observed. Similar changes have been described with electrocorticographic recordings over the primary motor cortex but the gamma increase was only present during contralateral movements. We compared ipsi- and contralateral movement-related changes in STN activity, using a time-frequency analysis of the recordings obtained simultaneously in both STN and the scalp (electroencephalography) during right and left hand movements. The movement-related changes observed in the STN in the 'on' and the 'off' states were similar to those described previously in terms of predominant frequency bands, but we found bilateral changes in the STN during movements of either hand. A contralateral earlier start of the beta STN changes was mostly observed when the moving hand corresponded to the less-affected side, irrespective of hand dominance. These results suggest that movement-related activity in the STN has, by and large, a bilateral representation and probably reflects cortical input.

The profile of the described dysfunctions matches frontal lobe circuits which also play a role in reward processing and reinforcement behavior. However, it is largely unknown if cerebral dysfunctions are reversible or persist during long term abstinence. Materials and methods: Cortical activation during auditory target processing (oddball task, P300 component) was recorded with 32-channel EEG in 247 healthy subjects consisting of 84 smokers, 53 former smokers ( mean time of abstinence 11.9 years), and 110 never smokers. Results: Both current smokers and former smokers exhibited significantly diminished P300 amplitudes (Cz, Pz) relative to never smokers. Neuroelectric source analysis ( low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) revealed a hypoactivation of the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, and prefrontal cortex in smokers compared to never smokers. A similar profile of hypoactivation was observed in former smokers. Conclusion: For the first time, evidence is provided that dysfunctional activation of frontal lobe networks in smokers is also present in long term abstainers.

Responses elicited by snout stimulation in the swine also contain similar HFOs during the rising phase of the porcine N20. This study examined the generators of the N20 and HFOs in the swine. Methods: We recorded intracortical SEPs and multi-unit activities in the sulcal area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) simultaneously with SEFs. The laminar profiles of the potential and current-source-density (CSD) were analyzed. Results: The CSD analysis revealed that the N20 was produced by two dipolar generators, both directed toward the cortical surface. After the arrival of the initial thalamocortical volley in layer TV, the sink of the first generator shifted toward shallower layers II-III with a velocity of 0.109 +/- 0.038 m/s (mean +/- SD). The sink of the second generator moved to layer V. The initial thalamocortical axonal component of the HFO was produced by repolarizing current with the sink in layer IV. The CSD laminar profile of the postsynaptic component was very similar to the profile of intracortical N20. The current sink within each cycle of HFO propagated upward with a velocity of 0.633 +/- 0.189 m/s, indicating backpropagation. Conclusions: We proposi, that the N20 is generated by two sets of excitatory neurons which also produce the HFOs. Although the loci of synaptic inputs are unknown, these neurons appear to fire initially in the soma and produce backpropagating spikes toward distal apical dendrites. Significance: These conclusions relate the N20 to the HFO and provide a new explanation of how the current underlying the N20 is invatiantly directed toward superficial layers across species.

In particular, the role of the occluding object in visual processing and its effect on the subsequent recognition of the occluded object is unclear. We report three human behavioral experiments suggesting that the recognition of partially visible objects is facilitated when the missing object information is replaced by an occluder rather than simply removed. Furthermore, we provide EEG evidence suggesting that the processes responsible for facilitated recognition occur relatively early in the visual stream. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Induction of LTP-like changes in human auditory cortex by rapid auditory stimulation: An FMRI study	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						LTP; human; auditory; fMRI; plasticity	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SCANNER BACKGROUND-NOISE; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NMDA RECEPTORS; TRANSMISSION; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; PLASTICITY; AMPLITUDE	Purpose: Previously we have shown that rapid sensory stimulation, in this case, auditory tone pips, can induce long-lasting plastic changes akin to Long Term Potentiation (LTP) within adult human sensory cortex. In a previous study, auditory LTP was reflected as an increase in the amplitude of the NI component of the auditory event-related potential as measured by EEG. The goal of the present study was to investigate potential effects of LTP-like changes on the hemodynamic response of the human auditory cortex. Methods: Silent sparse-sampled fMRI recordings were obtained while subjects passively listened to tone-pips both before and after a short block of rapidly presented auditory tone-pips (auditory tetanus) was delivered. Results: The BOLD response within the primary auditory cortex was significantly enhanced after the auditory tetanus. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating LTP-like changes of the hemodynamic response in the auditory system, and thus supports the growing literature demonstrating UP can be induced in adult human cortex. These results have implications in the fields of perceptual learning and rehabilitation.

Multisensory processing and oscillatory activity: analyzing non-linear electrophysiological measures in humans and simians	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cross-modal; bimodal; EEG; ERP; binding; oscillation; beta gamma	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; AUDITORY ASSOCIATION CORTEX; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HUMAN BRAIN; HUMAN EEG; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CROSSMODAL BINDING	Stimulus-related oscillations are known to be closely linked to integrative processing in the brain. One research domain within which there has been tremendous interest in oscillatory mechanisms is in the integration of inputs across the widely separated sensory systems. Under the standard approach of assessing multisensory interactions in electrophysiological datasets, the event-related response to a multisensory stimulus is directly compared with the sum of the responses to its unisensory constituents when presented alone. When using methods like wavelet transformation or fast Fourier transformation to derive induced oscillatory signals, however, such linear operations are not appropriate. Here we introduce a simple bootstrapping procedure wherein the linear summation of single unisensory trials forms a distribution against which multisensory trials may be statistically compared, an approach that circumvents the issue of non-linearity when combining unisensory oscillatory responses. To test this approach we applied it to datasets from intracranial recordings in non-human primates and human scalp-recorded EEG, both derived from a simple audio-visual integration paradigm. Significant multisensory interactions were revealed in oscillatory activity centered at 15 and 20 Hz (the so-called beta band). Simulations of different levels of background noise further validated the results obtained by this method. By demonstrating super- and sub-additive effects, our analyses showed that this approach is a valuable metric for studying multisensory interactions reflected in induced oscillatory responses.

We measured motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), before and after mobile phone exposure (active and sham) in 10 normal volunteers. Three sites were stimulated (motor cortex (CTX), brainstem (BST) and spinal nerve (Sp)). The short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) of the motor cortex reflecting GABAergic interneuronal function was also studied by paired pulse TMS method. MEPs to single pulse TMS were also recorded in two patients with multiple sclerosis showing temperature dependent neurological symptoms (hot bath effect). Neither MEPs to single pulse TMS nor the SICI was affected by 30 min of EMF exposure from mobile phones or sham exposure. In two MS patients, mobile phone exposure had no effect on any parameters of MEPs even though conduction block occurred at the corticospinal tracts after taking a bath. As far as available methods are concerned, we did not detect any short-term effects of 30 min mobile phone exposure on the human motor cortical output neurons or interneurons even though we can not exclude the possibility that we failed to detect some mild effects due to a small sample size in the present study. This is the first study of MEPs after electromagnetic exposure from a mobile phone in neurological patients.

Behavioral studies have shown that thatcherization of an upright face disrupts perceptual processing of the local configuration. We recorded high-density EEG from normal observers to study ERP correlates of the illusion during the perception of faces and nonface objects, to determine whether inversion and thatcherization affect similar neural mechanisms. Observers viewed faces and houses in four conditions (upright vs. inverted, and normal vs. thatcherized) while detecting an oddball category (chairs). Thatcherization delayed the N170 component over occipito-temporal cortex to faces, but not to houses. This modulation matched the illusion as it was larger for upright than inverted faces. The PI over medial occipital regions was delayed by face inversion but unaffected by thatcherization. Finally, face thatcherization delayed P2 over occipito-temporal but not over parietal regions, while inversion affected P2 across categories. All effects involving thatcherization were face-specific. These results indicate that effects of face inversion and feature inversion (in thatcherized faces) can be distinguished on a functional as well as neural level, and that they affect configural processing of faces in different time windows.

We first distinguish the temporary neuropsychological impairments often observed in the natural history of BCECTS from the more long-lasting and more specific neuropsychological deficits associated with CSWS, of which the Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is the most studied clinical form. A series of metabolic findings from (18)FDG-PET studies in BCECTS and CSWS children have shown that specific cognitive impairment is related to increased glucose uptake in cortical areas restricted to the associative cortex coincident with the focus of spike-wave discharges. From recent functional neuroimaging data of three patients recovered from LKS, we address the issue of the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment persisting after complete recovery of epilepsy. Finally, we discuss the reliability of the study of mismatch negativity to address the issue of the early effect of interictal discharges in typical and atypical BCECTS on the auditory cortex and the development of speech processing essential to verbal learning.

For the frequency analysis of MEG, a beamformer program, synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM), was employed and event-related desynchronization (ERD) or synchronization (ERS) was statistically determined. Both strong and weak odors induced ERD in (1) beta band (13-30 Hz) in the right precentral gyrus, and the superior and middle frontal gyri in both hemispheres, (2) low gamma band (30-60 Hz) in the left superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, and the middle frontal gyrus in both hemispheres, and (3) high gamma band 2 (100-200 Hz) in the right inferior frontal gyrus. TPD induced ERD in the left temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, while TTFD induced ERD in the right temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that physiological functions in several regions in the frontal lobe may change and the strength of the odor may play a different role in each hemisphere during olfactory perception in humans.

From perception to action: phase-locked gamma oscillations correlate with reaction times in a speeded response task	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED PATTERNS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; BAND RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FREQUENCY; HUMANS; BRAIN; ARCHITECTURE; PARADIGMS	Background: Phase- locked gamma oscillations have so far mainly been described in relation to perceptual processes such as sensation, attention or memory matching. Due to its very short latency (approximate to 90 ms) such oscillations are a plausible candidate for very rapid integration of sensory and motor processes. Results: We measured EEG in 13 healthy participants in a speeded reaction task. Participants had to press a button as fast as possible whenever a visual stimulus was presented. The stimulus was always identical and did not have to be discriminated from other possible stimuli. In trials in which the participants showed a fast response, a slow negative potential over central electrodes starting approximately 800 ms before the response and highly phase-locked gamma oscillations over central and posterior electrodes between 90 and 140 ms after the stimulus were observed. In trials in which the participants showed a slow response, no slow negative potential was observed and phase- locked gamma oscillations were significantly reduced. Furthermore, for slow response trials the phase- locked gamma oscillations were significantly delayed with respect to fast response trials. Conclusion: These results indicate the relevance of phase- locked gamma oscillations for very fast ( not necessarily detailed) integration processes.

Detailed results from this survey, which was based on the Brain Interface Design Framework proposed by Mason and Birch, are presented and discussed to address the following research questions: (1) which BI technologies are directly comparable, (2) what technology designs exist, (3) which application areas (users, activities and environments) have been targeted in these designs, (4) which design approaches have received little or no research and are possible opportunities for new technology, and (5) how well are designs reported. The results of this work demonstrate that meta-analysis of high-level BI design attributes is possible and informative. The survey also produced a valuable, historical cross-reference where BI technology designers can identify what types of technology have been proposed and by whom.

Recent findings Recent brain-computer interface studies are largely targeted at helping severely or even completely paralysed patients. The former are only able to communicate yes or no via a single muscle twitch, and the latter are totally nonresponsive. Such patients can control brain-computer interfaces and use them to select letters, words or items on a computer screen, for neuroprosthesis control or for surfing the Internet. This condition of motor paralysis, in which cognition and consciousness appear to be unaffected, is traditionally opposed to non responsiveness due to disorders of consciousness. Although these groups of patients may appear to be very alike, numerous transition states between them are demonstrated by recent studies. Summary All nonresponsive patients can be regarded on a continuum of consciousness which may vary even within short time periods. As overt behaviour is lacking, cognitive functions in such patients can only be investigated using neurophysiological methods. We suggest that brain-computer interfaces may provide a new tool to investigate cognition in disorders of consciousness, and propose a hierarchical procedure entailing passive stimulation, active instructions, volitional paradigms, and brain-computer interface operation.

J	Basar, E				Basar, Erol			The theory of the whole-brain-work	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain oscillations; spatial integration; temporal integration; super-synergy; APLR-alliance; causality; memory; attention; perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EARLY GAMMA RESPONSE; WAVELET ENTROPY; EEG-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; THETA; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION	The theory of the whole-brain-work basically explains the oscillatory dynamics of the human and nonhuman brain during cognitive processing. The theory is based on principles according to which brain functions are represented by the oscillatory activity. Oscillatory activity in a given frequency band performs multiple functions since they vary on a number of response parameters. There is selective cooperation in the stimulated brain; this produces super-binding between neural populations and super-synergy in the whole brain. The concept of super-synergy thus includes super-binding and, additionally, entropy and the role of EEG-oscillations as control parameters in brain's responsiveness. In super-synergy, spatial integration occurs through the selective cooperation of brain structures. Temporal integration occurs in line with the principle of superposition of oscillations in which the comparative polarity and phase angle are critical for forming the function-specific configurations. Extension of the theory of whole-brain-work to cognitive processing proposes that there is a constant reciprocal activation within the subprocesses of attention, perception learning and remembering and this leads to an APLR-alliance. In such a context, all brain functions are inseparable, for instance, from memory function and, in turn, memory states have no exact boundaries along the time space; memory states thus evolve in the APLR-alliance. The theory claims that the reentry and the dynamic behavior of oscillations during the reciprocal activation in APLR-alliance are among the causal factors for brain dynamics and for cognition.

The authors evaluated the similarity of inter-individual variation of the response strength between MMN and MMF recordings. Three types of MMN or MMF were recorded in ten healthy subjects: change in duration of pure-tone stimuli, change in duration of the Japanese vowel /a/, and difference between the Japanese vowels /a/ and /o/. There was no significant correlation between MMN amplitude and MMF strength under any condition and in either hemisphere. These results suggest that widely used indices of MMN in the two technologies, i.e., EEG-amplitude and MEG-ECD may not be proportional in an individual. To further clarify the differential significance of recording MMN/MMF may be important to establish MMN/MMF as clinical indices of individual ability of preattentive stage of auditory processing.

To examine the possible existence of different strategies, we used sentence-sentence and sentence picture verification trials in mixed blocks, whereby the probability of a specific second stimulus was fixed within a block but varied between blocks. Brain activation (slow wave, 550-1100 ms after stimulus onset) linked to parsing spatial sentences (and not nonspatial sentences) occurred at parieto-occipital regions associated with mental image processing, and only when participants were expecting to compare verbal information to a picture. Therefore, this study provides neurointaging evidence that different representational formats of spatial sentences arise almost directly when people are reading a spatial sentence.

To do this, we non-invasively estimated local field potentials (LFPs) using the ELECTRA distributed inverse solution and applied non-parametric statistical tests at each brain voxel and for each time point. This yields a spatio-temporal activation pattern of differential brain responses. The method is illustrated here in the analysis of auditory-somatosensory (AS) multisensory interactions in four subjects. Differential multisensory responses were temporally and spatially consistent across individuals, with onset at similar to 50 ms and superposition within areas of the posterior superior temporal cortex that have traditionally been considered auditory in their function. The close agreement of these results with previous investigations of AS multisensory interactions suggests that the present approach constitutes a reliable method for studying multisensory processing with the temporal and spatial resolution required to elucidate several existing questions in this field. In particular, the present analyses permit a more direct comparison between human and animal studies of multisensory interactions and can be extended to examine correlation between electrophysiological phenomena and behavior.

We investigated the effects of self-regulation of slow cortical potentials for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Slow cortical potentials are slow event-related direct-current shifts of the electroencephalogram. Slow cortical potential shifts in the electrical negative direction reflect the depolarization of large cortical cell assemblies, reducing their excitation threshold. This training aims at regulation of cortical excitation thresholds considered to be impaired in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Electroencephalographic data from the training and the 6-month follow-up are reported, as are changes in behavior and cognition. METHOD. Twenty-three children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder aged between 8 and 13 years received 30 sessions of self-regulation training of slow cortical potentials in 3 phases of 10 sessions each. Increasing and decreasing slow cortical potentials at central brain regions was fed back visually and auditorily. Transfer trials without feedback were intermixed with feedback trials to allow generalization to everyday-life situations. In addition to the neurofeedback sessions, children exercised during the third training phase to apply the self-regulation strategy while doing their homework. RESULTS. For the first time, electroencephalographic data during the course of slow cortical potential neurofeedback are reported. Measurement before and after the trials showed that children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder learn to regulate negative slow cortical potentials. After training, significant improvement in behavior, attention, and IQ score was observed. The behavior ratings included Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, number of problems, and social behavior at school and were conducted by parents and teachers. The cognitive variables were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and with a computerized test battery that measures several components of attention. All changes proved to be stable at 6 months' follow-up after the end of training. Clinical outcome was predicted by the ability to produce negative potential shifts in transfer sessions without feedback. CONCLUSIONS. According to the guidelines of the efficacy of treatments, the evidence of the efficacy of slow cortical potential feedback found in this study reaches level 2: "possibly efficacious." In the absence of a control group, no causal relationship between observed improvements and the ability to regulate brain activity can be made. However, it could be shown for the first time that good performance in self-regulation predicts clinical outcome. "Good performance" was defined as the ability to produce negative potential shifts in trials without feedback, because it is known that the ability to self-regulate without feedback is impaired in children and adults with attention problems. Additional research should focus on the control of unspecific effects, medication, and subtypes to confirm the assumption that slow cortical potential feedback is a viable treatment option for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Regulation of slow cortical potentials may involve similar neurobiological pathways as medical treatment. It is suggested that regulation of frontocentral negative slow cortical potentials affects the cholinergic-dopaminergic balance and allows children to adapt to task requirements more flexibly.

Yet, how these characteristics are reflected in neural processes remains largely unknown. The present ERP study investigates neurophysiological correlates of phonotactic probability: the distributional frequency of phoneme combinations. Methods: We employed an ERP measure indicative of experience-dependent auditory memory traces, the mismatch negativity (MMN). We presented pairs of non-words that differed by the degree of phonotactic probability in a modified passive oddball design that minimizes the contribution of acoustic processes. Results: In Experiment I the non-word with high phonotactic probability (notsel) elicited a significantly enhanced MMN as compared to the non-word with low phonotactic probability (notkel). In Experiment 2 this finding was replicated with a non-word pair with a smaller acoustic difference (notsel-notfel). An MMN enhancement was not observed in a third acoustic control experiment with stimuli having comparable phonotactic probability (so-fo). Conclusions: Our data suggest that auditory cortical responses to phoneme clusters are modulated by statistical regularities of phoneme combinations. Significance: This study indicates that the language environment is relevant in shaping the neural processing of speech. Furthermore, it provides a potentially useful design for investigating implicit phonological processing in children with anomalous language functions like dyslexia.

In the present study we attempted to establish whether electrophysiological correlates of low-level cognitive processes present a long-term alteration, dependent on the level of use of ecstasy. We addressed this issue by investigating amplitude and latency of VEPs related to a very simple discrimination task involving sustained attention ( arousal). Eight heavy-MDMA users, eight moderate-MDMA users and 18 drug-free control subjects were asked to discriminate whether the digit at the centre of the screen was 1 or 2. None of the subjects ( except one) had used MDMA in the 6 months previous testing. We measured psychophysical performance and EEG, recorded in Oz and Fz during task execution. The heavy-MDMA users made significantly more errors than the other two groups ( p<.05). Moreover, they presented reduced amplitude but not latency of VEPs in both Oz and Fz. The effect in Oz is present in P200 ( for heavy users only, p<.05) and in P300 components ( for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p<.001, moderate users: p<.0.5). In Fz, the amplitude effect is present in N250 ( for heavy users only, p<.05) and in P300 components ( for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p<.05, moderate users: p<.05). The three groups do not differ in early components, reflecting low-level processing. These results provide evidence of long-term electrophysiological abnormality displayed by ecstasy users and agree with the suggestion that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause long-term altered cortical activity in humans.

The present study simulated backup alarms by presenting trains of five consecutive 500 ms duration audible tones, with the time between the onset of each tone being 1 s and the time between trains (offset to onset) between 15 and 20 s. In different conditions, the tones were set at either 80 or 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Twelve young adults spent two consecutive nights in the laboratory. Stimuli were presented only on the second night. Measures of traditional sleep architecture (sleep stages) were not affected by the acoustic trains. Event-related potentials were also measured following presentation of the stimuli. In the waking state, the initial 80 dB stimulus elicited a large amplitude N1, peaking at about 100 ms, followed by a positive peak, P3, peaking at about 325 ms. N1 was attenuated following presentation of the 60 dB stimulus. The amplitude of N1 was much reduced following presentation of the subsequent second to fifth stimuli in the train. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the initial 80 dB stimulus elicited a large and later negativity (N350) that was reduced in amplitude for the 60 dB stimulus. A K-Complex (a composite N350 and a much larger N550) was elicited following 35% of the initial 80 dB tones and 12% of the initial 60 dB tones. The amplitude of N550 did not, however, significantly vary as a function of stimulus SPL. During REM sleep, N1 continued to be elicited by the initial louder stimulus, but the later positive wave was not apparent. A late negativity peaking at about 350 ms was, however, apparent. When queried the next morning, subjects rarely indicated that the stimulus presentations disturbed their sleep. This might be because of the absence of the late positivity. The presence of the long latency negativities (N350 and N550) might serve to protect sleep from obtrusive sound during sleep.

Hypoxia has been shown to inhibit respiratory load perception in healthy and asthmatic subjects, and could contribute to treatment delays and impaired function of protective reflexes. Objectives: Using respiratory-related evoked potentials (RREPs) this study aimed to determine the sensory processes mediating hypoxia-induced suppression of respiratory load sensation. Methods: EEG was measured over the central and parietal cortical regions in 14 healthy subjects. RREPs were elicited by 500-ms midinspiratory resistive load stimuli during and after isocapnic normoxia or hypoxia (blood arterial O-2 saturation 80%). On a separate occasion, subjects rated the perceived magnitude of five externally applied inspiratory resistive loads (range, 8.6-43.7 cm H2O (.) L-1 . s) under similar experimental conditions. In both experiments subjects voluntarily ventilated approximately 90% above baseline to match ventilatory output between gas conditions. Results: RREP stimulus was matched between gas conditions in 11 subjects (minimum mask pressure -9.7 +/- 0.6 versus -9.2 +/- 0.4 cm H2O). P1 and P2 amplitudes were reduced during isocapnic hypoxia compared with normoxia (maximal at Cz: P1, 2.5 +/- 1.1 versus 3.9 +/- 1.2 mu v, p = 0.03; P2, 10.0 +/- 2.2 versus 12.4 +/- 2.1 mu v, p < 0.01, respectively). Perceived magnitude of externally applied resistive loads was also reduced during hypoxia compared with normoxia (17.1 +/- 1.1 versus 19.0 +/- 1.1 au, p < 0.01). Conclusions: These data confirm that isocapnic hypoxia suppresses respiratory load sensation. Decreased amplitude of the earlier (P1) RREP component suggests that this is mediated, at least in part, by suppression of respiratory afferent information before its arrival at the primary sensory cortex.

The objective of this study is to investigate information processing in these patients with concurrent registration of brain activity. Twenty-six breast-cancer patients treated with adjuvant CMF chemotherapy and a control group of 23 stage I breast-cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy were examined. Mean time since treatment for the CMF patients was 5.1 years after the last CMF course, and for the control patients 3.6 years after termination of radiotherapy. An information processing task was administered with concurrent EEG registration. Reaction times and the amplitudes and latencies of an Event Related Potential component (P3) in different task conditions related to input, central, and output processing of information were studied. Significant differences in latency and amplitude of the P3 component were found between the treatment groups with an earlier and reduced P3 in the chemotherapy group. Patients treated with chemotherapy had longer reaction times (although not significantly different) than the control group on all task conditions. Our data provide further evidence for long-term neurocognitive problems in breast-cancer patients treated with adjuvant (CMF) chemotherapy and offer new information regarding abnormalities in brain functioning in these patients.

Residual inhibition is a frequent phenomenon in individuals with tinnitus, and refers to the fact that tinnitus can temporarily be reduced by presenting sounds or noises that inhibit tinnitus for a limited time even after termination of the sound. This kind of stimulation-induced inhibition of tinnitus could potentially be used for treatment by combining it with additional interventions to enhance the extinction of tinnitus. Here we propose a training program aimed at the amplification and the extension in time of residual inhibition as well as the extinction of negative emotional responses to the tinnitus. The program is tested alone or in combination with a pharmacological intervention that is aimed at decreasing central hyperactivity. Treatment effects are assessed by tinnitus questionnaires, electroencephalographic measures (reduction in the amplitude of the N-100 component of the event-related potential as an indicator of habituation) as well as skin conductance responses to 1000 Hz tones or tinnitus-like tones. This training is an example of the use of centrally acting and mechanism-oriented tinnitus treatments.

It has been speculated that idling neurons in the penumbra zone remain viable several years after injury and might be reactivated by enhanced oxygenation. We studied the therapeutic potential of HBO2 therapy in a 54-year-old man who had sustained traumatic brain injuries one year before testing that resulted in permanent neurological symptoms. Methods: Two treatment series separated by a one-year inter-session interval were administered. Treatment series consisted of 20 and 60 daily one-hour exposures to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA. Electrophysiological (event-related potentials), metabolic and behavioral (sensorimotor and neuropsychological) measurements were obtained to evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on neurocognitive functioning. Results: Following the initial treatment, the patient showed improvements in sensorimotor functions, as well as enhanced P300 amplitude in the damaged hemisphere. Although most of these gains were no longer observed one year after treatment, these were reinstated with an additional series of 60 exposures. Neuropsychological improvements were also observed after the completion of the second series of treatments. Conclusion: The present single-case study provides preliminary evidence of neuropsychological and electrophysiological improvements after series of 20 and 60 treatments, although the first dosage appeared to be insufficient to produce permanent benefits.

Estimation of individual evoked potential components using iterative independent component analysis	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUZZY CLUSTERING APPROACH; BLIND SEPARATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; SINGLE TRIALS; EEG; PERSPECTIVE; ALGORITHMS; RESPONSES	Independent component analysis (ICA) has been successfully employed in the study of single-trial evoked potentials (EPs). In this paper, we present an iterative temporal ICA methodology that processes multielectrode single-trial EPs, one channel at a time, in contrast to most existing methodologies which are spatial and analyze EPs from all recording channels simultaneously. The proposed algorithm aims at enhancing individual components in an EP waveform in each single trial, and relies on a dynamic template to guide EP estimation. To quantify the performance of this method, we carried out extensive analyses with artificial EPs, using different models for EP generation, including the phase-resetting and the classical additive-signal models, and several signal-to-noise ratios and EP component latency jitters. Furthermore, to validate the technique, we employed actual recordings of the auditory N100 component obtained from normal subjects. Our results with artificial data show that the proposed procedure can provide significantly better estimates of the embedded EP signals compared to plain averaging, while with actual EP recordings, the procedure can consistently enhance individual components in single trials, in all subjects, which in turn results in enhanced average EPs. This procedure is well suited for fast analysis of very large multielectrode recordings in parallel architectures, as individual channels can be processed simultaneously on different processors. We conclude that this method can be used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of specific EP components and may have a significant impact as a clinical tool in the analysis of single-trial EPs.

Detrimental effects of irrelevant speech on serial recall of visual items are reflected in reduced visual N1 and reduced theta activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; irrelevant sound effect; ISE; N1; theta	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TOKEN SET SIZE; UNATTENDED SPEECH; WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTIONAL SELECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; DISRUPTION; SOUND; PERFORMANCE; HABITUATION	The term irrelevant sound effect (ISE) describes an empirically robust finding in which serial recall performance of visual items is reduced by irrelevant speech. At present little is known about its neurophysiological basis. Although some previous neuroelectric studies have concentrated on responses elicited by irrelevant background sound, whether the processing of visually presented to-be-remembered digits itself is affected by irrelevant speech has yet to be studied. An experiment (n = 20) was conducted in which serial recall performance for visually presented digits was tested during exposure to either irrelevant speech, continuous white noise or silence while measuring EEG activity. White noise was chosen as a control condition, because it constitutes auditory stimulation while leaving serial recall performance unimpaired. In addition to replicating the detrimental behavioural effect of irrelevant speech, an analogous speech-specific early decrease (-160 ms) in the visual ERP (N1) and subsequently a reduced theta response (4-6 Hz; 400-800 ms) at right prefrontal electrodes were observed. Although irrelevant sound presentation was restricted to the visual presentation phase, power spectra reveal that the weaker theta response for speech persisted in a silent retention phase before serial recall. Based on such data we propose reevaluating the role attention plays in explaining the ISE.

J	Kim, KH; Kim, JH				Kim, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Ja Hyun			Analysis of induced gamma-band activity in EEG during visual perception of Korean, English, Chinese words	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); gamma-band activity; Korean word; Chinsese characters; lateralization; visual word perception	ACTIVATION PATTERN; TIME-COURSE; MODULATION; ENGAGEMENT; RESPONSES; CORTEX; POWER; ERP	The oscillation of brain activities in the gamma-band is known to be a manifestation of the formation of neuronal assemblies that jointly constitute neural correlates of feature binding and conscious awareness. Visual word perception is a task that demands a considerable amount of cognitive resources and integration of information from multiple functionally connected neuronal circuits at various scales. Thus, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in gamma-band activity (GBA) would be observed during visual word perception. The purpose of this study was to examine whether meaningful increases in GBA occur during visual word perception and to explore similarities and differences in the amount and spatiotemporal GBA patterns while native Korean subjects perceive Korean, English, and Chinese words. We also aimed at identifying relationships between GBA increase and a behavioral measure such as response time. The results of power spectrum and time-frequency analyses showed that the increases in GBA were most significant in the prefrontal, frontal, and temporal sites, which are known to be relevant to visual word perception. The GBAs in the prefrontal and temporal sites were significantly correlated with response time. The differences in spatiotemporal patterns of GBA among languages were not prominent compared to inter-individual differences. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Insight requires a restructuring of the problem situation that is relatively rare and hard to elicit in the laboratory. One way of dealing with this problem is to catalyze such restructuring processes using solution hints. This allows one to obtain multiple insight events and their accurate onset times, which are required for event-related designs in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram (EEG), and to reliably record the activity associated with the restructuring component of insight. In this article, we discuss in detail the methodological challenges that brain research on insight poses and describe how we dealt with these challenges in our recent studies on insight problem solving.

Eye contact influences neural processing of emotional expressions in 4-month-old infants	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						infants; EEG; eye gaze; social cognition; ERP	FACE; RECOGNITION; GAZE; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; CROWD; ANGER	Eye gaze is a fundamental component of human communication. During the first post-natal year, infants rapidly learn that the gaze of others provides socially significant information. In addition, infants are sensitive to several emotional expressions. However, little is known regarding how eye contact influences the way the infant brain processes emotional expressions. We measured 4-month-old infants' brain electric activity to assess neural processing of faces displaying neutral, happy and angry emotional expressions when accompanied by direct and averted eye gaze. The results show that processing of angry facial expressions was influenced by eye gaze. In particular, infants showed enhanced neural processing of angry expressions when these expressions were accompanied by direct eye gaze. These results show that by 4 months of age, the infant detects angry emotional expressions, and the infant brain processes their relevance to the self.

We performed experiments on 26 subjects with a strategy consisting of two types of stimulations: (1) the picture of an elder anonymous lady (unknown face) and (2) the picture of the subject's own grandmother (known face). The subjects were healthy, young people between the ages of 15-32 years. Data were analyzed by means of amplitude frequency characteristics and digital filtering. Our results show the significant role of beta response in face recognition and the differentiation of known and unknown faces. Furthermore, this report supports our former view that the presentation of grandmother face evokes selectively distributed multiple oscillations in the brain. Together with the scope of other frequencies (e.g., delta, theta, and alpha), this method can serve as a tool for research studies or clinical studies in memory and cognition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A subgroup of patients suffer from long-term infection without developing significant disease symptoms requiring antiretroviral therapy (long-term survivors, LTS). We investigated the prevalence and severity of neurophysiological abnormalities in LTS. Methods: The outpatient database of the Dept. of Neurology, University of Munster, was searched for HIV-infection LTS (infection for more than 9 years, no antiretroviral therapy since infection, stable CD4-positive lymphocyte count of more than 400/ul). Their neurophysiological test results (nerve conduction studies, event-related potentials, EEG) were compared to a control group of patients with similar disease duration not fulfilling the criteria for LTS. Results: Sixteen LTS patients and 22 control patients were investigated. Median age at examination was 35 years. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, sex, duration of the disease and way of infection. By definition, CD4+-lymphocyte counts differed between LTS and both control groups. Standard nerve conduction studies of the peroneal or the sural nerve were abnormal in 1 LTS patient and 3 control patients. Sural nerve paired stimulation amplitude showed abnormal findings in 4 LTS patients and 4 control patients. P300 latency Was prolonged in 4 LTS patients and 4 control patients. EEG background frequency was normal in all but one patient (LTS). There were no differences between groups regarding any of the parameters. Conclusion: Sensitive methods showed subtle affection of the nervous system in HINT-infected outpatients infected for more than 9 years. However, there was no difference between patients fulfilling accepted criteria of LTS, and those who did not. LTS most likely form the extreme end of a continuum of disease severity.

In this study, a theory of the "whole-brain-work," which can be useful for functional interpretation of brain oscillations, is presented together with its application to recognition of faces and facial expressions. Following results are summarized: (1) Mechanisms leading to the perception of the grandmother picture are manifested with parallel activations of neural assemblies in different cortical locations and as superposition of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Known and anonymous faces can be differentiated by means of oscillatory brain dynamics. Percepts cannot be localized in a given specific region. The differentiation of facial expression induces significant change in alpha and theta oscillation. (2) While the importance of fMRI in object recognition is clear, this method has low temporal resolution. Our results shows that multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ins, thus completing and implementing the analysis of percepts in the dynamic window and indicating a broader distribution at the cortex. (3) The presented evidence of selectively distributed multiple oscillations for differentiation of facial percepts is in conceptual accordance with the "selectively distributed processing" in neurocognitive networks of Goldman-Rakic, Fuster, and of Mesulam. The large-scale approach of several investigators is also confirmed with the new results. On facial stimuli, a given location can show a considerable selected activation, but the formation of percepts is manifested by multiple oscillations with differentiated weight in large neural populations. (4) The most important feature of the comparison of percepts of grandmother and anonymous faces is the existence of a variety of significant differences in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma responses between the anonymous and grandmother faces in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital sites. (5) The brain response is a construct in a multi-dimensional state manifested by amplitudes of oscillatory responses, topological coordinates, and changes in the time axis following presentation of the percepts including delays and prolongations, coherence between locations. Only a new metrics embracing all these parameters can be representative for dynamics of functionality in the brain. The conceptual aspects of this new scope are explained in the presented theory.

Here we dissociated between a neural mechanism manifested by the face-sensitive N170 event-related potential effect and a mechanism manifested by induced electro-encephalographic oscillations in the gamma band, which have been previously associated with the integration of individually coded features and activation of corresponding neural representations. The amplitude of the N170 was larger in the absence of the face contour but not affected by the configuration of inner components (ICs). Its latency was delayed by scrambling the configuration of the components as well as by the absence of the face contour. Unlike the N170, the amplitude of the induced gamma activity was sensitive to the configuration of ICs but insensitive to their presence within or outside a face contour. This pattern suggests a dual mechanism for early face processing, each utilizing different visual cues, which might indicate their respective roles in face processing. The N170 seems to be associated primarily with the detection and categorization of faces, whereas the gamma oscillations may be involved in the activation of their mental representation.

J	Frank, MJ; D'Lauro, C; Curran, T				Frank, Michael J.; D'Lauro, Christopher; Curran, Tim			Cross-task individual differences in error processing: Neural, electrophysiological, and genetic components	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AVERAGE REFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; DOPAMINE; NEGATIVITY	The error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) are electrophysiological markers of error processing thought to originate in the medial frontal cortex. Previous studies using probabilistic reinforcement showed that individuals who learn more from negative than from positive feedback (negative learners) had larger ERNs than did positive learners. These findings support the dopamine (DA) reinforcement-learning hypothesis of the ERN and associated computational models. However, it remains unclear (1) to what extent these effects generalize to tasks outside the restricted probabilistic reinforcement-learning domain and (2) whether there is a dopaminergic source of these effects. To address these issues, we tested subjects' reinforcement-learning biases behaviorally and recorded EEG during an unrelated recognition memory experiment. Initial recognition responses were speeded, but the subjects were subsequently allowed to self-correct their responses. We found that negative learners, as assessed via probabilistic learning, had larger ERNs in the recognition memory task, suggestive of a common underlying enhanced error-processing mechanism. Negative learners also had enhanced Pes when self-correcting errors than did positive learners. Moreover, the ERN and Pe components contributed independently to negative learning. We also tested for a dopaminergic genetic basis of these ERP components. We analyzed the COMT val/met polymorphism, which has been linked to frontal DA levels. The COMT genotype affected Pe (but not ERN) magnitude; met/met homozygotes showed enhanced Pes to self-corrected errors, as compared with val carriers. These results are consistent with a role for the Pe and frontal monoamines in error awareness.

After more than a century of both clinical and theoretical interest, the exact nature of such emotional disorders responsible for hysterical symptoms, and their functional consequences on neural systems in the brain, still remain largely unknown. However, several recent studies have used functional brain imaging techniques (such as EEG, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) in the attempt to identify specific neural correlates associated with hysterical conversion symptoms. This article presents a general overview of these findings and of previous neuropsychologically based accounts of hysteria. Functional neuroimaging has revealed selective decreases in the activity of frontal and subcortical circuits involved in motor control during hysterical paralysis, decreases in somatosensory cortices during hysterical anesthesia, or decreases in visual cortex during hysterical blindness. Such changes are usually not accompanied by any significant changes in elementary stages of sensory or motor processing as measured by evoked potentials, although some changes in later stages of integration (such as P300 responses) have been reported. On the other hand, several neuroimaging results have shown increased activation in limbic regions, such as cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex during conversion symptoms affecting different sensory or motor modalities. Taken together, these data generally do not support previous proposals that hysteria might involve an exclusion of sensorimotor representations from awareness through attentional processes. They rather seem to point to a modulation of such representations by primary affective or stress-related factors, perhaps involving primitive reflexive mechanisms of protection and alertness that are partly independent of conscious control, and mediated by dynamic modulatory interactions between limbic and sensorimotor networks. A better understanding of the neuropsychobiological bases of hysterical conversion disorder might therefore be obtained by future imaging studies that compare different conversion symptoms and employ functional connectivity analyses. This should not only lead to improve clinical management of these patients, but also provide new insights on the brain mechanisms of self-awareness.

Methods: Interhemispheric transfer times (IHTT) between the hemispheres were assessed using a lateralized lexical-decision task in males with schizophrenia (N = 12) and matched controls (N = 12). Words were presented to the left visual field (LVF), right visual field (RVF), or bilaterally (BVF) while 128-channel EEG was recorded continuously. A direct measure of IHTT in each direction was obtained by comparing the latencies of the N160 evoked potential (EP) component in the hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to stimulation. Results: Controls showed faster information transfer from the right to left hemisphere (R-to-L) for linguistic stimuli. The two groups did not differ for IHTTs L-to-R. Lack of IHTT asymmetry in the schizophrenia groups was associated with an overall concomitant decrease in the amplitude of the N160 in the right hemisphere. Conclusions: Differences in IHTT asymmetry may be attributed to lack of right hemisphere activation and not callosal dysfunction as has been previously suggested. Significance: It is suggested that a relative excess of myelinated axons in the right hemisphere speeds IHTT faster R-to-L, findings are discussed with reference to differences in fight hemisphere white matter connectivity in schizophrenia.

However, the neural dynamics during the unconscious processing remains largely uncharted. To assess both the complexity and temporal dynamics of unconscious cognition the present study contrasts the evoked response from classes of masked stimuli with three different levels of complexity; words, consonant strings, and blanks. The evoked response to masked word stimuli differed from both consonant strings and blanks, which did not differ from each other. This response was qualitatively different to any evoked potential observed when stimuli were consciously visible and peaked at 140 ms, earlier than is usually associated with differences between words and strings and 100 ms earlier than word-consonant string differences in the visible condition. The evoked response demonstrates a qualitatively distinct signature of unconscious cognition and directly demonstrates the extraction of abstract information under subliminal conditions.

The present electroencephalogram (EEG) study was intended to uncover to the generators of induced gamma band responses (GBRS) and to analyze phase-synchronization between these sources. A standard object recognition task was used to elicit gamma activity. At the scalp surface (electrode space), we found an augmentation of induced GBRs after the presentation of meaningful (familiar) as opposed to meaningless (unfamiliar) stimuli, which was accompanied by a dense pattern of significant phase-locking values between distant recording sites. Subsequently, intracranial current density distributions compatible with the observed scalp voltage topographies were estimated by means of VARETA (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In source space brain electrical tomographies (BETs) revealed widespread generators of induced GBRs at temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. Phase-locking analysis was calculated between re-constructed electrode signals based on separate forward solutions of the observed generators, thereby eliminating the possibly confounding influence of activity from areas not under observation. The results support the view that induced GBRs signify synchronous neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. The localization of the generators of event-related potentials (ERPs), evoked gamma activity, and induced alpha activity revealed different sources as compared to the induced GBR and, thus, seem to mirror complementary functions during the present task as compared to induced high-frequency brain dynamics.

Cortical gamma oscillations have been associated with neural processes supporting conscious perception, but the effect of general anesthesia on these oscillations is controversial. In this study, the authors examined three volatile anesthetics, halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane, and compared their effects on flash-induced gamma oscillations in terms of equivalent concentrations producing the loss of righting reflex (1 minimum alveolar concentration for the loss of righting [MAC(LR)]). Methods: Light flashes were presented every 5 s for 5 min, and event-related potentials were recorded from primary visual cortex of 15 rats with a chronically implanted bipolar electrode at increasing anesthetic concentrations (0-2.4 MAC(LR)). Early cortical response was obtained by averaging poststimulus (0-100 ms) potentials filtered at 20-60 Hz across 60 trials. Late (100-1.000 ms) gamma power was calculated using multitaper power spectral technique. Wavelet decomposition was used to determine spectral and temporal distributions of gamma power. Results: The authors found that (1) halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane enhanced the flash-evoked early cortical response in a concentration-dependent manner; (2) the effective concentration for this enhancement was the lowest for isoflurane, intermediate for halothane, and the highest for desflurane when compared at equal fractions of the concentration that led to a loss of righting; (3) the power of flash-induced late (> 100 ms) gamma oscillations was augmented at intermediate concentrations of all three anesthetic agents; and (4) flash-induced y power was not reduced below waking baseline even in deep anesthesia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a reduction in flash-induced y oscillations in rat visual cortex is not a unitary correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.

It is a familial condition with a complex pattern of inheritance. Variation of several genes involved in the regulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin neurotransmission is associated with ADHD. We highlight the two most prominent findings with the doparnine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene and the doparnine transporter (DAT1) gene, and their implications for the understanding of the cellular and neurobiological basis for ADHD. Cognitive and functional studies using electrophysiology and brain imaging frequently indicate altered processing in ADHD during performance on cognitive tasks hypothesized to measure a "core" deficit, such as response inhibition. Yet, children with ADHD appear to suffer from a more general deficit, including impairment in attentional alerting, orienting, response preparation, and control. Reward processes are also altered and, further, a strong association emerges with intraindividual variability, with several causal hypotheses being proposed. Task performance correlates with underactivation of, especially, frontostriatal areas of the brain, but an extended network of brain regions is also implicated. Electroencephalography studies indicate abnormalities in ADHD in relation to slow-wave activity, linked to underarousal. These advances in the areas of genetics, cognitive function, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy of ADHD give important leads for interdisciplinary research that aims to delineate the causal pathways. Such research is only at its beginning, but is illustrated by recent findings of an association between DAT1 and increased response variability in ADHD.

It is now possible to start to build the foundations of a physiology of language. The remarkable number of neuroimaging studies performed so far illustrates the potential of this approach, which complements the classical knowledge accumulated on aphasia. Here we attempt to characterize the impact of the functional neuroimaging revolution on our understanding of language. Although today considered as neuroimaging techniques, we refer less to electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies than to positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, which deal more directly with the question of localization and functional neuroanatomy. This review is structured in three parts. 1) Because of their rapid evolution, we address technical and methodological issues to provide an overview of current procedures and sketch out future perspectives. 2) We review a set of significant results acquired in normal adults ( the core of functional imaging studies) to provide an overview of language mechanisms in the "standard" brain. Single-word processing is considered in relation to input modalities ( visual and auditory input), output modalities ( speech and written output), and the involvement of "central" semantic processes before sentence processing and nonstandard language ( illiteracy, multilingualism, and sensory deficits) are addressed. 3) We address the influence of plasticity on physiological functions in relation to its main contexts of appearance, i.e., development and brain lesions, to show how functional imaging can allow fine-grained approaches to adaptation, the fundamental property of the brain. In closing, we consider future developments for language research using functional imaging.

J	LaBerge, D				LaBerge, D			Sustained attention and apical dendrite activity in recurrent circuits	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						attention; recurrent circuit; apical dendrite	SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONS IN-VIVO; NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; VISUAL CORTICAL-NEURONS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; HUMAN EEG; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PREPARATORY ATTENTION	Recurrent neural activity is a pervasive mode of cortical operations and is believed to underlie cognitive functions of working memory, attention, and the generation of spontaneous activity during sleep [90]. It is proposed here that activity in corticothalamic recurrent circuits underlies the sustaining of attention, and that extended durations of attention are made possible by the stabilizing effects of electrical activity in long apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Using the cue-target delay task as a framework, the present paper describes sustained attention during the cue-target delay as activity in recurrent circuits involving layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons. At target onset, persistent activity in apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (projected from the recurrent circuits) can enhance the processing of incoming pulse trains at basal dendrites. Apical dendrite activity is assumed to modulate the soma processing of layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons at subthreshold voltage levels. The variability of successive soma depolarizations from the apical dendrite strongly influences the stability of activity in the corticothalamic recurrent circuit. Lower variability promotes higher stability. According to the present model of apical dendrite function, soma depolarizations can be reduced in variability and maintained within subthreshold levels by increasing the distance that EPSPs propagate along the apical dendrite. The close relationship between sustained attention and the electrical field potentials produced by repeated EPSP propagations in apical dendrites is supported in a brief review of sustained attention experiments that have employed measures of EEG, ERS/ERD, ERP, and LFP.

Horizontal or vertical vernier stimuli were presented simultaneously at 8 locations at an eccentricity of 4 degrees. One of the stimuli displayed an offset, and subjects were asked to detect the target offset. Training was performed with either vertical or horizontal stimuli by the repeated presentation of stimuli. Discrimination performance was also measured with the untrained stimuli. Before and after the psychophysical experiment, EEG was recorded from 30 electrodes over the occipital areas (between the inion and Cz) while targets were presented at all locations as vernier onset/offset stimuli. The EEG was averaged for each orientation separately. Improvement in discrimination performance was observed in about 70% of the subjects with the trained orientation only. The evoked potential maps displayed three components occurring between 80 and 160; 180 and 260, and 280 and 340 ms. The potential field topography of the first and third component showed significant differences before and after learning. In addition, field strength (global field power) of the second and third component increased with learning. No effects were seen with the untrained stimuli in the psychophysical and electrophysiological experiments. Our findings suggest that perceptual learning in the peripheral visual field is specifically related to neurophysiological changes induced by training, and it is not caused by unspecific changes of spatial attention. The changes of electrical brain activity reflect short-term plasticity related to human perceptual learning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To study whether temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) affects automatic central auditory-change processing, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to standard and duration-deviant sounds in 12 TLE patients and 12 age-matched controls, and repeated MEG measurement in 8 patients 6-30 months following epilepsy surgery and in 6 controls 3-8 months after their first measurement. We compared the MMNm between patients and controls, and also evaluated intertrial phase coherences as indexed by phase-locking factors (PLF) using wavelet-based analyses. We observed longer MMNm latencies for patients than for controls. Dipole modeling and minimum-current estimates together showed bi-frontotemporal sources for MMNm. The phase locking across trials was dominant at the 4- to 14-Hz band, and the main difference in PLF between deviant- and standard-evoked responses occurred in the time frame of 150-250 ms after stimulus onset. Notably, in the 5 patients who became seizure free after removal of right temporal epileptic focus, the phase-locking phenomena resulting from deviant stimuli were enhanced, and even more distributed in the frontotemporal regions. We conclude that mesial TLE might affect auditory-change detection, and a successful surgery causes a possible plastic change in phase locking of deviant-evoked signals.

J	Hauk, O; Shtyrov, Y; Pulvermuller, F				Hauk, O; Shtyrov, Y; Pulvermuller, F			The sound of actions as reflected by mismatch negativity: rapid activation of cortical sensory-motor networks by sounds associated with finger and tongue movements	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action understanding; cell assemblies; EEG-ERP; mirror neurons; MMN	AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MIRROR NEURONS; MEMORY TRACES; HUMAN BRAIN; LANGUAGE; CORTEX; WORDS; PREMOTOR; MMN	In order to explore the activation dynamics of the human action recognition system, we investigated electrophysiological distinctions between the brain responses to sounds produced by human finger and tongue movements. Of special interest were the questions of how early these differences may occur, and whether the neural activation at the early stages of processing involves cortical motor representations related to the generation of these sounds. For this purpose we employed a high-density EEG set-up and recorded mismatch negativity (MMN) using a recently developed novel multideviant paradigm which allows acquisition of a high number of trials within a given time period. Deviant stimuli were naturally recorded finger and tongue clicks, as well as control stimuli with similar physical features but without the clear action associations (this was tested in a separate behavioural experiment). Both natural stimuli produced larger MMNs than their respective control stimuli at similar to 100 ms, indicating activation of memory traces for familiar action-related sounds. Furthermore, MMN topography at this latency differed between the brain responses to the natural finger and natural tongue sounds. Source estimation revealed the strongest sources for finger sounds in centrolateral areas of the left hemisphere, suggesting that hearing a sound related to finger actions evokes activity in motor areas associated with the dominant hand. Furthermore, tongue sounds produced activation in more inferior brain areas. Our data suggest that motor areas in the human brain are part of neural systems subserving the early automatic recognition of action-related sounds.

The results of the gamma-band current sources revealed that the same gamma-band activities are in process during the rare target and novelty task. In the low (30-55 Hz) gamma-band activity, the common sources were localized in the (inferior) anterior cingulate and adjacent inferior frontal cortex. In the high (65-85 Hz) gamma-band activity, the generator was represented in the superior frontal cortex. On the other hand, the P3a and P3b generators showed widespread distributions including the well-known fronto-parietal network [J. Polich, Theoretical overview of P3a and P3b, in: J. Polish (Ed.), Detection of Change: Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings, Kluwer Academic Press, Boston, 2003, pp. 83-98]. In conclusion, the same frontal generators of gamma-band activities in the present study may be associated with the functions of attentional control for the binding of consecutive cognitive stages corresponding to earlier P3a and later P3b components, which have distinct source distributions except for some overlaps.

The experiment was carried out with 30 male karateka (M age=35 yr., SD=8.7; M years of practice= 6, SD = 3) instructed to perform an action (Ura-Shuto-Uchi) that they had not previously learned. The athletes were divided into three groups: Untrained (10 subjects who did not perform any training), Action Trained (10 subjects who performed Ura-Shuto-Uchi training daily for 16 minutes), and Mental Imagery (10 subjects who performed mental imagery training of Ura-Shuto-Uchi daily for 16 minutes). The subjects were tested five times, once every 7 days. During each test, they performed a series of 60 motor action trials. In Tests 1, 3, and 5, they also performed a series of 60 mental imagery trials. During the trials, an electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), muscle strength and power, and other physiological parameters were recorded. The results differed by group. Untrained subjects did not show significant effects. In the Action Trained group, training had an effect on reactivity and movement speed, with a reduction of EMG activation and reaction times. Moreover, muscle strength, power, and work increased significantly. The Mental Imagery group showed the same effects on muscle strength, power, and work, but changes in reactivity were not observed. In the Mental Imagery group, the study of Movement Related Brain Macropotentials indicated a progressive modification of the profile of the waves from Test 1 to Test 5 during imagery, showing significant variations of the amplitude of the waves related to the premotor and motor execution periods. Results show that motor imagery can influence muscular abilities such as strength and power and can modify Movement Related Brain Macropotentials, the profile of which potentially could be used to verify the effectiveness of motor imagery training.

Intracerebral ERD/ERS in voluntary movement and in cognitive visuomotor task	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review						ERD; ERS; Bereitschaftspotential; fMRI; voluntary movement; executive functions	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; BASAL GANGLIA; READINESS-POTENTIALS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; MEMORY PROCESSES; SLOW POTENTIALS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	In order to study cerebral activity related to preparation and execution of movement, evoked and induced brain electrical activities were compared to each other and to fMRI results in voluntary self-paced movements. Also, the event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) were studied in complex movements with various degrees of cognitive load. The Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) ERD/ERS rhythms in self-paced simple movements were analyzed in 14 epilepsy surgery candidates. In previous studies, the cortical sources of BP were consistently displayed contralateral to the movement in the primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex, and bilateral in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and in the cingulate cortex. There were also small and inconstant BP generators in the ipsilateral sensorimotor, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Alpha and beta ERD/ERS were also observed in these cortical regions. The distribution of contacts showing ERD or ERS was larger than of those showing BP. In contrast to BP, ERD, and ERS frequently occurred in the orbitofrontal, lateral and mesial temporal cortices, and inferior parietal lobule. The spatial location of brain activation for self-paced repetitive movements, i.e., writing simple dots, was studied using event-related functional MRI (fMRI) in 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We observed significant activation in regions known to participate in motor control: contralateral to the movement in the primary sensorimotor and supramarginal cortices, the SMA and the underlying cingulate, and, to a lesser extent, the ipsilateral sensorimotor region. When the fMRI was compared with the map of the brain areas electrically active with self-paced movements (intracerebral recordings; Rektor et al., 1994, 1998, 2001b, c; Rektor, 2003), there was an evident overlap of most results. Nevertheless, the electrophysiological studies were more sensitive in uncovering small active areas, i.e., in the premotor and prefrontal cortices. The BP and the event-related hemodynamic changes were displayed in regions known to participate in motor control. The cortical occurrence of oscillatory activities in the alpha-beta range was clearly more widespread. Four epilepsy surgery candidates with implanted depth brain electrodes performed two visuomotor-cognitive tasks with cued complex movements: a simple task - copying randomly presented letters from the monitor; and a more complex task - writing a letter other than that which appears on the monitor. The second task demanded an increased cognitive load, i.e... of executive functions. Alpha and beta ERD/ERS rhythms were evaluated. Similar results for both tasks were found in the majority of the frontal contacts, i.e., in the SMA, anterior cingulate, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The most frequent observed activity was ERD in the beta rhythm. alpha ERS and ERD were also present. Significant differences between the two tasks appeared in several frontal areas - in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (BA 9 45 11), and in the temporal neocortex (BA 21). In several contacts localized in these areas, namely in the lateral temporal cortex, there were significant changes only with the complex task - mostly beta ERD. Although the fMRI results fit well with the map of the evoked activity (BP), several discrepant localizations were displayed when the BP was compared with the distribution of the oscillatory activity (ERD-ERS). The BP and hemodynamic changes are closely related to th motor control areas; ERD/ERS represent the broader physiological aspects of motor execution and control. The BP probably reflects regional activation, while the more widespread ERD/ERS may reflect the spread of task-relevant information across relevant areas. In the writing tasks, the spatial distribution of the alpha-beta ERD/ERS in the frontal and lateral temporal cortices was partially task dependent. The ERD/ERS occurred there predominantly in the more complex of the writing tasks. Some sites were only active in the task with the increased demand on executive functions. In the temporal neocortex only, the oscillatory, but not the evoked, activity was recorded in the self-paced movement. The temporal appearance of changes of oscillatory activities in the self-paced movement task as well as in the cued movement task with an increased load of executive functions raises the interesting question of the role of this region in cognitive-movement information processing.

A fast fixed-point algorithm for independent component analysis(FastICA), possesses the advantages of simply structure and fast computation. However, in some cases, many signals are not completely independent, the stability of the algorithm won't be as ideal as people have expected. In fact, the reason that system does not converge steadily is the fixed step size in FastICA algorithm, that is, The negentropy J(wn+1TZ) of random vectors no longer monotonic increasing in the iterative process of separated vectors. We define a cost function Delta J=J(w(n+1)(T)Z)-J(w(n)(T)Z) and a time-variant step size mu(t), and put forward a algorithm of adjusting step size by the variety of the cost function in iterative process. Results from a series of simulation and experiments show that, the stability and convergence of algorithm is improved.

Until now, no efficient device can record the entire procedure of intrinsic human behavior information, including acquiring, transmitting, processing and outputting. In this paper, we offer a system which consists of computer and F-tablet, the later can acquire the kinematics and kinetics information of human handwriting. Joined with human beings, a Vision-Brain-Hand to Computer (VBH-C) Interaction system is presented. In this human-in-the-loop-testing system, human beings acquire image, voice or text from computer by eyes or ears then write them down. As a closed-loop feedback portion, the designed F-tablet acquires strokes of pen-up and pen-down, velocity and acceleration of pen-tip, three dimension forces of pen-plate contacting point and shape of character etc. The core part of the system, named as F-Tablet, is introduced which is able to acquire the trajectory and three-axis forces directly and simultaneously of pen-tip. A simple test will be done to judge the movements and forces controlling ability of different ages with the help of the system. Comparing with other brain-computer interface (BCI), VBH-C interface can offer more information, especially as a closed-loop and information feedback, it is easier for human decision pattern identification.

We investigated whether the suppression that is known to occur during the onset of a single movement would persist or otherwise habituate when the movement is continuously repeated for a long period of time. Fourteen subjects took part in the experiments. They performed repetitive simultaneous extension-flexions of the fingers II-V in one hand, continuously for a period of at least 30 s. They then stopped this self-paced movement and rested for at least 30 s. Bipolar recording was made from C3-Cz and C4-Cz. Patterns of amplitude changes in the alpha and beta bands were calculated against a resting baseline. Following a bilateral alpha and beta suppression at the movement onset, alpha amplitude gradually but not fully recovered towards the baseline during the 30 s post-onset. Habituation of afferences and transfer of the cortical function were discussed as the two alternative explanations for this gradual recovery. Beta amplitude, however, displayed no recovery as long as the movement continued. Considering the relatively rapid beta recovery reported for sustained movements, this finding demonstrated that the sustained and continuous movements are conducted through quite different processes. A transient contralateral beta rebound was observed only after the end of the long movement period, strengthening the viewpoint that links the beta rebound with the closure of the cortical processes running throughout a motor sequence. Modulation of the beta amplitude, rather than the changes in alpha amplitude, appeared to be more closely correlated with the execution of a continuous movement. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Neurophysiologic findings in migraine emphasized the presence of abnormal neuronal function during the asymptomatic phase, predisposing to attack occurrence, the main patterns being the loss of habituation of evoked and event related potentials and the hypersynchronization of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. These studies confirmed the need of preventive agents able to act on neuronal excitability, with growing evidence in favor of the clinical efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs (AED), though electrophysiological evidence supporting migraine as a state of neuronal hypoexcitability rendered the rationale of their use and their fundamental action mechanism in preventing migraine rather questionable. In the last years, many studies reported the efficacy of other preventive agents than AED, such as -blockers, in reversing neurophysiologic abnormalities of migraine, while reducing headache frequency. Our recent results showed a normalizing effects of levetiracetam and topiramate vs. placebo on the dishabituation pattern of the contingent negative variation (CNV) and the efficacy of levetiracetam vs. both topiramate and placebo in reversing the hypersynchronization of alpha rhythm under flash stimulation. All these effects concurred with the clinical efficacy on migraine frequency, and confirmed the action of AED on the basal mechanisms of migraine. Considering our and previous results, migraine may be considered as a state of "altered" excitability, where the AED are modulating agents able to reverse the electrophysiological patterns predisposing to the attack occurrence. The challenge for the future may be the identification of subgroups of migraine patients with pronounced expression of some neurophysiologic indexes of migraine predisposition, e.g., hypersynchronization, which may optimize the choice of the preventive agent.

Electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping: A clinical technique for mapping the motor cortex	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						brain mapping; electrocorticography; motor cortex	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CURSOR CONTROL; EEG; LOCALIZATION; PATTERNS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR	OBJECTIVE: Electrocortical stimulation (ECS) has been well established for delineating the eloquent cortex. However, ECS is still coarse and inefficient in delineating regions of the functional cortex and can be hampered by after-discharges. Given these constraints, an adjunct approach to defining the motor cortex is the use of electrocorticographic signal changes associated with active regions of the cortex. The broad range of frequency oscillations are categorized into two main groups with respect to the sensorimotor cortex: low and high frequency bands. The low frequency bands tend to show a power reduction with cortical activation, whereas the high frequency bands show power increases. These power changes associated with the activated cortex could potentially provide a powerful tool in delineating areas of the motor cortex. We explore electrocorticographic signal alterations as they occur with activated regions of the motor cortex, as well as its potential in clinical brain mapping applications. METHODS: We evaluated seven patients who underwent invasive monitoring for seizure localization. Each patient had extraciperative ECS mapping to identify the motor cortex. All patients also performed overt hand and tongue motor tasks to identify associated frequency power changes in regard to location and degree of concordance with ECS results that localized either hand or tongue motor function. RESULTS: The low frequency bands had a high sensitivity (88.9-100%) and a lower specificity (79.0-82.6%) for identifying electrodes with either hand or tongue ECS motor responses. The high frequency bands had a lower sensitivity (72.7-88.9%) and a higher specificity (92.4-94.9%) in correlation with the same respective ECS positive electrodes. CONCLUSION: The concordance between stimulation and spectral power changes demonstrate the possible utility of electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping as an adjunct method to improve the efficiency and resolution of identifying the motor cortex.

We analyzed event-related oscillations in young, healthy subjects (N=26) by using three types of stimulation: (1) a simple light signal, (2) the picture of the face of an anonymous elderly lady and (3) the picture of the subjects' own grandmother. We found a number of significant peak to peak amplitude measures in all frequency bands in the time period of 0-500 ms, allowing a differentiation between perception of the subjects' own grandmother, the unknown elderly face and the light stimulation. The results showed increased event-related oscillatory responses elicited by the unknown face compared to the known grandmother a) in the theta responses (4-8 Hz) at T-6 (46%), b) in the gamma (28-48 Hz) responses at C-z (22%) and C-3 (38%) and c) in the beta responses at F-4 (46%), C-z (47%) and P-3 (105%). In contrast, the subjects' own grandmother elicited 20% increased fast theta (6-8 Hz) oscillations at F-4 compared to the unknown face. Delta responses dissociated face from simple light processing, as reflected in the observation of approx. 50% higher amplitudes at the occipital compared to the frontal locations during face perception. We conclude that the described multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ms. Furthermore, the results are in conceptual accordance with the "selectively distributed processing" hypothesis. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The electroencephalographic Narcotrend Index (NI) is a measure of the hypnotic component of general anaesthesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Narcotrend guidance on propofol consumption and emergence times in children receiving total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. Methods: Thirty children, aged 1-11 yr, scheduled for paediatric urological surgery were enrolled. Remifentanil was given to all patients at a constant infusion rate of 0.3 jig kg- I min- I throughout anaesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive a continuous propofol infusion adjusted either according to a conventional clinical practice (Group C: n = 15) or guided by Narcotrend monitoring (Group NI: n = 15; target NI 60 +/- 5). All patients were connected to the Narcotrend Monitor, but in Group C the anaesthetist was blinded to the screen of the monitor. Propofol consumption (mg kg(-1)h(-1)) and emergence times (min) were the primary and secondary outcome measures. Results: Propofol consumption (median [inter-quartile range]) was significantly lower in Group NI compared to Group C (NI: 7.0[6.4-8.2] vs. G 9.3 [8.3-11.0] mg kg(-1)h(-1); P < 0.001), whereas Log-Rank-analysis revealed no intergroup difference in emergence times (Group NI: mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] 12.8 [11.2-14.4] min; Group C: 16.4 [12.6-20.2] min; P = 0.10). Haemodynamic variables remained stable within age-related limits, and there were no observations of adverse events, especially no clinical signs of intraoperative awareness in any patient. Conclusion: Narcotrend monitoring for guidance of propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia in children results in reduced propofol consumption compared to a conventional clinical practice.

The present investigation was aimed to clarify whether, during a Simon task, hemispheric asymmetry is also observed in the early phases of stimulus processing. In a group of healthy subjects performing the Simon task, we analyzed scalp potentials evoked by the first lateralized cue (left or right), instead of the classical readiness potential preceding the motor response. ERP results showed a significant left cortical activation to stimuli presented in the right visual field at the 140-160 ms time window. Instead, left stimuli elicited a significant activation of the right versus left hemisphere starting at the next 160-180 ms time interval. We linked this asymmetry to that observed in behavioral data: the Simon effect recorded with left stimuli is smaller than the Simon effect recorded with right stimuli. Results confirm the hypothesis that in right handed subjects, left hemisphere is specialized for motor response selection and is able to process right stimuli faster than the right hemisphere does for left stimuli.

Advances in the ensuing 28 years warranted a re-look at visual scoring of sleep stages. This paper describes the work of the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R&K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of EEG, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin EMG were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of REM sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of REM sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules. Future advances in technology may require modification of these rules with time.

Birth and hatching: Key events in the onset of awareness in the lamb and chick	NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Review						behaviour; electroencephalogram; developmental neurobiology; embryo; fetus; neuroactivators; neurosuppressors; onset of awareness; unconsciousness	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GABA BINDING-SITES; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ADENOSINE A(1); CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPONSES; RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS; BEHAVIORAL AROUSAL; STEROID-HORMONES; SLEEP STATE	The neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the embryo and fetus and unique features of the physiological environment of the fetal brain, features which are lost at birth, support recent conclusions that under normal circumstances awareness ( or consciousness) is probably not exhibited by the ovine embryo-fetus before birth and that it appears for the first time only after birth. However, there has apparently been no evaluation of whether or not similar mechanisms modulate awareness-related functions in domestic chicks before and after hatching. This comparative review, in seeking to rectify this, arrived at the following conclusions. First, the neural apparatus of both lambs and chicks appears to be too immature to support any states resembling awareness during at least the first half of pregnancy or incubation. Second, electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity, which evolves subsequently, shows that states of sleep-like unconsciousness are likely to be continuously present in lambs until after birth, and that such states at least predominate in chicks until after hatching. Third, as in fetal lambs, epochs of so-called `wakefulness' previously reported in chick embryos do not seem likely to represent short periods of awareness in ovo. Fourth, several neurosuppressive mechanisms, with some unique features, also operate or have the potential to operate in chicks before hatching, but a dearth of published information currently hinders a full comparison with those demonstrated to operate in fetal lambs. Fifth, contradicting the intuitive perception that vocalisation pre-hatching by the chick indicates the presence of awareness, published evidence suggests that vocalisation before and during hatching occurs mostly during EEG states indicating sleep-like unconsciousness. Sixth, as seems to be the case for newborn lambs after birth, it is possible that demonstrable awareness may appear for the first time only after hatching in chicks, presumably through waning neurosuppression and burgeoning neuroactivation, but such awareness seems to take longer to manifest itself. However, additional research in chicks is recommended to further assess this suggestion. Particular attention should be given to the status of vocal interactions between hen and chick which begin several days before hatching, and to the operation of neurosuppressive and neuroactivating mechanisms throughout the last 40% of incubation and during and after hatching.

Evoked brain responses are generated by feedback loops	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						connectivity; dynamic causal modeling; EEG; predictive coding; top-down	CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; NEURONAL CIRCUITS; VISUAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN; PERCEPTION; ERP; NEOCORTEX; MODEL	Neuronal responses to stimuli, measured electrophysiologically, unfold over several hundred milliseconds. Typically, they show characteristic waveforms with early and late components. It is thought that early or exogenous components reflect a perturbation of neuronal dynamics by sensory input bottom-up processing. Conversely, later, endogenous components have been ascribed to recurrent dynamics among hierarchically disposed cortical processing levels, top-down effects. Here, we show that evoked brain responses are generated by recurrent dynamics in cortical networks, and late components of event-related responses are mediated by backward connections. This evidence is furnished by dynamic causal modeling of mismatch responses, elicited in an oddball paradigm. We used the evidence for models with and without backward connections to assess their likelihood as a function of peristimulus time and show that backward connections are necessary to explain late components. Furthermore, we were able to quantify the contribution of backward connections to evoked responses and to source activity, again as a function of peristimulus time. These results link a generic feature of brain responses to changes in the sensorium and a key architectural component of functional anatomy; namely, backward connections are necessary for recurrent interactions among levels of cortical hierarchies. This is the theoretical cornerstone of most modern theories of perceptual inference and learning.

Although face and other object expertise effects are typically bilateral or right-lateralized, the spatial topography of reading-related N170 effects are often left-lateralized, providing potential insights into the unique aspects of reading-related perceptual expertise. Methods: Extending previous research in German [1], we use a high-density channel array to characterize the N170 topography for reading-related perceptual expertise in English, a language with inconsistent spelling-to-sound mapping. N170 effects related to overall reading-related expertise are defined by contrasting responses to visual words versus novel symbol strings. By contrasting each of these conditions to pseudowords, we examined how this reading-related N170 effect generalizes to well-ordered novel letter strings. Results: A sample-by-sample permutation test computed on word versus symbol ERP topographies revealed differences during two time windows corresponding to the N170 and P300 components. Topographic centroid analysis of the word and symbol N170 demonstrated significant differences in both left-right as well as inferior-superior dimensions. Words elicited larger N170 negativities than symbols at inferior occipito-temporal channels, with the maximal effect over left inferior regions often unsampled in conventional electrode montages. Further contrasts produced inferior-superior topographic effects for the pseudoword-symbol comparison and left-lateralized topographic effects for the word-pseudoword comparison. Conclusion: Fast specialized perception related to reading experience produces an N170 modulation detectable across different EEG systems and different languages. Characterization of such effects may be improved by sampling with greater spatial frequency recordings that sample inferior regions. Unlike in German, reading-related expertise effects in English produced only partial generalization in N170 responses to novel pseudowords. The topographic inferior-superior N170 differences may reflect general perceptual expertise for orthographic strings, as it was found for words and pseudowords across both languages. The topographic left-right N170 difference between words and pseudowords was only found in English, and may suggest that ambiguity in pronunciating novel pseudowords due to inconsistency in spelling-to-sound mapping influences early stages of letter string processing.

Effects of native language and training on lexical tone perception: An event-related potential study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						lexical tone; second language learning; perceptual training; mismatch negativity; late negativity; neural plasticity	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; CROSS-LINGUISTIC PET; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MANDARIN TONES; HUMAN BRAIN; THAI TONES; DISCRIMINATION; SPEECH; PLASTICITY; CHINESE	Tone languages such as Thai use pitch differences to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have reported that naive listeners can discriminate among lexical tones, but that native language background affects performance. The present study uses ERPs to determine whether native speakers of a tone language (Mandarin Chinese) and of a nontone language (English) differ in their pre-attentive discrimination among Thai lexical tones, and whether training has a different effect in these two language groups. EEGs were obtained from 10 native Mandarin Chinese speakers, 10 English and 10 Thai speakers in an oddball paradigm: The Thai syllable [k(h)a:] pronounced with a high rising or low falling tone, was presented as an infrequent deviant amidst a standard mid level tone [k(h)a] syllable, while participants watched a silent movie. Next, the Chinese and English participants completed a 2-day perceptual identification training on the mid level and low falling tones, and returned for a post training EEG. The low falling tone deviant elicited a Mismatch Negativity (MMN) in all participant groups before and after training; the high rising deviant elicited no, or a smaller, MMN, which became larger after training only in the English group. The high rising deviant also elicited a later negativity (350-650 ms) versus the mid level standard, which decreased after training in the Chinese group. These results suggest that non-Thai speakers can pre-attentively discriminate among Thai tones, but are sensitive to different physical properties of the tones, depending on their native language. English speakers are more sensitive to early pitch differences, whereas native speakers of Mandarin Chinese are more sensitive to the (later) pitch contour. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We recorded event-related potentials ( ERPs) to words in standard or mirror orientation to investigate the role of visual word form in reading. Word inversion was performed to determine whether rotated words lose their linguistic properties. Methods: About 1300 Italian words and legal pseudo-words were presented to 18 right-handed Italian students engaged in a letter detection task. EEG was recorded from 128 scalp sites. Results: ERPs showed an early effect of word orientation at similar to 150 ms, with larger NI amplitudes to rotated than to standard words. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed an increase in NI to rotated words primarily in the right occipital lobe ( BA 18), which may indicate an effect of stimulus familiarity. NI was greater to target than to non-target letters at left lateral occipital sites, thus reflecting the first stage of orthographic processing. LORETA revealed a strong focus of activation for this effect in the left fusiform gyrus ( BA 37), which is consistent with the so-called visual word form area ( VWFA). Standard words ( compared to pseudowords) elicited an enhancement of left occipito/temporal negativity at about 250-350 ms, followed by a larger anterior P3, a reduced frontal N400 and a huge late positivity. Lexical effects for rotated strings were delayed by about 100 ms at occipito/temporal sites, and were totally absent at later processing stages. This suggests the presence of implicit reading processes, which were pre-attentive and of perceptual nature for mirror strings. Conclusion: The contrast between inverted and standard words did not lead to the identification of a purely linguistic brain region. This finding suggests some caveats in the interpretation of the inversion effect in subtractive paradigms.

We studied the auditory steady-state response (SSR) which represents the net effect of entrained background activity and superimposed cortical evoked responses, in AD patients and healthy controls. Methods: Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to measure SSR to monaural 40-Hz stimulation in AD patients and age-matched controls. Equivalent current dipoles (ECD) of the SSR were modeled in each hemisphere, and source amplitudes were compared between the two groups using time-varying ECD models. Results: Our results indicate that the SSR is significantly increased in AD patients with mild to moderate cognitive deterioration in comparison with healthy elderly subjects. Conclusions: Goal-directed functioning requires optimization of inhibitory and excitatory inputs in the cortex, allowing the adaptation of responsiveness to repetitive stimulation with low relevance. The present results suggest that this balance is impaired in AD, manifesting itself in decreased inhibition in cortical auditory processing and impaired adaptation of the stimulus-locked activity, probably due to abnormalities in cholinergic modulation. Significance: MEG appears to be a sensitive tool to detect abnormalities of auditory processing already in early stages of AD. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Oscillatory beta activity predicts response speed during a multisensory audiovisual reaction time task: A high-density electrical mapping study	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cross-modal; EEG; ERP; motor system; sensory integration	SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAMMA-RESPONSES; BISENSORY STIMULATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; DIVIDED ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; FREQUENCY; CORTEX	Bisensory redundant targets are processed faster than the respective unisensory target stimuli alone as evidenced by substantially faster reaction times (RTs). This multisensory RT facilitation has been interpreted as an expression of integrative processing between the different sensory modalities. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the RT facilitation effect are not well understood. Oscillatory responses in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) have been related to sensory-motor processing. Here, we investigated whether modulation of beta responses might also underlie the faster RTs seen for multisensory stimuli. Using high-density electrical mapping, we explored the association between early (50-170 ms) multisensory processing in the evoked beta response and RTs recorded during a simple RT task. Subjects were instructed to indicate the appearance of any stimulus in a stream of auditory-alone (A), visual-alone (V), and multisensory (AV) stimuli by a button press. Beta responses were analyzed using Morlet wavelet transformations. Multisensory interactions were found over frontal, occipital, central, and sensory-motor regions. Critically, beta activity correlated with mean RTs over all stimulus types. Significant negative correlations were found for frontal, occipital, and sensory-motor scalp regions. We conclude that the association between oscillatory beta activity and integrative multisensory processing is directly linked to multisensory RT facilitation effects.

The effect of reference choices on the spatio-temporal analysis of brain evoked potentials: The use of infinite reference	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						infinite reference; contralateral and ipsilateral mastoid; average; Cz reference; amplitude; SEP	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; REFERENCE ELECTRODE; AVERAGE REFERENCE; HEAD MODEL; COHERENCE	Reference is a very virtual issue in EEG and ERP. Understanding the difference of various references will make the applications more confident. In this work, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) with stimulation on the right hand was studied. The SEP spatio-temporal analysis was conducted comparatively on six references, left mastoid (contralateral mastoid reference, CM), right mastoid (ipsilateral mastoid reference, IM), linked mastoids (LM), average reference (AR), vertex reference (Cz) and the infinity reference (IR) newly proposed in 2001. Among the six, CM is the one used in actual recordings, and the other five are obtained by off-line re-referencing. The comparison is conducted on four selected components (P30 ms, P40 ms, N90 ms and P230 ms) in both temporal and spatial aspects. The results show that references may have a distinct influence on the amplitudes of the scalp potentials, with relative error at some electrodes larger than 500%, and for some electrodes it may even change the polarity. Pair-wise multiple comparison (Tukey test) shows that the differences of peak values among various references are very significant (P < 0.001) between Cz and IR\CM\IM\LM, and significant (P < 0.01) between Cz and AR for component N90 ms; very significant (P < 0.001) between Cz and IR\CM\IM\LM\AR, significant between IM\LM and AR (P < 0.01), CM and AR (P < 0.05) for component P230 ms. The amplitude value order is CM/IM >= LM > IR > AR > Cz. The two-ways (the six references vs. the four Peaks) repeated measures ANOVA test shows the effect of different references depends on various components; there is a statistically significant interaction between reference and the peak (P = < 0.001). While for the spatial map of the potential amplitude, references will not affect the amplitude map shape if the color-bar is selected automatically, but if a fixed color-bar is chosen for data of various references, they may show some differences. These results mean a common reference is important for producing a comparable result between labs. As IR is theoretically a constant reference, we recommend it as the common choice in the future.

Theta responses of 22 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (11 non-treated, 11 treated by cholinesterase inhibitors), and 20 healthy elderly controls were analyzed by using the conventional visual oddball paradigm. We aimed to compare theta responses of the three groups in a range between 4-7 Hz at the frontal electrodes. At F-3 location, theta responses of healthy subjects were phase locked to stimulation and theta oscillatory responses of non-treated Alzheimer patients showed weaker phase-locking, i.e. average of Z-transformed means of correlation coefficients between single trials was closer to zero. In treated AD patients, phase-locking following target stimulation was two times higher in comparison to the responses of non-treated patients. The results indicate that the phase-locking of theta oscillations at F-3 in the treated patients is as strong as the control subjects. The F-4 theta responses were not statistically significant between the groups. Our findings imply that the theta responses at F3 location are highly unstable in comparison to F4 in non-treated mild AD patients and cholinergic agents may modulate event-related theta oscillatory activities in the frontal regions.

Twelve OCD patients and 13 healthy control subjects performed a word/nonword discrimination task, in which the words and nonwords were visually presented, and some of the words appeared twice with a lag of one or five items. During the 200-500 ms post-stimulus period, the control group showed more positivity in the ERPs elicited by old words than in those elicited by new words, whereas the OCD patients did not. Furthermore, the OCD patients showed prolonged response times to the old words, as compared to the controls. We calculated the location and the power of the ECD sources at approximately 400 ms post-stimulus with the peak mean global field potentials. In both groups, the sources of word repetition effects were determined to be located in the inferior frontal gyrus. The right ECD powers of the ERP generators elicited by the new words were significantly higher in the OCD patients than in the control subjects. The OCD patients also exhibited significant alterations in the hemispheric asymmetry of ECD power during the processing of new words. These results suggest that OCD patients suffer from the encoding deficits in word processing, particularly in the left hemisphere.

Methods: Two groups of subjects, young (mean age 22.5 years) and older (mean age 58.3 years) were studied with a four-choice reaction time task. Response-related potentials (RRPs) to correct and error responses were decomposed by means of wavelet transform. Time-frequency (TF) components of correct and error responses were identified. Effects of aging were evaluated for the phase-locked TF power at FCz. Results: (1) Error-related potentials in both groups were characterized by phase-locked activity from the delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) frequency band that was error-specific and was significantly enhanced for errors. (2) In contrast to young adults, no pronounced phase-locked theta (4-7 Hz) RRP components were generated at FCz for either correct or error responses, nor did the theta power manifest any sensitivity to error processing in older subjects. Conclusion: In older subjects, RRPs at FCz do not contain a theta TF component, thus, demonstrating that the frequency content of error-related potentials changes with aging. A common error-specific delta component is present in the two age groups, but its reactivity is significantly reduced and delayed with aging. These qualitative and quantitative differences between young and older subjects may reflect a functional suppression of the underlying frontomedial structures involved in performance and movement monitoring.

To understand how bimanual learning may aid recovery post-stroke, the present study used EEG to investigate cortical adaptations associated with short-term bimanual training and the behavioral modulations that transfer to unimanual movement in healthy individuals. Movement-related potentials (MRP) and reaction times (RT) were recorded from 10 healthy subjects during blocks of unimanual visuomotor trials before and after a bimanual training task. We hypothesized that short-term bimanual practice would induce adaptive cortical changes evident in the MRPs to movements involving a single hand. Post-training results showed that: (1) the late MRP amplitude did not change, (2) RT significantly decreased, and (3) there was a trend for the early MRP amplitude to increase. There was a strong relationship between modulation of early MRP amplitude and RT in the unimanual movement blocks before and after training. Specifically, a subgroup showed a significant decrease in RT in conjunction with a significant increase in the early MRP amplitude. Lastly, comparing later to earlier trials within the bimanual training block, task accuracy and early MRP amplitude significantly increased and (2) a positive re-afferent potential significantly decreased. Results suggest that short-term bimanual training is associated with possible transfer effects to a unimanual task reflected in changes of MRP components and RT. Furthermore, results from the bimanual training trial itself indicate that short-term bimanual training can change the level of motor preparation and sensory feedback in all subjects.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether inter-individual differences in VEP morphology might affect the nature and polarity of amplitude changes via selective visual attention. EEG was recorded in 20 right-handed individuals while they viewed drawings of familiar objects presented slightly lateralized and performed a categorization task. It consisted in paying attention and responding to a conjunction of space and object features. On the basis of VEP morphology, and independently of task factors, subjects were subdivided in two groups: one group exhibited a prominent N80 and the other a prominent P80 in the same latency range from the same electrode sites. RTs to targets were identical in the two groups, suggesting that morphology was independent of task-related factors. VEP morphology affected the direction and amplitude of spatial and non-spatial attention effects. While attention effects always resulted in increased positivity for the P80 group (at both the C1 and P1 levels), shape relevance was associated with enhanced N80 and P1 responses in the N80 group. These data provide evidence for an inversion of attention effects, in addition to inversion of C1 polarity, in people exhibiting negative C1 at mesial occipital sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The relation between electrophysiological reflections of attentional orienting, sensory gain control, and speed of responding	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						attention; deployment; electrophysiology; response latency; N2pc	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ERP; AUDITION; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; VISION	Selective visual attention is thought to facilitate goal-directed behavior by biasing the system in advance to favor certain stimuli over others, resulting in their selective processing. The aim of the present study was to gain more insight into the link between control processes that induce a spatial attention bias, target selection processes and speed of responding. To this end, participants performed a spatial cueing task while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. In this task, cues either validly or invalidly predicted the location (left or right) of a forthcoming imperative stimulus or provided no information regarding its location. Cues directing attention in space elicited greater positivity over fronto-central and contralateral posterior scalp regions than non-informative cues starting around 320 ms post cue. Targets appearing at attended vs. unattended locations evoked larger P1 and N1 components, indicating enhanced perceptual processing. Interestingly, detection of targets was fastest in trials with most cue-evoked posterior positivity and in trials with largest target-evoked N1 amplitude. Importantly, the greater the difference in cue-evoked posterior positivity between fast and slow trials, the greater the difference in target-evoked N1 amplitude between fast and slow trials was. Together these findings support neurobiological models of attention that postulate that preparatory attention to a particular location in space can bias the system in advance to favor stimuli presented at the attended location, resulting in a modulation of perceptual processing of incoming stimuli and facilitated goal-directed behavior.

Sensory gating of auditory evoked and induced gamma band activity in intracranial recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						gamma band activity; sensory gating; auditory evoked potentials; ERP; electrocorticography	OBJECT REPRESENTATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-STIMULI; HUMANS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; POTENTIALS	Oscillatory activity in the gamma band range (30-50 Hz) and its functional relation to auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) is yet poorly understood. In the current study, we capitalized on the advantage of intracranial recordings and studied gamma band activity (GBA) in an auditory sensory gating experiment. Recordings were obtained from the lateral surface of the temporal lobe in 34 epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Two kinds of activity were differentiated: evoked (phase locked) and induced (not phase locked) GBA. In 18 patients, an intracranial P50 was observed. At electrodes with maximal P50, evoked GBA occurred with a similar peak latency as the P50. However, the intensities of P50 and evoked GBA were only modestly correlated, suggesting that the intracranial P50 does not represent a subset of evoked GBA. The peak frequency of the intracranial evoked GBA was on average relatively low (similar to 25 Hz) and is, therefore, probably not equivalent to extracranially recorded GBA which has normally a peak frequency of similar to 40 Hz. Induced GBA was detected in 10 subjects, nearly exclusively in the region of the superior temporal lobe. The induced GBA was increased after stimulation for several hundred milliseconds and encompassed frequencies up to 200 Hz. Single-trial analysis revealed that induced GBA occurred in relatively short bursts (mostly << 100 ms), indicating that the duration of the induced GBA in the averages originates from summation effects. Both types of gamma band activity showed a clear attenuation with stimulus repetition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Gonzalez-Hernandez, JA; Pita-Alcorta, C; Cedeno, IR				Gonzalez-Hernandez, JA; Pita-Alcorta, C; Cedeno, IR			From genes to brain oscillations: Is the visual pathway the epigenetic clue to schizophrenia?	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							CARD SORTING TEST; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; EEG; TASK; DYSFUNCTION; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCIES; ATTENTION	Molecular data and gene expression data and recently mitochondrial genes and possible epigenetic regulation by non-coding genes is revolutionizing our views on schizophrenia. Genes and epigenetic mechanisms are triggered by cell-cell interaction and by external stimuli. A number of recent clinical and molecular observations indicate that epigenetic factors may be operational in the origin of the illness. Based on the molecular insights, gene expression profiles and epigenetic regulation of gene, we went back to the neurophysiology (brain oscillations) and found a putative role of the visual experiences (i.e. visual stimuli) as epigenetic factor. The functional evidences provided here, establish a direct link between the striate and extrastriate unimodal visual cortex and the neurobiology of the schizophrenia. This result support the hypothesis that 'visual experience' has a potential role as epigenetic factor and contribute to trigger and/or to maintain the progression of the schizophrenia. In this case, candidate genes sensible for the visual 'insult' may be located within the visual cortex including associative areas, while the integrity of the visual pathway before reaching the primary visual cortex is preserved. The same effect can be perceived if target genes are localised within the visual pathway, which actually, is more sensitive for 'insult' during the early life than the cortex per se. If this process affects gene expression at these sites a stably sensory specific 'insult', i.e. distorted visual information, is entering the visual system and expanded to fronto-temporoparietal multimodal areas even from early maturation periods. The difference in the timing of postnatal neuroanatomical events between such areas and the primary visual cortex in humans (with the formers reaching the same development landmarks later in life than the latter) is 'optimal' to establish an abnormal 'cell-communication' mediated by the visual system that may further interfere with the local physiology. In this context the strategy to search target genes need to be rearrangement and redirected to visual-related genes. Otherwise, psychophysics studies combining functional neuroimage, and electrophysiology are strongly recommended, for the search of epigenetic clues that will allow to carrier gene association studies in schizophrenia.

SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						semantic memory; lexical decision; event-related potentials	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY; WORDS	Introduction: An insight into the meaning of words is one of the central processes of semantic memory. To evaluate the access to the cognitive representation of the meaning of words, in the present study we used the lexical decision paradigm developed by Marcos. In this situation, the subject has to recognize if the presented stimulus corresponds to a word or a pseudo-word with the purpose of budding a model of normal processing. Once such a model of normal processing is obtained, the findings can be contrasted with pathologies in which semantic memory is altered. Method: The sample consisted of 32 healthy subjects (7 men, 25 women), right-handed and with no personal or familial history of neurological or psychiatric conditions. The average age of the subjects was 34.4 (+/- 9.56) years and they had an average educational level of 16.2 (+/- 4.4) years. The lexical decision paradigm employed in this study is constituted by 408 stimuli, 240 words and 168 pseudo-words. The criteria for word selection were: frequency, length, grammatical category and morphology Electroencephalogram (EEG) monopolar recording was obtained from 19 derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Fz, Cz and Pz), as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) for the word and pseudo-word sub-states. Results: In the first place, a chi-squared analysis was performed to establish whether significative differences existed between the rates of correct and incorrect answers for both sub-states. The value of chi-squared was 65.7 (gl = 1) and significant for p < 0.0001. A correlation value of 0.43 (p < 0.02) was found when the educational level and the percentage of correct answers in the sub-sate word were compared. On the other hand, for the pseudo-word sub-state, the value 0.24 was encountered for the same correlation, being statistically non-significant. Pearson's correlation coefficient was also calculated for the educational level variable compared to the mistakes committed when subjects were presented with frequent and infrequent words. In the case of infrequent words, a value of r = - 0.43 (p < 0.02) was obtained when the educational level and the number of mistakes were correlated. No correlation was found when the educational level and the number of mistakes commited for frequent words were compared (r = - 0.06). A multivariate variance analysis for repeated measures was performed to determine significant differences between the reaction times when recognizing words or pseudo-words. The outcome showed that all effects were significant in the following cases: reaction times for words and pseudo-words, notwithstanding whether they were correct or incorrect; comparison between correct and incorrect answers, independently of their being words or pseudo-words, as well as the interactions between both effects. To determine differences between average ERPs for both substates, Student's T-test was applied with Bonferroni's correction and p < 0.0002 as the significance level. Significant differences were encountered between the two sub-states, independently of the age or gender. In the 375-495 ms latency interval, a negative component was appreciated in the pseudo-words case, showing significant differences (p < 0.0002) in the following derivations: F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02, T3, T5, T6, Fz, Cz and Pz. Amplitude differences between the two sub-states were more evident in Pz and P3 derivations followed by Cz. In addition, a positive component in the 700-795 ms latency interval was detected (mainly in 795 ms) when pseudo-words were presented. Here, the significant differences (p < 0.0002) were manifest in the following derivations: F3, C3, P3, F7, T3, T5 and Pz. Amplitude differences between the two sub-states were mainly patent in Pz and P3 followed by C3. Discussion: When analyzing behavioral aspects, subjects made more mistakes when presented with words. However, individuals with less education were the ones committing more mistakes. From this we can infer that this variable may be associated with the range of lexical repertoire. A relation was encountered between educational level and word recognition. With regard to reaction times, significant differences were detected between both sub-states, since the recognition of both words and correct answers was achieved in shorter reaction times. Average reaction times for words and pseudo-words were 819.73 ms and 999.35 ms, respectively. Similarly, the latest potential component appeared in an interval of significant differences between 600 and 940 ms, though with a significance p < 0.0005 between 690 and 805 ms. This means that positiveness occurred much sooner than the response, implying that the activity underlying ERPs is related to a cognitive processing of information due to the paradigm used. The analysis of ERPs primary components for both sub-states shows that significant differences arise until 270 ms. The negative component in this study was present between 270 and 580 ms, rendering it similar to N400 given its latency (around 400 ms). Although well-defined in centro-parietal regions, its distribution was generalized, which corresponds to the results of studies using the semantic incongruence paradigm. According to the data from previous research on ERPs, N400 has been associated with the integration process. If this were the case, this association would be equivalent to the semantic incongruence within a lexical integration process described in conventional literature as a "semantic facilitator", only that this time it would be limited to the process of access to the lexicon, which can be interpreted as a discrimination of the answer by assigning a meaning to a word, that is, to process information in the semantic module. This negative component, may be related to the generalized response to brain activity when given a meaningless stimulus, i.e., a pseudo-word. Similarly, the wave amplitude may be related to the amount of activation necessary to gain access to the semantic representation of the stimulus in the memory. With regard to the positive component in this study, it is present between 600 and 940 ms and is interpreted as a late P300 (P3b), which has a latency in the 500-1400 ms interval. It is distributed over the centro-parietal region, making it a liable participant in the task categorization process, in which it is necessary to discriminate between the target from the non-target stimulus, and also reflects focalized attentional processes (voluntary) involved in the execution of the task. From the former, it is believed that this component may be related to attentional resources necessary to process the presentation of pseudo-words. Research dealing with the P600 component locate it within the context of statements and associate it with an anomaly in statement syntax. Therefore, even though the positive component lies within the P600 latency domain, this particular component was not considered as being present in this study, because a syntax incongruence paradigm was not used. Finally, the contribution of the present study lies in the finding of N400 and "P600" components, which have been reported when the "semantic facilitator" and the syntax incongruence paradigm were respectively used, but had not been observed when a lexical decision paradigm based on word recognition per se was utilized. Similarly, given that our results stem from a sample of healthy subjects, a comparison can be made with a patient population with semantic memory alterations.

Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding how activity in diverse brain regions creates and modulates the experience of acute and chronic pain states, emphasizing the contribution of various imaging techniques to emerging concepts. Data Sources: MEDLINE and PRE-MEDLINE searches were performed to identify all English-language articles that examine human brain activity during pain, using hemodynamic (PET, fMRI), neuroelectrical (EEG, MEG) and neurochemical methods (MRS, receptor binding and neurotransmitter modulation), from January 1, 1988 to March 1, 2003. Additional studies were identified through bibliographies. Study Selection: Studies were selected based on consensus across all four authors. The criteria included well-designed experimental procedures, as well as landmark studies that have significantly advanced the field. Data Synthesis: Sixty-eight hemodynamic studies of experimental pain in normal subjects, 30 in clinical pain conditions, and 30 using neuroelectrical methods met selection criteria and were used in a meta-analysis. Another 24 articles were identified where brain neurochemistry of pain was examined. Technical issues that may explain differences between studies across laboratories are expounded. The evidence for and the respective incidences of brain areas constituting the brain network for acute pain are presented. The main components of this network are: primary and secondary somatosensory, insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices (S1, S2, IC, ACC, PFC) and thalamus (Th). Evidence for somatotopic organization, based on 10 studies, and psychological modulation, based on 20 studies, is discussed, as well as the temporal sequence of the afferent volley to the cortex, based on neuroelectrical studies. A meta-analysis highlights important methodological differences in identifying the brain network underlying acute pain perception. It also shows that the brain network for acute pain perception in normal subjects is at least partially distinct from that seen in chronic clinical pain conditions and that chronic pain engages brain regions critical for cognitive/emotional assessments, implying that this component of pain may be a distinctive feature between chronic and acute pain. The neurochemical studies highlight the role of opiate and catecholamine transmitters and receptors in pain states, and in the modulation of pain with environmental and genetic influences. Conclusions: The nociceptive system is now recognized as a sensory system in its own right, from primary afferents to multiple brain areas. Pain experience is strongly modulated by interactions of ascending and descending pathways. Understanding these modulatory mechanisms in health and in disease is critical for developing fully effective therapies for the treatment of clinical pain conditions.
