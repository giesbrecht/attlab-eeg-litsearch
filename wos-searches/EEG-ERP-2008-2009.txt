We derive the weighted averaging procedure by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio in the averaged subject responses and show, thereby, that maximizing signal-to-noise ratio criterion is equivalent to minimizing the originally proposed mean-square error criterion in the sense of the weighted averaging problem solving. Moreover, in order to characterize fully the performance of the selected methods, we compare also noise reduction rates in estimates of event-related potentials provided by methods, while the number of processed trials increases.

This is typically done by characterizing event-related potentials/fields or modulations of oscillatory activity (e. g., event-related synchronization) in response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link between the two phenomena. An essential component of our theory is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate asymmetrically; e. g., peaks are more strongly modulated than troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory brain activity will not "average out" when multiple trials are averaged. Using MEG, we demonstrate that such asymmetric amplitude fluctuations of the oscillatory alpha rhythm explain the generation of slow event-related fields. Furthermore, we provide a physiological explanation for the observed asymmetric amplitude fluctuations. In particular, slow event-related components are modulated by a wide range of cognitive tasks. Hence, our findings provide new insight into the physiological basis of cognitive modulation in event-related brain activity.

This method rank orders single trials according to the impact of each trial on the ERP average. Then, the minimum residual background noise level in the ERP data is determined at each step in the averaging process. Trials having a negative impact on the residual background noise are discarded from the averaging procedure. Simulations showed that ERP estimates obtained by the auto-adaptive averaging procedure were either better or comparable to those obtained by single trial artifact detection methods at their most optimum configuration, in particular during long duration artifacts. Experimental data from a working memory task further illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

The present paper provides a review of recent studies - 2001 to the present - with a focus on EEG findings in human participants characterized by a history of chronic substance use, abuse or dependence. In some areas (e.g., alcohol and cocaine dependence), the field has attempted to build upon earlier work by incorporating different methodologies or pursuing research questions of a transdisciplinary nature. New areas of inquiry, such as the investigation of EEG differences among users of ecstasy (MDMA) and methamphetamine, have emerged, primarily as a result of an alarming rise in popularity of these drugs.

Many laboratories are engaged in the discovery and validation of a wide array of potential genetic, proteomic, cognitive, and other types of biomarkers. Methods: This review focuses on the application of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and event-related potential (ERP) technologies as markers of prodromal impairment and early disease progression. It is the aim of this review to critically assess where this field currently stands, as well as future directions for EEG biomarker development. Results: As a neuroimaging tool that is relatively inexpensive, potentially portable, and capable of providing high-density spatial mapping, qEEG offers a noninvasive, rapid, and replicable method for assessing age-related and disease-related neurophysiologic change. Conclusions: As different signature changes associated with particular stages of disease burden are identified and validated, we anticipate expanded application of qEEG as a reliable and sensitive biomarker(s) of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease.

Carbon wire electrodes (not metallic EEG electrodes with carbon wire leads) are suitable for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording, because they cause less RF (radio-frequency) heating and susceptibility artifacts than metallic electrodes. These characteristics are especially desirable for recording the EEG in high field MRI scanners. Carbon wire electrodes are also comfortable to wear during long recording sessions. However, carbon electrodes have high electrode-electrolyte potentials compared to widely used Ag/AgCl (silver/silver chloride) electrodes, which may cause slow voltage drifts. This paper introduces a prototype EEG recording system with carbon wire electrodes and a circuit that suppresses the slow voltage drift. The system was tested for the voltage drift, RF heating, susceptibility artifact, and impedance, and was also evaluated in a simultaneous ERP (event-related potential)-fMRI experiment.

However, existing studies are based on a variety of different approaches, including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), raising the question of how EEG and fMRI findings in this field are related to each other. The present study aimed at disentangling common from specific regions underlying bottom-up novelty-processing and top-down target-processing. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings were employed to investigate how fMRI-identified brain regions contribute to event-related potential (ERP) signatures of novelty- and target-processing. Fourteen subjects performed a modified novelty oddball task in which either rare tones or novel sounds served as targets in different blocks, allowing us to separate novelty-related from mere distractor-related effects. ERP signatures of novelty- and target-processing could be identified, confirming previous research based on recordings outside the scanner. fMRI analyses revealed that, despite considerable overlap of regions activated during novelty- and target-processing, bilateral superior temporal and right inferior frontal areas showed pronounced activation related to novelty-processing. fMRI-informed ERP dipole seeding was used to integrate both signals. The source modeling results further implicated temporal and inferior frontal sources in novelty-processing. Target-related fMRI activation on the other hand was confirmed in a network comprising distributed frontoparietal regions as well as bilateral caudate nucleus and cerebellum. Most regions identified by fMRI showed a contribution to target-related ERP signatures. This pattern of findings underscores the potential of simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings for the spatiotemporal characterization of target- and novelty-processing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The denoising is done by separating ERP/noise subspaces in multidimensional EEG data by a linear transformation and the following dimension reduction by ignoring noise components during inverse transformation. The separation matrix is found based on the assumption that ERP sources are deterministic for all repetitions of the same type of stimulus within the experiment, while the other noise sources do not obey the determinancy property. A detailed derivation of the technique is given together with the analysis of the results of its application to a real high-density EEG data set. The interpretation of the results and the performance of the proposed method under conditions, when the basic assumptions are violated - e.g. the problem is underdetermined - are also discussed. Moreover, we study how the factors of the number of channels and trials used by the method influence the effectiveness of ERP/noise subspaces separation. In addition, we explore also the impact of different data resampling strategies on the performance of the considered algorithm. The results can help in determining the optimal parameters of the equipment/methods used to elicit and reliably estimate ERPs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Congress of Psychophysiology the Olympics of the Brain	SEP 08-13, 2008	St Petersburg, RUSSIA	Int Org Psychophysiol		Multimodal EEG/ERP-MRI technique; N100; P300; Source localization; Spatial resolution; SWARM; Brain mapping	TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; ODDBALL PARADIGM; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERROR-DETECTION; GAMMA-RESPONSE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUAL TARGET	Event-related potentials (ERPs) have high temporal resolution, but insufficient spatial resolution; the converse is true for the functional imaging techniques. The purpose of the study was to test the utility of a multimodal EEG/ERP-MRI technique which combines electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a simultaneously high temporal and spatial resolution. The sample consisted of 32 healthy young adults of both sexes. Auditory stimuli were delivered according to the active and passive oddball paradigms in the MRI environment (MRI-e) and in the standard conditions of the electrophysiology laboratory environment (Lab-e). Tasks were presented in a fixed order. Participants were exposed to the recording environments in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were preprocessed for MRI-related artifacts. Source localization was made using a current density reconstruction technique. The ERP waveforms for the MRI-e were morphologically similar to those for the Lab-e. The effect of the recording environment, experimental paradigm and electrode location were analyzed using a 2 x 2 x 3 analysis of variance for repeated measures. The ERP components in the two environments showed parametric variations and characteristic topographical distributions. The calculated sources were in line with the related literature. The findings indicated effortful cognitive processing in MRI-e. The study provided preliminary data on the feasibility of the multimodal EEG/ERP-MRI technique. It also indicated lines of research that are to be pursued for a decisive testing of this technique and its implementation to clinical practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In these and other ways these topographic analysis methods allow the experimenter to glean additional information and neurophysiologic interpretability beyond what is available from canonical waveform analyses. In this tutorial we present the example of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to stimulation of each hand to illustrate these points. For each step of these analyses, we provide the reader with both a conceptual and mathematical description of how the analysis is carried out, what it yields, and how to interpret its statistical outcome. We show that these topographic analysis methods are intuitive and easy-to-use approaches that can remove much of the guesswork often confronting ERP researchers and also assist in identifying the information contained within high-density ERP datasets.

In the present study, WE, relative WE and WE change were estimated for the EEG and ERP signals recorded during a working memory task, from dyslectic children and healthy subjects. The analysis of the two groups (controls vs dyslectics) revealed differentiations mainly in relative WE and WE change that takes into account the variability of rest EEG. These findings indicate that the WE can be employed as a quantitative measure for monitoring EEG and ERP activities and may provide a useful tool in analyzing electrophysiological signals associated with dyslexia.

The present article provides an overview on the theoretical background, recording methods and quantification of the ERP-Signals. In particular, the methodological problems of the EEG activity measure like placement of appropriate reference electrode or selection of a baseline are discussed. Beside such general aspects of ERP methodology, two kinds of ERP data analysis are considered: the extraction of ERP subcomponents using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and different types of source localisation methods of the ERP signals in the context of the "inverse problem".

In doing so, it should be possible to identify features of latent neural sources whose trial-to-trial dynamics are jointly reflected in both modalities. We present a joint independent component analysis (jICA) model for analysis of simultaneous single trial EEG-fMRI measurements from multiple subjects. We outline the general idea underlying the jICA approach and present results from simulated data under realistic noise conditions. Our results indicate that this approach is a feasible and physiologically plausible data-driven way to achieve spatiotemporal mapping of event related responses in the human brain.

A structural model was created based on musical aspects and multiple regression was used to calculate profiles of the contribution of each aspect, in contrast to traditional ERP components. By decomposing the response, we aimed to uncover pronounced ERP contributions for aspects of the encoding of musical structure, assuming a simple additive combination of these. When using a model built up of metric levels and contour direction, 81% of the variance is explained for perceived, and 57% for imagined melodies. The maximum correlation between the parameters found for the same melodic aspect in perception vs. imagery was 0.88, indicating similar processing between tasks. The decomposition method is shown to be a novel analysis method of complex ERP patterns, which allows subcomponents to be investigated within a continuous context. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of spontaneous and event related measures in the electroencephalogram	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			ERP; EEG; string length	EEG ANALYSIS; INTELLIGENCE	Some common descriptors of spontaneous EEG include the common spectral measures (including alpha and beta bands) and the less common measures of statistical moment analysis (such as activity, mobility and complexity). Of these measures, the complexity quantifies the apparent "excessive detail" of the EEG trace. Typically, around 20 seconds of EEG are required to compute these measures. A similar measure can be made in the averaged event related potential (ERP) domain, the "string-length" obtained when the normalized ERP trace is stretched out into a straight line. Several researchers have correlated this parameter with IQ measures in children and adults. Approximately 200 responses (100 seconds) of recorded data are required to form the averaged ERP and compute the string length. The present study examines the relationship between EEG activity, mobility & complexity and ERP string length. This paper describes a pilot study comparing results from moment analysis of EEG with string length. The preliminary results from two individuals indicate that complexity is strongly related to string length. This suggests that a simpler process for obtaining the measures is possible without requiring any stimulus.

In this technique, spatial notch filters are developed to exploit the multichannel electroencephalogram data together with a model of ERP with variable parameters in order to accurately localize the corresponding ERP signal sources. The algorithm is robust in the presence of reasonably high noise. The performance of the proposed system has been compared to that of linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer for different noise and correlation levels and its superiority has been demonstrated.

A review of EEG and ERP studies in bipolar disorder. The electroencephalogram (EEG) can be a useful tool in determining differences in general neural activity and specific waveforms in individuals with a number of psychiatric disorders. This paper aims to outline and discuss significant findings in EEG and event-related potential (ERP) research into bipolar disorder (BD). A literature review was performed through searches of MedLine, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo medical research databases for papers published from 1985 onwards. References of selected articles were also examined for other relevant studies. Differences in general EEG data were found in subjects with BD, namely increased theta and delta and decreased alpha wave bands. Changes in EEG were also found in euthymic BD subjects and those undergoing medication programmes. ERP studies commonly report prolonged latencies and reduced amplitudes in the P300 component. Hyperfunctioning of the right hemisphere in BD was also reported in some studies, although further confirmation of this finding is required. Finally, the effects of medication and the role that genetics plays in EEG still remain unclear. The literature reviewed demonstrates supporting evidence for the presence of significant differences in EEG and ERP data in subjects with BD. However, methodological considerations such as varying mood states and medication status of the patients need to be followed more stringently for future research to bring about a robust model of the cognitive deficits of BD.

This paper presents a comparison of three different algorithmic schemes for single-trial ERP detection: SVM (baseline), hierarchical SVM-(naive) Bayes, selected temporal windows-based SVM-(naive) Bayes. An ERP-based image search system, including experimental setup, data collection, pre-processing, and three ERP detection schemes is described and utilized as the framework for comparison. We apply three schemes on EEG data from four subjects acquired on four days (eight sessions) each. Results indicate that a properly trained SVM operating on data from the post-stimulus [0,500]ms interval and SVMs trained on 50ms nonoverlapping windows spanning the poststimulus [200,450]ms interval (where P300 is expected) whose binary decisions are fused via the naive-Bayes approach perform similarly in terms of area under the ROC curve measure, while the latter fusion approach applied to all ten nonoverlapping windows spanning the [0,500]ms poststimulus interval is inferior. The poststimulus time limit of 500ms is imposed on all data that goes into the ER-P detector because in our experimental setup the subjects are asked to press a button when they recognize the event of. interest, which creates motor responses in the brain typically in the [600,800]ms interval and around.

Twenty-one adults looked at emotional (sad, happy, fearful) or neutral faces. The results demonstrated that the emotional face elicited a negative peak at approximately 230 ms (N230). Moreover EEG measures showed that motivational significance of face (stimulus type) can modulate the amplitude of EEG, especially for theta and delta. Regression analysis showed that theta oscillations mainly effect as oscillation activity at the N2 latency. Thus, this frequency band variation could represent a complex set of cognitive processes, whereby selective attention becomes focused on an emotional relevant stimulus.

In this study we constructed chord-sequences such that perceived differences in the cognitive processing between regular and irregular chords could not be due to the sensory processing of acoustic factors like pitch repetition or pitch commonality (the major component of 'sensory dissonance'). Methodology/Principal Findings: Two groups of subjects (musicians and nonmusicians) were investigated with electroencephalography (EEG). Irregular chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) in the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The ERAN had a latency of around 180 ms after the onset of the music-syntactically irregular chords, and had maximum amplitude values over right anterior electrode sites. Conclusions/Significance: Because irregular chords were hardly detectable based on acoustical factors (such as pitch repetition and sensory dissonance), this ERAN effect reflects for the most part cognitive (not sensory) components of regularity-based, music-syntactic processing. Our study represents a methodological advance compared to previous ERP-studies investigating the neural processing of music-syntactically irregular chords.

This method permits direct observation of information processing at different levels of analysis; it can provide crucial information regarding real-time imaging of the neural system's responses to sensory stimulation (Bentin, 1989). This chapter will review the different ERP components which are relevant to reading and language processing, in order to aid us in understanding the different stages of processing that occur in the brain during reading. In addition, the differences in ERP components between regular and dyslexic readers will be discussed with the aim of understanding the manner in which reading ability affects brain activity. This information, which has been collected during the past few years, constitutes a stepping stone toward the development of diagnostic tools for the early identification of individuals at risk for dyslexia as well as the development of intervention programs for its remediation.

We can suggest that reinforcement learning using P300 can be performed accurately.

In order to handle the large-scale high dimension problems efficiently and quickly, the ISOMAP algorithm was used to find the low dimensional manifolds from recorded EEG. Then, based on reduced dimension data, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) with similar iterative re-weight least square (IRWLS) was used to discover the relationship between the observation potentials on the scalp and the internal sources within the brain. In our experiments, the two current dipole sources with four-shell concentric sphere model were reconstructed. Our experiments demonstrate that MSVR based on the support vector machine can obtain more robust estimations for EEG source localization problem.

Single trials were analyzed with an extremely simple high-dimensional version of discriminant analysis. The question was how many of the target trials contribute to the average P3, and to test whether other components in the ERP are sensitive to discriminate between target and non-target trials. One common classification rule for all participants expressing the P3 component correctly classified 88% of the ERPs of all subjects in response to a target or non-target trial. For four of the eight participants, there were strong differences in an early ERP component over the occipital recording sites. Their individual classification rules, obtained from the training data in the time interval up to 200 ms, correctly classified 85% of the trials of the test data.

With respect to every EEG trials caused by the same stimulus, the computation of all trails will be very enormous. In order to explore more significant information about even- evoked oscillatory activities, we introduced the approach of statistical parametric mapping for power-concentrated brain regions and interactivations among them, and applied them to the study of bimodal audio-visual speech cognitive task. The results gave explanations to the power and connectivity change of event-evoked oscillatory activities which matched ERP component in cognitive process. This study may provide a basis for future studies to reveal the underlying neural processes and neural networks associated with specialized cognitive state.

Recordings with patients often reveal a noisy background EEG, i.e., a high amplitude and multiple artifacts. Research studies have to deal with a limited number of available epochs. Therefore, averaging and efficient artifact rejection algorithms are needed. This paper focuses on the sorted averaging algorithm which was developed for the recording of auditory brainstem responses. We demonstrate the applicability of sorted averaging on ERPs by comparing three different averaging algorithms on a classical mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, recorded at 10 normal hearing volunteers. The resulting estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP waveforms was significantly increased compared to established averaging algorithms. Thus, the sorted averaging algorithm provides an improvement of the SNR in recordings with poor SNR (e.g., the MMN) or noisy background EEG (e.g., at Cochlear Implant users). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of attempting to model the entire ERP waveform, the method relies on modeling ERP component descriptors (amplitude and latency) thru the spatial diversity of multichannel recordings, and thus, it is tailored to extract signals in negative SNR conditions. The model allows for both amplitude and latency variability in the ERP component under investigation. The extracted ERP component is constrained through a spatial filter to have minimal distance (with respect to some metric) in the temporal domain from a user-designed template component. The spatial filter may be interpreted as a noise canceller in the spatial domain. Study with both simulated data and real cognitive ERP data shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The aim of this study is to apply a method for temporally extracting these components from human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during an auditory simple reaction time task (SR-task). The stimulus- and response-locked components are extracted from each channel of the EEG epochs and reaction times (RTs) of all the trials by using a discrete Fourier transform; the performance of the method is verified using known simulation data. The extracted stimulus-/response-locked components are compared with the stimulus-/response-triggered average EEG during the SR-task, auditory-evoked potential (AEP) during the passive hearing of an auditory stimulus, and movement-related potential (MRP) during self-paced voluntary movement. For the EEG filtered with a bandpass of 1-40 Hz, the scalp distributions of negative peaks around 400 ms (N400) in the extracted stimulus-locked components are significantly different from those in the stimulus-triggered average EEG during the SR-task, suggesting that the late parts of the stimulus-triggered average EEG largely suffer from temporal smearing with the response-locked components. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the temporal smearing is large when slow waves remain in the EEG. In conclusion, these results confirm the feasibility and necessity of the decomposition method proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we describe experiments involving six professional image analysts and summarize the ERP detection performance as they search for targets within a large image database. We develop a disjoint windowing scheme for data preprocessing to discard irrelevant and redundant information from the raw data to get clean training data. We apply support vector machines to detect ERPs and conduct 10-fold cross validation for parameter regularization. The results demonstrate that the ERP pattern recognition can provide reliable inference for image triage.

Each repetition is called a trial. Recent work has demonstrated that contrary to the traditional view, the event-related potential (ERP) can vary from trial to trial and the background ongoing activity often contains rich information about the cognitive state of the brain. Based on such a variable signal plus ongoing activity model, an iterative parameter estimation method is proposed in which both the single-trial parameters of the ERP and the autoregressive representation of the ongoing activity are obtained simultaneously. This technique, referred to as the analysis of single-trial ERP and ongoing activities method, is first tested on simulation examples, and then applied to the local field potential recordings from monkeys performing a visuomotor task.

For controls, the event-related potential (ERP) showed an enhanced visual N1 for trials in which Bad traits were endorsed. For depressed participants, this N I was attenuated, specifically for these endorsed Bad trials. A similar pattern was observed in the P2-medial frontal negativity (P2-MFN) complex, with controls showing an enhanced MFN to the endorsed Bad words, while depressed participants showed an attenuated or absent medial frontal response on these items specifically. Distributed linear-inverse source analysis of the ERP localized the NI effect to the inferotemporal-occipital cortex and the medial frontal effect to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The altered ERP responses in depressed participants may provide clues to the neurophysiological processes associated with negatively biased cognition and self-evaluation in clinical depression.

Evidence-Based Medicine Evaluation of Electrophysiological Studies of the Anxiety Disorders	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Event-related Potentials; Evoked Potentials; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Obsessive-compulsive Disorder; Panic Disorder; Phobias; Post-traumatic Stress Disorder; Quantitative Electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; OPTIMAL SEARCH STRATEGIES; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETRIEVING SCIENTIFICALLY STRONG; DETECTING CLINICALLY SOUND; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG POWER MODIFICATIONS	We provide a systematic, evidence-based medicine (EBM) review of the field of electrophysiology in the anxiety disorders. Presently, electrophysiological studies of anxiety focus primarily on etiological aspects of brain dysfunction. The review highlights many functional similarities across studies, but also identifies patterns that clearly differentiate disorder classifications. Such measures offer clinical utility as reliable and objective indicators of brain dysfunction in individuals and indicate potential as biomarkers for the improvement of diagnostic specificity and for informing treatment decisions and prognostic assessments. Common to most of the anxiety disorders is basal instability in cortical arousal, as reflected in measures of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) measures tend to correlate with symptom sub-patterns and be exacerbated by condition-specific stimulation. Also common to most of the anxiety disorders are condition-specific difficulties with sensory gating and the allocation and deployment of attention. These are clearly evident from evoked potential (EP) and event-related potential (ERP) electrical measures of information processing in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the phobias. Other ERP measures clearly differentiate the disorders. However, there is considerable variation across studies, with inclusion and exclusion criteria, medication status and control group selection not standardized within condition or across studies. Study numbers generally preclude analysis for confound removal or for the derivation of diagnostic biomarker patterns at this time. The current trend towards development of databases of brain and cognitive function is likely to obviate these difficulties. In particular, electrophysiological measures of function are likely to play a significant role in the development and subsequent adaptations of DSM-V and assist critically in securing improvements in nosological and treatment specificity.

A neural index of memory function - the electrophysiological 'Old-New' effect - was obtained from participants undertaking a memory recognition test of previously studied ('old') and unstudied ('new') pictures of variable levels of negative emotional intensity. The magnitude of the old-new effect was compared across four different levels of linearly increasing stimulus emotional intensity. Results revealed an inverted-U-shaped effect of emotional intensity on the magnitude of ERP old-new differences starting at 300 ms after stimulus onset. These results suggest that moderate negative emotions can enhance memory brain function, whereas extreme levels of emotional intensity have the potential of inhibiting memory function. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for neurobiological and psychological models of emotion-memory interactions.

This theory was tested in the domain of word reading by examining brain responses to briefly presented words that were either new or immediate repetitions. Critically, the prime that immediately preceded the target was presented either for 150 ins or 2,000 ins, thus examining a situation of perceptual integration versus one of perceptual separation. Electrophysiological responses during the first 200 ins following presentation of the target word were assessed using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. As predicted by a dynamic neural network model with habituation, repeated words produced less of a perceptual response, and this effect diminished with increased prime duration. Using dynamics that best accounted for the behavioral transition from positive to negative priming with increasing prime duration, the model correctly predicted the time course of the event-related potential (ERP) repetition effects under the assumption that letter processing is the source of observed P100 repetition effects and word processing is the source of observed N170 repetition effects.

However, recent studies suggested that the perception of food-like and nonfood-like odors may depend on the route of stimulation. The aim of the present study was two-fold: first to examine the neural correlates of perceptual interactions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived event-related potentials (ERPs) and second to test the influence of the stimulation route on quality perception. Therefore, we designed an experiment with 30 subjects to study perceptual interactions in woody-fruity mixtures and compared ortho- vs. retronasal stimulation sites on perceived odor quality and ERPs. The results revealed synergy or masking of the fruity component, depending on the woody component level. Synergy was supported by larger N1 amplitude of the ERP. Furthermore, mixtures including a medium level of the woody odor elicited a strong increase of P2 amplitude only retronasally. This study evidenced for the first time electrophysiological correlates of both perceptual synergy and masking on the early component of the ERPs and confirmed that retro- vs. orthonasal stimulation route induces different neural processes that are reflected in the late component of the ERP.

J	Ng, KS; Yang, HJ; Kim, SH				Ng, Kam Swee; Yang, Hyung-Jeong; Kim, Sun-Hee			Hidden pattern discovery on event related potential EEG signals	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						ERP; EEG; Hidden variables; Principal Component Analysis		EEG signals are important to capture brain disorders. They are useful for analyzing the cognitive activity of the brain and diagnosing types of seizure and potential mental health problems. The Event Related Potential can be measured through the EEG signal. However, it is always difficult to interpret due to its low amplitude and sensitivity to changes of the mental activity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to incrementally detect the pattern of this kind of EEG signal. This approach successfully summarizes the whole stream of the EEG signal by finding the correlations across the electrodes and discriminates the signals corresponding to various tasks into different patterns. It is also able to detect the transition period between different EEG signals and identify the electrodes which contribute the most to these signals. The experimental results show that the proposed method allows the significant meaning of the EEG signal to be obtained from the extracted pattern. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are two approaches in neurometrics. The first relies on the spectral characteristics of spontaneous electroencephalograms (EEG) and measures deviations from normality in EEG recorded in the resting state. The second approach relies on event related potentials that measure the electrical responses of the brain to stimuli and actions in behavioral tasks. The present study reviews recent re search on the application of event related potentials (ERPs) for the discrimination of different types of brain dys function. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is used as an example. It is shown that the diagnostic power of ERPs is enhanced by the recent emergence of new methods of analysis, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Low Resolution Electromagnetic To mography (LORETA).

Evoked activity and EEG phase resetting in the genesis of auditory Go/NoGo ERPs	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP genesis; Phase resetting; Stimulus-processing evoked activity; EEG; Go/NoGo paradigm	CONTRIBUTES; GENERATION; POWER	Current views of the genesis of the event-related potential (ERP) contrast the phase-reset and evoked activity models. In the former, a portion of the ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity becomes phase-locked at stimulus onset; in the latter, processing in the brain contributes additional time-locked activity at each trial. This study aimed to explore these perspectives in an auditory Go/NoGo task. The interactions between these processes were examined using the amplitudes and topographies of pre- and post-stimulus EEGs in traditional bands, and the averaged ERPs, together with time-frequency analysis. Results indicate that both evoked activity and phase locking of ongoing EEG activity contribute substantially to the different Go and NoGo ERP components. Phase locking contributes most strongly to the early exogenous ERP components, with evoked brain activity related to cognitive processing contributing strongly to the endogenous ERP components. Evidence also suggests that extensive phase realignments may generate the power increases associated with early exogenous components. It is concluded that exogenous ERP components arise substantially from phase-resetting mechanisms involving ongoing EEG activity. In contrast, the endogenous components are substantially produced by evoked activity in various frequency bands, and their differences reflect differential cortical processing required for appropriate responding to the Go vs. NoGo stimuli.

The method is based on recursive Bayesian mean square estimation of ERP wavelet coefficients using their previous estimates as prior information. To enable a performance evaluation of the approach in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributed noise conditions, we added Gaussian white noise (GWN) and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded during rest to the simulated ERPs. The results were compared to that of the Kalman filtering (KF) approach demonstrating the robustness of the PF over the KF to the added GWN noise. The proposed method also outperforms the KF when the assumption about the Gaussianity of the noise is violated. We also applied this technique to real EEG potentials recorded in an odd-ball paradigm and investigated the correlation between the amplitude and the latency of the estimated ERP components. Unlike the KF method, for the PF there was a statistically significant negative correlation between amplitude and latency of the estimated ERPs, matching previous neurophysiological findings(4).

Forty-five patients and twenty non-phobic women were presented with phobia-relevant, generally fear-inducing, disgust-inducing and affectively neutral pictures in a first EEG session. Phobic patients were randomly assigned to either a therapy (TG) or a waiting-list (WG) group. EEG measurement was repeated after CBT or a waiting period. ERPs were extracted in the time windows 340-500 ms (P300), 550-770 ms (late positive potential (LPP), early LPP) and 800-1500 ms (late LPP). Relative to controls, untreated phobics showed enhanced amplitudes of P300 and early LPP in response to spider pictures. This most likely reflects the emotional significance of the phobic stimulus, which automatically draws attention. The therapy effect consisted of a significant enhancement of late LPP amplitudes in response to spider pictures. Results are discussed in terms of reduced attentional avoidance.

The correction techniques proposed so far cannot optimally represent transitions, i.e. when abrupt changes of the artefact properties due to head movements occur. The algorithm developed here takes the head movement parameters from the fMRI signal into account to calculate adequate EEG artefact templates and subsequently correct the distorted EEG data. The data reported in this work demonstrate that the realignment parameter-informed algorithm outperforms the commonly used moving average algorithm if head movements occur. The superiority is reflected by comparing the residual variance after artefact correction with either method. The residual variance is lower around head-movements that exceed head deflections of about 1 mm when applying the realignment parameter-informed algorithm. Additionally, the signal to noise ratio of a surrogate event-related potential (ERP) increased by 10-40% for head displacements larger than 1 mm. The algorithm developed here is particularly suited for studies where head movements of the subject cannot be prevented as in studies with patients, children, or during sleep. Furthermore, the enhanced signal to noise ratio of a single trial ERP indicates the power of the presented algorithm for single trial ERP-fMRI studies in which EEG signal quality is a critical factor.

In the Simple Task, negative pictures are target stimuli, while in the Complex Task white-framed negative pictures are target stimuli. Subjects are required to respond when a target stimulus is onset. The EEG (electroencephalogram) epochs are averaged and ERP (event-related potential) components are obtained. The P300 amplitude is smaller in the Complex Task than in the Simple Task, which proves that the emotion P300 is significantly modulated by task relevance. As PI and NI amplitudes are decreased in the Complex Task comparing with the Simple Task, we can suggest that the PI/NI components elicited by emotional stimuli are modulated by task relevance, too.

The event-related potentials (ERP) of normal subjects and excessive Internet users were acquired using the oddball paradigm experiment. We applied the wavelet transformed and event-related spectral perturbation to ERP in order to extract the time-frequency values. The F-test statistics of time-frequency values were then decomposed into two components by NMF. Excessive Internet use resulted in a significant decrease in the P300 amplitudes (P < 0.05) and a significant increase in the P300 latency ( P < 0.05) in all electrodes. The major effect of excessive Internet use on gamma oscillation occurred at similar to 300 ms after stimuli at 40-50 Hz on the parietal central region. Thus, these data suggest that excessive Internet use affects information coding and integration in the brain. (C) 2009 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Oil the other hand, cognitive architectures such as ACT-R would explain how all the components of the mind work together to generate coherent human cognition. Thus EEG/LRP (event-related potential) and ACT-R will provide two aspects to explore the cognitive processes and their neural basis. In this paper, we present a case study by combining EEG/ERP and ACT-R for investigating human computation mechanism. In particular, we focus oil two digits addition tasks with or without carry, and systematically perform a set of behavior and EEG experiments, as well as with the help of ACT-R simulation. Preliminary results show the usefulness of our approach.

Estimation of time-varying causal connectivity on EEG signals with the use of adaptive autoregressive parameters	2008 30TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	30th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 20-24, 2008	Vancouver, CANADA	DEVICIX, Green Coll, Natl Inst Hlth, NIBIB, NSF, PLEXON Inc, UBC Engn Biomed Engn, Univ Washington, Coll Engn, Bentham Sci Publ Ltd, Recent Patents Biomed Engn, Recent Patents Engn			EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INFORMATION-FLOW; MODELS	In this paper, we address the problem of time-varying causal connectivity estimators on Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals by means of Directed Transfer Function (DTF). The DTF method reveals causal information flows between brain areas, while direct DTF (dDTF) is able to distinguish and estimate only direct flows. Since neurophysiological signals such as EEG and event related potentials (ERP) can be nonstationary, their temporal dynamics cannot be satisfactorily represented. Time-varying dDTF can be estimated using Kalman Filter for adaptive calculation of multivariate autoregressive coefficients. This approach can reveal transient causal relations and model time-dependent flow patterns. This approach was applied to simulated signals and the results indicated that time-varying dDTF can provide efficient estimates of connectivity patterns.

NP may reflect persisting inhibition of former distractors and/or retrieval of task-inappropriate information from the primes. In an event-related potential (ERP) study of the flanker task, NP was accompanied by reduced positivity in the P300 time range. The early portion of this effect was shared with a target-repetition condition and hence may indicate retrieval processes cued by repeated stimuli. A subsequent N400-like component was specific for NP and may reflect processing of the retrieved task-inappropriate information. In addition, NP effects on the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) matched predictions of the episodic-retrieval view. NP effects on P300, N400, and response-locked LRP were stronger in participants with above-median behavioral NP, confirming the significance of these ERP effects for NP. Overall, findings support episodic-retrieval explanations of NP.

In the case of ambiguous figures, however, perception is unstable, spontaneously alternating between equally possible outcomes. The present study compared EEG responses to ambiguous figures and their unambiguous variants. We found that slight figural changes, which turn ambiguous figures into unambiguous ones, lead to a dramatic difference in an ERP ("event-related potential") component at around 400 ms. This result was obtained across two different categories of figures, namely the geometric Necker cube stimulus and the semantic Old/Young Woman face stimulus. Our results fit well into the Bayesian inference concept, which models the evaluation of a perceptual interpretation's reliability for subsequent action planning. This process seems to be unconscious and the late EEG signature may be a correlate of the outcome.

It is believed that antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical ones, could improve cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 response are potential candidates for objective investigation of pre-attentional and attention-dependent processing in schizophrenia patients, respectively. Both these responses were found to be altered in schizophrenia. Moreover, neurotransmitters play important role in generation of MMN and P300 components. Therefore, these ERPs are potential candidates for monitoring the cognitive changes caused by neurochemical modulation during antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients. In addition, neurochemical ERP generation mechanisms discovered during drug-challenge studies in healthy subjects could explain these ERP findings in patients. To date, no effect of antipsychotic treatment on MMN was observed, whereas certain antipsychotics ( e. g. clozapine) could modulate P300 response. At the same time, adjunctive glutamate-system affecting therapy seems to influence MMN response. The explanation of these phenomena could be a weak relationship between dopaminergic activities and MMN response and a strong connection between glutamate NMDA receptors and MMN generation. As to the P300 component, because of the multiple generators, it is more sensitive to the influences of different neurochemical activities. In the future, the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) with electroencephalography ( EEG) will open new possibilities for understanding the drug-induced changes on the neural substrates of information processing in schizophrenia patients.

Event-related Potential Study of Novelty Processing Abnormalities in Autism	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Review						Event-related potentials; Autism; Attention; Novelty	DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; WEAK CENTRAL COHERENCE; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MINICOLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; P300	To better understand visual processing abnormalities in autism we studied the attention orienting related frontal event potentials (ERP) and the sustained attention related centro-parietal ERPs in a three stimulus oddball experiment. The three stimulus oddball paradigm was aimed to test the hypothesis that individuals with autism abnormally orient their attention to novel distracters as compared to controls. A dense-array 128 channel EGI electroencephalographic (EEG) system was used on 11 high-functioning children and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 11 age-matched, typically developing control subjects. Patients with ASD showed slower reaction times but did not differ in response accuracy. At the anterior (frontal) topography the ASD group showed significantly higher amplitudes and longer latencies of early ERP components (e.g., P100, N100) to novel distracter stimuli in both hemispheres. The ASD group also showed prolonged latencies of late ERP components (e.g., P2a, N200, P3a) to novel distracter stimuli in both hemispheres. However, differences were more profound in the right hemisphere for both early and late ERP components. Our results indicate augmented and prolonged early frontal potentials and a delayed P3a component to novel stimuli, which suggest low selectivity in pre-processing and later-stage under-activation of integrative regions in the prefrontal cortices. Also, at the posterior (centro-parietal) topography the ASD group showed significantly prolonged N100 latencies and reduced amplitudes of the N2b component to target stimuli. In addition, the latency of the P3b component was prolonged to novel distracters in the ASD group. In general, the autistic group showed prolonged latencies to novel stimuli especially in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successful differentiation of target and novel stimuli. We propose the potential application of ERP evaluations in a novelty task as outcome measurements in the biobehavioral treatment (e.g., EEG biofeedback, TMS) of autism.

Theta EEG oscillatory activity and auditory change detection	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); mismatch negativity (MMN); phase-resetting; spectral power; theta rhythm	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; NEURAL DYNAMICS; VISUAL-STIMULI; RESPONSES; MEMORY; CORTEX; ALPHA; PITCH	The mismatch negativity is an electrophysiological marker of auditory change detection in the event-related brain potential and has been proposed to reflect an automatic comparison process between an incoming stimulus and the representation of prior items in a sequence. There is evidence for two main functional subcomponents comprising the MMN, generated by temporal and frontal brain areas, respectively. Using data obtained in an MMN paradigm, we performed time-frequency analysis to reveal the changes in oscillatory neural activity in the theta band. The results suggest that the frontal component of the MMN is brought about by an increase in theta power for the deviant trials and, possibly, by an additional contribution of theta phase alignment. By contrast, the temporal component of the MMN, best seen in recordings from mastoid electrodes, is generated by phase resetting of theta rhythm with no concomitant power modulation. Thus, frontal and temporal MMN components do not only differ with regard to their functional significance but also appear to be generated by distinct neurophysiological mechanisms.

Instead of modeling the entire ERP waveform, the method focuses on the ERP component local descriptors (amplitude and latency) thru the spatial diversity of multichannel recordings and thus it is tailored to extract signals in negative signal to noise ratio conditions. The model allows for both amplitude and latency variability in the ERP component under investigation. We applied the method to the estimation of the P300 component in an oddball target detection task and found that negative correlations exist between response time and single-trial P300 amplitude.

Our research team has used the technique of functional MRI and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to address the question of how the brain answers while subjects viewed different designs. Classifying the good or bad designs, subjects chose a mouse button to decide their perception of good or bad design and we analyzed their patterns of EEG rhythms and fMRI. The results of fMRI showed that the perceptions of different feelings of designs are associated with the frontal lobe and the occipital lobe. After analyzing the EEG by the Event-related brain potentials (ERP) method, we also found that the amplitude of ERP components in perception of bad design is greater and latency is shorter than that of good design.

Part of the discrepancy might be explained by uncontrolled low-level differences between images used to assess the timing of face processing. In the present experiment, we used a set of faces, houses, and noise textures with identical amplitude spectra to equate energy in each spatial frequency band. The timing of face processing was evaluated using face-house and face-noise contrasts, as well as upright-inverted stimulus contrasts. ERP differences were evaluated systematically at all electrodes, across subjects, and in each subject individually, using trimmed means and bootstrap tests. Different strategies were employed to assess the robustness of ERP differential activities in individual subjects and group comparisons. We report results showing that the most conspicuous and reliable effects were systematically observed in the N170 latency range, starting at about 130-150 ms after stimulus onset.

The separation and identification of such components could not only serve diagnostic purposes, but also facilitate the design of brain-computer interface systems. However, the effective analysis of components is hindered by many factors including the complexity of the EEG signal and its variation over the trials. In this paper we study several measures for the identification of the nature of independent components and address the means for efficient decomposition of the rich information content embedded in the multi-channel EEC recordings associated with the multiple trials of an event-related experiment.

In Dutch, the base position of the verb is clause final, but in matrix clauses, the finite verb is in second position, a construction known as Verb Second. In embedded clauses, the finite verb remains in its clause-final base position. The results show that ungrammatical placement of finite verbs in second position in embedded clauses yields a P600 response, which suggests that the parser treats this type of violation as a clear syntactic anomaly. This is in contrast to accounts by which a general preference for subject-verb-object word order in languages like Dutch is reflected by an absence of P600 effects in response to violations of Verb Second.

Objective selection of EEG late potentials through residual dependence estimation of independent components	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						independent component analysis; clustering; EEG event-related potentials	BLIND SEPARATION; ICA; EXTRACTION; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; INFORMATION; EMOTION; FMRI	This paper presents a novel method to objectively select electroencephalographic (EEG) cortical sources estimated by independent component analysis (ICA) in event-related potential (ERP) studies. A proximity measure based on mutual information is employed to estimate residual dependences of the components that are then hierarchically clustered based on these residual dependences. Next, the properties of each group of components are evaluated at each level of the hierarchical tree by two indices that aim to assess both cluster tightness and physiological reliability through a template matching process. These two indices are combined in three different approaches to bring to light the hierarchical structure of the cluster organizations. Our method is tested on a set of experiments with the purpose of enhancing late positive ERPs elicited by emotional picture stimuli. Results suggest that the best way to look for physiologically plausible late positive potential (LPP) sources is to explore in depth the tightness of those clusters that, taken together, best resemble the template. According to our results, after brain sources clustering, LPPs are always identified more accurately than from ensemble-averaged raw data. Since the late components of an ERP involve the same associative areas, regardless of the modality of stimulation or specific tasks administered, the proposed method can be simply adapted to other ERP studies, and extended from psychophysiological studies to pathological or sport training evaluation support.

Separating Cognitive Processes with Principal Components Analysis of EEG Time-Frequency Distributions	ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS, ARCHITECTURES, AND IMPLEMENTATIONS XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, and Implementantions XVIII	AUG 10-11, 2008	San Diego, CA	SPIE			ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEM; BAD OUTCOMES; FEEDBACK; BRAIN; TASK; LOSSES; REWARD; GAINS	Measurement of EEG event-related potential (ERP) data has been most commonly undertaken in the time-domain, which can be complicated to interpret when separable activity overlaps in time. When the overlapping activity has distinct frequency characteristics, however, time-frequency (TF) signal processing techniques can be useful. The current report utilized ERP data from a cognitive task producing typical feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 ERP components which overlap in time. TF transforms were computed using the binomial reduced interference distribution (RID), and the resulting TF activity was then characterized using principal components analysis (PCA). Consistent with previous work, results indicate that the FRN was more related to theta activity (3-7 Hz) and P300 more to delta activity (below 3 Hz). At the same time, both time-domain measures were shown to be mixtures of TF theta and delta activity, highlighting the difficulties with overlapping activity. The TF theta and delta measures, on the other hand, were largely independent from each other, but also independently indexed the feedback stimulus parameters investigated. Results support the view that TF decomposition can greatly improve separation of overlapping EEG/ERP activity relevant to cognitive models of performance monitoring.

Thirty healthy right-handed volunteers (mean age 24 years) participated in the study. The dynamics of RT, characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP) components during perception of digits and non-verbal stimuli were analyzed. The specificity of RT's asymmetry in simple and complex visual-motor reactions depended on stimulus type was revealed. The similarity of early ERP components (peak latency of 100-200ms) for both stimuli types in simple and complex visual-motor reaction was shown. We also described the formation of specific ERP configuration for digits differentiation such as a left-sided asymmetry of component N200, and increase of peak latency of the late negative component with their extension to the parietal region.

ERP and ERMF recordings showed that selective attention to stimulus arrays in one visual field enhanced late responses (around 200 ms after the stimulus presentation) that were localized in S (ERMF) and ES (ERP) cortex. The results of the DIT analysis indicate there is a significant attention related increase in the flow of information back from ES to S cortex at around 220 ms with an associated decrease in the flow of information forward from S cortex to ES cortex. These results support the hypothesis that a feedback mechanism guides attention-related processing in primary visual cortex and provide evidence that DIT can by used to evaluate the direction of information. flow between cortical areas.

Brain dynamics in the auditory oddball task as a function of stimulus intensity and task requirements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain dynamics; Event-related potentials; Mechanisms; Orthogonal phase effects; Phase synchronisation; Auditory oddball	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG-DYNAMICS; ALPHA-PHASE; ERP; ATTENTION; HYPOTHESIS; COMPONENTS; TARGET	We examined relationships between the phase of narrow-band electroencephalographic (EEC) activity at stimulus onset and the resultant event-related potentials (ERPs) in an auditory oddball task, varying both stimulus intensity and active vs. passive task requirements between groups. We used a novel conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). This study focused on the operation of three previously-reported phase-influenced mechanisms, involving prestimulus amplitudes, poststimulus amplitude changes, and the prestimulus contingent negative variation (CNV), in various EEG frequency bands. ERP responses to the standard stimuli were analysed. Prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1 Hz bands from 1 to 13 Hz) at Cz was assessed for each trial using digital filtering. For each frequency, the cycle at stimulus onset was used to sort trials into four phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz, and Pz. The occurrence of preferred phase-defined brain states was confirmed at a number of frequencies, crossing the traditional frequency bands. These preferred states were associated with more efficient processing of the stimulus, as reflected in differences in latency and/or amplitude of all ERP components, and provided evidence of the operation of the three separate phase-influenced mechanisms. The preferred brain states occurred similarly across groups, suggesting that they reflect reflexive aspects of brain function associated with the timing of the stimuli, rather than voluntary attention. The impact on markers of cognitive function, such as the P3, suggests their important contributions to the efficiency of brain dynamics involved in perceptual and cognitive processing.

Methods: Twenty-one CWA (4-8 years) and 21 age-matched typically developing children (TDC) were presented with pairs of clicks separated by a 0.5 s intra-pair interval, with longer (7-9 s) intervals between pairs. Children watched a silent movie during click presentation. We assessed EEG perturbations and event-related potentials (ERP) in response to Sounds of different temporal novelty - first (S1) and second (S2) clicks in the pair. Results: In TDC, the early attention-modulated midtemporal N1c wave evoked by S1 and corresponding EEG phase locking and power increase were right-lateralized and were bilaterally higher than those evoked by S2. CWA demonstrated abnormal S1 responses, characterized by reduced N1c amplitude and EEG phase locking in the right midtemporal region. reversed leftward lateralization of the phase locking, and diminished later frontal N2 wave. Their brain responses to S2 Were essentially normal. Conclusions: The impaired right hemispheric processing of temporary and contextually novel information and suboptimal lateralization of normally right-lateralized attention networks may be important features of autistic disorder. Significance: Results of this study contribute to the understanding of autism neurobiology. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Spatio-temporal EEG waves in first episode schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Schizophrenia; EEG dynamics; P3b ERP; Psychomotor Poverty; Hypofrontality	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAVELING ALPHA-WAVES; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NAIVE PATIENTS; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GAMMA-SYNCHRONY; PARIETAL CORTEX	Objective: Schizophrenia is characterized by a deficit in context processing, with physiological correlates of hypofrontality and reduced amplitude P3b event-related potentials. We hypothesized an additional physiological correlate: differences in the spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical activity along the anterior-posterior axis of the scalp. Methods: This study assessed latency topographies of spatio-temporal waves under task conditions that elicit the P3b. EEG was recorded during separate auditory and visual tasks. Event-related spatio-temporal waves were quantified from scalp EEG of subjects with first episode schizophrenia (FES) and matched controls. Results: The P3b-related task conditions elicited a peak in spatio-temporal waves in the delta band at a similar latency to the P3b event-related potential. Subjects with FES had fewer episodes of anterior to posterior waves in the 2-4 Hz band compared to controls. Within the FES group, a tendency for fewer episodes of anterior to posterior waves was associated with high Psychomotor Poverty symptom factor scores. Conclusions: Subjects with FES had altered global EEG dynamics along the anterior-posterior axis during task conditions involving context update. Significance: The directional nature of this finding and its association with Psychomotor Poverty suggest this result is related to findings of hypofrontality in schizophrenia.

J	Galow, A; Tamm, S				Galow, Anett; Tamm, Sascha			True and False memory: in EEG pilot study	FORENSISCHE PSYCHIATRIE PSYCHOLOGIE KRIMINOLOGIE			German	Article						EEG; ERP; false; memory; old/new effect		The present study aims to discriminate true and false memory by examining the EEG activity in a setting as applied as possible to the context of credibility assessment. To achieve this, 19 participants saw a short film about a robbery and had to answer 35 yes-no-questions, 25 of them contained misleading information. In order to distort the participants' memories suggestive techniques were implemented, e.g. repeated questioning. The comparison of event-related potentials (ERP) of true and false memories reveals a parieto-occipital effect between 350 and 500 ms. This effect is consistent with the parietal old/new effect, which is associated with recollection. At the same time, this finding is in agreement with research associating a transient negativity (N400) with processing of semantic incongruent information.

Alpha power is influenced by performance errors	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP < Measures Used; Cognition < Content; Normal Volunteers < Groups Studied	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EEG ALPHA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; ERP COMPONENTS; NEGATIVITY; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; THETA	Error commission evokes changes in event-related potentials, autonomic nervous system activity, and behavior, presumably reflecting the operation of a cognitive control network. Here we test the hypothesis that errors lead to increased cortical arousal, measurable as changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha band power. Participants performed a Stroop task while EEG was recorded. Following correct responses, alpha power increased and then decreased in a quadratic pattern, implying transient mental disengagement during the intertrial interval. This trend was absent following errors, which elicited significantly less alpha power than correct trials. Moreover, post-error alpha power was a better predictor of individual differences in post-error slowing than the error-related negativity (ERN), whereas the ERN was a better predictor of post-error accuracy than alpha power. These findings imply that changes in cortical arousal play a unique role in modulating post-error behavior.

Time-frequency Coherence Analysis of Multi-channel Event-related Potential using Adaptive Windowed Lomb Periodogram	2009 4TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	APR 29-MAY 02, 2009	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE, EMBS		Lomb periodogram; coherence analysis; event-related potential; electroencephalography	STATISTICS	This paper introduces a new time-frequency coherence analysis method based on Lomb periodogram and applies it to investigate the time-varying synchronization of multi-channel event-related potentials (ERP). The Lomb periodogram is first extended to a time-frequency analysis method by windowing the observation. Furthermore, the window bandwidth is selected adaptively by the intersection of confidence intervals (ICI) rule to improve the time-frequency resolution. By using an adaptive window for each sinusoid and at each time instant, the adaptive windowed Lomb periodogram (AWLP) can achieve better bias and variance tradeoff and optimize the time-frequency resolution. Experimental results show that the AWLP-based coherence can provide useful information indicating the direction of information flow and correlation between different cortical regions.	[Zhang, Z.

Fractal geometry has been proved useful in quantifying complexities of dynamical signals. Temporal fractal dimension of EEG signals provides a new neurophysiological measure. In order to better understand what the complexity measure reveals about the underling brain process, a further exploration oil the neuronal generators of fractal geometry characteristics of EEG is conducted in this study. Our investigation suggests that the temporal fractal measure of EEG signals can be related to the activity diversity of neuronal population activities. The complexity measure also gives an indication oil the change in synchronization state under certain mental conditions. These assumptions are supported by experimental evidence from the Visual cortex and sensori-motor cortex. This work helps give an interpretation of the obtained results of the temporal complexity analysis on EEG signals and may be useful in further investigating the covert steps of brain information processing.

Electrophysiological effects of dizocilpine (MK-801) in adult rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						NMDA; ethanol; adolescent; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HIPPOCAMPAL TYPE-2 THETA; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; NMDA; AGE; BRAIN	Background: Despite evidence showing persistent changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor function following ethanol (EtOH) exposure, the contribution of NMDA systems to the long-term neurophysiological consequences of adolescent EtOH exposure is unclear. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to determine whether adolescent EtOH exposure produces neurophysiological changes after a prolonged withdrawal period in adult rats and (2) to assess protracted alterations in neurophysiological responses to the NMDA antagonist MK-801 in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence. Methods: Adolescent male Wistar rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 12 h/d for 5 weeks. The effects of MK-801 (0.0 to 0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed after 8 weeks of abstinence from EtOH. Results: Experiments in aim 1 revealed that adolescent EtOH exposure reduced EEG variability in the frontal cortex in the 4 to 6 Hz band but had no effect on cortical and hippocampal EEG power and ERPs. Experiments in aim 2 showed that MK-801 significantly reduced EEG power in the parietal cortex (4 to 6 Hz, 6 to 8 Hz, 8 to 16 Hz, 16 to 32 Hz) and hippocampus (16 to 32 Hz) and EEG variability in the parietal cortex (6 to 8 Hz, 16 to 32 Hz) following adolescent EtOH exposure. MK-801 produced a significant decrease in hippocampal EEG variability (4 to 6 Hz, 8 to 16 Hz, 16 to 32 Hz) in control, but not in EtOH-exposed rats. MK-801 reduced frontal P1 ERP amplitude and latency in response to the rare tone in EtOH-exposed rats compared to controls. In contrast, MK-801 significantly reduced P3 ERP amplitude and latency in control, but not in EtOH-exposed rats. Conclusions: The effects of MK-801 on hippocampal EEG variability and P3 ERP amplitude and latency are significantly attenuated after a prolonged withdrawal period following adolescent EtOH exposure. However, the inhibitory effects of MK-801 on cortical and hippocampal EEG power were enhanced in rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence. Taken together, these data suggest protracted changes in NMDA systems following adolescent EtOH exposure.

Current methods are based on spontaneous EEG providing only indirect information on the reactivity of the brain. Measurement of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) has been shown to have additional potential for evaluation of the level of consciousness. Unfortunately, compact and easy-to-use devices are not commercially available. In this study a portable battery-powered device for clinical auditory ERP measurements was designed, constructed and validated. The device consists of a five-channel data logger and a 16-bit stereo audio stimulator. The signals are digitized with a 22-bit sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converter and stored to a PC Card hard disk. Prior to the in vivo application, the device was validated with extensive technical tests. Importantly, the RMS noise amplitude of the EEG channels was found to be less than 1 mu V and the delivered auditory stimulus intensity corresponded accurately the settings (mean difference 0.2 +/- 0.5 dB). In addition to technical tests the device was successfully validated in vivo. To summarize, a novel portable instrument for measurement of auditory event-related potentials in intensive care environment is introduced. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

One possible pathophysiological mechanism for this is all effect of corticosteroids. We have previously demonstrated that endogenous cortisol concentrations correlate with the asymmetry of cortical activity related to episodic memory in healthy subjects and depressed patients. To further-examine whether this is due to a causal effect of cortisol on the laterality of episodic memory, we studied the effect of exogenous administration of cortisol in healthy subjects. Twenty-three right-handed healthy male volunteers were tested in a double-blind cross-over study. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during an episodic memory task following a four-day course of 160 mg/day cortisol or placebo. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to identify brain regions involved in the neurocognitive task. Cortisol levels were measured in saliva samples. ERP and LORETA analysis following placebo demonstrated significant left parahippocampal activation associated with successful retrieval. Cortisol led to a decrease in the mean early frontal ERP voltage and all increase in the late right ERP voltage. LORETA suggested this to be due to a significant increased late activation of the right superior frontal gyrus. There was no significant effect of cortisol on episodic memory performance. This study suggests that exogenous cortisol leads to more positive-going waveforms over the right than the left hemisphere, possibly due to increased monitoring of the products of retrieval. The results support the hypothesis of causal effects of cortisol on the laterality of cortical activity occurring during an episodic memory task. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evidence of performance improvements in nonsmokers has provided partial support for the absolute effects of nicotine on cognitive processes, which are independent of withdrawal relief, but the mechanisms underlying its pro-cognitive properties still remain elusive. The attentional facilitation frequently reported with smoking/nicotine may be indirectly related to its diffuse arousal-enhancing actions, as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) fast frequency power increments, or it may reflect nicotine's direct modulating effects on specific neural processes governing stimulus encoding, selection and rejection, Event-related potential (ERP) components extracted during the performance of cognitive tasks have proven to be sensitive to early pre-attentive and later attention-dependent processes that are not otherwise reflected in behavioral probes. To date, the majority of ERP studies have been conducted with smokers using passive non-task paradigms or relatively non-demanding "oddball" tasks. This paper will emphasize our recent ERP investigations with acute nicotine polacrilex (6 mg) administered to nonsmokers, and with a battery of ERP and behavioral performance paradigms focusing on intra- and inter-modal selective attention and distraction processes. These ERP findings of nicotine-augmented early attentional processing add support to the contention that nicotine may be be used by smokers as a "pharmacological tool" for tuning cognitive functions relating to the automatic and controlled aspects of sensory input detection and selection.

Changes in Performance Monitoring During Sensorimotor Adaptation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; MOTOR CONTROL; REWARD PREDICTION; NEURAL SYSTEM; ARM MOVEMENTS	Anguera JA, Seidler RD, Gehring WJ. Changes in performance monitoring during sensorimotor adaptation. J Neurophysiol 102: 1868-1879, 2009. First published July 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00063.2009. Error detection and correction are essential components of motor skill learning. These processes have been well characterized in cognitive psychology using electroencephalography (EEG) to record an event-related potential (ERP) called error-related negativity (ERN). However, it is unclear whether this ERP component is sensitive to the magnitude of the error made in a sensorimotor adaptation task. In the present study, we tested the function of error-related activity in a visuomotor adaptation task. To examine whether error size is reflected in the ERP, two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to either a small (30 degrees) or large (45 degrees) rotation of the visual feedback display. Each participant's trials were sorted into large and small error trials using a median split to examine potential error magnitude waveform differences. We also examined these trial types at the early and late stages of adaptation. There were no group differences for the behavioral or neural measures; however, waveforms from large error trials were significantly different from small error trials. The waveforms also changed as a function of practice as early adaptation waveforms were larger than late adaptation waveforms. The observed ERP component reflected differences in error magnitude with the amount of activity corresponding to the size of the error. Movement monitoring potentials likely affected the frequency and time course of the waveform so that it did not resemble the typical ERN; however, error-related activity was still distinguishable. The present findings are discussed in terms of current theories of the ERN as well as skill acquisition.

Glucose modulates event-related potential components of recollection and familiarity in healthy adolescents	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Recognition memory; Glucose; Event-related potentials; Adolescents	VERBAL EPISODIC MEMORY; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; BLOOD-GLUCOSE; FACILITATION; RETRIEVAL; ATTENTION; AGE	Behavioural evidence supports the notion that oral glucose ingestion enhances recognition memory judgements based on recollection, but not familiarity. The present study sought to clarify and extend upon these behavioural findings by investigating the influence of glucose administration on event-related potential (ERP) components that are thought to be differentially mediated by recollection and familiarity processes in healthy adolescents. In a within-subjects design, participants performed a recognition memory task, during which time electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, subsequent to ingestion of either (a) glucose or (b) placebo in a counterbalanced order. Response times during the recognition memory task were observed to be faster for the glucose condition, relative to a placebo control. Further, glucose ingestion was associated with an enhanced left parietal old/new ERP effect (a marker of recollection) and an enhanced mid-frontal old/new ERP effect (known to be mediated by familiarity). These findings (a) support the results of previous research that the 'glucose memory facilitation effect' can be extended to healthy adolescents, but (b) suggest that glucose enhances both the recollection and familiarity components of recognition memory. The observed ERP profile has important implications for the proposal that glucose specifically targets the hippocampus in modulating cognitive performance.

The amplitude of the P300 component in event-related potentials (ERPs) has been shown to be sensitive to the category (target vs. nontarget) of the eliciting stimulus, its overall probability, and the preceding stimulus sequence. In the present study we further specify the functional underpinnings of the prolonged microsaccadic inhibition in the visual oddball task, showing that the stimulus category, the frequency of a stimulus, and the preceding stimulus sequence influence microsaccade rate. Furthermore, by co-recording ERPs and eye movements, we were able to demonstrate that, despite being largely sensitive to the same experimental manipulation, the amplitude of P300 and the microsaccadic inhibition predict each other only weakly.

Here, we investigated whether noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from the human PPC can be used to decode intended movement direction. To this end, we recorded whole-head EEG with a delayed saccade-or-reach task and found direction-related modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the PPC. Using parietal EEG components extracted by independent component analysis (ICA), we obtained in average accuracy of 80.25% on four subjects in binary single-trial EEG classification (left versus right). These results show that ill the PPC, neuronal activity associated with different movement directions call be distinguished using EEG recording and might, thus, be used to drive a noninvasive brain-machine interface (BMI).

A backward masking procedure was performed while high-density EEG recordings were carried out. Subjects were asked to detect a familiar face, presented at durations that varied parametrically between 16 and 266 ms. ERPs were computed and awareness was assessed using a sensitivity measure from signal detection theory (d'). Modifications in the electrical scalp topographies were found to reflect visual awareness of the stimulus. In particular, an early map topography was found to emerge progressively around 230 ms, showing a pattern of increase similar to the measure of visual awareness. This was followed by an increase in duration of a second, P300-like map. Source localisation for the early awareness-related topography revealed the activation of a distributed network of brain areas including frontal and temporo-occipital regions. Our results suggest that conscious experience emerges in parallel with the activation of a specific neural network that occurs in a time window beginning from about 200 ms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive Network Interactions and Beta 2 Coherence in Processing Non-Target Stimuli in Visual Oddball Task	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Intra-cerebral EEG recording in humans; Event-related potential; Oddball task; Beta coherence; Binding in cognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARADIGM; P300; LATENCY; TARGET	Spatiotemporal dynamics of event-related potentials (ERP) evoked by non-target stimuli in a visual oddball experiment and the presence of coherent oscillations in beta 2 frequency band of decomposed EEG records from peristimulus period were investigated by means of intracranial electrodes in humans. Twenty-one patients with medically intractable epilepsy participated in the study. The EEG signal was recorded using platinum electrodes implanted in several cortical and subcortical sites. Averaged 2 s EEG records were analyzed. Task-specific EEG changes were found in each patient, ERPs were derived from 92 electrodes used (96 % of possible cases). In the majority of analysed cases, ERPs were composed of several distinct components, and their duration was mostly longer than 1 s. The mean onset of the first ERP component was 158 +/- 132 ms after the stimulus (median 112 ms, minimum value 42 ms, maximum value 755 ms), and large variability of these onset times was found in all the investigated structures. Possible coherence between neural activities of remote brain sites was investigated by calculating running correlations between pairs of decomposed EEG records (alpha, beta 1, beta 2 frequency bands were used, total number of correlated pairs was 662 in each frequency band). The record pairs exhibiting highly correlated time segments represented 23 % of all the investigated pairs in alpha band, 7 % in beta 1 band, and 59 % in beta 2 band. In investigated 2 s record windows, such segments were distributed evenly, i.e. they were also found before the stimulus onset. In conclusion, the results have implicated the idea that a lot of recorded ERPs was more or less by-products of chance in spreading a signal within the neuronal network, and that their functional relevance was somewhat linked with the phenomenon of activity synchronization.

The purpose of the present research was to develop a paradigm to measure 3D visual fatigue using background EEG and ERP signals. We have developed "3D oddball paradigm" that revealed the effect of binocular parallax and presentation duration on 3D visual fatigue. Subjective 3D visual fatigue was also measured. Power of beta frequencies increased as watching duration increased and it was much stronger in 3D rather than in 2D condition. More importantly, P700 delayed as watching duration increased as well as in 3D rather than in 2D condition. Similar pattern of results was obtained in the measured subjective 3D visual fatigue. These results suggest that the 3D oddball paradigm would measure 3D visual fatigue correctly and reliably.

Event-related potential (ERP) data indicate differences between experts and laypersons in making aesthetic judgments at three different processing stages. Additionally, effects of expertise on ERP components that have previously been proven to be sensitive to musical training were replicated.

This mixing process decreases the sensitivity of voxel-by-voxel prediction of hemodynamic activation by the EEG when multiple sources contribute to either the predictor and/or the response variables. In order to address this problem, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to recover maps from the fMRI and timecourses from the EEG, and matched these components across the modalities by correlating their trial-to-trial modulation. The analysis was implemented as a group-level ICA that extracts a single set of components from the data and directly allows for population inferences about consistently expressed function-relevant spatiotemporal responses. We illustrate the utility of this method by extracting a previously undetected but relevant EEG-fMRI component from a concurrent auditory target detection experiment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

An enormous literature with findings of abnormal central processing in psychiatric diseases has been acquired during the last decades. However, the benefit of this research has been limited in part due to the unresolved problem of precise and correct localization of the underlying neural generators. The difficulty of correct localization is due to the fact that different constellations of cortical neuroelectric generators can produce identical EEG activity. Therefore, even concerning several major event related potentials no generally accepted knowledge about their cerebral generation exists. While correct localization can easily be obtained by imaging methods based on hemodynamic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), these techniques can not distinguish between different aspects of neural activity such as oscillation modes or stages of information processing that are only some milliseconds apart. Accordingly, the integration of simultaneous measurements of EEG and fMRI has become a methodological key issue today. EEG-fMRI may prove to be crucial in providing much deeper understanding of brain activity over the next decades. This review summarizes the basic physiology, methodological issues and interesting applications in psychiatry.

In an effort to differentiate components that are sensitive to emotional versus neutral stimuli, the current study utilized temporospatial principal components analysis to analyze ERPs from a large sample (N=82) while pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant images were passively viewed. Several factors sensitive to emotional stimuli were identified-corresponding to the N1, early posterior negativity (EPN), and P3; multiple factors resembling the late positive potential (LPP) emerged. Results indicate that the N1 represents the earliest component modulated by emotional stimuli; the EPN and the LPP represent unique components; the scalp-recorded LPP appears to include a P3-like positivity as well as additional positivities at occipital and central recording sites.

Using a variety of event-related potential (ERP) measures, several parameters such as onset, offset, contrast and velocity have been investigated, while a critical aspect of visual motion, that of direction, has received less attention. Here we used multichannel electroencephalography and distributed source localization to study brain activity for different directions of visual motion using random dot stimuli. Our data reveal differential extrastriate activation at 164-226 ms after motion onset that coded for motion direction with different ERP maps and underlying electrical generators for each tested direction. This activation was paralleled initially (164-186 ms) by a distinct extrastriate activation encoding whether the motion stimulus consisted of directed motion stimuli (as above) or contained undirected incoherent motion (control stimulus). Application of a linear inverse solution localized the brain activity for each tested motion direction to distinct brain regions within the same larger network of extrastriate brain regions. These regions included bilateral temporo-occipital and bilateral parieto-occipital cortex. The present data in healthy subjects are compatible with extrastriate activity that is tuned to different directions of visual motion. This extends previous clinical data and suggests the presence of distributed macroscopic motion direction tuning in primate extrastriate cortex that may complement the classical microscopic motion tuning at the columnar level.

Incremental learning has been widely investigated to deal with large datasets. To solve the problem of data growing over time in cross session studies, we apply an incremental learning support vector machines (SVM) method on single-trial ERP detection for identifying targets in satellite images. We implement the incremental learning SVM by keeping only the support vectors, instead of all the data, from the previous sessions and incorporating them with the data of the current session. Thus the incremental learning dramatically reduces the computational load. The results demonstrate that the incremental learning ERP detection system performs as well as the naive method, which uses only the current training session, and the batch mode, which uses all training data. Furthermore, it is more computationally efficient, which allows it to better cope with a continuous stream of EEG data.

Low-frequency EEG oscillations associated with information processing in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Delta; Theta; Oscillations; Schizophrenia; Go/no-go	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; PHASE-RESET; BRAIN; P300; DEFICIT; DELTA; POWER	Numerous studies have described attenuated event-related potential (ERP) component amplitudes in schizophrenia (e.g., P300, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Error Negativity/Error-Related Negativity (Ne/ERN)). Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI) studies have typically shown decreased recruitment of diverse brain areas during performance of tasks that elicit the above ERP components. Recent research suggests that phase-resetting of slow-oscillations (e.g., in the delta and theta bands) underlies the potentials observed in ERP averages. Several studies have reported that slow-oscillations are increased in amplitude in people with schizophrenia at rest. Few studies have examined event-related low-frequency oscillations in schizophrenia. We examined event-related evoked and induced delta and theta activity in 17 people with schizophrenia and 17 healthy controls in two go/no-go task variants. We analyzed stimulus-related and response-related oscillations associated with correct-hits, correct-rejects and false-alarms. Our results reveal a pattern of reduced delta and theta activity for task-relevant events in schizophrenia. The findings indicate that while low-frequency oscillations are increased in amplitude at rest, they are not coordinated effectively in schizophrenia during various information processing tasks including target-detection, response-inhibition and error-detection. This slow-oscillation coordination abnormality may help explain the decreased recruitment of brain areas seen in fMRI studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERN) were recorded while 14 OCD patients and 14 age-, sex-, handedness-, and educational level-matched healthy control subjects performed recognition tasks for spoken words (items) or for the voice of the speaker of spoken words (sources). In the item memory task, both groups showed ERP old/new effects at 300-700 ms. In the source memory task, the controls showed ERP old/new effects at 400-700 ms, whereas the OCD patients did not. Compared with the controls, the OCD patients showed significantly lower source accuracy and prolonged reaction times to the old words with accurate voice judgments. There were no differences between the OCD and control groups with regard to the locations of the ERP generators elicited by source correct and correct rejection conditions. The OCD patients showed significantly altered hemispheric asymmetry of ECD power in the frontal lobe during source memory retrieval, compared with the controls. These results indicate that OCD patients have preserved item memory about content, but impaired Source memory about context. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG phase reset due to auditory attention: an inverse time-scale approach	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG phase reset; auditory attention; inverse transform; time-scale; wavelet phase stability	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CONTRIBUTES; GENERATION; COMPONENTS; MECHANISMS	We propose a novel tool to evaluate the electroencephalograph (EEG) phase reset due to auditory attention by utilizing an inverse analysis of the instantaneous phase for the first time. EEGs were acquired through auditory attention experiments with a maximum entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that is associated with auditory attention (6-10 Hz, termed as theta-alpha border) was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEGs. The inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is necessary to generate the event-related potential (ERP). Power spectrum analysis shows a remarkable increase of evoked power but little change of total power after stabilizing the phase of EEGs. Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles attention data. These results show strong connections between EEGs and ERP, in particular, we suggest that the presentation of an auditory stimulus triggers the phase reset process at the theta-alpha border which leads to the emergence of the N100 wave. It is concluded that our study reinforces other studies on the importance of the EEG in ERP genesis.

Advanced data acquisition technology in conjunction with novel statistical methods holds the key to future progress in this area. Recent studies have applied Granger causality to multivariate population recordings such as local field potential (LFP) or electroencephalography (EEG) in event-related paradigms. The aim is to reveal the detailed time course of stimuluselicited information transaction among various sensory and motor cortices. Presently, interdependency measures like coherence and Granger causality are calculated on ongoing brain activity obtained by removing the average event-related potential (AERP) from each trial. In this paper we point out the pitfalls of this approach in light of the inevitable occurrence of trial-to-trial variability of event-related potentials in both amplitudes and latencies. Numerical simulations and experimental examples are used to illustrate the ideas. Special emphasis is placed on the important role played by single trial analysis of event-related potentials in experimentally establishing the main conclusion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Microsaccades give rise to EMG eye muscle spikes that can distort the spectrum of the scalp EEG and mimic increases in gamma band power. Here we demonstrate that microsaccades are also accompanied by genuine and sizeable cortical activity, manifested in the EEG. In three experiments, high-resolution eye movements were corecorded with the EEG: during sustained fixation of checkerboard and face stimuli and in a standard visual oddball task that required the counting of target stimuli. Results show that microsaccades as small as 0.15 degrees generate a field potential over occipital cortex and midcentral scalp sites 100-140 ms after movement onset, which resembles the visual lambda response evoked by larger voluntary saccades. This challenges the standard assumption of human brain imaging studies that saccade-related brain activity is precluded by fixation, even when fully complied with. Instead, additional cortical potentials from microsaccades were present in 86% of the oddball task trials and of similar amplitude as the visual response to stimulus onset. Furthermore, microsaccade probability varied systematically according to the proportion of target stimuli in the oddball task, causing modulations of late stimulus-locked event-related potential (ERP) components. Microsaccades present an unrecognized source of visual brain signal that is of interest for vision research and may have influenced the data of many ERP and neuroimaging studies.

When coupled with the high spatial resolution of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), the combined techniques provide a powerful tool for neuroscience in the examination of brain abnormalities in major psychiatric illnesses. Over the last 20 years, our work has examined brain structure and function in schizophrenia. Both EEG and MRI measures have indicated profound abnormalities in schizophrenia within the temporal lobe, particularly marked over the left hemisphere. Our studies of patients first hospitalized due to psychosis revealed the early course of the disease to be characterized by progressive impairment and cortical gray matter reduction, most intense near the time of first hospitalization. Knowledge of those locations and brain signals affected early should help understand the basic physiological defect underlying this progression, with potential implications for new therapeutic interventions.

Role of beta 2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in auditory event-related potentials	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotine; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; EEG; Event-related potentials; Auditory gating; Knockout mice; Hippocampus	EVOKED POTENTIALS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; DOPAMINE DEPLETION; SMOKING-CESSATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; P50 SUPPRESSION; ALPHA-7 SUBUNIT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MICE; BRAIN	Nicotine improves sensory processing in schizophrenic individuals, as measured by changes in auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Nicotine administration also alters ERPs in mice by increasing the amplitude and gating of the P20 ERP component while decreasing the amplitude of the N40 ERP component. Less is known about the role of specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. In this study, we examined whether nAChRs containing the beta 2 subunit contribute to nicotine's effects on auditory ERPs. We tested the effect of nicotine in wild-type mice and mice lacking the beta 2 nAChR subunit. Mice underwent stereotaxic implantation of stainless steel electrodes located in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, and 50 paired click stimuli were delivered during each drug condition. There was no significant difference in P20 or N40 amplitude or gating between genotypes during the control condition, suggesting that beta 2-containing receptors are not essential for the baseline auditory ERP response. Nicotine increased P20 amplitude and enhanced gating in wild-type and beta 2 knockout mice, but only decreased N40 amplitude in wild-type mice. There was no effect of nicotine on N40 gating in either genotype. beta 2-containing receptors are necessary for nicotine's effects on the N40 component of the mouse auditory ERP. These results suggest that beta 2-containing nAChRs modulate sensory processing and may serve as a therapeutic target in schizophrenic individuals.

Recently, we described such a methodology (event-related potential technique [ERP]) based on recording of p300 electroencephalography (EEG) waves elicited by auditory stimuli during synchronous exposure to erotic films. To compare sexual interest of sexually healthy women to females with sexual dysfunction (FSD) using ERP, and to explore whether FSD women with and without HSDD would respond differently to two different types of erotic stimuli-films containing (I) or not containing (NI) sexual intercourse scenes. Twenty-two women with FSD, of which nine had HSDD only, and 30 sexually healthy women were assessed by the Female Sexual Functioning Index. ERP methodology was performed applying erotic NI or I films. Significant differences in percent of auditory p300 amplitude reduction (PR) in response to erotic stimuli within and between all three groups for each film type. PRs to each film type were similar in sexually healthy women (60.6% +/- 40.3 (NI) and 51.7% +/- 32.3 [I]), while in women with FSD, reduction was greater when viewing the NI vs. I erotic films (71.4% +/- 41.0 vs. 37.7% +/- 45.7; P = 0.0099). This difference was mainly due to the greater PR of the subgroup with HSDD in response to NI vs. I films (77.7% +/- 46.7 vs. 17.0% +/- 50.3) than in the FSD women without HSDD group or the sexually healthy women (67.5% +/- 38.7 vs. 50.4% +/- 39.4 respectively), P = 0.0084. For comparisons, we used the mixed-model one-way analysis of variance. Differences in neurophysiological response patterns between sexually healthy vs. sexually dysfunctional females may point to a specific inverse discrimination ability for sexually relevant information in the subgroup of women with HSDD. These findings suggest that the p300 ERP technique could be used as an objective quantitative tool for libido assessment in sexually dysfunctional women.

Neural processes involved in these spontaneous facial reactions remain largely unknown. Here we concurrently recorded EEG and facial EMG in 15 participants watching short movie clips displaying either happy or angry facial expressions. EMG activity was recorded for the zygomaticus major (ZM) that elevates the lips during a smile, and the corrugator supercilhi (CS) that knits the eyebrows during a frown. We found increased EMG activity of CS in response to angry expressions, and enhanced EMG activity of ZM for happy expressions, replicating earlier EMG studies. More importantly, we found that the amplitude of an early visual evoked potential (right PI) was larger when ZM[ activity to happy faces was high, and when CS activity to angry faces was high, as compared to when muscle reactions were low. Conversely, the amplitude of right N170 component was smaller when the intensity of facial imitation was high. These combined EEG-EMG results suggest that early visual processing of face expression may determine the magnitude of subsequent facial imitation, with dissociable effects for PI and N170. These findings are discussed against the classical dual-route model of face recognition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acute dopamine depletion with branched chain amino acids decreases auditory top-down event-related potentials in healthy subjects	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Dopamine depletion; Branched chain amino acid (BCAA); Attention; Top-down processing; Event-related potentials (ERP); Schizophrenia	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TYROSINE DEPLETION; PHENYLALANINE DEPLETION; RECENT-ONSET; PERFORMANCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POLYMORPHISM	Cerebral dopamine homeostasis has been implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes and is of great pathophysiological importance in schizophrenia. A novel approach to study cognitive effects of dopamine is to deplete its cerebral levels with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) that acutely lower dopamine precursor amino acid availability. Here, we studied the effects of acute dopamine depletion on early and late attentive cortical processing. Auditory event-related potential (ERP) components N2 and P3 were investigated using high-density electroencephalography in 22 healthy male subjects after receiving BCAAs or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Total free serum prolactin was also determined as a surrogate marker of cerebral dopamine depletion. Acute dopamine depletion increased free plasma prolactin and significantly reduced prefrontal ERP components N2 and P3. Subcomponent analysis of N2 revealed a significant attenuation of early attentive N2b over prefrontal scalp sites. As a proof of concept, these results strongly suggest that BCAAs are acting on basic information processing. Dopaminergic neurotransmission seems to be involved in auditory top-down processing as indexed by prefrontal N2 and P3 reductions during dopamine depletion. In healthy subjects, intact early cortical top-down processing can be acutely dysregulated by ingestion of BCAAs. We discuss the potential impact of these findings on schizophrenia research.

As a consequence, such high-density ERP mapping yields fairly dense ERP data sets that are often hard to analyze comprehensively or to relate straightforwardly to specific cognitive or emotional processes, because of the richness of the recorded signal in both the temporal (millisecond time-resolution) and spatial (multidimensional topographic information) domains. Principal component analyses (PCA) and topographic analyses (combined with distributed source localization algorithms) have been developed and successfully used to deal with this complexity, now offering powerful alternative strategies for data-driven analyses in complement to more traditional ERP analyses based on waveforms and peak measures. In this paper, we first briefly review the basic principles of these approaches, and then describe recent ERP studies that illustrate how they can inform about the precise spatio-temporal dynamic of emotion processing. These studies show that the perception of emotional visual stimuli may produce both quantitative and qualitative changes in the electric field configuration recorded at the scalp level, which are not apparent when using conventional ERP analyses. Additional information gained from these approaches include the identification of a sequence of successive processing stages that may not fully be reflected in ERP waveforms only, and the segregation of multiple or partly overlapping neural events that may be blended within a single ERP waveform. These findings highlight the added value of such alternative analyses when exploring the electrophysiological manifestations of complex and distributed mental functions, as for instance during emotion processing.

We examined 21 patients with MDD in partial remission and 21 age-, sex-, and education matched healthy controls using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed a hybrid flanker Go/Nogo task while multichannel EEG was recorded. Two ERP components were of interest which repeatedly have been linked to response inhibition: the Nogo-N2 and the Nogo-P3 which can be observed in Nogo trials of a Go/Nogo task. MDD patients showed a specifically reduced Nogo-P3 while the Nogo-N2 and the P3b in Go trials were unaffected. These results provide further evidence of impaired response monitoring and control processes in patients with MDD. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Each space-time event is represented using a basis function expansion which reflects the most relevant (or measurable) features of the signal. This model of neural activity leads naturally to a Bayesian likelihood function which balances the model fit to the data with the complexity of the model, where the complexity is related to the number of included events. A novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm which maximizes the likelihood function is presented. The new method is shown to be effective on several MEG simulations of neurological activity as well as data from a self-paced finger tapping experiment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Effects of Low Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on Gamma Frequency Oscillations and Event-Related Potentials During Processing of Illusory Figures in Autism	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Review						Autism; Minicolumns; Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Gamma frequencies	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; WEAK CENTRAL COHERENCE; DOUBLE BOUQUET CELL; MINICOLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BAND ACTIVITY; DOUBLE-BLIND; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION	Previous studies by our group suggest that the neuropathology of autism is characterized by a disturbance of cortical modularity. In this model a decrease in the peripheral neuropil space of affected minicolumns provides for an inhibitory deficit and a readjustment in their signal to noise bias during information processing. In this study we proposed using low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a way increasing the surround inhibition of minicolumns in autism. Thirteen patients (ADOS and ADI-R diagnized) and equal number of controls participated in the study. Repetitive TMS was delivered at 0.5 Hz, 2 times per week for 3 weeks. Outcome measures based on event-related potentials (ERP), induced gamma activity, and behavioral measures showed significant post-TMS improvement. The results suggest that rTMS offers a potential therapeutic intervention for autism.

To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of event-related brain responses, Most studies rely on across-trial averaging in the time domain, a procedure that is, however, blind to a significant fraction of the elicited cortical activity. Here, we outline the key concepts underlying the limitations of time-domain averaging and consider three alternative methodological approaches that have received increasing interest: time-frequency decomposition of the EEG (using the continuous wavelet transform), blind source separation of the EEG (using Independent Component Analysis) and the analysis of event-related brain responses at the level of single trials. In addition we provide practical guidelines on the implementation of these methods and on the interpretation of the results they produce. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Iannetti, G.

Participants monitored an RSVP sequence for a given target letter that could appear in upper- or lowercase. Prior to the sequence, a cue indicated the most likely color of the target letter. Replicating E. Vierck and J. Miller (2005), upper-/lowercase discrimination accuracy was higher following valid than invalid color cues. Within the ERPs, the target onset produced a negative component between 150 and 350 ms at occipital sites, with shorter latencies following valid than invalid cues. We also found larger amplitude components for valid than invalid color cues at central and parietal sites between 150 and 325 ms. The results not only demonstrate clear effects of color cuing on both behavior and ERPs but also suggest that the observed ERP differences between valid versus invalid trials mediate the behavioral effects.

The spelling system, where letters in a matrix were coded with acoustically presented numbers, was tested on a group of healthy volunteers. The results were compared with a visual spelling system. Nine of the 13 participants presented with the auditory ERP spelling system scored above a predefined criterion level control for communication. Compared to the visual spelling system, users' performance was lower and the peak latencies of the auditorily evoked ERPs were delayed. It was concluded that auditorily evoked ERPs from the majority of the users could be reliably classified. High accuracies were achieved in these users, rendering item selection with a BCI based on auditory stimulation feasible for communication.

We studied "ramp-like" components in which the true ERP increases or decreases monotonically, except for noise. If the growth rates of such components vary across participants, the jackknife-based measure can easily have only 10%-20% as much error variance as the traditional method, and this advantage is magnified with more participants. We also studied boolean AND-shaped or "bump-like" components. Jackknifing generally yielded smaller error variances with these components too, especially when the component's peak amplitude varied across participants, but less so if the component's peak latency varied. These results help illuminate the reasons for the superiority of jackknife-based onset latency measures over traditional measures in recent simulations.

Response inhibition in borderline personality disorder: event-related potentials in a Go/Nogo task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						response inhibition; event-related potentials; Nogo-N2; Nogo-P3; borderline personality disorder	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; ERROR-DETECTION; ERP COMPONENTS; GO; CONFLICT; STIMULUS; P300; SCHIZOPHRENIA; TOMOGRAPHY	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been related to a dysfunction of anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex and has been associated clinically with impulsivity, affective instability, and significant interpersonal distress. We examined 17 patients with BPD and 17 age-, sex-, and education matched control participants with no history of Axis I or II psychopathology using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed a hybrid flanker-Go/Nogo task while multichannel EEG was recorded. Our study focused on two ERP components: the Nogo-N2 and the Nogo-P3, which have been discussed in the context of response inhibition and response conflict. ERPs were computed on correct Go trials (button press) and correct Nogo trials (no button press), separately. Groups did not differ with regard to the Nogo-N2. However, BPD patients showed reduced Nogo-P3 amplitudes. For the entire group (n = 34) we found a negative correlation with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-10) and Becks's depression inventory (BDI). The present study is the first to examine Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 in BPD and provides further evidence for impaired response inhibition in BPD patients.

Common procedure of analysis of the event-related potentials (ERPs) averaged for a group of subjects has soiree drawbacks because of the ERP interindividual variability. Therefore in our work, we determined parameters of the auditory ERP components selectively summed up for individual subjects in different series of a psychomotor test with their subsequent group analysis. Search for the ERP parameters which would allow us to quantitatively estimate brain functional states during performance errors associated with a decrease in the level of wakefulness and falling asleep was the aim of our work. The ERPs were recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 41) in the evening from eight EEG derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02) in reference to a linked mastoid electrode. The analysis was performed in 14 subjects with a sufficient number of falling asleep episodes. A monotonous psychomotor test was performed in a supine position with the eyes closed. The test consisted of two alternating series: calculation of sound stimuli from 1 up to 10 with simultaneous pressing the button and calculation from 1 up to 5 without pressing the button and so on. Computer-generated sound stimuli (50-ms pulses with the frequency of 1000 Hz, 60 dB HL) were presented binaurally through earphones with interstimulus intervals in 2.4-2.7 s. Comparison of the ERP parameters (latency and amplitude of components N1, P2, N, and P3) during correct and erroneous performance of the psychomotor test showed that a decrease in the level of wakefulness caused a statistically significant increase in the amplitude of components of vertex complex N1-P2-N2 in series without pressing the button. The greatest changes in the ERPs in different series of the psychomotor test were observed for component N2 (latency 330-360 ms), which has the common origin with the EEG theta rhythm and is characteristic of the first sleep stage.

However, the formal computational processes underlying the generation of the P300 are not well known. Here, we formulate a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on Information Theory. Specifically, we modeled the surprise associated with the occurrence of a visual stimulus to provide a formal quantification of the "subjective probability" associated with an event. Subjects performed a choice reaction time task, while we recorded their brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG). In each of 12 blocks, the probabilities of stimulus occurrence were changed, thereby creating sequences of trials with low, medium, and high predictability. Trial-by-trial variations in the P300 component were best explained by a model of stimulus-bound surprise. This model accounted for the data better than a categorical model that parametrically encoded the stimulus identity, or an alternative model of surprise based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The present data demonstrate that trial-by-trial changes in P300 can be explained by predictions made by an ideal observer keeping track of the probabilities of possible events. This provides evidence for theories proposing a direct link between the P300 component and the processing of surprising events. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how model-based analyses can be used to explain significant proportions of the trial-by-trial changes in human event-related EEG responses.

In the present study, healthy subjects without history of DSM-IV Axis I or II psychopathology were examined. Impulsiveness was determined by calculating individual reaction times (as a function of general response speed) in order to split the entire group (n = 26) in a subgroup with a more controlled response style (low impulsiveness [LI] group; n = 13) and a subgroup with a more impulsive response style (high impulsiveness [HI] group; n = 13). Subjects performed a Go/Nogo task while a multi-channel EEG was recorded. Two event-related potentials (ERP) were of special interest: the Nogo-N2 and -P3 component. HI subjects had significantly reduced (less positive) Nogo-P3 amplitudes compared to LI subjects whereas groups did not differ with regard to the Nogo-N2. These results corroborate previous findings of reduced Nogo-P3 amplitudes in samples with enhanced levels of impulsiveness. Moreover, present data suggest that there is a broader range of impulsiveness even in healthy subjects which might mask or pronounce between-group differences in clinical studies. Therefore, different levels of impulsiveness in control groups should be carefully taken into account in further ERP studies.

We analyzed event-related brain potentials and affective responses to pictures depicting spiders, as well as generally fear-inducing, disgust-inducing, and neutral content, and compared them between 18 phobic and 18 nonphobic female participants. The patients rated the spider scenes as more fear- and disgust-inducing than the controls. This was accompanied by enhanced amplitudes of the P300 and the late positive potential (LPP). The other picture types elicited comparable electrocortical and affective responses in both groups. Separate group analyses showed that the patients were characterized by larger ERP positivity (P300, LPP) for phobic than for nonphobic material. Control subjects' P300s were equally enhanced for spider, disgust and fear pictures relative to neutral scenes. Their LPPs were smaller for spiders compared to disgust and fear. Taken altogether, motivated attention in emotional picture processing is reflected by P300 and LPP modulation.

EEG was recorded from 21 participants while they performed a visual object recognition test on a combination of unstudied items and old items that were previously encountered during either a 'deep' or 'shallow' levels-of-processing (LOP) study task. The results demonstrated a midline P150 old/new effect which was sensitive only to objects' old/new status and not to the accuracy of recognition responses to old items, or to the LOP manipulation. Similar outcomes were observed for the subsequent P200 and N400 effects, the former of which had a parietal scalp maximum and the latter, a broadly distributed topography. In addition an LPC old/new effect typical of those reported in past ERP recognition studies was observed. These outcomes support the proposal that the P150 effect is reflective of perceptual object priming and moreover, provide novel evidence that this and the P200 effect are independent of explicit recognition memory process(es).

To examine the neural mechanisms underlying this age-related effect, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during perceptual judgments of motion directions by younger and older adults in two experiments. When judging single-step motion, both younger and older adults evoked significantly larger ERP late positive component (LPC) responses to unambiguous motion compared to LPC responses elicited by ambiguous motion. In contrast, compared to the younger adults, the older adults evoked comparable but delayed ERP responses to single motion steps. In the second experiment the younger and older groups judged the directions of two successive motion-steps (either motion priming or motion reversals). Under short (200-400 ms) stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), the difference between the ERP responses to priming and reversal conditions was significantly larger for the younger than for the older adults. This study provides the first electrophysiological evidence that brain aging leads to delayed processing of single motion direction and visual motion priming as early as 100 ms in the early visual cortex. Age-related changes in strength and temporal characteristics of neural responses in temporal-parietal regions were particularly pronounced in older adults when successive motion signals are placed closely in time, within 400 ms.

Methods: Wave activity in the EEG was assessed during both an auditory Oddball and a visual continuous performance task (CPT) for an ADHD group ranging in age from 6 to 18 years and comprising mostly Combined and Inattentive subtypes, and for an age and gender matched control group. Results: The ADHD subjects had less wave activity at low frequencies (similar to 1 Hz) during both tasks. For auditory Oddball targets, this effect was shown to be related to smaller P3 ERP amplitudes. During CPT, the similar to 1 Hz wave activity in the ADHD subjects was inversely related to clinical and behavioral measures of hyperactivity and impulsivity. CPT wave activity at similar to 1 Hz was seen to "normalise" following treatment with stimulant medication. Conclusions: The results identify a deficit in low frequency wave activity as a new marker for ADHD associated with levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity. Significance: The marker is evident across a range of tasks and may be specific to ADHD. While lower similar to 1 Hz activity partly accounts for reduced P3 ERPs in ADHD, the effect also arises for tasks that do not elicit a P3. Deficits in behavioral inhibition are hypothesized to arise from underlying dysregulation of cortical inhibition.

Sixty-four channel ERP responses were recorded while participants classified items as "man-made" or "not man-made" in a repetition priming task. The two groups showed different ERP responses at frontal electrode sites after seeing a visual stimulus for 400-800 ms. The frontal late positive components (LPC) showed different habituation of ERP responses to new and studied repeated objects between high and low sensation seekers. Source localization analysis (LORETA) indicated that during visual stimulus adaptation the ventral prefrontal cortex showed lack of frontal involvement among high sensation seekers. Furthermore, frontal LPC latencies during repeated visual exposure correlated with boredom susceptibility and experience seeking subscales. The distinct profiles of brain responses to repeated visual experience in high and low sensation seekers provide evidence that individual differences in neural adaptation can be linked to personality dimensions.

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is an auditory ERP component elicited by infrequent (deviant) stimuli differing in some physical features from the repetitive frequent (standard) stimuli in a sound sequence. The MMN provides a sensitive measure for cortical auditory stimulus feature discrimination, regardless of attention and other contaminating factors. In this study, MMN responses to duration, intensity, frequency, and gap changes were recorded in healthy young adults (n = 17), using a multifeature paradigm including several types of auditory change in the same stimulus sequence, while a GSM mobile phone was placed on either ear with the EMF (902 MHz pulsed at 217 Hz; SAR(1g) = 1.14 W/kg, SAR(10g) = 0.82 W/kg, peak value = 1.21 W/kg, measured with an SAM phantom) on or off. An MMN was elicited by all deviant types, while its amplitude and latency showed no significant differences due to EMF exposure for any deviant types. In the present study, we found no conclusive evidence that acute exposure to GSM mobile phone EMF affects cortical auditory change detection processing reflected by the MMN.

Neural generators of ERPs linked with Necker cube reversals	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensation/perception; EEG/ERP; Cognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; ATTENTION; STIMULI; NOVELTY; TARGET	Multistable perception occurs when a single physical stimulus leads to two or more distinct percepts that spontaneously switch (reverse). Previous ERP studies have reported reversal negativities and late positive components associated with perceptual reversals. The goal of the current study was to localize the neural generators of the reversal ERP components in order to evaluate their correspondence with previous fMRI results and to better understand their functional significance. A Necker-type stimulus was presented for brief intervals while subjects indicated their perceptions. Local auto-regressive average source analyses and dipole modeling indicated that sources for the reversal negativity were located in inferior occipital-temporal cortex. Generators of the late positive component were estimated to reside in inferior temporal and superior parietal regions.

In a double-blind task design, subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. Before and after irradiation subjects were presented with a random series of 50 ms tone burst (frequent standards: 1 kHz, P=0.8, rare deviants: 1.5 kHz, P=0.2) at a mean repetition rate of 1500 ms while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The subjects' task was to silently count the appearance of targets. The amplitude and latency of the N100, N200, P200 and P300 components for targets and standards were analyzed in 29 subjects. We found no significant effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) irradiation on the amplitude and latency of the above ERP components. In order to study possible effects of EMF on attentional processes, we applied a wavelet-based time-frequency method to analyze the early gamma component of brain responses to auditory stimuli. We found that the early evoked gamma activity was insensitive to UMTS RF exposition. Our results support the notion, that a single 20 min irradiation from new generation 3G mobile phones does not induce measurable changes in latency or amplitude of ERP components or in oscillatory gamma-band activity in an auditory oddball paradigm.

The current study introduces a new linguistic task which (1) directly compares self-reference and other- reference, and (2) separates pre-reflective from reflective aspects of self-awareness. Twenty-six healthy volunteers evaluated trait adjectives in reference to the self or a close friend while a continuous 30-channel EEG was recorded. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used for statistical brain imaging. As expected, the direct comparison of self-reference to other-reference revealed the MPFC to be significant and strongly more active during the self-reference condition. Pre-reflective aspects of self seem to be implemented to a greater degree in the ventral, reflective aspects of the self in dorsal parts of the MPFC. In the pre-reflective self condition, brain areas that receive homeostatic afferents from somatic and visceral sensation of the body such as the insula and the somatosensory cortex were strongly activated as early as 134 ms after stimulus onset. The right inferior parietal lobe seems to be involved in self-referential processing in general. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the animal brain it has been shown that the phase of cortical oscillations is related to the exact timing of neural activity. The potential role of oscillatory phase and phase synchronization for the explanation of cortical information processing has been largely underestimated in the human EEG until now. Here it is argued that EEG phase (synchronization) reflects the exact timing of communication between distant but functionally related neural populations, the exchange of information between global and local neuronal networks, and the sequential temporal activity of neural processes in response to incoming sensory stimuli. Three different kinds of phase synchronization are discussed: (i) phase coupling between brain sites, (ii) phase synchronization across frequencies, and (iii) phase-locking to external events. In this review recent work is presented demonstrating that EEG phase synchronization provides valuable information about the neural correlates of various cognitive processes, and that it leads to a better understanding of how memory and attention Processes are interrelated.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of various regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy on the N1 and P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) in breast cancer patients 3-6 years after treatment. Methods: Fifty-three breast cancer patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens were compared to 23 stage I breast cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy. An auditory oddball task was used to study the amplitude, latency and structure of the potential field of the N1 and P3. Results: Patients treated with chemotherapy showed lower P3 amplitudes than patients not treated with chemotherapy. Differences were also observed in P3 latency between patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens. Conclusions: Our results indicate a general effect of all chemotherapy regimens under Study on P3 amplitude and a more specific chemotherapeutic effect on P3 latency. Significance: The present study provides evidence for the notion that different chemotherapy regimens have different effects on brain functioning.

This review focuses on the timing of neural activations related to attentional and sensory-motor functions in the somatosensory system as revealed by high-temporal resolution neuroimaging studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). We will briefly review basic concepts of EEG and MEG, and then EEG and MEG studies of attention and somatosensory-motor interaction while referring to previous studies using other techniques. Findings from patients with movement disorders will be also summarized. An overview of these studies shows that EEG and MEG are helpful to reveal cortical dynamics of attentional and sensory-motor processing in the human brain and potentially a powerful tool to evaluate the pathophysiology of relevant disorders.

The stimulation elicits a percept often described as metallic, sour or salty, also referred to as electric taste. To date, the neuronal mechanisms that underlie electric taste perception are not yet fully understood. Electroencephalographic (EEG) approaches will certainly complement behavioral procedures and, furthermore, extend the understanding of gustatory processing in general and disturbances of gustatory functions in particular. We used anodal pulses applied to the tip of the participants' tongue while EEG was recorded. The major disadvantage of combining EEG and EGM, namely the electrical stimulation artifact, was overcome by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which separated the EGM artifact from the neural portion of the EEG. After artifact correction, we found a largely uncontaminated electrogustatory event-related potential (eGERP) at both individual and group level. Furthermore, source analysis revealed an early involvement of bilateral insular cortices and the adjacent operculi, the areas comprising the primary taste cortex. The procedures, described in detail, pave the way for the eGERP to become an affordable and objective tool for the assessment of taste function, and thus to complement behavioral measures (i.e. EGM detection thresholds). Furthermore, they render the access to different levels of the electrogustatory processing pathway possible and by doing so they may aid the identification and localisation of lesions that cause taste disturbances.

The major questions were: (1) do ERPs differ between girls and boys aged 7-10 years, (2) do gender differences in ERPs depend on the development with age, on task-processing demands, and on the development of neuroelectric networks as reflected by the spontaneous EEG? Methods: Thirty-six healthy children (18 girls and 18 boys) were divided in two age groups (7- to 8- and 9- to 10-year-old). Boys and girls were pairwise matched for age. Auditory ERPs were analyzed in a passive listening condition (PLC), a simple reaction task (SRT) and a serial learning reaction task (SLRT), in which memory and sensorimotor processes were varied in a balanced way. Cognitive performance, reaction times (RTs), and the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) were also measured. Results: Cognitive performance improved earlier in girls than boys, whereas response speed was not affected by gender. Independent of processing demands, ERP components within 300 ins after stimulation (N1, P2, N2 and P3) increased with development only in the group of girls. For later components, the developmental speeding of the parietal P3b component to task-relevant stimuli also tended to be more expressed in girls than boys, whereas a late frontal negative wave N400-700 was shorter in the girls than boys from the two age groups. Likewise, independently of age, the spontaneous EEG manifested a larger theta activity in girls than boys. Conclusions: Developmental changes of basic auditory processing mechanisms strongly depend on gender in children between 7 and 10 years by being faster in girls. This gender-specific development of early ERP components is not modulated by processing demands, cannot be attributed to a faster cognitive maturation of girls, nor can it be explained with the gender-specific maturation of background neuroelectric networks. Rather, it reflects an accelerated functional activation of auditory processing networks in girls. Interestingly, the cognitive development was also faster in girls, but it occurred earlier than the functional activation of auditory processing networks. Significance: This study provides evidence for accelerated neuroelectric (as reflected by spontaneous EEG), neurofunctional (as reflected by auditory ERPs), and neurocognitive (as reflected by learning performance) development in 7- to 10-year-old girls than boys.

The present event-related potential (ERP) study compared the processing of self-initiated tones with the processing of externally-initiated but otherwise identical tones. In different conditions, frequency and onset of the sound were either predictable or unpredictable. The amplitudes of the NI component of the ERP for the self-initiated relative to the ones for externally-initiated sounds were significantly attenuated even when the particular frequency or sound onset could not be predicted by the subject. These results support internal forward model mechanisms which dynamically predict the sensorial consequences of ones own motor acts even in face of uncertainties with respect to the frequency of the sound and its onset. Moreover, the attenuation effect was reduced when the frequency was unpredictable suggesting that it is easier to discriminate a self-initiated sound with exact foreknowledge. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Eight naive subjects performed or kinesthetically imagined four movements while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 29 channels over sensorimotor areas. The task was instructed with a specific stimulus (SI) and performed at a second stimulus (S2). A classifier was trained and tested off-line at differentiating the EEG signals from movement/imagery preparation (the 1.5-s preceding movement/imagery execution). Results: Accuracy of movement/imagery preparation classification varied between subjects. The system preferentially selected event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) signals for classification, and high accuracies were associated with classifications that relied heavily on the ERD/ERS to discriminate movement/imagery planning. Conclusions: The ERD/ERS preceding movement and motor imagery can be used to predict which of the four movements/imageries is about to Occur. Prediction accuracy depends on this signal's accessibility. Significance: The ERD/ERS is the most specific pre-movement/imagery signal to the movement/imagery about to be performed.

Positions in the vertical meridian were cued in order to evaluate the cognitive consequences in the processing of the validly (VC) or invalidly cued (IC) targets. The behavioural responses and the 64 EEG channel were recorded. The late endogenous event-related potential (ERP) induced by target stimuli in VC and IC targets were compared in voltage amplitude, voltage and current source density topographies. The P3a and a late positive complex, possibly P3b were increased in a statistically significant manner in the IC targets with regard to the VC targets. The previous result suggests that subjects prepare to accomplish the task upon specification of the cue, and when the IC target appeared it is treated as a low probability stimulus in a similar manner to deviant stimuli in odd-ball paradigms.

Fluctuations in electrodermal activity reveal variations in single trial brain responses to painful laser stimuli - A fMRI/EEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Electroencephalography; Electrodermal activity; Galvanic skin reaction	SKIN-CONDUCTANCE; EVOKED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG-FMRI; PERCEPTION; HABITUATION; ACTIVATION; REPRESENTATION; INTENSITY; PARADIGM	Pain is a complex experience with sensory, emotional and cognitive aspects. It also includes a sympathetic response that can be captured by measuring the electrodermal activity (EDA). The present study was performed to investigate which brain areas are associated with sympathetic activation in experimental pain; an issue that has not been addressed with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) thus far. Twelve healthy subjects received painful laser stimulation to the left hand. The event-related fMRI BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) response was measured together with simultaneous EEG (electroencephalography) and EDA recordings. Laser stimuli induced the expected EDA response, evoked EEG potentials and BOLD responses. Single trial EDA amplitudes were used to guide further analysis of fMRI and EEG data. We found significantly higher BOLD responses in trials with high EDA vs. low EDA trials, predominantly in the insula and somatosensory cortex (S1/S2). Likewise, in the EEG we found the N2 laser evoked potentials to have significantly higher amplitudes in trials with high vs. low EDA. Furthermore EDA-informed BOLD modeling explained additional signal variance in sensory areas and yielded higher group level activation. We conclude that the sympathetic response to pain is associated with activation in pain-processing brain regions, predominantly in sensory areas and that single trial (EDA)-information can add to BOLD modeling by taking some of the response variability across trials and subjects into account. Thus, EDA is a useful additional, objective index when pain is studied with fMRI/EEG which might be of particular relevance in the context of genetic- and pharmacoimaging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We sorted the EEG data into 4 experimental conditions based on the combination of memory instruction and behavioral outcome: TBU (to-be-forgotten and forgotten), TBF_R (to-be-forgotten but remembered), TBR_R (to-be-remembered and remembered, i.e. hits) and correct rejections (CR). TBR_R trials elicited a typical old/new effect (similar to 500-750 ms poststimulus) over central and parietal regions. The TBU condition, however, elicited ERP that were more negative-going than ERP for CR (the reversed old/new effect). The latter may reflect the very effective inhibition of encoding and retrieval processes. This indicates that intentional processes leading to successful forgetting significantly influence brain activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to track the time course of these repetition processes, EEG was recorded while 12 healthy young subjects performed a long-term perceptual repetition priming task using faces and object drawings. Item repetition induced early (N170) and late (P300 and 400-600 Ins time-window) event-related potential (ERP) modulations. The N170 component was reduced in response to primed stimuli even with several hundred intervening items and this repetition effect was larger for objects than for faces. This early repetition effect may reflect the implicit retrieval of perceptual features. The late repetition effects showed enhanced positivity for primed items at centro-parietal, central and frontal sites. During this later time-window (400 and 600 ms at central and frontal sites), ERP repetition effects were more obvious at the left side for objects and at the right side for faces. ERP repetition effects were also larger for famous faces during this time-window. These later repetition effects may reflect deeper semantic processing and/or greater involvement of involuntary explicit retrieval processes for the famous faces. Taken together, these results suggest that among the implicit and explicit memory processes elicited by a perceptual priming task, some of them are modulated by the type of item which is repeated.

Sixteen healthy adults participated in the ERP experiment, and 11 adults in the ERF experiment. In different conditions, the participants focused their attention on a designated sound location or pitch, or pictures presented on a screen, in order to detect target sounds or pictures among the attended stimuli. In the Attend Location condition, the location of sounds varied randomly (left or right), while their pitch (high or low) was kept constant. In the Attend Pitch condition, sounds of varying pitch (high or low) were presented at a constant location (left or right). Consistent with previous ERP results, selective attention to either sound feature produced a negative difference (Nd) between ERPs to attended and unattended sounds. In addition, ERPs showed a more posterior scalp distribution for the location-related Nd than for the pitch-related Nd, suggesting partially different generators for these Nds. The ERF source analyses found no source distribution differences between the pitch-related Ndm (the magnetic counterpart of the Nd) and location-related Ndm in the superior temporal cortex (STC), where the main sources of the Ndm effects are thought to be located. Thus, the ERP scalp distribution differences between the location-related and pitch-related Nd effects may have been caused by activity of areas outside the STC, perhaps in the inferior parietal regions.

Since manual screening of human EEGs is inherently error prone and might induce experimental bias, automatic artifact detection is an issue of importance. Automatic artifact detection is the best guarantee for objective and clean results. We present a new approach, based on the time-frequency shape of muscular artifacts, to achieve reliable and automatic scoring. The impact of muscular activity on the signal can be evaluated using this methodology by placing emphasis on the analysis of EEG activity. The method is used to discriminate evoked potentials from several types of recorded muscular artifacts-with a sensitivity of 98.8% and a specificity of 92.2%. Automatic cleaning of EEG data is then successfully realized using this method, combined with independent component analysis. The outcome of the automatic cleaning is then compared with the Slepian multitaper spectrum based technique introduced by Delorme et al (2007 Neuroimage 34 1443-9).

Monosyllabic and bisyllabic words were presented to 34 young adults in the context of a semantic category judgment. The basic paradigm assessed the typicality effect, the tendency for classification of members of a category to be made more accurately and more rapidly for strong exemplars than for weak exemplars. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 30 active scalp electrodes. The ERP waveform in response to the semantic categorization of a word was characterized by unique activity in four temporal intervals; (1) a negative peak at a latency of about 100 ms, (2) a positive peak at a latency of about 200 ms, (3) a broad negativity extending over the latency range from 200 to 600 ms, and (4) a broad positivity extending from 600 to 1400 ms. Independent component analysis (ICA) of the individual EEG epochs yielded four maximally independent components, interpreted as (1) exogenous detection of a change in the acoustic environment, followed by allocation of cognitive resources, especially sustained attention, to the analysis of subsequent acoustic events, (2) phonological processing, (3) semantic processing, and (4) decision processing. The morphologies of the four ICA waveforms were consistent with a parallel processing, interactive model of word recognition, and subsequent semantic categorization.

For this purpose, 40-Hz amplitude modulated tones and a visual fixation cross were presented concurrently. By means of target detection tasks either on the sounds or on the fixation cross, participants' attention was directed to the respective modality. Attended sounds elicited a negative difference (Nd) in the ERP relative to unattended sounds. Nd was divided into an early and a late part as often observed for intramodal attention. Moreover, attention to the sounds led to a significant enhancement of the ASSR. This modulation of the ASSR by intermodal attention is demonstrated for the first time in the EEG. The present data suggest that ASSRs could provide a useful tool for the investigation of the neural dynamics of intermodal attentional processes.

Furthermore, activation of brain regions related to rapid eye movements during human REM sleep has been reported. Although recent brain imaging techniques have high spatial resolution, their temporal resolution is limited. Consequently, the spatio-temporal structures of brain activities related to rapid eye movement remain largely unknown. This article presents a short review of findings of recent studies that have used brain potentials related to rapid eye movement to examine dream image-generation processes. Brain potentials related to rapid eye movement are obtained using averaged electroencephalography (EEG) that is time-locked to the onset or offset of rapid eye movement. First, based on findings related to presaccadic and pre-REM brain potentials, we discuss why eyes move during REM sleep. Second, the relationship of lambda-like potentials, which occur immediately after the cessation of rapid eye movement, to generation of visual dream images, is discussed. Third, enhancement of gamma-band EEG activity occurring immediately after the offset of rapid eye movement is discussed in terms of information-binding of dream images. Finally in this review, preparatory activation of emotion and memory circuits before the onset of rapid eye movement is discussed in terms of contextual setting of the dream story.

In contrast, no EEG correlates have been identified related to the processing of monetary gains orpositive feedback. This result is puzzling considering the large number of brain regions involved in the processing of rewards. In the present study we used a gambling task to investigate this issue with trial-by-trial wavelet-based time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalographic signal recorded non-invasively in healthy humans. Using this analysis a mediofrontal oscillatory component in the beta range was identified which was associated to monetary gains. In addition, standard time-domain ERP analysis showed an MFN for losses that was associated with an increase in theta power in the time-frequency analysis. We propose that the reward-related beta oscillatory activity signifies the functional coupling of distributed brain regions involved in reward processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The SUD is a complex series of disorders with frequent comorbidities and EEG abnormalities of several types. EEG biofeedback has been employed in conjunction with other therapies and may be useful in enhancing certain outcomes of therapy. Based on published clinical studies and employing efficacy criteria adapted by the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, alpha theta training-either alone for alcoholism or in combination with beta training for stimulant and mixed substance abuse and combined with residential treatment programs, is probably efficacious. Considerations of further research design taking these factors into account are discussed and descriptions of contemporary research are given.

J	Kota, S; Gupta, L; Molfese, DL; Vaidyanathan, R				Kota, Srinivas; Gupta, Lalit; Molfese, Dennis L.; Vaidyanathan, Ravi			A Dynamic Channel Selection Strategy for Dense-Array ERP Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decision fusion; dense electrode arrays; dimensionality reduction; dynamic channel selection; event-related potentials (ERPs); spatiotemporal modeling	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BRAIN-INJURY; HEAD-INJURY; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NEGATIVITY; FUSION	The goal of this paper is to introduce a new strategy to accurately classify event-related potentials (ERPs), recorded using dense electrode arrays, into predefined brain activity categories. The challenge is to exploit the enhanced spatial information offered by dense arrays while overcoming the significant increase in the dimensionality problem introduced by the large increase in the number of channels. These conflicting objectives are achieved by introducing a spatiotemporal-array model to observe the dense-array ERP amplitude variations across channels and time, simultaneously. To account for latency variations and EEG noise in the array elements, each spatiotemporal element in the array is initially modeled as a Gaussian random variable. A two-step process that uses the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test and the Lilliefors test is formulated to select the array elements that have different Gaussian densities across all ERP categories. Selecting spatiotemporal elements that fit the assumed model and also statistically differ across the ERP categories not only ensures high classification accuracies but also decreases the dimensionality significantly. The selection is dynamic in the sense that selecting spatiotemporal-array elements corresponds to selecting ERP samples of different channels at different time instants. Each selected array element is classified using a univariate Gaussian classifier, and the resulting decisions are fused into a decision fusion vector that is classified using a discrete Bayes classifier. By converting an inherently multivariate classification problem into a simpler problem involving only univariate classifications, the dimensionality problem that plagues the design of practical multivariate ERP classifiers is circumvented. Consequently, classifiers can be designed to classify the ERPs that are unique to an individual without having to collect a prohibitively large ERP dataset from him/her. The application of the resulting dynamic-channel-selection-based classification strategy is demonstrated by designing and testing classifiers for eight subjects using ERPs from a Stroop color test and it is shown that the strategy yields high classification accuracies. Finally, it is noted that because of the generalized formulation of the strategy, it can be applied to various other problems involving the classification of multivariate signals acquired from multiple identical or multiple heterogeneous sensors.

Event-related potentials in semantic memory retrieval	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						left temporal lobe; object memory; EEG; features; categories; memory recall	OBJECT-RECALL; TEST SORT; COMPREHENSION; WORD; ORGANIZATION; IMPAIRMENTS; ACTIVATION; FEATURES; SYSTEM; CORTEX	The involvement of the left temporal lobe in semantics and object naming has been repeatedly demonstrated in the context of language comprehension; however, its role in the mechanisms and time course for the retrieval of an integrated object memory from its constituent features have not been well delineated. In this study, 19 young adults were presented with two features of an object (e.g., "desert" and "humps") and asked to determine whether these two features were congruent to form a retrieval of a specific object ("camel") or incongruent and formed no retrieval while event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. Beginning around 750 ms the ERP retrieval and nonretrieval waveforms over the left anterior fronto-temporal region show significance differences, indicating distinct processes for retrievals and nonretrievals. In addition to providing further data implicating the left frontal-anterior temporal region in object memory/retrieval, the results provide insight into the time course of semantic processing related to object memory retrieval in this region. The likely semantic process at 750 ms in this task would be coactivation of feature representations common to the same object. The consistency of this finding suggests that the process is stable across individuals. The potential clinical applications are discussed.

The extraction of such stimulus-unlocked components has been difficult owing to the unknown delays. Here, we propose a novel method to extract both of the two components from single-channel EEG epochs. In this method, we initially set random values for the delays and extract uncontaminated stimulus-locked and -unlocked components using the preset delays and a discrete Fourier transform. Then, we reconstruct the EEG by overlapping the extracted components with the preset delays, and calculate the residual errors between the reconstructed and original EEG. This procedure is repeated by updating the delays until the residual errors become adequately small. After verifying the performance of this method by two kinds of simulations with artificial and EEG data, we apply the method to EEG during NoGo trials of a Go/NoGo task, and obtain the stimulus-unlocked components, the magnitudes of which are comparable with those of the stimulus-locked components. By applying this method, it is possible to study internal and subjective brain activity, which occurs with variable delays. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study examined this question using the N2 event-related brain potential. It was predicted that threat stimuli will selectively influence the N2 for those showing elevated trait anxiety and that reduced N2 may reflect a compensatory process predicting better attention performance. EEG was recorded while 36 participants completed a cued flanker task with threat or nonthreat distracters. N2 amplitudes were greater to incongruent versus congruent flankers. Following threat, high trait anxious participants showed reduced modulation of the N2 by flanker type and greater N2 amplitudes to congruent flankers. Reduced N2 was associated with better attention performance. This study was among the first documenting the emotional modulation of the N2 related to the threat bias and its links with attention interference in anxiety.

Older adults (mean age 70) showed greater behavioral slowing than young adults (mean age 24) when the distractor face was incompatible with the target name. That this increased interference in the older adults was indeed associated with more distractor processing, was shown by the face-related N170 component of the EEG, which had greater amplitude in older adults when faces were unattended, but not when they were attended. These findings suggest a reduced ability to prevent distractor processing in old age. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using an uninformative peripheral cued Go/Nogo (commit/withdrawal response) task experiment, this study aimed to characterize the neural mechanism of IOR by studying not only the early event-related potentials (ERPs), P1 and N1, but also the late ERPs, Go/ Nogo-N2 and P3. Scalp topographies and LORETA showed that the changes in PI and N1, the cueing effects, were distributed mainly over the dorsal occipito-parietal areas, such as the bilateral middle occipital gyrus and the occipital portion of the cuneus. The changes in the late Nogo-N2 and P3 were distributed mainly over frontal-central areas, such as the right medial frontal gyrus. The Nogo-N2 was smaller and earlier in valid trials than in invalid trials, suggesting that the late component related to IOR was modulated by response preparation inhibition. The Nogo-P3 was larger and later in valid trials than in invalid trials, perhaps indicating that the control system (FEF) was free from an inhibitory marker in the cued locations. These data support a mechanism of IOR consisting of both sensory inhibition and response preparation inhibition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate possible alterations in selective attention, as an important constituent part of frontal brain function in ALS patients. A classical dichotic listening task paradigm was employed to assess event-related EEG potential (ERPs) indicators of selective attention as well as preattentive processing of mismatch, without interference by motor impairment. A total of 20 patients with sporadic ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria and 20 healthy controls were studied. Additionally a neuropsychological test battery of frontotemporal functions was applied. Compared with the controls, the ALS patients showed a distinct decrease of the fronto-precentral negative difference wave (Nd), i.e., the main ERP indicator of selective attention. Analysis of the P3 component of the ERPs indicated an increased processing of non-relevant stimuli in ALS patients confirming a reduced focus of attention. We conclude impaired selective attention reflects a subtle variant of frontotemporal dementia frequently observed in ALS patients at a relatively early stage of the disease.

EEGs were acquired through an auditory attention experiments with the highest entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that corresponds to auditory attention was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEG. Then the inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found a significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is needed to generate the event related potential (ERP). Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles the attention data. These results show direct connections between EEGs and ERPs and thus it is concluded that the phase reset of EEGs plays a very crucial role in the ERP generation.

This possibility has generated interest in experiments aiming to improve deficits in clinical settings, as well as deficits in the cognitive domain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the on-line effects of low frequency (I Hz) TMS on the EEG oscillatory activity in the healthy human brain, focusing particularly on the outcome of these modulatory effects in relation to the duration of the TMS stimulation. To this end, we used the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) approach to determine the patterns of oscillatory activity during two consecutive trains of sham and real TMS. Each train of stimulation was delivered to the left primary motor cortex (MI) of healthy subjects over a period of 10 min, while EEG rhythms were simultaneously recorded. Results indicated that TMS induced an increase in the power of brain rhythms that was related to the period of the stimulation, i.e. the synchronization of the a band increased with the duration of the stimulation, and this increase was inversely correlated with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude. In conclusion, low frequency TMS over primary motor cortex induces a synchronization of the background oscillatory activity on the stimulated region. This induced modulation in brain oscillations seems to increase coherently with the duration of stimulation, suggesting that TMS effects may involve short-term modification of the neural circuitry sustaining MEPs characteristics.

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the brain's response to stimuli, ICA allows the researcher to explore the factors that constitute the data and alleviates the need for explicit spatial and temporal priors about the responses. In this paper, we introduce ICA for hemodynamic (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) data processing, and one of the possible extensions to the population level that is available for both data types. We then selectively review some work employing ICA for the decomposition of EEG and fMRI data to facilitate the integration of the two modalities to provide an overview of what is available and for which purposes ICA has been used. An optimized method for symmetric EEG-fMRI decomposition is proposed and the outstanding challenges in multimodal integration are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Initially, ERP presence was examined in different brain areas. To accomplish that, 20 EEG channels were used, positioned according to the 10-20 international system. The grand average, resulting from 10 normal subjects showed, as expected, responses at frontal, central, and parietal areas, particularly evident at the central area (C3, C4, Cz). The MSC, applied to movement imagination related EEG signals, detected a consistent response in frequencies around 0.3-1 Hz (delta band), mainly at central area (C3, Cz, and C4). Ability differences in control imagination among subjects produced different detection performance. Some subjects needed up to 45 events for a detectable response, while for some others only 10 events proved sufficient. Some subjects also required two or three experimental sessions in order to achieve detectable responses. For one subject, response detection was not possible at all. However, due to brain plasticity, it is plausible to expect that training sessions (to practice movement imagination) improve signal-noise ratio and lead to better detection using MSC. Results are sufficiently encouraging as to suggest further exploration of MSC for future BCI application. Copyright (C) 2009 Sady Antonio Santos Filho et al.

The role of event related potentials in evaluation of subclinical cognitive dysfunction in epileptic patients	ACTA NEUROLOGICA BELGICA			English	Article							P300	Background/Aim : Cognitive dysfunction ill epileptic patients may develop due to the neurophysiological changes related to seizures or antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cognitive dysfunction ill epileptic patients under antiepileptic drug therapy by the aid of event related potentials. Method: P300 latencies were obtained from F-z, C-z and P-z electrod positions from both epileptic patients (n = 40) and age and sex matched control group (n = 40). Epileptic patients were, classified either idiopathic primary generalized (IPGE) (n = 9) or secondary generalized epilepsy (SGE) (n = 31) based oil the ILAE classification The effect of epilepsy hype, treatment types (monotherapy/polytherapy), daily dosages and serum levels of antiepileptic drugs, age at onset and EEG abnormalities oil P300 latencies were studied. Results : P300 latencies were longer ill the epileptics when compared to controls (P < 0.05). Besides, our results pointed out that P300 latencies were longer ill IPGE when compared to SGE (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was determined between ERP parameters neither ill monotherapy nor ill polytherapy groups (p > 0.05). Antiepileptic drug subgroups revealed variable effects on ERP latencies. Conclusion : We believe P300 latencies may have all important role in the evaluation of subclinical cognitive dysfunction in epileptic patients treated with antiepileptic drags.

The main reason for the absence of such an investigation is that MRI data acquisition generates major artifacts, which completely conceals the EEG signal. Recently, artifact removal algorithms have been developed. Our goal was to examine the validity of the face-selective ERP component N170 and its functional effects such as category selectivity and hemispherical laterality, when recorded simultaneously with functional MRI In our experiment, half of the scans were collected during fMRI acquisition and half without fMRI acquisition. The validity (of the N170 was then measured for its amplitude, latency, face selectivity (the difference between the amplitude to faces and objects), laterality (the difference between the amplitude to faces over the right and the left hemispheres) and the laterality of the face selectivity effect, by correlating these measures across subjects between data collected without fMRI and with fMRI data acquisition, after applying artifact removal procedures. We found high validity coefficients for all N170 measures. Furthermore, ERP data collected outside the scanner on a different day were highly correlated with data collected during MR acquisition for the N170 amplitude, latency, and selectivity index but moderate for laterality indices. Our study demonstrates that face-selective ERP effects are preserved in simultaneous recording with fMRI. These findings will hopefully encourage researchers to combine the two complementary neuroimaging techniques in future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Healthy controls and children with ADHD, PDD-NOS or symptoms of both disorders (PDD/HD) (n = 15 in each group) carried out a visual selective memory search task while their EEG was recorded from which event-related potentials were derived. Results: Compared to the control group, all patient groups made more omissions while hyperactive children also exhibited more false alarms. Regarding the process of WM-controlled search, significant group differences in ERP data were found between the control group and each of the clinical groups. Conclusions: The results point to less efficient WM-functioning in all patient groups. Whereas the clinical groups differed from each other at the behavioral level as measured by questionnaires, no distinction between the clinical groups could be made with respect to performance or ERP measures of WM capacity and selective attention. Significance: The results suggest that a possible differentiation in selectivity and working memory capacities between PDD-NOS and ADHD is hard to find. This may agree with clinical practice, where differential diagnosis is a subject of discussion. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Liu, ZM; He, B				Liu, Zhongming; He, Bin			fMRI-EEG integrated cortical source imaging by use of time-variant spatial constraints	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						multimodal neuroimaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; blood oxygen level dependent; electroencephalography; cortical source imaging; adaptive; Wiener filter; inverse problem	SKULL CONDUCTIVITY RATIO; HUMAN BRAIN-FUNCTION; ILL-POSED PROBLEMS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HIGH-RESOLUTION; IN-VIVO; SENSORY STIMULATION; BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; INTRINSIC SIGNAL	In response to the need of establishing a high-resolution spatiotemporal neuroimaging technique, tremendous efforts have been focused on developing multimodal strategies that combine the complementary advantages of high-spatial-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-temporal-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). A critical challenge to the fMRI-EEG/MEG integration lies in the spatial mismatches between fMRI activations and instantaneous electrical source activities. Such mismatches are fundamentally due to the fact that fMRI and EEG/MEG signals are generated and collected in highly different time scales. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical framework to solve the problem of fMRI-EEG integrated cortical source imaging. The new framework has two principal technical advancements. First, by assuming a linear neurovascular coupling, a method is derived to quantify the fMRI signal in each voxel as proportional to the time integral of the power of local electrical current during the period of event-related potentials (ERP). Second, the EEG inverse problem is solved for every time instant using an adaptive Wiener filter, in which the prior time-variant source covariance matrix is estimated by combining the quantified fMRI responses and the segmented EEG signals before response averaging. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed methods in terms of imaging the instantaneous cortical current density (CCD) distribution and estimating the source time courses with a millisecond temporal resolution. As shown in the simulation results, the instantaneous CCD reconstruction by using the proposed fMRI-EEG integration method was robust against both fMRI false positives and false negatives while retaining a spatial resolution nearly as high as that of fMRI. The proposed method could also reliably estimate the source waveforms when multiple sources were temporally correlated or uncorrelated, or were sustained or transient, or had some features in frequency or phase, or had even more complicated temporal dynamics. Moreover, applying the proposed method to real fMRI and EEG data acquired in a visual experiment yielded a time series of reconstructed CCD images, in agreement with the traditional view of hierarchical visual processing. In conclusion, the proposed method provides a reliable technique for the fMRI-EEG integration and represents a significant advancement over the conventional fMRI-weighted EEG (or MEG) source imaging techniques and is also applicable to the fMRI-MEG integrated source imaging.

Electrophysiological markers of skill-related neuroplasticity	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG; skill learning; neuroplasticity	MULTIPLICATION FACTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; POWER-LAW; MEMORY; AUTOMATIZATION; RECOLLECTION; VERIFICATION; ACTIVATION; DIFFICULTY; LANGUAGE	Neuroplasticity involved in acquiring a new cognitive skill was investigated with standard time domain event-related potentials (ERPs) of scalp-recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and frequency domain analysis of EEG oscillations looking at the event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) of neural activity. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded before and after practice, while participants performed alphabet addition (i.e., E + 3 = G, true or false?). Participant's performance became automated with practice through a switch in cognitive strategy from mentally counting-up in the alphabet to retrieving the answer from memory. Time domain analysis of the ERPs revealed a prominent positive peak at similar to 300 ms that was not reactive to problem attributes but was reduced with practice. A second prominent positive peak observed at similar to 500 ms was found to be larger after practice, mainly for problems presented with correct answers. Frequency domain spectral analyses yielded two distinct findings: (1) a frontal midline ERS of theta activity that was greater after practice, and (2) a beta band ERD that increased with problem difficulty before, but not after practice. Because the EEG oscillations were not phase locked to the stimulus, they were viewed as being independent of the time domain results. Consequently, use of time and frequency domain analyses provides a more comprehensive account of the underlying electrophysiological data than either method alone. When used in combination with a well-defined cognitive/behavioral paradigm, this approach serves to constrain the interpretations of EEG data and sets a new standard for studying the neuroplasticity involved in skill acquisition.

The difficulties of the problem reside essentially in the fact that traditional methods do not apply when observations are in a high dimensional space, which is a common case in biomedical engineering. Our objective is to propose new hypothesis tests that give p-values reflecting the reality of the efficacy criterion of drugs. Our test is based on a pattern recognition approach. We first study the stability of different training algorithms. We then exhibit a relationship between stability and power functions of the corresponding tests. We finally apply our method to test the efficacy of Lorazepam versus placebo to modify generators of brain activity.

Methods: We examined the time-course of visual ERP in response to the short (100ms) and prolonged (7 s) presentation of simple salient visual stimuli separated by long interstimulus intervals employing high-resolution 64-channel DG-EEG. Current Source density (CSD) mapping and spatio-temporal dipole source analysis were performed. Results: CSD analysis revealed highly significant bilateral Current sinks over occipito-temporal areas from about 450 ms up to 1 s after stimulus offset (visual N700). CSD topography and dipole source analysis suggested late prolonged activation of extrastriate visual areas which did not depend merely upon a stimulus offset response, afterimages or blinking, as confirmed by control conditions. Conclusions: Our findings provide basic knowledge about the time-course of sensory activation. We found that passive watching of rare salient short stimuli automatically evoked sustained activity in the extrastriate visual cortex up to I s after stimulus offset. Significance: Visual N700 provides a promising tool for important insights into the cortical mechanisms of stimulus post-processing. Its role in associative learning of temporally non-overlapping stimuli (automatic Ultra-short-term sensory memory) should be explored. (C) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: We recruited 19 patients with sporadic ALS (eight with limb-onset, 11 with bulbar-onset) and 19 controls. In addition to the mini-mental state examination and the Wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised, we assessed the frontal lobe function with Wisconsin card sorting test, Stroop test and trail making test. We used auditory 'oddball' counting paradigm for the ERPs under 20-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Global field power (GFP) was computed, and its peak amplitudes and latencies of N1/N2/P3 were determined. The results of ERP and neuropsychological tests were correlated with respiratory function and clinical scale. Results: No global cognitive impairment except for subtle frontal dysfunction was detected, although N1/N2/P3 GFP latencies were significantly prolonged in ALS patients than in the controls. Vital capacity correlated with P3 GFP amplitude, and the relative bulbar functional rating scale correlated with P3 GFP latency. Conclusions: Our findings indicated the presence of sub-clinical cognitive deficits in non-demented, sporadic ALS patients. In addition, clinical sub-types and respiratory function dependently influenced cognitive function in patients with sporadic ALS. Significance: ERP confirmed cognitive impairment in patients with sporadic ALS. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event-related delta oscillatory responses of Alzheimer patients	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						alzheimer; delta; dementia; event-related potentials; oscillations; P300; visual	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; POTENTIALS; RHYTHMS; TASK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DEMENTIA; DISEASE	Background and purpose: Alzheimer type of dementia (AD) is the most common neuropsychiatric morbidity in elderly individuals. Event-related oscillations (ERO) provide an useful tool for detecting subtle abnormalities of cognitive processes with high temporal resolution. Methods: In the present report, event-related oscillations of patients with AD were analyzed by using a visual oddball paradigm. A total of 22 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and 20 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy control subjects were compared. AD group consisted from 11 untreated patients and 11 patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitor. Oscillatory responses were recorded from 13 scalp electrodes. Results: Significant differences in delta frequency range were seen between the groups by using repeated measures of ANOVA analysis [F(9.120) = 2.228; P = 0.022]. Post-hoc analyses using Wilcoxon test showed that at mid- and left central regions, (Cz, C3) peak amplitudes of delta responses of healthy subjects were significantly higher than either group. Also cholinesterase inhibitors did not have effect on delta oscillatory responses. Conclusions: Our findings imply that the delta oscillatory responses at central locations are highly instable in mild probable AD patients regardless of treatment when compared to the healthy aged controls. This study supports the importance of oscillatory event-related potentials for investigating AD brain dynamics.

Abnormal spatiotemporal processing of emotional facial expressions in childhood autism: dipole source analysis of event-related potentials	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BESA; brain; electroencephalography; emotion; faces	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; SPECTRUM DISORDER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TACTILE INPUT; BRAIN	Previous studies of face processing in autism suggest abnormalities in anatomical development, functioning and connectivity/coordination of distributed brain systems involved in social cognition, but the spatial sequence and time course of rapid (sub-second) neural responses to emotional facial expressions have not been examined in detail. Source analysis of high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) is an optimal means to examine both the precise temporal profile and spatial location of early electrical brain activity in response to emotionally salient stimuli. Therefore, we recorded 128-channel ERPs from high-functioning males with autism (aged 6-10 years), and age-, sex- and IQ-matched typically developing controls during explicit and implicit processing of emotion from pictures showing happy, angry, fearful, sad and neutral facial expressions. Children with autism showed normal patterns of behavioural and ERP (P1, N170 and P2) responses. However, dipole source analysis revealed that ERP responses relating to face detection (visual cortex) and configural processing of faces (fusiform gyrus), as well as mental state decoding (medial prefrontal lobe), were significantly weaker and/or slower in autism compared with controls during both explicit and implicit emotion-processing tasks. Slower- and larger-amplitude ERP source activity in the parietal somatosensory cortices possibly reflected more effortful compensatory analytical strategies used by the autism group to process facial gender and emotion. Such aberrant neurophysiological processing of facial emotion observed in children with autism within the first 300 ms of stimulus presentation suggests abnormal cortical specialization within social brain networks, which would likely disrupt the development of normal social-cognitive skills.

In the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces, the Common Spatial Patterns method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. It is proposed a Bayesian methodology for feature combination that overcomes the limitations of the feature method used in motor imagery. Also, a method for channel selection based on inter-channel coherence is proposed, reducing the number of channels and improving the classification results.

Reduction of alpha distortion in event related potentials	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Electroencephalogram; Event Related Potentials; alpha activity; Parallel Factor Analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG; SEPARATION	A frequently used brain monitoring technique in cognitive neuroscience research are Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are electrical brain responses to specific sensory, cognitive and motor events in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. However, ERPs are known to have a very low signal-to-noise-ratio and suffer from artifacts present in EEG data like ocular and muscular artifacts. Another common type of distortion is alpha activity. The aim of this study is to remove this activity with different mathematical approaches. Classical methods like filtering and independent component analysis (ICA) do not yield good results in the reduction of alpha distortion. Therefore, we propose Parallel Factor Analysis or PARAFAC as a method for reducing the alpha activity. We will show why filtering and ICA fail to solve this problem and how PARAFAC does succeed in improving the quality of the measured ERPs.

J	Kim, KH; Choi, JW; Yoon, J				Kim, Kyung Hwan; Choi, Jeong Woo; Yoon, Jin			Difference in gamma-band phase synchronization during semantic processing of visually presented words from primary and secondary languages	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-related potential (ERP); Visual word recognition; Language difference; Semantic processing; N400; Gamma-band activity; Phase synchronization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; ENGLISH; EEG; DISSOCIATION; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; DIFFICULTY; INTERPLAY; PATTERN	The difference in cortical mechanisms underlying processing different languages has been of great interest. Exploration of local and global functional connections between neuronal activities originating from task-relevant areas can contribute to a more complete understanding on these processes. Semantic processing is known to involve frontal and parietal activities, and thus, functional connection between anterior-posterior regions is expected during semantic processing of visually presented words. The major purpose of this study is to investigate whether a substantial difference in gamma-band phase synchronization (GBPS) is observed during semantic processing of visually presented words from primary (Korean) and secondary (English) languages. Conventional ERP component and evoked gamma-band activity (eGBA) analyses were also performed. Word pairs with closely-related or unrelated meanings were presented to 14 Korean subjects so that N400 event-related potential (ERP) component was evoked. Other components, such as P1, N1, and late positive component, could also be identified. The N1 was shown to be larger for Korean. Response times and N400 latencies were significantly faster for Korean. eGBAs were significantly smaller in response to English at similar to 100 ms poststimulus, and latencies were considerably delayed. We verified significant GBPS from anterior-posterior electrode pairs, and substantial difference between the two languages emerged in the GBPS pattern during the 200-350 ms period where significant GPBS was observed from more electrode pairs for Korean. This finding indicates that differences in cortical activities due to language differences are more evident in inter-regional connectivity during semantic analysis than during other stages, such as orthographic processing.

The components related to time-locked and noise subspaces are distinguished by method based on different behavior they experience after traditional averaging. The actual separation of the two subspaces is performed without whitening by maximizing/minimizing the same criterion. The detailed derivation of the method is given, and the results of the method's application to simulated and real EEG data sets are studied. The possibilities of improving the results are also discussed.

The proximity of ECoG electrodes to EEG sources enhances their spatial resolution, as well as their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for high frequency EEG activity. ECoG recordings have therefore been used to study the event-related dynamics of brain oscillations in a variety of frequency ranges, and in a variety of functional-neuroanatomic systems, including cortical networks responsible for language. Synchronized gamma oscillations particularly in the high gamma range (>60Hz) was suggested to play a role in binding between cortical regions, essential part of efficient semantic network. The functional response properties of high gamma activity (HGA) are distinct from similar phenomena in lower frequencies. The HGA findings are consistent with its proposed binding role in models of neural computation. Preliminary studies suggest that interactions between gamma oscillations in macroscopic local field potentials (LFP) generated by different large-scale populations of neurons engaged by the same functional task occur in gamma frequencies at latencies consistent with the timing of task performance. The neuronal mechanisms underlying high gamma activity and its distinctive response properties in humans are still largely unknown, but their research through invasive means is expected to support and expand their potential clinical and research applications, including functional brain mapping, brain-computer interfaces, and neurophysiological studies of human cognition. In our lab studies we aim to asses HGA and compare it to event related potentials (ERP's) at different stages of linguistic processing from early sensory to late lexical and semantic stages of processing. The results of these studies indicate that HGA which is related to the semantic network activation distinguished spatially and temporally from the early sensory registration. HGA specific to semantic processing occurs mainly in late stages of processing and its cortical distribution is restricted in comparison to ERP's response of the same process.

However, whether non-phase-locked neural oscillations are involved in empathic responses remains unknown. To investigate the functional role of nonphase-locked theta (3-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) oscillations in empathy for pain, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults who performed pain judgment of pictures of hands in painful or neutral situations. Wavelet analysis was used to calculate EEG spectral power with high time-frequency (TF) resolution. We found that, relative to neutral stimuli, painful stimuli induced increased theta event-related synchronization (ERS) at 200-500 ms but decreased alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) at 200-400 ms, providing evidence for the engagement of theta and alpha activity in empathy for pain. In addition, subjective ratings of perceived pain and self-unpleasantness positively correlated with theta band ERS but negatively correlated with alpha band ERD related to painful stimuli, suggesting that theta and alpha oscillations are respectively involved in emotional sharing and regulation during empathy for pain. Finally, the long-latency upper theta (6-8 Hz) and alpha band TF power significantly decreased by repeated exposure to painful stimuli, indicating short-term adaptive changes of empathy-related neural activity.

This raises the question on how the brain integrates information conveyed in visual and/or linguistic format during spoken language comprehension. In this study we investigated the dynamics of semantic integration of visual and linguistic information by means of time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal. A modified version of the N400 paradigm with either a word or a picture of an object being semantically incongruous with respect to the preceding sentence context was employed. Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis showed qualitatively similar N400 effects for integration of either word or picture. Time-frequency analysis revealed early specific decreases in alpha and gamma band power for linguistic and visual information respectively. We argue that these reflect a rapid context-based analysis of acoustic (word) or visual (picture) form information. We conclude that although full semantic integration of linguistic and visual information occurs through a common mechanism, early differences in oscillations in specific frequency bands reflect the format of the incoming information and, importantly, an early context-based detection of its congruity with respect to the preceding language context.

These sources can be modeled as effective dipoles. Identifying the dipole parameters from the measured multichannel data is called the EEG inverse problem. In this work, we propose a new method for the solution of EEG inverse problem. Our method uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for optimally choosing the dipole parameters. Simulations on synthetic data sets show, that our method well localizes the dipoles into their actual locations. In the real data sets, since the actual dipole parameters aren't known, the fit error between the measured data and the reconstructed data is minimized. It has been observed that our method reduces this error to the noise level by localizing only a few dipoles in the brain.

The human capacity to detect such relations has been comprehensively demonstrated in paradigms in which contingency rules were task-relevant or in which they applied to motor behavior. The extent to which contingencies can also be extracted from events that are unrelated to the current goals of the organism has remained largely unclear. The present study addressed the emergence of contingency-related effects for behaviorally irrelevant auditory stimuli and the cortical areas involved in the processing of such contingency rules. Contingent relations between different features of temporally separate events were embedded in a new dynamic protocol. Participants were presented with the auditory stimulus sequences while their attention was captured by a video. Themismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) was employed as an electrophysiological correlate of contingency detection. MMN generators were localized by means of scalp current density (SCD) and primary current density (PCD) analyses with variable resolution electromagnetic tomography (VARETA). Results show that task-irrelevant contingencies can be extracted from about fifteen to twenty successive events conforming to the contingent relation. Topographic and tomographic analyses reveal the involvement of the auditory cortex in the processing of contingency violations. The present data provide evidence for the rapid encoding of complex extrapolative relations in sensory areas. This capacity is of fundamental importance for the organism in its attempt to model the sensory environment outside the focus of attention. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Whether compromised attentional selectivity or abnormal target detection causes schizophrenia subjects' poor performance on visual attention tasks, therefore, is unknown. To address this issue, we measured the neural activity (using electroencephalography) of 17 schizophrenia and 17 healthy subjects during a target identification task. Participants viewed superimposed images (horizontal and vertical bars differing in color) and attended to one image to identify bar width changes in specific locations. Bars were frequency tagged so attention directed to unique parts of the images could be tracked. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) were used to quantify attention-related neural activity to specific parts of the visual images. Behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to the target events were used to quantify target detection abilities. For both schizophrenia and healthy subjects, attending to specific parts of the attended image enhanced brain activity related to attended bars and reduced activity evoked by unattended bars. Activity in relation to the spatially overlapping unattended image was unaffected. Schizophrenia patients, however, were impaired on target detection abilities on both behavioral and brain activity measures. Target-related behavioral and brain activity measures were highly correlated in both groups. These findings indicate that deficient target detection rather than compromised attentional selectivity accounts for previously reported visual attention deficits in schizophrenia.

The strength of anticipatory spatial biasing predicts target discrimination at attended locations: a high-density EEG study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; biasing; cueing; electroencephalography; human; spatial attention	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SENSORY GAIN-CONTROL; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; POWER; SUPPRESSION	Cueing relevant spatial locations in advance of a visual target results in modulated processing of that target as a consequence of anticipatory attentional deployment, the neural signatures of which remain to be fully elucidated. A set of electrophysiological processes has been established as candidate markers of the invocation and maintenance of attentional bias in humans. These include spatially-selective event-related potential (ERP) components over the lateral parietal (around 200-300 ms post-cue), frontal (300-500 ms) and ventral visual (> 500 ms) cortex, as well as oscillatory amplitude changes in the alpha band (8-14 Hz). Here, we interrogated the roles played by these anticipatory processes in attentional orienting by testing for links with subsequent behavioral performance. We found that both target discriminability (d') and reaction times were significantly predicted on a trial-by-trial basis by lateralization of alpha-band amplitude in the 500 ms preceding the target, with improved speed and accuracy resulting from a greater relative decrease in alpha over the contralateral visual cortex. Reaction time was also predicted by a late posterior contralateral positivity in the broad-band ERP in the same time period, but this did not influence d'. In a further analysis we sought to identify the control signals involved in generating the anticipatory bias, by testing earlier broad-band ERP amplitude for covariation with alpha lateralization. We found that stronger alpha biasing was associated with a greater bilateral frontal positivity at similar to 390 ms but not with differential amplitude across hemispheres in any time period. Thus, during the establishment of an anticipatory spatial bias, while the expected target location is strongly encoded in lateralized activity in parietal and frontal areas, a distinct non-spatial control process seems to regulate the strength of the bias.

Thirty male and 30 female respondents solved simple auditory and visual tasks while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Also recorded was the percentage of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (%StO(2)) in the respondents' frontal brain areas with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The attended task condition was based on the oddball paradigm. Respondents had to mentally count infrequent target stimuli-tones or shapes. In the unattended condition they just listened to tones or viewed different shapes. Gender related differences in EEG activity were only observed in the amplitudes of the early evoked gamma response and the P3 component. Women displayed higher amplitudes than men. A second finding was that these differences were more pronounced for the visual than for the auditory stimuli. No gender related differences were observed in the ERP latencies, as well as in the amplitudes of the P1-N1 complex, and the induced gamma response. The NIRS data showed that males in their frontal brain areas displayed a higher percentage of StO(2) than did females; and males also showed a higher increase in % StO(2) during task performance as compared with the resting condition. Taken all together the results suggest that the females' visual event-categorization process is more efficient than in males. The data are discussed in the theoretical framework of the evolutionary theory of human spatial sex differences. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Current diagnosis of AD primarlly uses longitudinal clinical evaluations and/or invasive lumbar punctures for CSF analysis, available only at specialized hospitals, which are generally outside of financial and geographical reach of most patients. We expand on our previous work and describe an ensemble of classifiers based approach that combines decision and data fusion techniques for the early diagnosis of AD using event related potentials (ERP) obtained in response to different audio stimuli. In this contribution, we specifically examine various feature set combinations, obtained from different EEG electrode locations and in response to different stimulus tones to illustrate the accuracy of such H system for AD diagnosis at the earliest stage on a clinically significant cohort size of 71 patients.

Here, we recorded intracranial EEG during a modified Flanker task from the MFC of two patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for the treatment of epilepsy. Performance on the task was associated with a suppression of beta (15-30 Hz) frequency oscillation power prior to and just following the response and an enhancement of theta (4-8 Hz) frequency power following the response. Beta (theta) power was anatomically distributed towards more dorsal/caudal (rostral/ventral) electrode sites along the cortex, suggesting all anatomical/ functional specialization along the medial frontal wall for pre-response versus post-response action monitoring. Inter-site phase coherence analyses demonstrated that the ventral/rostral MFC theta oscillations were coupled with theta oscillations observed at scalp electrodes Fz and Cz. One patient was tested before and after having epileptogenic tissue in the MFC surgically removed; task performance increased from chance levels to near-perfect, and an ERP conflict effect was observed only following surgery. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of MFC oscillations and their relation to surface EEG-recorded potentials during action monitoring. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The performances of four ICA algorithms (AMUSE, SOBI, Infomax, and JADE) are assessed by separating the ERPs from semi-simulated EEG datasets, in order to determine the optimal method. Infomax and JADE performs significantly better than AMUSE and SOBI in eliminating artifacts and Infomax is further successful in extracting ERPs from real EEG recordings. The excellent performance of Infomax with real case supports this ICA algorithm as a valid choice to minimize the influence of artifacts on ERPs single trial extraction.

We hypothesized that self-reported BIS should relate to neural mechanisms associated with conflict monitoring, whereas self-reported BAS should be associated with neural correlates of approach motivation. Consistent with these predictions, higher self-reported BIS was uniquely related to the N2 event-related potential on No-Go trials of a Go/No-Go task, linking BIS with conflict monitoring and sensitivity to No-Go cues. Higher BAS was uniquely related to greater left-sided baseline frontal cortical asymmetry associated with approach orientation. Implications for theories of self-regulation involving conflict monitoring, cognitive control, and approach/avoidance motivation are discussed.

To maintain their waking state during this boring task, participants were instructed to alternately close or open their eyes to each stimulus. None of the baseline-to-peak ERP measures showed trials effects comparable with the marked habituation over trials shown by the SCRs. Principal Components Analysis was used to decompose the ERP, yielding factors identified as the N1, N2, P3a, P3b and Novelty P3 components. An additional factor represented later eye-movement activity. No trial effects were apparent for the N1, N2. P3a or P3b components. The Novelty P3 showed marked response decrement over trials. These results are discussed in relation to current conceptualisations of the OR. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The random SART is a Go/No-Go task in which the No-Go target appears unpredictably and rarely. In the present experiment, the EEG was recorded from 58 electrodes with mastoids as reference. As expected, the N2 and P3 were larger in the No-Go trials compared to the Go trials, with the P3 more frontal for the No-Go trials compared to the Go trials. The functional role of the N2 and P3 in the No-Go trials is discussed comparing our results to the fixed SART results obtained by Dockree et al. [Dockree P. M., Kelly S. P., Robertson I. H., Reilly R. B., & Foxe J. J. (2005). Neurophysiological markers of alert responding during goal-directed behaviour: A high-density electrical mapping study. NeuroImage, 27, 587-601]. In addition, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) was computed. The absence of an LRP in the No-Go trials suggests that a central inhibitory mechanism intervenes to prevent the preparation and execution of a dominant motor response. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated the relationship between white matter integrity and event related potentials (ERP) during a continuous performance test (CPT). Anisotropy values were correlated with the brain electrical P300 microstate duration and P300 latency associated to the NoGo- and the Go-stimuli of the CPT in 11 patients with first episode schizophrenia and 11 matched healthy controls. Both groups showed significant positive correlations of the NoGo-microstate duration with the white matter signal in the superior frontal region, the optic radiation, the posterior cingulate, and the inferolateral fascicle. In addition, patients with first episode schizophrenia had significant correlations with the right radiation and the left genu of the corpus callosum, bilateral geniculate, and the left middle and the superior temporal regions. We interpreted these findings as a sign of functional correlates of extended circuits for the active inhibition of a motor response in the visual CPT as compared to controls. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Slow waves have been found to accompany a large number of cognitive processes in a systematic and topographically specific way, and have thus been successfully employed in psychophysiological experiments to dissociate cognitive functions by means of their slow wave topography. Recently, however, several independent studies, using different experimental paradigms, suggest the existence of another feature of slow waves, i.e., a close relationship with the fMRI BOLD response. Some of these studies found couplings between slow waves and BOLD signals in various brain regions, using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Others found similar task-related activation patterns of slow waves (i.e., scalp topographies) and BOLD responses (i.e., activated voxel profiles), as well as corresponding parametric increases of signal strength with increasing task difficulty. The close relationship between slow waves and BOLD responses reported here concerns a low frequency range of the EEG signal (< 1 Hz) that has so far received less attention in studies on the correspondence between EEG and fMRI than the higher frequencies, and therefore adds to the various findings obtained at higher EEG frequencies. Implications for the use of slow waves for neuroscientific research are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The evidence for reflection of attention mechanisms and saccade preparation in intensity and topography of the visual evoked potentials and event-related potentials is given. On the basis of the results obtained by the authors and literature data, the contribution of attention to preparation of a saccade and its programming is shown.

Combining these advantages of EEG with dipole-tracing analysis incorporating a realistic three-layer head model (scalp-skull-brain head model; SSB/DT) allows for the detection of dipoles in the millisecond range and investigation of the processing of cognitive function and movement execution. In this study, we constructed a scalp-skull-brain head model from Montreal Neurological Institute standard brain images and detected dipole localizations in the millisecond range from grand-averaged negative slope (NS) to motor potentials during a simple pinching movement. The left movement activated the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), rostral cingulate cortex and rostral premotor area, which are associated with cognitive functions and self-initiated decisions. These areas were associated with the early NS potential during left pinching movement preparation. The right movement activated the caudal cingulate cortex, pre-SMA and caudal premotor area, and these areas were activated just before the execution of movement. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: The two experiments consisted of two conditions, Mastication (chewing gum) and Control (relaxing Without chewing gum) in Experiment 1, and law Movement (opening and closing the jaw) and Finger Tapping (tapping the right index finger) in Experiment 2. The subjects performed four sessions of an auditory oddball paradigm. RT and ERPs were recorded in these four sessions, Pre (before chewing), and Post 1, Post 2 and Post 3 (after chewing). Results: In Mastication for RT and the peak latencies of P300 and N100. the values were significantly longer in Pre than in Post 2 or Post 3. By contrast, in Control, jaw Movement, and Finger Tapping, they were almost identical among sessions or significantly shorter in Pre than in Post 2 or Post 3. Conclusions: Mastication influences cognitive processing time as reflected by RT and the latency of ERP waveforms. Significance: This is the first study investigating the effect of mastication on the central nervous system using event-related potentials.

Laser-evoked potential P2 single-trial amplitudes covary with the fMRI BOLD response in the medial pain system and interconnected subcortical structures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Electroencephalography; Anterior cingulate cortex; Amygdala	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; HUMAN BRAIN; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; NOCICEPTIVE STIMULI; HUMANS; ACTIVATION; CO2-LASER	Pain is a complex experience with sensory, emotional and cognitive aspects. The cortical representation of pain - the pain matrix - consists of a network of regions including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) sensory cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These structures interact with brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdalae. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI (electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging) has recently been introduced as a method to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of cognitive processes with high spatial and high temporal resolution at the same time. The present study was conducted to clarify if single trial EEG-informed BOLD modeling supports the definition of functional compartments within the pain matrix and interconnected regions. Twenty healthy subjects received painful laser stimulation while EEG and the fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal were recorded simultaneously. While the laser-evoked N2 potential provided no additional information for BOLD modeling, the regressor obtained from the single trial laser-evoked P2 potential explained additional variance in a network of cortical and subcortical structures that largely overlapped with the pain matrix. This modeling strategy yielded pronounced activation in the ACC, right amygdala and thalamus. Our results suggest that laser-evoked potential (LEP) informed fMRI can be used to visualize BOLD activation in the pain matrix with an emphasis on functional compartments (as defined by the temporal dynamics of the LEP) such as the medial pain system. Furthermore, our findings suggest a concerted effort of the ACC and the amygdala in the cognitive-emotional evaluation of pain. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to assess whether objective physiological responses from an electroencephalogram (EEG) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) can qualify stress level or not. The stress levels of twenty-two healthy subjects were evaluated with questionnaire methods, and the subjects were categorized into two groups: the Stress Group and the Non-Stress Group. An EEG and an ECG were measured under emotional stress tasks using audio-visual stimuli and analyzed with a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The results showed that beta activities in the frontal areas of the Non-Stress Group were larger than those of the Stress Group soon after the emotionally Unpleasant stimuli. These events suggest that people with less stress (the Non-Stress Group) have a high stress-resistance potential in their brain activities as biological reactions.

Detection of a neural marker for emotion regulation thus has the potential to inform early detection and intervention for mood problems. One such neural marker may be the late positive potential (LPP), which is a scalp-recorded event-related potential reflecting facilitated attention to emotional stimuli. In adults, the LPP is reduced following use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies such as reappraisal. No studies to date have examined the LPP in relation to cognitive emotion regulation in children, and whether the LPP is related to parent-report measures of emotion regulation and mood disruptions. Methods: To examine this question, high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) was recorded from 20 children (M age = 87.8 months, SD = 18.02; 10 girls) while they viewed unpleasant emotional pictures following either a directed negative or neutral interpretation of the picture. Results: As predicted, the LPP was smaller following neutral versus negative interpretations at posterior recording sites, except for younger girls (aged 5-6). The timing of this effect was later than that reported in studies with adults. For all children, greater modulation of the LPP by neutral interpretations was associated with reduced anxious-depressed symptoms, whereas larger LPPs for both interpretation types were associated with greater mood symptoms and worse parent-reported emotion regulation. Conclusions: Results suggest that the LPP may represent a clinically relevant neural marker for emotion regulation and mood disruptions.

Though such a multi-modal acquisition is attractive given that it can exploit the temporal resolution of EEG and spatial resolution of fMRI, it comes with unique signal processing and pattern classification challenges. In this paper I will review some our work at developing signal processing and pattern recognition for analysis of simultaneous EEG and fMRI, with a focus on those algorithms enabling a single-trial analysis of the neural signal. In general, these algorithms exploit the multivariate nature of the EEG, removing MR induced artifacts and classifying event-related signals that then can be correlated with the BOLD signal to yield specific fMRI activations.

So far, not much is known about the temporal dynamics of ACC activity in effort-related decision making or auditory attention, because fMRI is limited concerning its temporal resolution and electroencephalography (EEG) is limited concerning its spatial resolution. Single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI can be used to predict the BOLD signal specifically related to amplitude variations of electrophysiological components. The striking feature of single-trial coupling is its ability to separate different aspects of the BOLD signal according to their specific relationship to a distinct neural process. In the present study we investigated 10 healthy subjects with a forced choice reaction task under both low and high effort conditions and a control condition (passive listening) using simultaneous EEG and fMRI We detected a significant effect of mental effort only for the N1 potential, but not for the P300 potential. In the fMRI analysis, ACC activation was present only in the high effort condition. We used single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI in order to separate information specific to NI-amplitude variations from the unrelated BOLD response. Under high effort conditions we were able to detect circumscribed BOLD activations specific to the N1 potential in the ACC (t=4.7) and the auditory cortex (t=6.1). Comparing the N1-specific BOLD activity of the high effort condition versus the control condition we found only activation of the ACC (random effects analysis, corrected for multiple comparisons, t=4.4).

Psychophysiology and imaging of visual cortical functions in the blind: A review	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Visual function; plasticity; blind; brain imaging; EEG; ERP; fMRI; PET; TMS	CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CONGENITALLY BLIND; AUDITORY ATTENTION; HUMANS; REORGANIZATION; SOUND	Imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and psychophysiological recordings of the congenitally blind have confirmed functional activation of the visual cortex but have not extensively explained the functional significance of these activation patterns in detail. This review systematically examines research on the role of the visual cortex in processing spatial and non-visual information, highlighting research on individuals with early and late onset blindness. Here, we concentrate Oil the methods utilized in studying visual cortical activation in early blind participants, including positron emissions tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electrophysiological data, specifically event-related potentials (ERPs). This paper summarizes and discusses findings of these studies. We hypothesize how mechanisms of cortical plasticity are expressed in congenitally in comparison to adventitiously blind and short-term visually deprived sighted participants and discuss potential approaches for further investigation of these mechanisms in future research.

Perspectives on Detecting the Effective Brain Connectivity - The AR Approach	NONLINEAR OPTICS QUANTUM OPTICS-CONCEPTS IN MODERN OPTICS			English	Article						Time variant autroregressive models; EEG; Granger causality; signal processing; partial directed coherence; partial correlation		How brain areas communicate during different mental tasks or under specific conditions has not yet been clarified. This study contributes to the understanding of communication between brain areas by analyzing the methods that reveal cerebral interactions and brain influences using data from Event-Related Potentials (ERP), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). To investigate effective connectivity in the brain, the autoregressive time variant (tvAR) models are used. The investigation of the effective connectivity included the analyses by means of time variant Granger Causality Index, of time variant Partial Directed Coherence, and of partial correlation. The second objective of the study was the application of the methods to composed physiological data. The methods are applied to examine change in the physiological control system, by extracting the directed connections between the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory signal.	[Ungureanu, G.

The Brain's Orienting Response: An Event-Related Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Investigation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						attention; habituation; functional MRI; acoustic stimulation	AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; PREFRONTAL LESIONS; TARGET DETECTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; ALPHA-RHYTHM; NOVELTY P3; FMRI; ERP; EEG	An important function of the brain's orienting response is to enable the evaluation of novel, environmental events in order to prepare for potential behavioral action. Here, we assessed the event-related hemodynamic (erfMRI) correlates of this phenomenon using unexpected (i.e., novel) environmental sounds presented within the context of an auditory novelty oddball paradigm. In ERP investigations of the novelty oddball, repetition of the identical novel sound leads to habituation of the novelty P3, an ERP sign of the orienting response. Repetition also leads to an enhancement of a Subsequent positivity that appears to reflect semantic analysis of the environmental Sounds. In this adaptation for erfMRI recording, frequent tones were intermixed randomly with infrequent target tones and equally infrequent novel, environmental sounds. Subjects responded via speeded button press to targets. To assess habituation, some of the environmental sounds were repeated two blocks after their initial presentation. As expected, novel Sounds and target tones led to activation of widespread, but somewhat different, neural networks. Contrary to expectation, however, there were no significant areas in which activation was reduced in response to second compared to first presentations of the novel sounds. Conversely, novel sounds relative to target tones engendered activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) consistent with semantic analysis of these events. We conclude that a key concomitant of the orienting response is the extraction of meaning, thereby enabling one to determine the significance of the environmental perturbation and take appropriate goal-directed action.

Gamma oscillations in gerbil auditory cortex during a target-discrimination task reflect matches with short-term memory	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						40 Hz; auditory cortex; ERP; local field potential; EEG; frequency modulated sound; gamma activity; oscillation	FREQUENCY-MODULATED TONES; BAND ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; 3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS; MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN; REPRESENTATION; ATTENTION	Tightly stimulus-locked "evoked" and not tightly stimulus-locked "induced" gamma-band oscillations have been implicated in a variety of cognitive functions as well as more basic stimulus-related aspects of neuronal activity. The present study aimed at dissociating both aspects using a preparation in rodents trained to perform in a target-discrimination task while recording the intracerebral electrocorticogram in parallel from left and right auditory cortex. While stimulus-related aspects of gamma-band activity were already evident in the naive subjects, aspects related to successful target-discrimination only emerged with learning. Frequency-modulated tones were employed as stimuli and were varied with respect to two stimulus dimensions, viz. "spectral content" and "modulation direction". A target stimulus had to be discriminated in a GO/(NO-GO) paradigm from three non-target stimuli matching the target in only one or none of these dimensions. Analysis of the event-related potentials indicated that the physical stimulus parameters explained most of the variance in amplitude of most event-related potential components. For the evoked gamma-band activity no learning related modulations were found. The induced gamma-band activity showed a relationship with the similarity of a stimulus with the target that was most prominent in the right hemisphere. The correspondence between task-specific behavior and the amplitude of induced gamma-band activity, both developing with learning, supports a functional relevance of this form of oscillation beyond merely processing physical stimulus attributes.

During rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), this correlation is absent. Here we study how subjects' target detection responses, both behavioral and electrophysiological, differ between continuous serial visual sequences (CSVP), flashed serial visual presentation (FSVP) and RSVP. Behavioral results show longer reaction times for CSVP compared to the FSVP and RSVP conditions, as well as a difference in miss rate between RSVP and the other two conditions. Using mutual information, we measure electrophysiological differences in the electroencephalography (EEG) for these three conditions. We find two peaks in the mutual information between EEG and stimulus class (target vs. distractor), with the second peak occurring 30-40 ms earlier for the FSVP and RSVP conditions. In addition, we find differences in the persistence of the peak mutual information between FSVP and RSVP conditions. We further investigate these differences using a mutual information based functional connectivity analysis and find significant fronto-parietal functional coupling for RSVP and FSVP but no significant coupling for the CSVP condition. We discuss these findings within the context of attentional engagement, evidence accumulation and short-term visual memory.

The authors investigated the relationships among SES, performance, and the neural correlates of auditory selective attention, by comparing event-related potentials (ERPs) in lower- and higher-SES preadolescent children during a task in which they attended to two types of pure tones but ignored two other types. Our hypothesis was that, at comparable performance levels, higher-SES children ignore distracters (the unattended, irrelevant tones) while lower-SES children attend equally to distracters and to targets (the attended, relevant tones). The authors found that ERP waveform differences between attended and unattended tones (Nd, difference negativity) were significant in the higher-SES but not in the lower-SES group. However, the groups did not differ in reaction times or accuracy. Electroencephalographic power analysis revealed a differential pattern of theta activity concomitant with irrelevant tones for the two groups, indicating that although they performed similarly the children from these groups recruited different neural processes. Lower-SES children, the authors suggest, deployed supplementary resources to also attend to irrelevant information.

These waves arise from the synchronization of slow oscillations in the membrane potentials of millions of neurons. Scalp-level studies have indicated that slow waves are not instantaneous events, but rather they travel across the brain. Previous studies of EEG slow waves were limited by the poor spatial resolution of EEGs and by the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to the activity of the underlying cortex. Here we use high-density EEG (hd-EEG) source modeling to show that individual spontaneous slow waves have distinct cortical origins, propagate uniquely across the cortex, and involve unique subsets of cortical structures. However, when the waves are examined en masse, we find that there are diffuse hot spots of slow wave origins centered on the lateral sulci. Furthermore, slow wave propagation along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain is largely mediated by a cingulate highway. As a group, slow waves are associated with large currents in the medial frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate, the precuneus, and the posterior cingulate. These areas overlap with the major connectional backbone of the cortex and with many parts of the default network.

Modulation of the cortical processing of novel and target stimuli by drugs affecting glutamate and GABA neurotransmission	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	30th Annual Meeting of the Research-Society-on-Alcoholism	JUL 07-11, 2007	Chicago, IL	Res Soc Alcoholism		Event-related potential; GABA-A; novelty processing; NMDA; P300	WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; NOVELTY DETECTION; KETAMINE; P300; ALCOHOLISM; INHIBITION; TASK	In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine (an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist) and thiopental (a GABA-A receptor agonist) on the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of deviant stimulus processing in 24 healthy adults. Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were recorded both before and during each challenge while participants performed a visual 'oddball' task consisting of infrequent 'target' and 'novel' stimuli intermixed with frequent 'standard' stimuli. We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.

Single-trial P3 amplitude and latency informed event-related fMRI models yield different BOLD response patterns to a target detection task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event Related Potentials (ERPs); functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); Single-trial; P3 amplitude; P3 latency; Multimodal imaging	VISUAL-STIMULI; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; FUNCTIONAL MRI; REACTION-TIME; ODDBALL TASK; RARE TARGET; SWITCH COST	Using single-trial parameters as a regressor in the General Linear Model (GLM) is becoming an increasingly popular method for informing fMRI analysis. However, the parameter used to characterise or to differentiate brain regions involved in the response to a particular task varies across studies (e.g. ERP amplitude, ERP latency, reaction time). Furthermore, the way in which the single-trial information is used in the fMRI analysis is also important. For example, the single-trial parameters can be used as regressors in the GLM or to modify the duration of the events modelled in the GLM. The aim of this study was to investigate the BOLD response to a target detection task when including P3 amplitude, P3 latency and reaction time parameters in the GLM. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was recorded from fifteen subjects in response to a visual choice reaction time task. Including P3 amplitude as a regressor in the GLM yielded activation in left central opercular cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left insula, left middle frontal gyrus, left insula and left parietal operculum. Using P3 latency and reaction time as an additional regressor yielded no additional activation in comparison with the conventional fMRI analysis. However, when P3 latency or reaction time was used to determine the duration of events at a single-trial level, additional activation was observed in the left postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate Cortex and supramarginal gyrus. Our findings suggest that ERP amplitudes and latencies can yield different activation patterns when used to modify relevant aspects of the GLM. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Success in the endeavour of real-time multimodal experiments requires special hardware and software as well as purpose-tailored experimental design and analysis strategies. Here, we review the key methodological issues in recording electrophysiological data in humans simultaneously with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focusing on recent technical and analytical advances in the field. Examples are derived from simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) during functional MRI in cognitive and systems neuroscience as well as in clinical neurology, in particular in epilepsy and movement disorders. We conclude with an outlook on current and future efforts to achieve true integration of electrical and haemodynamic measures of neuronal activity using data fusion models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

At a temporal resolution on the order of seconds, fMRI does not reveal the real 'language of neurons', spelt Out by fast electrical discharges ('spikes') which occur on a time scale of milliseconds. In animal studies, these limitations have been addressed by adding invasive electrode measurements to fMRI Here, we propose to circumvent this inverse problem of fMRI by deriving a noninvasive spike measure from recordings of ultrafast electroencephalography (EEG) signals during fMRI. We demonstrate how in response to median nerve stimulation 600 Hz oscillatory EEG signals can be measured reliably during fMRI. These high-frequency bursts (HFBs) are supposed to reflect Population spikes in the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex, respectively. We show that distinct fMRI activations in these two generator structures can be attributed to spontaneous HFB fluctuations. Thus, our approach allowed the noninvasive identification of neural processes along the thalamocortical pathway unfolding at a millisecond time scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Three externally-paced reading tasks were administered with an event-related design: passive observation of letters and symbols and active reading aloud of letters. ERP and fMRI data were separately recorded from 8 healthy adults during the same experimental conditions. Due to the presence of artifacts in the EEG signals, two subjects were discarded from further analysis. Independent Component Analysis was applied to ERPs, after dimensionality reduction by Principal Component Analysis: some independent components were clearly related to specific reading functions and the associated current density distributions in the brain were estimated with Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Analysis method (LORETA). The impulse hemodynamic response function was modeled as a linear combination of linear B-spline functions and fMRI statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression. fMRI and LORETA maps were superimposed in order to identify the overlapping activations and the activated regions specifically revealed by each modality. The results showed the existence of neuronal networks functionally specific for letter processing and for explicit verbal-motor articulation, including the temporo-parietal and frontal regions. Overlap between fMRI and LORETA results was observed in the inferior temporal-middle occipital gyros, suggesting that this area has a crucial and multifunctional role for linguistic and reading processes, likely because its spatial location and strong interconnection with the main visual and auditory sensory systems may have favored its specialization in grapheme-phoneme matching.

J	Sun, LM; Rieger, J; Hinrichs, H				Sun, Limin; Rieger, Jochem; Hinrichs, Hermann			Maximum noise fraction (MNF) transformation to remove ballistocardiographic artifacts in EEG signals recorded during fMRI scanning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Ballistocardiographic artifact; Maximum noise fraction; Blind source separation	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEPARATION; REDUCTION; VEP; MRI; ECG	Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow imaging of the brain at high temporal and spatial resolution. However, EEGs recorded under these conditions are corrupted by large repetitive artifacts generated by the switching MR gradients and, second, by slightly less stable ballistocardiographic artifacts (BCG) resulting from heart beat related body movements. Here we present a new approach to remove BCG artifacts using a blind source separation (BSS) approach called maximum noise fraction (MNF). In contrast to other BSS methods MNF provides a set of components ordered by their signal-to noise-ratio. Applied to BCG contaminated EEG signals this means that components representing the artifact activity always result as the last or first ones (depending on the direction of ordering) thus making it easy to identify those components to be removed for artefact suppression. The new algorithm combines MNF and a subsequent template subtraction method to remove the BCG in a fully automatic manner. The efficiency of the new method was validated by comparing spontaneous EEG signals as well as event related potentials recorded from four subjects. According to these results MNF outperforms other BSS approaches in its capability to separate artifact activity from true EEG. In addition, MNF is superior to these alternatives regarding computational efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present article, we address the question as to whether recent fMRI studies on primary affective experiences have truly helped to pinpoint emotion-specific areas in the human brain or whether these studies are afflicted with methodological problems which make such inferences difficult. As one approach for improvement, we suggest the combination of fMRI with methods characterized by high temporal resolution, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Simultaneous recoding allows the correlation of temporally specific EEG components (e.g., the late positive potential) with regional blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during affective experiences. Combined information on the source as well as the exact temporal pattern of a neural affective response will help to improve our understanding of emotion-specific brain activation.

J	Koivisto, M; Revonsuo, A				Koivisto, Mika; Revonsuo, Antti			Comparison of event-related potentials in attentional blink and repetition blindness	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						attention; awareness; EEG; ERP; perception	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; VISUAL CONSCIOUSNESS; RAPID LISTS; INDEPENDENCE; SUPPRESSION; AWARENESS; MASKING; TOKENS; LOCUS	Attending to the first target in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) interferes with processing of the second target so that the participants fail to recognize the second target if the targets are separated by a stimulus onset asynchrony of 200-500 ms. This phenomenon is attentional blink (AB). Repetition blindness (RB) is an additional difficulty to recognize the second occurrence of the same stimulus in RSVP. A controversial issue in studies of both deficits is the processing level at which they occur. To compare the timing and mechanisms of AB and RB directly during the same RSVP stream, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to repeated and unrepeated targets. Comparable to earlier ERP studies on visual awareness, the results showed for both types of targets a negative amplitude difference between ERPs to consciously recognized and unrecognized targets during 250350 ms from stimulus onset, suggesting that both AB and RB are associated with deficits of conscious perception, occurring at earlier stages than access to working memory. However, the perceptual deficit in RB is more severe, which may be related to higher overall negativity in response to repeated targets observed 150-300 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting stronger cortical baseline activation and higher perceptual threshold for repeated targets as compared with unrepeated ones.

More specifically, we discuss several research programs that employ electro-encephalography, event-related potentials, or functional magnetic resonance imaging methods to examine neural correlates of stereotype and social identity threat. We present neuroimaging studies that show brain activation related to the experience of being stereotyped and ERP studies that shed light on the cognitive processes underlying social identity processes. Among these are two projects from our own lab. The first project reveals the important role of the neurocognitive conflict-detection system in stereotype threat effects, especially as it pertains to stereotype threat 'spillover'. The second project examines the role of automatic ingroup evaluations as a neural mediator between social identity threats and compensatory ingroup bias. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits, limitations, and unique contributions of social neuroscience to our understanding of stigma and social identity threat.

It has been argued that this direct matching of observed on executed actions is modulated by contextual factors. An open question is whether observing another person being physically restrained has an influence on action execution in the observer. Using performance measures we found a slowing of response times when perceiving others' hands being physically restrained (Experiment 1). We did not find a slowing effect when participants responded with their feet ruling out a general perceptual interpretation of the present findings (Experiment 2). To further test our hypothesis, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The ERP results demonstrate that the observed slowing effect is reflected in a decrease of motor-related ERP components (Experiment 3). Perceiving others' hands physically restrained impairs motor preparation in the observer. Our findings suggest that observed environmental constraints are automatically mapped onto the observer's motor system. Such a mapping of motor restraints might facilitate action understanding.

The purpose of this study was to extend a previously introduced pattern recognition method for the ERP assessment in this application. This extension was done by the further extending the feature set and also the employing a method for the selection of optimal features. For the evaluation of the method, several subjects went through the designed GKT paradigm and their respective brain signals were recorded. Next, a P300 detection approach based on some features and a statistical classifier was implemented. The optimal feature set was selected using a genetic algorithm from a primary feature set including some morphological, frequency and wavelet features and was used for the classification of the data. The rates of correct detection in guilty and innocent subjects were 86%, which was better than other previously used methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physiological arousal and attention during a week of continuous sleep restriction	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sleep restriction; Sleepiness; Performance; EEG; Spectral analysis; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; WAKING EEG; PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS; DEPRIVATION; TASK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; WAKEFULNESS; FREQUENCIES	Waking brain physiology underlying deficits from continuous sleep restriction (CSR) is not well understood. Fourteen good sleepers participated in a 21-day protocol where they slept their usual amount in a baseline week, had their time in bed restricted by 33% in a CSR week, and slept the desired amount in a recovery week. Participants slept at home. completing diaries and wearing activity monitors to verify compliance. Each day participants completed an RT task and mood and sleepiness ratings every 3 h. Laboratory assessment of electrophysiology and performance took place at the end of baseline, three times throughout the CSR week. and at the beginning of recovery. Participants reported less sleep during CSR which was confirmed by activity monitors. Correspondingly, well-being and neurobehavioural performance was impaired. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed significantly reduced arousal between the 1st and 7th days of restriction and linear effects at anterior sites (Fp2, Fz, F8, T8). At posterior sites (P4, P8), reductions occurred only later in the week between the 4th and 7th nights of restriction. Both the immediate linear decline in arousal and precipitous drop later in the week were apparent at central sites (C4, Cz). Thus, frontal regions were affected immediately, while parietal regions showed maintenance of function until restriction was more severe. The P300 ERP component showed evidence of reduced attention by the 7th day of restriction (at Pz, P4). EEG and ERPs deficits were more robust in the right-hemisphere, which may reflect greater vulnerability to sleep loss in the non-dominant hemisphere. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Brain event-related potentials (ERPs) in schizophrenia during a word recognition memory task. Int. J. Psychophysiol. 34(3), 249-265.]). However, patients showed reduced early negative potentials (NI, N2) and poorer WRM. Because group differences in neuronal generator patterns (i.e., sink-source orientation) may be masked by choice of EEG recording reference, the current study combined surface Laplacians and principal components analysis (PCA) to clarify ERP component topography and polarity and to disentangle stimulus- and response-related contributions. To investigate the impact of stimulus modality, 31-channel ERPs were recorded from 20 schizophrenic patients (15 male) and 20 age-, gender-, and handedness-matched healthy adults during parallel visual and auditory continuous WRM tasks. Stimulus- and response-locked reference-free current source densities (spherical splines) were submitted to unrestricted Varimax-PCA to identify and measure neuronal generator patterns underlying ERPs. Poorer (78.2 +/- 18.7% vs. 87.8 +/- 11.3% correct) and slower (958 +/- 226 vs. 773 +/- 206 ms) performance in patients was accompanied by reduced stimulus-related left-parietal P3 sources (150 ms pre-response) and vertex N2 sinks (both overall and old/new effects) but modality-specific NI sinks were not significantly reduced. A distinct mid-frontal sink 50-ms post-response was markedly attenuated in patients. Reductions were more robust for auditory stimuli. However, patients showed increased lateral-frontotemporal sinks (T7 maximum) concurrent with auditory P3 sources. Electrophysiologic correlates of WRM deficits in schizophrenia suggest functional impairments of posterior cortex (stimulus representation) and anterior cingulate (stimulus categorization, response monitoring), primarily affecting memory for spoken words.

Both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state data are discussed. These reflections of typical development provide a framework for illustrating EEG differences in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), and its main diagnostic types, from children to adults. Comorbidity effects in the EEG of children with AD/HD, particularly comorbid reading disabilities and conduct disorders, are also described. Some recent explorations of the links between arousal/activation and EEG activity may contribute to our understanding of the functional nature of brain oscillations in this context. Other aspects of oscillatory brain activity, coherence and event-related potentials, are also briefly discussed within this framework.

Methods: Fifteen healthy controls and three equally large groups of children with symptoms of PDD-NOS, ADHD or both (PDD/HD) performed a visual selective memory search task. The EEG was recorded from which occipital alpha and frontal theta were derived. Results: The effects of the overall task manipulations of task load, relevance and target/nontarget were clearly present in the overall analyses of alpha and theta ERD/ERS. However, no significant differences with respect to these manipulations existed between any of the subject groups. Conclusions: The results supply no evidence for a distinction in information processing abilities of selective attention and working memory as reflected by alpha and theta ERD/ERS between children diagnosed with either ADHD, PDD-NOS or healthy controls. Significance: Alpha and theta ERD/ERS are sensitive to manipulations of task load, relevance and target/nontarget, but supply no additional information on possible group differences in comparison to the more frequently used method of event-related potentials.

In Experiment 1 participants searched a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequence for a prespecified target letter that usually appeared in a cued color. ERPs elicited by cued-color distractors were similar to those elicited by targets, indicating relatively complete distractor processing. In Experiment 2 one letter in the RSVP sequence was framed by an irrelevant distractor probe in either the cued color or an uncued color. Such distractor probes elicited a P1, N1, or P2 sequence that depended on their color. In addition, probes presented shortly before the target tended to suppress the ERP components associated with target processing, especially for probes in the cued color. These observed variations in ERPs depending on the distractor's type and its distance from the target help to reveal the time course and mechanisms of selection by color.

The very low signal-to-noise ratio and low spatial resolution still limits severely BCIs communication bandwidth. This paper presents the ongoing work toward the development of a BCI system for wheelchair steering. A full system based on a visual P300 oddball paradigm is proposed. The signal processing algorithms are computationally efficient and require a short phase training. Temporal features and EEG channels are selected through a Fisher criteria. For enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio and data dimensionality reduction, a spatial filter named Common Spatial Patterns is applied. This method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. In our approach, the input features for classification are the projections of the filtered data instead of the variance of the projections as typically used in motor imagery. Offline classification results, obtained with a Bayesian classifier, are presented showing the effectiveness of the overall methodology.

Our main goal was to disentangle the earliest ERP effects of the length of letter strings ("word length") and orthographic neighbourhood size (Coltheart's "N"). With respect to N, existing evidence is still ambiguous with respect to whether effects of N reflect early access to lexico-semantic information, or whether they occur at later decision or verification stages. In the present study, we found distinct neurophysiological manifestations of both N and word length around 100 ms after word onset. Importantly, the effect of N distinguished between words and pseudowords, while the effect of word length did not. Minimum norm source estimation revealed the most dominant sources for word length in bilateral posterior brain areas for both words and pseudowords. For N, these sources were more left-lateralised and consistent with perisylvian brain areas, with activation peaks in temporal areas being more anterior for words compared to pseudowords. Our results support evidence for an effect of N at early and elementary stages of word recognition. We discuss the implications of these results for the time line of word recognition processes, and emphasise the value of ERRCs in combination with source analysis in psycholinguistic and cognitive brain research.

Four ovals on the horizontal midline were either unconnected or pairwise connected by circles, forming ears of left and right heads (gestalts). Relevant to responding was the position of one colored oval, either within its pair or relative to fixation ("object-based" or "fixation-based" instruction). Responses were faster under fixation- than object-based instruction, less so with gestalts. Previously reported increases of N1 when evoked by features within objects were replicated for fixation-based instruction only. There was no effect of instruction on N2pc. However P1 increased under the adequate instruction, object-based for gestalts, fixation-based for unconnected items, which presumably indicated how foci of attention were set by expecting specific stimuli under instructions that specified how to bind these stimuli to objects.

JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aging; VEP; stimulus-response processing; Go/NoGo; alpha oscillations	GO NOGO TASKS; ERP COMPONENTS; RESPONSE PRODUCTION; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; EEG; AGE; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; THETA	A major challenge for developmental cognitive neuroscience is to understand how changes in cognitive functions related to aging are associated with changes in the neuronal information processing architecture. Previous studies on EEG event-related brain oscillations suggest functional changes in alpha-bands with age during sensory and memory tasks. Specifically, the topographical distribution of both single-trial lower and upper alpha magnitude and the corresponding phase coherence is altered in elderly persons. Thus, alpha oscillations, associated not only with sensory, but also with sensorimotor functions, may be altered with age. Compensatory mechanisms, possibly reflected in increased frontal alpha synchronization, may thereby be of profound relevance. The present study investigates age-related differences in the modulation of alpha oscillatory activity related to sensory and sensorimotor functions, including response preparation, execution, and inhibition. EEG was recorded while 10 young and 10 elderly persons performed a visual evoked potential (VEP), a cued stimulus response (S-R), and a cued visual Go/NoGo task. Early event-related synchronization (ERS, 0-250ms) and late event-related desynchronization (ERD, 200-600ms) of single-trial lower and upper alpha was analyzed using poststimulus amplitude enhancement and intertrial phase coherence measures. The results show comparable modulations of lower (8-10 Hz) and upper (10-15 Hz) alpha activity in young and elderly related to the sensory and different forms of motor response processing. Specifically, reduced early lower alpha ERS as well as late upper alpha ERD at central locations characterized response inhibition processing in both age groups. We discuss the counterintuitive hypothesis that reduced efficacy of some basal neural inhibitory mechanisms enables older observers to perform better than or comparable to younger observers on some visual tasks, and conclude that alterations in alpha oscillatory networks with age may depend on the stimuli applied.

It consistently detects neural processing deficits in schizophrenia. So far MMN is assessed with different methods (electroencephalography, EEG; magnetoencephalography, MEG) and with different paradigms: the "traditional" oddball design with rare deviants (20%) or the "optimum" design with 50% deviants varying in one of five parameters each. These MMN measures may not reflect one unitary mechanism which is equally affected in schizophrenia. We compared both designs in 12 patients with schizophrenia and controls using MEG and EEG. Automated, observer-independent data analysis rendered the procedures suitable for clinical applications. The optimum design was fastest to detect MMN and MEG had the best signal-to-noise ratio. In addition MMN was mostly reduced in schizophrenia if measured with MEG in the optimum paradigm. Optimized paradigms improve sensitivity and speed for the detection of schizophrenia endophenotypes. Dysfunctions in this disorder may lie primarily in the fast and automatic encoding of stimulus features at the auditory cortex. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we obtained EEG data during a modified dot-probe task using internet-related words and neutral words in graduates with high internet addiction tendency. Stimulus type effects on ERPs were tested by repeated-measures ANOVAs. Participants exhibited larger P300 positive wave components of the EAP on internet-related wordy than on neutral words. At Cz and Pz sites, the P300 waves were more positive in internet-related condition than in neutral condition. In the central and posterior areas P300 waves were more positive in the internet-related condition than in the neutral condition and this difference was significant. This study provides neurophysiological evidence that information processing of internet-related information is abnormal in graduates with high internet addiction tendency. The results provide further cognitive and neurobiological information for the internet addiction.

The time-frequency analysis of single-trial ERP data allows to specify in a reliable manner whether the P3 reduction in schizophrenia is due to the decreased P3 response in single trials or due to the intertrial variability in the timing of the response. Since the delta response most strongly contributes to the P3 amplitude, we focused to the low frequency range of the time-frequency transformed data. EEG was recorded from chronic schizophrenia patients and matched healthy controls during a simple visual oddball task. The wavelet transforms of the averaged ERP and the single trials were computed to investigate the amplitudes of the evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) delta (1-3 Hz) responses, respectively. Evoked delta activity and P3 amplitude to target stimuli were both reduced significantly in patients with schizophrenia, whereas no such difference was obtained for the total delta activity. The significant reduction of the evoked delta response and the absence of such a difference in the total delta response of schizophrenia patients reveals that the delta band response is weakly phase-locked to stimulus in schizophrenia. This result suggests that the reduced P3 amplitudes in the averaged ERPs of schizophrenia patients result from a temporal jitter in the activation of neural circuits engaged in P3 generation.

These are all capabilities that develop during infancy and childhood, but the human mirror neuron system has been poorly studied using neurophysiological measures. This study measured the brain activity of 6-month-old infants and adults using a high-density EEG net with the aim of identifying mirror neuron activity. The subjects viewed both goal-directed movements and non-goal-directed movements. An independent component analysis was used to extract the sources of cognitive processes. The desynchronization of the mu rhythm in adults has been shown to be a marker for activation of the mirror neuron system and was used as a criterion to categorize independent components between subjects. The result is showed significant mu desynchronization in the adult group and significantly higher ERP activation in both adults and 6-month-olds for the goal-directed action observation condition. This study demonstrate that infants as young as 6 months display mirror neuron activity and is the first to present a direct ERP measure of the mirror neuron system in infants.

In fMRI-constrained source analysis, event-related potential (ERP) generator locations are defined by fMRI activation patterns, and their contribution to the scalp ERP signal is probed. In contrast, ICA assumes that networks of cortical generators can be separated on the basis of their statistical independence. While good arguments can be put forward to justify both approaches, it is unclear how results from both methods compare. A clarification of these issues is of utmost importance to reconcile findings made using identical paradigms but these two complementary analysis methods. As both methods share the concept of spatially static sources a natural space to compare both methods and to crossvalidate the respective findings is at the level of source activity in the form of dipole source waves and independent component time courses and their corresponding maps. We used fMRI-constrained source analysis and ICA followed by clustering using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to analyze data from a working memory experiment. We demonstrate that crossvalidation is indeed possible using an appropriate statistical test. However, the sensitivity of this crossvalidation approach is ultimately limited by the low number of dimensions that contribute significant variance to the grand average scalp ERP We conclude that testing at the single-subject level is preferable for crossvalidation purposes if the signal-to-noise ratio of the data allows for this approach.

The precise function of these rhythms is not clear. We used simultaneous EEG-fMRI during a bimanual motor task to localize brain areas involved in Rolandic alpha and beta EEG rhythms. The identification of these rhythms in the MR environment was achieved by a blind source separation algorithm. Rhythm "strength", i.e. spectral power determined by wavelet analysis, inversely correlated most strongly with the fMRI-BOLD signal in the postcentral cortex for the Rolandic alpha (mu) rhythm and in the precentral cortex for the Rolandic beta rhythm. FMRI correlates of Rolandic alpha and beta rhythms were distinct from those associated with the posterior "classical" alpha rhythm, which correlated inversely with the BOLD signal in the occipital cortex. An inverse correlation with the BOLD signal in the respective sensory area seems to be a general feature of "idle rhythms". Hum Brain Mapp 30:1168-1187, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss. Inc.

This calibration, however, implies inconvenience to the end users. In this paper, we propose an online-adaptive-learning method to address this problem for P300-based brain computer interfaces. By automatically capturing subject-specific EEG characteristics during online operation, this method allows a new user to start operating a P300-based brain-computer interface without guided (supervised) calibration. The basic principle is to first learn a generic model termed subject-independent model offline from EEG of a pool of subjects to capture common P300 characteristics. For a new user, a new model termed subject-specific model is then adapted online based on EEG recorded from the new subject and the corresponding labels predicted by either the subject-independent model or the adapted subject-specific model, depending on a confidence score. To verify the proposed method, a study involving 10 healthy subjects is carried out and positive results are obtained. For instance, after 2-4 min online adaptation (spelling of 10-20 characters), the accuracy of the adapted model converges to that of a fully trained supervised subject-specific model.

On the basis of findings showing that the frequency characteristic of the P1 component lies in the alpha range and that alpha oscillation is functionally associated with inhibition, we predict that the P1 component also reflects inhibitory processes. This hypothesis is tested in two experiments, a spatial-cuing task and a visual-semantic categorization task. The results of the cuing task demonstrate that in a similar way as alpha power, the P1 component is larger over task-irrelevant ipsilateral sites. For the categorization task, we found that the P1 component, in a similar way to alpha oscillations, is larger for task-irrelevant, distorted pictures. We conclude that the P1 component may be generated at least in part by evoked alpha oscillations and reflects inhibition in the sense of suppressing task-irrelevant processes.

Therefore, we examined the impact of secondary task performance (an auditory oddball task) on a primary driving task (lane keeping). Twenty healthy participants performed two 20-min tests in the Divided Attention Steering Simulator (DASS). The visual secondary task of the DASS was replaced by an auditory oddball task to allow recording of brain activity. The driving task and the secondary (distracting) oddball task were presented in isolation and simultaneously, to assess their mutual interference. In addition to performance measures (lane keeping in the primary driving task and reaction speed in the secondary oddball task), brain activity, i.e. event-related potentials (ERPs), was recorded. Performance parameters on the driving test and the secondary oddball task did not differ between performance in isolation and simultaneous performance. However, when both tasks were performed simultaneously, reaction time variability increased in the secondary oddball task. Analysis of brain activity indicated that ERP amplitude (P3a amplitude) related to the secondary task, was significantly reduced when the task was performed simultaneously with the driving test. This study shows that when performing a simple secondary task during driving, performance of the driving task and this secondary task are both unaffected. However, analysis of brain activity shows reduced cortical processing of irrelevant, potentially distracting stimuli from the secondary task during driving. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These movement related HGB modulations may play an important role in sensorimotor cortex function. It is however currently not clear to what extent this type of neural activity can be detected using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) and how similar HGB responses in healthy human subjects are to those observed in epilepsy patients. Using the same arm reaching task, we have investigated spectral power changes both in intracranial ECoG recordings in epilepsy patients and in non-invasive EEG recordings optimized for detecting HGB activity in healthy subjects. Our results show a common HGB response pattern both in ECoG and EEG recorded above the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the side of arm movement. In both cases, HGB activity increased around movement onset in the 60-90 Hz range and became most pronounced at reaching movement end. Additionally, we found EEG HGB activity above the frontal midline possibly generated by the anterior supplementary motor area (SMA), a region that was however not covered by the intracranial electrodes used in the present study. In summary, our findings show that HGB activity from human sensorimotor cortex can be non-invasively detected in healthy subjects using EEG, opening a new perspective for investigating the role of high gamma range neuronal activity both in function and dysfunction of the human cortical sensorimotor network.

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of tactile spatial-selective attention on spatiotemporal aspects of evoked neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We employed simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 14 right-handed subjects during bilateral index finger Braille stimulation to investigate the relationship between attentional effects on somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) components and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The 1st reliable EEG response following left tactile stimulation (P50) was significantly enhanced by spatial-selective attention, which has not been reported before. FMRI analysis revealed increased activity in contralateral S1. Remarkably, the effect of attention on the P50 component as well as long-latency SEP components starting at 190 ms for left stimuli correlated with attentional effects on the BOLD signal in contralateral S1. The implications are 2-fold: First, the correlation between early and long-latency SEP components and the BOLD effect suggest that spatial-selective attention enhances processing in S1 at 2 time points: During an early passage of the signal and during a later passage, probably via re-entrant feedback from higher cortical areas. Second, attentional modulations of the fast electrophysiological signals and the slow hemodynamic response are linearly related in S1.

Enhancement of Signal-to-noise Ratio of Peroneal Nerve Somatosensory Evoked Potential Using Independent Component Analysis and Time-Frequency Template	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP); Independent component analysis (ICA); Peroneal nerve; Time-frequency template	ARTIFACTS; EEG	This study aims to recover the somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) from the smearing electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with the proposed time-frequency SSEP template (TF-SSEP). The SSEPs induced from patients with the impaired motor functions exhibit longer latency and lower amplitude than the normal SSEPs and are inevitably contaminated by artifacts and environmental noise. Although ICA has been demonstrated as a novel technique to segregate the EEG into independent sources, the selection of task-related components needs to be further elaborated. The TF-SSEP template, generated by the Morelet wavelet transformation of the averaged SSEPs from three normal subjects, was used to automatically extract the SSEP-related features. The performance of the TF-SSEP template was further validated using EEGs through the left and right peroneal nerve stimulation of four stroke patients. After ICA decomposition, the sources were selected for reconstruction if their correlation coefficients with the TF-SSEP template were higher than the predetermined threshold. On the other hand, the unselected sources were considered as the event-unrelated components or artifacts. Among all patients, the topography maps at four peak times, namely P40, N45, P60 and N75, showed higher contrast in the vicinity of the foot-associated motor area, and the resolved SSEPs demonstrated uncontaminated waveforms in comparison with the conventionally averaging method. This indicated that the proposed method can remarkably suppress artifacts and effectively extracted the SSEP-related features.	[Hung, C. I.; Wu, Y.

The impact of attention on these gating measures is still not fully resolved. In the current study, the impact of attention on sensory gating was studied by scalp and intracranial recordings. The study sample consisted of epilepsy and tumor patients undergoing presurgical evaluation by means of implanted electrodes. In the unattend condition, patients had no overt task. In the active condition, patients had to count simultaneously trials with paired clicks, as well as interspersed trials with single clicks. The ERPs in the active condition were characterized by an underlying negativity both for scalp and neocortical recordings, reaching their maximum at the N100 latency of the 2nd stimulus. A time-frequency analysis revealed that this attention effect comprised only low frequency signals (<3 Hz). In line with that, P50 amplitude and P50 gating were unaffected by attention when data were filtered from 10 to 50 Hz. In addition, attention effects were revealed for intrahippocampal ERP components and for induced high frequency neocortical gamma band activity. Findings indicate that N100 and P200 gating measures can potentially be affected by attention and have to be interpreted carefully when studying clinical populations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Mode level cognitive subtraction (MLCS) quantifies spatiotemporal reorganization in large-scale brain topographies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						functional connectivity; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; cognitive subtraction; mode decomposition; mode level cognitive subtraction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTEGRATION; EEG; VALIDATION; TRANSITION; HUMANS; MEG	Contemporary brain theories of cognitive function posit spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal reorganization as mechanisms for neural information processing. Corresponding brain imaging results underwrite this perspective of large-scale reorganization. As we show here, a suitable choice of experimental control tasks allows the disambiguation of the spatial and temporal components of reorganization to a quantifiable degree of certainty. When using electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG or MEG), Our approach relies on the identification of lower dimensional spaces obtained from the high dimensional data of suitably chosen control task conditions. Encephalographic data from task conditions are reconstructed within these control spaces. We show that the residual signal (part of the task signal not captured by the control spaces) allows the quantification of the degree of spatial reorganization, such as recruitment of additional brain networks.

Methods: We evaluated BOLD changes specifically related to the main physiological EEG rhythms (alpha, beta, theta, delta, spindles) in 15 epilepsy patients with rare discharges (all the regressors were included in the same general linear model to improve specificity). Results: We found a consistent effect of spindles, alpha and theta. For alpha, BOLD was positively correlated in thalami and putamen, and negatively correlated in the occipital, parietal and frontal lobes. For theta, a negative correlation was found over the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes. Spindles were correlated with a positive BOLD in thalami and putamen. Rhythm regressors added as confounds in the fMRI analysis explained at least 5% of BOLD signal Variance in 6.8 +/- 8.9% of gray matter voxels, a contribution which is of the order of typical changes in fMRI studies. Conclusion: First, we found specific cerebral Structures involved in each main EEG rhythm generation. Second, fluctuations of these rhythms following vigilance changes are responsible for noteworthy BOLD changes. Significance: Physiological EEG rhythms may be integrated to the analysis of EEG-fMRI in Studies with fluctuation of alertness, to eliminate possible confounding factors.

Methods: Subjects performed a feedback-based learning task. Event-related Potentials (ERPs) time locked to responses and feedback were derived from the EEG. Results: Compared to the TD and ASD groups, the medication-free ADHD group showed a decreased response-locked Error Related Negativity (ERN) and error Positivity (Pe), particularly as learning progressed throughout the task. Compared to the medication-free ADHD group, the Methylphenidate-treated group showed a normalised Pe. All clinical groups showed or tended to show a decreased feedback-locked late positive potential to negative feedback. Conclusions: The ERPs suggest that medication-free children with ADHD, but not with ASD, have a diminished capacity to monitor their error responses when they are learning by performance feedback. This capacity partially 'normalises' in Mph-treated children with ADHD. Both children with ADHD and children with ASD are Suggested being compromised in affective feedback Processing. Significance: This study shows that measuring ERPs of error and feedback processing is a useful method for (1) dissociating ADHD from ASD and (2) elucidating medication effects in ADHD on component processes of performance monitoring.

We show that older adults exhibit a selective deficit in suppressing task-irrelevant information during visual working memory encoding, but only in the early stages of visual processing. Thus, the employment of suppressive mechanisms are not abolished with aging but rather delayed in time, revealing a decline in processing speed that is selective for the inhibition of irrelevant information. EEG spectral analysis of signals from frontal regions suggests that this results from excessive attention to distracting information early in the time course of viewing irrelevant stimuli. Subdividing the older population based on working memory performance revealed that impaired suppression of distracting information early in the visual processing stream is associated with poorer memory of task-relevant information. Thus, these data reconcile two cognitive aging hypotheses by revealing that an interaction of deficits in inhibition and processing speed contributes to age-related cognitive impairment.

Present findings show that intellectually gifted children had significantly larger delta activity than their normal peers in mismatch negativity (MMN) component, while in P3a component, which originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, intellectually gifted children had both significantly larger delta and theta activities than their normal peers. The present findings further supported that low-frequency brain activity could be regarded as the basis of intelligence and cognitive functions, and spectral EEG time-frequency analysis technique should be used to explore some new aspects of brain activity relating to intelligence.

Combining these advantages of EEG with dipole-tracing analysis incorporating a realistic three-layer head model (scalp-skull-brain head model; SSB/DT) allows for the detection of dipoles in the millisecond range and investigation of the processing of cognitive function and movement execution. In this study, we constructed a scalp-skull-brain head model from Montreal Neurological Institute standard brain images and detected dipole localizations in the millisecond range from grand-averaged negative slope (NS) to motor potentials during a simple pinching movement. The simple self-initiated left and right motor execution activated different areas: the left movement activated the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), putamen, rostral cingulate cortex and rostral premotor area, which are associated with cognitive functions and self-initiated decisions. These areas were associated with the early NS potential during left pinching movement preparation. The right movement activated the caudal cingulate cortex, pre-SMA and caudal premotor area, and these areas were activated just before the execution of movement. In the primary stage of the cognitive circuit for motor control, pre-SMA-putamen are activated before the onset of NS that relates cognitive function as decision making, response selection in time perception and motivation.

In the present study, we have developed an approach to image the cortical rhythmic modulation associated with motor imagery using minimum-norm estimates in the frequency domain (MNEFD). The distribution of cortical sources of mu activity during online control of BCI was obtained with the MNEFD. Contralateral decrease (event-related desynchronization) and ipsilateral increase (event-related synchronization) are localized in the sensorimotor cortex during online control of BCI in a group of human subjects. Statistical source analysis revealed that maximum correlation with movement imagination is localized in sensorimotor cortex.

Phonetic combinations are used in this method. During the DL paradigm, recently developed system is able to mark the time point on the continuous electroencephalograph), (EEG) at which the DL stimulus is applied to the person in real time. By applying this new method, DL paradigm, we can evaluate the event related potentials of each ear advantages. Also we can elucidate how auditory system processes the knowledge. In this preliminary study, the main aim was to apply the standardized "Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography" (sLORETA) method to EEG data of DL paradigm. Secondly, sLORETA was applied to different ear advantage (heteronymous and homonymous) event related potentials (ERPs) as a new approach. The preliminary results indicate that for the heteronymous condition the activation found in the superior temporal gyrus in the early stages, moves to central frontal gyrus in the late stages. The differences between the conditions of heteronymous and homonymous arise in frontal activation in the late stages. These findings which indicate the spatial-temporal resolution of the brain's dynamic processing can be beneficial for the clinical applications.

Wavelet analysis of the EEG during the neurocognitive evaluation of invalidly cued targets	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						P3a; P3b; Spectral power; ITC; Trial evaluation; Invalid cue	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; P300 COMPONENT; ATTENTION; ALPHA; TASK; POTENTIALS; THETA; ERP; CONTRIBUTES	In a spatial central cueing paradigm, positions in the horizontal meridian were cued to evaluate the neurocognitive processing of validly (V) and invalidly cued (I) targets. ERPs were obtained from 20 EEG channel recordings. Complex Morlet wavelets were applied for computing event-related spectral power (ERSP) modulations and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC). P3a and P3b responses were increased in a statistically significant manner in I targets with regard to V targets. This increase seems to be generated only by phase resetting without enhancement of spectral power. Comparing ERSP modulations between I and V target trials we found a major effect centred in the alpha range. The following results were obtained for invalid condition in relation to valid condition: 6-12Hz ERSP decrease topographically widespread over the scalp, starting around 450ms and peaking around 650ms; 10-14Hz ERSP increase peaking around 200ms at fronto-central electrodes; and 10-14Hz ERSP decrease occurring from 400 to 600ms at posterior electrodes. Therefore, the invalidity effect indeed produces salient changes in the stimulus related and ongoing neuronal activity leading to a brain state of comparative higher activity both excitatory and inhibitory with respect to the validly cued target processing.

This paper try to detect Error-related potentials (ErrP) elicited when a human user want to monitors an external system upon which he has no control whatsoever. To this end we use a Bayesian filter to classify erroneous or correct events. On average over three subjects, the proposed probabilistic classifier achieves single-trial classification of 85% for correct trials and 71% for erroneous trials.

Scalp-recorded ssSEPs were analysed by means of dipole source analysis to achieve optimal separation of left and right hemisphere ssSEPs. The time course of ssSEP modulation at the source level was extracted by means of a wavelet transform. in addition to the extraction of ssSEPs, the analysis included the derivation of lateralized attention and movement-related potentials, i.e. the attention-directing anterior negativity (ADAN) and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). The results revealed a time course of ssSEP modulation remarkably similar to the time course of ADAN and LRP. The time course was characterized by a reduction of ssSEP amplitude at latencies just following the peak latency of the ADAN (similar to 400 ms) and the peak latency of the LRP (similar to 1200 ms). This reduction was greater for contralateral than for ipsilateral movements. The study demonstrates that ssSEP methodology represents a feasible approach to the measurement of movement-related changes in cortical excitability, which may be used to resolve ambiguities in the interpretation of lateralized event-related brain potentials.

Right frontal cortex generates reward-related theta-band oscillatory activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; ERRORS; STRIATUM; EEG; EXPECTATION; SENSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY	When participants in a gambling game are given feedback as to whether they won or lost the previous bet, a series of stereotypical brain electrical responses can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the stimulus-locked Event-Related Potential (ERP). These include the Feedback-Related Mediofrontal Negativity (FRN), a posterior P300, and a feedback-induced increase in power at the theta (4 to 8 Hz) band over frontal scalp. Although the generators of the FRN and P300 have been studied previously, little is known about the generator of feedback-induced theta. We employed a gambling game in which participants chose either high-risk/high-reward or low-risk/low-reward bets to investigate these feedback-related responses. The FRN was not modulated by the riskiness of the bet, but both P300 and feedback-induced theta were of greater amplitude following high-relative to low-risk bets. Using a bilateral multi-source Beamformer approach, we localized the induced theta-band responses following wins and losses to partially overlapping regions in the right medial frontal cortex, possibly including the Anterior Cingulate. Using a dipole-fitting approach, we found that the generators of feedback-induced theta are anatomically distinct from those of the FRN and P300. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study used electroencephalography to investigate the brain activity elicited in response to a neutral, inverted, and split face and compared this to the activity produced in response to a non-facial stimulus (a clock). Results showed that the N170 response amplitude was larger and its latency longer during recognition of split and inverted faces as compared to a normal face, whereas no amplitude change was seen for the different clock configurations. However, for the P300 component, larger amplitudes were observed in both the face and the object condition. Taken together, the results suggest that unusual human face presentations are detected at earlier stages than unusual object presentations.

Long term effects of left frontal rTMS on EEG and ERPs in patients with depression	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						depression; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; event-related potenital; QEEG; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; treatment	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ASYMMETRIES; PERFUSION	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression has been under investigation in many controlled studies over the last 20 years. Little is known about the neurobiological action of rTMS in patients. We therefore investigated pre- and post-treatment effects on QEEG, ERP's and behavior (BDI and NEO-FFI). rTMS treatment was applied in 8 subjects for an average of 21 sessions to the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (left DLPFC). Clients were assessed on a QEEG and Oddball ERP evaluation pre-and post-treatment. Clients were stimulated over the left DLPFC with 10 Hz rTMS (100% MT). Furthermore, rTMS treatment was complimented by psychotherapy. All subjects showed full remission within 20 sessions and there was a significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (BDI score) after 10 and 15 sessions and a clear decrease in the Neuroticism and an increase on the extraversion scale of the NEO-FFI personality questionnaire. Pre- and post-l measurements did not reveal treatment specific effects, but only an indirect right frontal increase in delta power. On the other hand. ERP measures did reveal treatment specific effects by showing an increased positivity in the post-treatment ERP's specifically left frontal. The P2 amplitude demonstrated a significant left frontal increase in amplitude, whereas for the negative N1 and N2 a significant decrease in amplitude was observed. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that rTMS can be a safe and efficacious treatment modality for depression. Furthermore, a specific left frontal increase in positivity for the ERP's was found (increased P2 and decreased N1 and N2 components) most likely related to the rTMS over the left DLPFC. Furthermore, there was no change in the alpha asymmetry lending support to the fact that frontal alpha asymmetry can be considered a trait marker for depression. The findings from this pilot study require future replication with larger sample sizes.

Audiovisual integration underlying this phenomenon is often studied in EEG experiments in which the event related brain potential (ERP) elicited by a bimodal stimulus is compared to the sum of ERPs triggered by auditory and visual signals of the same source. However, this method leads to spurious results in time ranges when ERP components common to all these stimulus types are present. A method that aims to filter out such common early anticipatory potentials is data high-pass filtering. In the present study, first, we demonstrated that subtle changes in filter cut-off frequency lead to remarkably different results on the interaction effect so that no reliable conclusion on the spatial distribution of the interaction could be drawn. Second, we suggested a different approach for the investigation of ERP correlates of audiovisual integration: bimodal syllables modified by light temporal asynchrony were presented to subjects and ERPs correlating with the fused and unfused perceptions were compared. We found that components corresponding to both auditory N1 and P2 waves were smaller in case of the fused perception, supporting the view that NI and P2 generator activities are suppressed during multimodal speech perception. The N1 effect showed a clearly right hemisphere dominance while the effect around the P2 peak was most pronounced on centroparietal electrodes and dominated over the left hemisphere.

Thirty male and 30 female respondents solved four tasks while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Also recorded was the percentage of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (%StO(2)) in the respondents' frontal brain areas with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The main findings of the study can be summarized as follows. (1) Most pronounced differences between males and females were observed for the factor modality-visual/auditory. (2) Gender related differences in neuroelectric brain responses could be observed during the solution of auditory and visual tasks; however, on the behavioral level only for the visual tasks did females display shorter reaction times than males. The ERP amplitudes of the early evoked gamma response, P1, and P3 were higher in females than males, whereas the N4 amplitude was higher in males than females. The differences were more noticeable in the visual modality. The NIRS showed a more bilateral involvement of the frontal brain areas in females as compared with a more left hemispheric frontal activity in males. In the task conditions an increase in right hemispheric activity in females was observed; however, this increase was less pronounced in the visual than the auditory domain, indicating a more lateralized processing of visual stimuli in females. Taken all together the results suggest that the females' visual event-categorization process is more efficient than in males. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, this framework has been extended and established in the magneto/encephalography (M/EEG) domain. DCM for M/EEG entails the inversion a full spatiotemporal model of evoked responses, over multiple conditions. This model rests on a biophysical and neurobiological generative model for electrophysiological data. A generative model is a prescription of how data are generated. The inversion of a DCM provides conditional densities on the model parameters and, indeed on the model itself. These densities enable one to answer key questions about the underlying system. A DCM comprises two parts; one part describes the dynamics within and among neuronal sources, and the second describes how source dynamics generate data in the sensors, using the lead-field. The parameters of this spatiotemporal model are estimated using a single (iterative) Bayesian procedure. In this paper, we will motivate and describe the current DCM framework. Two examples show how the approach can be applied to M/EEG experiments.

The stimuli were several morphed images containing seven facial emotions (neutral, anger, happiness, disgust, sadness, surprise, and fear) and ten-graded intensity levels to parametrically control these aspects of facial emotions. Brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography as the subjects detected the facial emotion and assessment of intensity. We found that the temporal profile of detection was quite different from the assessed its intensity. A positive component 100 ms after stimulus onset (PI 00) was significantly correlated with the correct detection of facial emotion, whereas a negative component 170 ms after stimulus onset (N170) was significantly correlated with the assessment of intensity level. The source of both the P100 and N170 signals was consistently localized to the right occipito-parietal region. We propose phased processing of facial emotion, in which rapid detection of any facial emotion occurs within 100 ms and detailed processing, including the assessment of the intensity, occurs shortly afterwards.

When beef primes reef more than leaf: Orthographic information affects phonological priming in spoken word recognition	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Language/speech; Cognition; Normal volunteers; EEG/ERP	FEEDBACK CONSISTENCY; SPEECH; REPRESENTATIONS; REPETITION; ACTIVATION; LANGUAGE; LOCUS	This study was designed to investigate orthographic effects on spoken word recognition by combining the priming paradigm with a measure of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Primes and targets either shared both orthography and phonology of the rhyme (beef-reef) or they shared rhyme phonology only (leaf-reef). The two "related'' conditions were compared against an "unrelated'' condition (sick-reef). The results revealed a significant orthographic priming effect that was present on the early part of the N400 and that occurred as early as the phonological priming effect itself. Importantly, phonological and orthographic priming effects had different topographic distributions: The phonological priming effect was localized over centro-posterior regions, whereas the orthographic priming effect was more anterior. These results support a theory according to which orthographic information is coactivated online in spoken word recognition.

Event-related potentials were used to replicate results concerning an attention related modulation of neural processes and to investigate the involvement of prefrontal cortex in this modulation. 16 healthy subjects executed an n-back task with sequentially presented faces and scenes. Attention was selectively directed to only one stimulus category. We found an enhancement of the N170 amplitudes for relevant stimuli compared to irrelevant or neutral stimuli. Late frontal amplitudes were stronger positive for relevant compared to neutral stimuli indicating selective attention processes of working memory. Evidence for selective inhibition was not found.

J	Vocat, R; Pourtois, G; Vuilleumier, P				Vocat, Roland; Pourtois, Gilles; Vuilleumier, Patrik			Unavoidable errors: A spatio-temporal analysis of time-course and neural sources of evoked potentials associated with error processing in a speeded task	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERN; error-related negativity; ACC; error processing; error monitoring; awareness; anxiety; topographic analysis; spatial clustering	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; ERP COMPONENTS; NEUROCOGNITIVE MECHANISMS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	The detection of errors is known to be associated with two successive neurophysiological components in EEG, with an early time-course following motor execution: the error-related negativity (ERN/Ne) and late positivity (Pe). The exact cognitive and physiological processes contributing to these two EEG components, as well as their functional independence, are still partly unclear. Furthermore, these components are typically obtained in conditions where errors are rare events relative to correct trials, and thus presumably implicate other cognitive and motivational processes besides error monitoring. Here, we investigated error processing using high-density scalp ERPs and advanced topographical analyses in healthy participants, during a new Go/noGo task that led to many errors within a relatively short period of time, yet without generating frustration or insufficient motivation. ERP results showed the presence of two distinct electrophysiological markers of error monitoring (ERN/Ne and Pe) during this task, even though errors were practically as frequent as correct responses. Topographic mapping analyses showed for the first time that both the ERN/Ne and Pe elicited a specific distribution of electrical activity relative to correct responses (not just a change in the amplitude of electric signals), suggesting the activation of a distinct configuration of intracranial generators during error detection. This was confirmed by additional analyses using dipole source localization, showing generators in anterior cingulate cortex contributing to the ERN/Ne, but in more posterior cingulate regions for Pe. Moreover, we found that, across all participants, the magnitude of the ERN/Ne correlated with the level of state anxiety, even in the subdinical range, whereas the Pe was correlated negatively with the total number of errors and positively with the improvement of response speed on correct trials. By contrast, no significant relation was found between error monitoring ERPs and individual measures of impulsivity. Taken together, these data suggest that these two successive EEG components associated with errors reflect different monitoring processes, with distinct neural substrates in cingulate cortex. While ERN/Ne processes in anterior cingulate might primarily mediate error detection, Pe processes in posterior cingulate might be more directly related to behavioral adjustment based on the outcome of current actions.

ERPs were recorded from 64 electrodes in 10 healthy university students while three types of emotional Pictures (pleasant, neural, and unpleasant) from the international affective picture system were presented. All the Subjects showed significantly greater P300 and slow waves amplitudes at antero-inferior, medial-inferior and posterior electrode sites for pleasant and unpleasant pictures than for neural pictures and unpleasant pictures elicited more positive P300 and slow wave effects than pleasant pictures.

However, studies of such topic in adults are few and controversial. We prospectively assessed the possible influence of IDA and iron supplementation (for 3 months) on cognitive function and intelligence of 28 young adults with IDA. We used group of hematological, cognitive, neurophysiological tests for assessment including: mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Wechsler memory scale-revised (WMS-R), Wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (WAIS-R), event-related potentials (ERPs), and electroencephalography (EEG). Compared to controls, patients demonstrated lower scores of different cognitive tests (MMSE, WMS-R, and WAIS-R), which showed significant improvement after treatment. Prolongation of ERPs latencies (N200 and P300) and reduction in their amplitudes (P200 and P300) were identified with significant increase in amplitude occurred after treatment. EEG abnormalities were observed in 55% of patients which showed improvement in 35% after treatment. Positive correlation was identified before and after treatment between hemoglobin levels and MMSE (P = 0.01, 0.05), total verbal (P = 0.04) and performance (P = 0.05, 0.04) IQ scores. Negative correlation was identified between before and after treatment between P300 latency and total IQ of WAIS-R (P = 0.03, 0.008) and hemoglobin level (P = 0.4, 0.01). Positive correlation was found before and after treatment between P300 amplitude and total IQ (P = 0.028, 0.01) and serum iron (P = 0.01, 0.001). In conclusion, IDA is a significant factor in cognitive performance in adult population, which can be partially reversed by treatment.

This article introduces the basics of time-frequency methods, which are typically applied for the analysis of event-related oscillations, focusing on adaptive procedures (e.g., wavelet networks). The potential of these methods is illustrated. Findings about event-related oscillations (gamma responses, theta responses) in children performing an auditory selective attention task are reviewed. Both the neuronal substrates of gamma (30-70 Hz) networks and the ability to synchronize these networks in relation to task-specific processes are available in children and adolescents from 9 to 16 years of age. Developmental changes in the task reactivity of synchronized gamma oscillations may provide evidence for a transition in cognitive processing strategies emerging at the age of 12-13 years. Event-related theta (3-7.5 Hz) activity is enhanced in two latency ranges. The early event-related theta response occurring 0-200 ms after a stimulus may be associated with representations of relevant target features in working memory. The late fronto-central theta response (200-450ms) could be related to the processing of task-irrelevant information. In summary, event-related oscillations can be analyzed using time-frequency methods like wavelet networks. This approach should be used intensively to study neurocognitive development in children.

Single-Trial Evoked Brain Responses Modeled by Multivariate Matching Pursuit	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Auditory evoked fields (AEF); electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG); multivariate matching pursuit (MMP)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG; VARIABILITY; DECOMPOSITION	We present a new approach to the analysis of brain evoked electromagnetic potentials and fields. Multivariate version of the matching pursuit algorithm (MMP) performs an iterative, exhaustive search for waveforms, which optimally fit to signal structures, persistent in all the responses (trials) with the same time of occurrence, frequency, phase, and time width, but varying amplitude. The search is performed in a highly redundant time-frequency dictionary of Gabor functions, i.e., sines modulated by Gaussians. We present the feasibility of such a single-trial MMP analysis of the auditory M100 response, using an illustrative dataset acquired in a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurement with auditory stimulation with sinusoidal 1-kHz tones. We find that the morphology of the M100 estimate obtained from simple averaging of single trials can be very well explained by the average reconstruction with a few Gabor functions that parametrize those single trials. The M100 peak amplitude of single-trial reconstructions is observed to decrease with repetitions, which indicates habituation to the stimulus. This finding suggests that certain waveforms fitted by MMP could possibly be related to physiologically distinct components of evoked magnetic fields, which would allow tracing their dynamics on a single-trial level.

Category specificity in early perception: face and word N170 responses differ in both lateralization and habituation properties	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; event-related potentials; N170; face processing; word processing; habituation; adaptation; lateralization	HUMAN BRAIN; FUSIFORM GYRUS; TIME-COURSE; RECOGNITION; EXPERTISE; OBJECT; REPETITION; COMPONENT; SCALP; ERPS	N170 event-related potential (ERP) responses to both faces and visual words raises questions about category specific processing mechanisms during early perception and their neural basis. Topographic differences across word and face N170s suggests a form of category specific processing in early perception - the word N170 is consistently left-lateralized, while less consistent evidence supports a right-lateralization for the face N170. Additionally, the face N170 shows a reduction in amplitude across consecutive individual faces, a form of habituation that might differ across studies thereby helping to explain inconsistencies in lateralization. This effect remains unexplored for visual words. The current study directly contrasts N170 responses to words and faces within the same subjects, examining both category-level habituation and lateralization effects. ERP responses to a series of different faces and words were collected under two contexts: blocks that alternated faces and words vs. pure blocks of a single category designed to induce category-level habituation. Global and occipito-temporal measures of N170 amplitude demonstrated an interaction between category (words, faces) and block context (alternating categories, same category). N170 amplitude demonstrated class-level habituation for faces but not words. Furthermore, the pure block context diminished the right-lateralization of the face N170, pointing to class-level habituation as a factor that might drive inconsistencies in findings of right-lateralization across different paradigms. No analogous effect for the word N170 was found, suggesting category specificity for this form of habituation. Taken together, topographic and habituation effects suggest distinct forms of perceptual processing drive the face N170 and the visual word form N170.

As the stimulus context of this task differs from the traditional two-stimulus oddball paradigm, the purpose here was to apply EEG/fMRI integration to investigate the localization and activities of the P300 generators involved with this task. Material/Methods: Ten healthy subjects performed the visual P300 task while fMRI and 64-channel ERP data were acquired. The voltage topographical maps of die P300 component were calculated and analyzed for die main activation foci. Furthermore, constraints from fMRI Were Used to identify the source activities of visual P300 ERR Results: Analysis of the hemodynamic response to the visual target stimuli revealed a distributed network of neural sources in the bilateral parietal lobules, middle and inferior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus. The analysis particularly showed preponderant, activations of the bilateral superior parietal lobules. in this target detection design, two distinct P300 peaks were observed in the dipole waveforms, the bilateral prefrontal and the light inferior parietal dipole waveforms displayed the higher peak at. short. latency, while the four parietal, die anterior cingulate, and the temporal dipole waveforms had the higher peak at long latency Conclusions: Compared with the classical oddball paradigm, the amplitude decreased in this study, which might be related to its particular stimulus context. The source technique was utilized to yield A realistic 11-dipole model and distinguish the anatomical generators of early and late components of the P300 response.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of automatic ocular filtering procedures in the conclusions drawn from a pharmaco-EEG trial. Regression analysis, gold standard, and blind source separation (BSS), Second Order Blind Identification algorithm, ocular filtering procedures were compared using time, frequency, topographic and tomographic brain mapping approaches and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships. Data consisted of EEGs obtained from 20 volunteers who received single oral doses of haloperidol 3 mg, risperidone 1 mg, olanzapine 5 mg and placebo in a randomized crossover double-blind design. Although the BSS-based technique preserved brain activity more than regression analysis in anterior leads, in general, topographic significance probability maps globally showed similar results with both methods for most spectral variables. However, different results were obtained when using whole multi-channel information for studying drug effects in the brain: (i) higher correlations between PK and PD time courses showing that BSS allowed estimation of spectral variables more accurately related to drug effects and (ii) larger and more symmetric drug related tomographic LORETA maps showing that BSS led to results that were more neurophysiopharmacologically sound. Definitely, the BSS-based procedure is an effective and efficient preprocessing method to remove ocular artifacts from EEG data. The selection of the ocular filtering procedure could determine different results whose impact depends on the evaluating tool applied to analyze the pharmaco-EEG data.

EEG auditory event-related potentials were collected from 14 healthy volunteers, and the statistical values of wavelet-transformed EEG in gamma band were decomposed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to identify where the differences appeared in the time, frequency and spatial domains. The results showed that the changes of brain states caused by SD appeared around 40 Hz at about 400 ms after stimulation on prefrontal and frontal lobes. Negative effects of SD on neuronal activity and oscillation were observed. The analysis of the EEG data by the wavelet transform and PARAFAC can be an integrated way to estimate the change of brain states in the three domains.

Whereas target shape was always the task-relevant stimulus attribute, either target location (location-based task) or motion direction within the target stimuli (motion-based task) was used as a source of conflict. Data from ten healthy participants who performed both tasks are presented. In the motion-based task the incompatible condition showed smaller P300 amplitudes at Pz than the compatible condition and the location-based task yielded a trend towards a reduced P300 amplitude in the incompatible condition. For both tasks, no P300 latency differences between the conditions were found at Pz. The results suggest that the motion-based task elicits behavioral and electrophysiological effects comparable with regular Simon tasks. As all stimuli in the motion-based Simon task were presented centrally the present data strongly argue against the attention-shifting account as an explanatory approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of recording EEG is to obtain magnetically evoked and event related potentials. The issue of electrode heating is discussed and experimental results presented that show graphite as well as fully notched or "C" silver, gold or silver-silver chloride are suitable for current rTMS protocols. Standard silver or gold cup electrodes may cause excessive scalp heating. Removal or reduction of the magnetically induced stimulus artefact is also discussed. A new system is presented that uses sample and hold circuitry to block most of the artefact allowing the researcher to record ipsi- and contra-lateral evoked potentials occurring within the first few milliseconds of the magnetic stimulus.

The Effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome on Response Execution and Inhibition: An Event-Related Potential Study	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Electroencephalography; Event-Related Potentials; Response Inhibition	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PRENATAL ALCOHOL; REACTION-TIME; STIMULUS PROBABILITY; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ERP COMPONENTS; GO/NOGO TASK; WESTERN-CAPE; EXPOSURE	Background: Both executive function deficits and slower processing speed are characteristic of children with fetal alcohol exposure, but the temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying cognitive processing deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder have rarely been studied. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the nature of alcohol-related effects on response inhibition by identifying differences in neural activation during task performance. Methods: We recorded ERPs during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in 2 groups of children in Cape Town, South Africa (M age = 11.7 years; range = 10 to 13)-one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 7); the other, a control group whose mothers abstained or drank only minimally during pregnancy (n = 6). Children were instructed to press a "Go" response button to all letter stimuli presented except for the letter "X," the "No-go" stimulus, which occurred relatively infrequently. Results: Task performance accuracy and reaction time did not differ between groups, but differences emerged for 3 ERP components-P2, N2, and P3. The FAS/PFAS group showed a slower latency to peak P2, suggesting less efficient processing of visual information at a relatively early stage (similar to 200 ms after stimulus onset). Moreover, controls showed a larger P2 amplitude to Go versus No-go, indicating an early discrimination between conditions that was not seen in the FAS/PFAS group. Consistent with previous literature on tasks related to cognitive control, the control group showed a well-defined, larger N2 to No-go versus Go, which was not evident in the FAS/PFAS group. Both groups showed the expected larger P3 amplitude to No-go versus Go, but this condition difference persisted in a late slow wave for the FAS/PFAS group, suggesting increased cognitive effort. Conclusions: The timing and amplitude differences in the ERP measures suggest that slower, less efficient processing characterizes the FAS/PFAS group during initial stimulus identification. Moreover, the exposed children showed less sharply defined components throughout the stimulus and response evaluation processes involved in successful response inhibition. Although both groups were able to inhibit their responses equally well, the level of neural activation in the children with FAS/PFAS was greater, suggesting more cognitive effort. The specific deficits in response inhibition processing at discrete stages of neural activation may have implications for understanding the nature of alcohol-related deficits in other cognitive domains as well.

Twenty children with AD/HD and 20 matched controls aged between 8 and 14 years performed visual Go-Nogo (30% Nogo) and Flanker tasks while EEG was recorded. Results indicated that children with AD/HD traded off speed for accuracy in the Go-Nogo task, resulting in similar levels of response inhibition accuracy; in the Flanker task response speed and errors were at control levels, while misses were increased and showed an enhanced interference effect. In the Go-Nogo task, the AD/HD group showed reduced Go/Nogo P2, a reduced central N2 Nogo>Go effect, and a more anterior Go/Nogo P3 compared to controls. For the Flanker task, the AD/HD group showed delayed NI and P2, dramatically reduced N2 to Incongruent stimuli, enhanced N2 to Neutral stimuli, as well as increased P3 to Incongruent stimuli, compared to controls. These results indicate that Go-Nogo behavioral inhibition and Flanker interference control were not equally impaired in children with AD/HD, and that factors such as effort, arousal and motivation require further investigation.

In both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), deviants elicited an N300 component, sometimes accompanied by a slow wave. Both components had a symmetrical distribution, but the former was more posterior than the latter. The same responses to prosodic stimuli were significant in 6 of 27 patients with severe disorders of consciousness (persistent vegetative state and minimally conscious state) and in all 3 of the examined locked-in patients, indicating that the procedure can be applied for testing neurological patients. The occurrence of significant responses depended on the presence or absence of a lesion to the right temporal lobe. Obviously, the N300 depends on the activity of the right temporal cortex but does not originate there. We suggest that the component is related not to the recognition of affective prosody as such, but to the following detection of affective mismatch due to violations of emotional context of stimulation.

ERP effects of caricaturing familiar and unfamiliar faces	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						face perception; event-related potential; face learning; caricature; EEG; face-space	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; UNIFIED ACCOUNT; FACIAL DISTINCTIVENESS; GEOMETRIC DISTORTIONS; STIMULUS REPETITIONS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; TYPICALITY; PERCEPTION; SPACE	We report two experiments in which participants classified familiarity and rated best-likeness of photorealistic spatial caricatures and anti-caricatures (up to a distortion level of 30%) in comparison to veridical pictures of famous faces (Experiment 1) and personally familiar faces (,Experiment 2). In both experiments there was no evidence for a caricature advantage in the behavioural data. In line with previous research, caricatures were perceived as worse likenesses than veridical pictures and moderate anti-caricatures. In Experiment 2, ERPs for familiar faces were largely unaffected by spatial caricaturing, whereas clear effects of caricaturing were observed for unfamiliar faces, for which caricaturing elicited increased occipito-temporal N170 and N250 responses. Whereas increases in N170 amplitude were limited to the first half of the experiment, increases in N250 were largest after a number of stimulus repetitions in the second half of the experiment. In the second half, ERPs to caricatured unfamiliar faces became more similar to ERPs to familiar faces, whereas ERP differences between familiar and unfamiliar faces remained prominent for veridicals and anti-caricatures. In the context of previous reports of caricature effects for line-drawings, these results imply that non-spatial (e.g., texture) information plays a prominent role for familiar face recognition, whereas spatial caricaturing maybe particularly important for the recognition of unfamiliar faces, by increasing their distinctiveness.

To contribute to a better understanding of the neurophysiological underpinnings of habituation in auditory processing and its disturbance in schizophrenia we used three different approaches to analyze auditory evoked responses, namely phase-locking (PL) analyses, single trial amplitudes, and averaged event-related potentials (P50 and N100). Given that brain oscillations reflect the neuronal correlates of information processing we hypothesized that PL and amplitudes reflect even more essential parts of auditory processing than the averaged ERP responses. In 32 schizophrenia patients and 32 matched controls EEG was continuously recorded using an auditory paired click paradigm. PL of the lower frequency bands (alpha and theta) was significantly reduced in patients whereas no significant differences were present in higher frequencies (gamma and beta). Alpha and theta PL and amplitudes showed a marked increase after the first click and to a minor degree after the second one. This habituation was more prominent in controls whereas in schizophrenia patients the response to both clicks differed only slightly. N100 suppression was significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients whereas no group differences were present with respect to the P50. This corresponded to the finding that Gamma mostly contributed to the prediction of the P50 response and theta mostly to the N100 response. Our data showed that analyzing phase and amplitude in single trials provides more information on auditory information processing and reflects differences between schizophrenia patients and controls better than analyzing the averaged ERP responses.

To date, experimental paradigms vary as to whether or not they require participants immediately to stop working on the ongoing task whenever they encounter a PM event (cue) and directly switch to the prospective action (task-switch approach). Alternatively, several other paradigms used in the literature encourage participants to continue working on the ongoing task item after the cue, and only then, perform the prospective action (dual-task approach). The present study explores the possible behavioural and electrophysiological effects that both approaches may have on PM performance. Seventeen young adults performed both versions of a standard PM task in a counterbalanced order during which behavioural data and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Behavioural data showed a decrement in PM performance in the task-switch compared to the dual-task condition. In addition, EEG data revealed differences between the dual-task and task-switch approach in event-related potential (ERP) components associated with response inhibition and with post-retrieval monitoring (i.e. late positive complex). No differences between the two tasks were found with regard to the PM event detection processes (i.e. N300) and the retrieval of the intended action from long-term memory. In sum, findings demonstrate that it does make a difference which task approach is applied and suggest that dual-task and task-switch paradigms may result in different processing and neurophysiological dynamics particularly concerning attentional resources and cognitive control.

By comparison, to fit EEG electrodes on the forehead area is much easier because there is no hair on it. If correlations of the EEGs generated from the forehead area are high with respect to EEGs from the sensorimotor area, it is then possible to achieve relatively high classification accuracy in motor imagery tasks just using EEG from forehead channels. In this way, it will help to make the procedure of motor imagery tasks much easier and convenient. Because correlation coefficients is often used to measure the similarity of two signals, it is necessary to study whether there is a high correlation between forehead channels' EEG and EEG from sensorimotor area during MI(Motor Imagery) tasks. In this paper, EEG data from three subjects were used in the tests. Firstly, a test was conducted on the correlation between EEGs from forehead 8(Fp1-Af8) channels and EEGs from the sensorimotor area channel C3, C4 during the MI tasks. The correlation is calculated with respect to ERP (Event-Related-Potential), Spectral Power between 6-25Hz, and ERSP (Event-Related-Spectral-Perturbation) at Alpha rhythms 8-12Hz. The results of the correlation tests are mostly above 70%. In particular, for subject Sl1, the correlation coefficient of ERSP between forehead channels and C3, C4 are as high as 0.9 during the left hand movement imagery trials. Secondly, we did a test on the classification of imagined left/right hand movement tasks using EEGs from 8 electrodes in the forehead. Classification results show that the accuracy of the forehead 8 channels' EEGs are as high as 81% for subject Sk6 comparing to 90% using 29 channels' EEG signal neighboring to C3, C4. For subject Sk3 and subject Sl1, the accuracies are 65% and 79% comparing to 80% and 83% using EEG signals from 29 channels neighboring to C3, C4. So there are high correlation between EEGs from the forehead area and EEGs from the sensorimotor area. That is to say, we can use EEGs from forehead in some situations, such as classification of left/right imagery, because they are much easier to measure than EEG form the sensorimotor area. This will make BCI system more portable and more convenient to use.

Intermodal Auditory, Visual, and Tactile Attention Modulates Early Stages of Neural Processing	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; GAMMA-BAND; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; CORTEX; PHASE; COMPONENTS	We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and gamma band oscillatory responses (GBRs) to examine whether intermodal attention operates early in the auditory, visual, and tactile modalities. To control for the effects of spatial attention, we spatially coregistered all stimuli and varied the attended modality across counterbalanced blocks in an intermodal selection task. In each block, participants selectively responded to either auditory, visual, or vibrotactile stimuli from the stream of intermodal events. Auditory and visual ERPs were modulated at the latencies of early cortical processing, but attention manifested later for tactile ERPs. For ERPs, auditory processing was modulated at the latency of the Na (29 msec), which indexes early cortical or thalamocortical processing and the subsequent P1 (90 msec) ERP components. Visual processing was modulated at the latency of the early phase of the C1 (62-72 msec) thought to be generated in the primary visual cortex and the subsequent P1 and N1 (176 msec). Tactile processing was modulated at the latency of the N160 (165 msec) likely generated in the secondary association cortex. Intermodal attention enhanced early sensory GBRs for all three modalities: auditory ( onset 57 msec), visual (onset 47 msec), and tactile (onset 27 msec). Together, these results suggest that intermodal attention enhances neural processing relatively early in the sensory stream independent from differential effects of spatial and intramodal selective attention.

A Spatiotemporal Framework for Estimating Trial-to-Trial Amplitude Variation in Event-Related MEG/EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Event-related magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG); expectation-maximization (EM); independent response (IR); linear dynamical system response (LDSR); maximum likelihood (ML); trial-to-trial variability	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; HUMAN-BRAIN; NOISY SIGNALS; VARIABILITY; POTENTIALS; ALGORITHM; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LATENCIES; DYNAMICS	A spatiotemporal framework for estimating trial-to-trial variability in evoked response (ER) data is presented. Spatial and temporal bases capture the aspects of the response that are consistent across trials, while the basis expansion coefficients represent the variable components of the response. We focus on the simplest case of constant spatiotemporal response shape and varying amplitude across trials. Two different constraints on the amplitude evolution are employed to effectively integrate the individual responses and improve robustness at low SNR. The linear dynamical system response constraint estimates the current trial amplitude as an unknown constant scaling of the estimate in the previous trial plus zero-mean Gaussian noise with unknown variance. The independent response constraint estimates response amplitudes across trials as independent Gaussian random variables having unknown mean and variance. We develop a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the signal waveform, noise covariance matrix, and unknown constraint parameters. ML source localization is achieved by scanning the likelihood over different sets of spatial bases. We demonstrate the variability estimation and source localization effectiveness of the proposed algorithms using both real and simulated ER data.

This work uses a physiology-based continuum model of neuronal activity in the human brain to calculate theoretical cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) from the model's linearized response. These are fitted to experimental data, allowing the fitted parameters to be related to brain physiology. This approach yields excellent fits to CAEP data, which can then be compared to fits of EEG spectra. It is shown that the differences between resting eyes-open EEG and standard CAEPs can be explained by changes in the physiology of populations of neurons in corticothalamic pathways, with notable similarities to certain aspects of slow-wave sleep. This pilot study demonstrates the ability of our model-based fitting method to provide information on the underlying physiology of the brain that is not available using standard methods.	[Kerr, C.

Temporal activation patterns of lateralized cognitive and task control processes in the human brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						event related potentials (ERPs); current source density reconstruction (CDR); posterior parietal cortex (PPC); Broca's area; anterior cingulated cortex (ACC)	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PARIETAL CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FMRI; FLUENT; EEG	In a recent fMRI study with identical word stimuli we demonstrated task-dependent lateralization of brain activity during visual processing, with left-hemispheric activations for letter decisions and right-hemispheric activations for visuospatial decisions (Stephan, K.E., Marshall, J.C., Friston, K.J., Rowe, J.B., Ritzl, A., Zilles, K., Fink, G.R., 2003. Lateralized Cognitive Processes and Lateralized Task Control in the Human Brain. Science 301, 384-386). In order to explore the temporal dynamics of these lateralized processes we here recorded multichannel event-related potentials (ERPs) using the same stimuli. ERP data were analysed with current source density reconstruction (CDR). Contrasting the ERP results elicited by the two tasks, source deconvolution showed enhanced activity during letter decisions in Broca's area from 200-250 ins during letter decisions and during visuospatial decisions in the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) from 175-200ms and 250-275 ms. Prior to these activations ERP data revealed an initiation of activity within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) from 125-150 ms followed by a late activation of this region from 400-425 ms. Consistent with our previous fMRI study the current electrophysiological data support the notion that lateralized cognitive processes may depend on task requirements rather than stimulus properties. The current results extend our previous findings as they allow insights into the temporal dynamics of these lateralized processes and their relations to task control processes. The temporal deconvolution of ERPs suggests an early differential involvement of Broca's area in letter-processing and of PPC during visuospatial processing. In addition, activation of ACC prior and after this differential activation is consistent with previous findings suggesting that this area may be involved in cognitive control. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

PRIMING OF OBJECT CATEGORIZATION WITHIN AND ACROSS LEVELS OF SPECIFICITY	PSIHOLOGIJA			English	Article						implicit memory; task-switching; visual object representation; EEG; ERPs	GAMMA BAND RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; REPETITION; TASK; IDENTIFICATION; PICTURES; RECOGNITION	Identification of objects can occur at different levels of specificity. Depending on task and context, an object can be classified at the superordinate level (as an animal), at the basic level (a bird) or at the subordinate level (a sparrow). What are the interactions between these representational levels and do they rely on the same sequential processes that lead to successful object identification? In this electroencephalogram study, a task-switching paradigm (covert naming or living/non-living judgment) was used. Images of objects were repeated either within the same task, or with a switch from a covert naming task to a living or non-living judgment and vice versa. While covert naming accesses entry-level (basic or subordinate), living/non-living judgments rely oil superordinate classification. Our beha-vioural results demonstrated clear priming effects within both tasks. However asymmetries were found when task-switching had occurred, with facilitation for covert naming but not for categorization. We also found lower accuracy and early-starting and persistent enhancements Of event-related potentials (ERPs) for covert naming, indicating that this task was more difficult and involved more intense perceptual and semantic processing. Perceptual priming was marked by consistent reductions of the ERP component L1 for repeated presentations, both with and without task switching. Additional repetition effects were found in early event related activity between 150-190 ms (N1) when a repeated image had been named at initial presentation. We conclude that differences in N1 indicate task-related changes in the identification process itself Such enhancements for covert naming again emerge in a later time window associated with depth of semantic processing. Meanwhile, L1 reflects modulations due to implicit memory of objects. In conclusion, evidence was found for representational overlap; changes in ERP markers started early and revealed cross-task priming at the level of object structure analysis and more intense perceptual and semantic processing for covert naming.

Methods: Sixteen control, 17 dyslexic, 16 ADHD, and 15 comorbid adults performed the task, comprising a valid, invalid, and no-cue condition. Performance measures were errors and reaction time (RT). A negative potential in response to cues and targets (N2), and a positive potential in response to targets (P3) were derived from the EEG. A 2 x 2 design was used with the factors dyslexic/non-dyslexic, and ADHD/non-ADHD. Results: Dyslexic participants demonstrated a smaller cue-related N2, yet a greater target-related N2 in the valid condition. ADHD participants were discriminated by the P3 difference between the invalid and valid conditions. Comorbids differed from ADHD mainly in invalid-valid RT, and were similar to dyslexics in target N2 processing. Conclusions: Dyslexics were impaired in early information processing, and participants with ADHD differed for later processing stages. Significance: This is the first ERP study of attentional processes in dyslexia to incorporate all ADHD and a comorbid group. Its results may contribute to differentiation of these clinical groups.

BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						attention; awareness; consciousness; detection; EEG; ERP; perception	ATTENTIONAL BLINK; CHANGE BLINDNESS; CONSCIOUSNESS; INDEPENDENCE; EVENTS	To examine the neural correlates and timing of human visual awareness, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in two experiments while the observers were detecting a grey dot that was presented near subjective threshold. ERPs were averaged for conscious detections of the stimulus (hits) and nondetections (misses) separately. Our results revealed that hits, as compared to misses, showed a negativity around 180-350 ms at occipital and posterior temporal sites. It was followed by a positive wave after 400-500 ms, peaking at parietal sites. These correlates were not affected by a manipulation of attention. The early negativity, called 'visual awareness negativity' (VAN), may be a general, primary electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The present data show that it can be observed in response to appearance of a stimulus in visual awareness and that it generalizes across different manipulations of stimulus visibility.

In EEG recordings, the detection of task-relevant stimuli elicits the P300 component, a transient response with latency around 300 ms. The P300 response has been shown to be affected by the amount of mental effort and learning, as well as habituation. Furthermore, trial-by-trial variability of the P300 component has been associated with inter-stimulus interval, target-to-target interval or target probability; however, understanding the mechanisms underlying this variability is still an open question. In order to investigate whether it could be related to the distinct cortical networks in which coherent intrinsic activity is organized, and to understand the contribution of those networks to target detection processes, we carried out a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, collecting data from 13 healthy subjects during a visual oddball task. We identified five large-scale networks, that largely overlap with the dorsal attention, the ventral attention, the core, the visual and the sensory-motor networks. Since the P300 component has been consistently associated with target detection, we concentrated on the first two brain networks, the time-course of which showed a modulation with the P300 response as detected in simultaneous EEG recordings. A trial-by-trial EEG-fMRI correlation approach revealed that they are involved in target detection with different functional roles: the ventral attention network, dedicated to revealing salient stimuli, was transiently activated by the occurrence of targets; the dorsal attention network, usually engaged during voluntary orienting, reflected sustained activity, possibly related to search for targets.

Hemispheric dominance for mental rotation: it is a matter of time	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						EEG; event-related potential; evoked potentials; hemispheric asymmetries; mental rotation; right hemisphere; right parietal; visual-evoked sensory potential	NEURAL MECHANISMS; ACTIVATION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; HANDEDNESS	Mental rotation is often said to be a right-hemisphere function. The evidence for this claim, however, remains equivocal. To investigate whether right-hemispheric superiority relates to speed of processing, we measured the latencies and amplitudes of individual participant's mental-rotation event-related potential effects over the parietal electrodes. The results suggest that increases in parietal negativity begin around 400 ms after stimulus onset, and continue until 550 ms over the right hemisphere, and 610 ms over the left hemisphere. The effect of orientation on event-related potential amplitudes during those times do not differ between hemispheres. These results indicate that the lateralization effect is primarily related to timing, rather than the extent of cortical involvement.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic temporal and topographical characteristics of event related potentials (ERPs) obtained with diotic and dichotic consonant-vowel (CV) stimuli from the same subjects. We used a novel approach in which we concurrently analyzed on a trial-by-trial basis ERP parameters during trials that resulted in a right ear advantage (REA) or left ear advantage (LEA) or that were presented under diotic (homonymous) conditions. CV syllables were used as auditory stimuli (/ba/, /da/, /ga/, /ka/, /pa/, /ta/). The EEG measurements were performed with 64 channels by mainly focusing on the N1P2, N2P3 and late negativity (LN) components. Overall, behavioral data revealed a clear REA. The central area showed higher amplitudes than the other locations for N1P2 responses. Additionally, responses were faster for the diotic, compared to the dichotic conditions. The LN had shorter latencies in trials resulting in a REA, compared with those producing a LEA. This result makes it likely that the overall REA is a time-bound effect. which can be explained by the structural theory of Kimura. Furthermore, the results demonstrated a specific spatiotemporal shift from central to frontal areas between N1P2 and LN that was pronounced in dichotic trials. This shift points towards the involvement of frontal areas in resolving conflicting input. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ERP correlates of anticipatory attention: spatial and non-spatial specificity and relation to subsequent selective attention	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						human; visual attention; top-down control	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN PARIETAL CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; PREPARATORY STATES	Brain-based models of visual attention hypothesize that attention-related benefits afforded to imperative stimuli occur via enhancement of neural activity associated with relevant spatial and non-spatial features. When relevant information is available in advance of a stimulus, anticipatory deployment processes are likely to facilitate allocation of attention to stimulus properties prior to its arrival. The current study recorded EEG from humans during a centrally-cued covert attention task. Cues indicated relevance of left or right visual field locations for an upcoming motion or orientation discrimination. During a 1 s delay between cue and S2, multiple attention-related events occurred at frontal, parietal and occipital electrode sites. Differences in anticipatory activity associated with the non-spatial task properties were found late in the delay, while spatially-specific modulation of activity occurred during both early and late periods and continued during S2 processing. The magnitude of anticipatory activity preceding the S2 at frontal scalp sites (and not occipital) was predictive of the magnitude of subsequent selective attention effects on the S2 event-related potentials observed at occipital electrodes. Results support the existence of multiple anticipatory attention-related processes, some with differing specificity for spatial and non-spatial task properties, and the hypothesis that levels of activity in anterior areas are important for effective control of subsequent S2 selective attention.

Enhancement of activity of the primary visual cortex during processing of emotional stimuli as measured with event-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy and event-related potentials	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						emotion; NIRS; optical topography; EPN	BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTIVATION; PICTURES; AROUSAL; LIGHT; TASK; FEAR; IMAGES; FMRI	In this study we investigated whether event-related near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is suitable to measure changes in brain activation of the occipital cortex modulated by the emotional content of the visual stimuli. As we found in a previous pilot study that only positive but not negative stimuli differ from neutral stimuli (with respect to oxygenated haemoglobin), we now measured the event-related EEG potentials and NIRS simultaneously during the same session. Thereby, we could evaluate whether the subjects (n = 16) processed the positive as well as the negative emotional stimuli in a similar way. During the task, the subjects passively viewed positive, negative, and neutral emotional pictures (40 presentations were shown in each category, and pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System, IAPS). The stimuli were presented for 3 s in a randomized order (with a mean of 3 s interstimulus interval). During the task, we measured the event-related EEG potentials over the electrode positions O1, Oz, O2, and Pz and the changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin by multichannel NIRS over the occipital cortex. The EEG results clearly show an increased early posterior negativity over the occipital cortex for both positive as well as negative stimuli compared to neutral. The results for the NIRS measurement were less clear. Although positive as well as negative stimuli lead to significantly higher decrease in deoxygenated haemoglobin than neutral stimuli, this was not found for the oxygenated haemoglobin.

In the present study, we assessed whether children's neurophysiological responses to salient and socially significant emotional distractersemotional faceswere related to broader emotion regulation capacities. Emotion regulation was measured as attention performance following emotional distracters and as maternal report of child emotional dysregulation. Electroencephalography was recorded while participants (15 children aged 5-9) performed an attention task. Scalp-recorded event related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to emotional distracters (fearful, sad, and neutral faces) and reflected a range of rapid attentional and face processing operations (P1, N1, N170, and Nc). P1 latencies were faster whereas N1 amplitudes were reduced to fearful compared to sad faces. Larger P1 and Nc amplitudes to fearful and sad faces were correlated with more effective emotion regulation. Results are discussed in terms of mechanisms in emotion regulation and the use of ERPs to detect early risk for psychopathology and inform intervention efforts.

A forced choice reaction task under different effort conditions has been previously used to demonstrate single-trial EEG-fMRI coupling effects for an early ERP component (N1: 70-150 ms) measured on a single scalp channel (Cz), thereby providing the first multi-modal evidence of early anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation in effortful decision making (Mulert, C., Seifert, C., Leicht, G., Kirsch, V., Ertl, M., Karch, S., Moosmann, M., Lutz, J., Moller, H.J,, Hegerl, U., Pogarell, O., Jager, L., 2008. Single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI reveals the involvement of early anterior cingulate cortex activation in effortful decision making. Neuroimage 42, 158-168.). In this work, we searched for "effort-specific" ERP-N1 sources and explored their single-trial EEG-fMRI correlations for discovering "source-specific" inter-modality Coupling effects. To this end, we performed a whole-cortex distributed ERP analysis and used the local source power trial-by-trial variation as an input for single-trial EEG-fMRI coupling analysis. We found a high-effort-specific ERP-N1 Source in the ACC and statistically significant differential EEG-fMRI coupling spots in five cortical regions, including the ACC. Our results provide new insights about the neural origins of effort-specific EEG and fMRI response modulations in a choice reaction task and confirm the central role of early ACC activation in motivation-related decision making processes; we discuss the importance of combining distributed source modeling with single-trial coupling for enriching the interpretation of EEG-fMRI patterns.

Reduced brain responses to novel sounds in depression: P3 findings in a novelty oddball task	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Depression; ERP; P3; Novelty; Attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CURRENT-DENSITY; COMPLEX TONES; AMPLITUDE; DISORDER; STIMULI	There have been conflicting findings as to whether the P3 brain potential to targets in oddball tasks is reduced in depressed patients. The P3 to novel distracter stimuli in a three-stimulus oddball task has a more frontocentral topography than P3 to targets and is associated with different cognitive operations and neural generators. The novelty P3 potential was predicted to be reduced in depressed patients. EEG was recorded from 30 scalp electrodes (nose reference) in 20 unmedicated depressed patients and 20 matched healthy controls during a novelty oddball task with three stimuli: infrequent target tones (12%), frequent standard tones (76%) and nontarget novel stimuli, e.g., animal or environment sounds (12%). Novel stimuli evoked a P3 potential with shorter peak latency and more frontocentral topography than the parietal-maximum P3b to target stimuli. The novelty P3 was markedly reduced in depressed patients compared to controls. Although there was a trend for patients to also have smaller parietal P3b to targets, this group difference was not statistically significant. Nor was there a group difference in the earlier N1 or N2 potentials. The novelty P3 reduction in depressed patients is indicative of a deficit in orienting of attention and evaluation of novel environmental sounds. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Model order estimation for independent component analysis of epoched EEG signals	BIOSIGNALS 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL II			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Bio-Inspired Systems and Signal Processing	JAN 28-31, 2008	Funchal, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technol Informat, Control & Commun, Univ Madeira, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Special Interest Grp Artificial Intelligence, Assoc Adv Artificial Intelligence		EEG; event related potentials; independent component analysis (ICA); Molgedey Schuster; TDSEP; model selection; cross validation	TOOLBOX	In analysis of multi-channel event related EEG signals indepedent component analysis (ICA) has become a widely used tool to attempt to separate the data into neural activity, physiological and non-physiological artifacts. High density elctrode systems offer an opportunity to estimate a corresponding large number of independent components (ICs). However, too large a number of ICs leads to overfitting of the ICA model, which can have a major impact on the model validity. Consequently, finding the optimal number of components in the ICA model is an important problem. In this paper we present a method for model order selection, based on a probabilistic framework. The proposed method is a modification of the Molgedey Schuster (MS) algorithm to epoched, i.e. event related data. Thus, the contribution of the present paper can be summarized as follows: 1) We advocate MS as a low complexity ICA alternative for EEG. 2) We define an epoch based likelihood function for estimation of a principled unbiased 'test error'. 3) Based on the unbiased test error measure we perform model order selection for ICA of EEG. Applied to a 64 channel EEG data set we were able to deten-nine an optimum order of the ICA model and to extract 22 ICs related to the neurophysiological stimulus responses as well as ICs related to physiological- and non-physiological noise. Furthermore, highly relevant high frequency response information was captured by the ICA model.

The authors' clinical observations suggested emotional lability might also be a noteworthy symptom. In a consecutive series of systemic lupus erythematosus clinic attendees the authors therefore measured depression, anxiety, and emotional lability. Additionally, based on reports linking emotional reactivity and transient mood changes to alterations in early attentional processes, the authors investigated event-related potential indices of preattentive and early orienting responses to auditory stimuli (NI, MMN, P3a and P3b). The authors observed that 15 of 32 participants with systemic lupus erythematosus had high lability scores and, comparing event-related potential measures between the high and low lability subgroups, noted that those with greater emotional lability demonstrated reduced response latencies in N1 and MMN paradigms.

Previous electrophysiological studies investigating this issue focused on brain potentials elicited after erroneous responses, mainly in simple speeded response tasks. In the present study, we investigated brain potentials before the commission of errors in a natural and complex situation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Expert pianists bimanually played scales and patterns while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were computed for correct and incorrect performances. Results revealed differences already 100 ms prior to the onset of a note (i.e., prior to auditory feedback). We further observed that erroneous keystrokes were delayed in time and pressed more slowly. Conclusions: Our data reveal neural mechanisms in musicians that are able to detect errors prior to the execution of erroneous movements. The underlying mechanism probably relies on predictive control processes that compare the predicted outcome of an action with the action goal.

It has been suggested that communicative impairments among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) might be caused by an inability to integrate synchronously presented visual and auditory cues. Method: We investigated audiovisual integration of speech stimuli among a group of high-functioning adult PDD individuals and age- and IQ-matched controls using electroencephalography, measuring both early pre-phonological, as well as late phonologically driven integration. Results: Pre-phonological AV interactions are intact, while AV interactions corresponding to more complex phonological processes are impaired in individuals with PDD. Conclusions: The present findings argue for a pattern of impairments on tasks related to complex audiovisual integration combined with relative sparing of low-level integrational abilities.

Enhanced EEG gamma-band activity reflects multisensory semantic matching in visual-to-auditory object priming	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; HEMISPHERIC LESIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; INTEGRATION; RECOGNITION; REPETITION; RESPONSES	An important step in perceptual processing is the integration of information from different sensory modalities into a coherent percept. It has been suggested that such crossmodal binding might be achieved by transient synchronization of neurons from different modalities in the gamma-frequency range (> 30 Hz). Here we employed a crossmodal priming paradigm, modulating the semantic congruency between visual-auditory natural object Stimulus pairs, during the recording of the high density electroencephalogram (EEG). Subjects performed a semantic categorization task. Analysis of the behavioral data showed a crossmodal priming effect (facilitated auditory object recognition) in response to semantically congruent stimuli. Differences in event-related potentials (ERP) were found between 250 and 350 ms, which were localized to left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) using a distributed linear source model. Early gamma-band activity (4050 Hz) was increased between 120 ms and 180 ms following auditory stimulus onset for semantically congruent stimulus pairs. Source reconstruction for this gamma-band response revealed a maximal increase in left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), an area known to be related to the processing of both complex auditory stimuli and multisensory processing. The data support the hypothesis that oscillatory activity in the gamma-band reflects crossmodal semantic-matching processes in multisensory convergence sites. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The injury has been postulated as transient and void of long-term consequences when rapidly diagnosed and properly managed. Emerging evidence, however, has suggested an increased risk for late life cognitive dysfunction in those with previous injuries. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate young adults with and without a history of concussion using a standard clinical assessment and highly sensitive electrophysiological measures for persistent changes in cognitive functioning. Ninety participants (19.7 +/- 1.3 years; 44 without mTBI and 46 with previous mTBI) were evaluated using the ImPACT and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that were recorded during a three-stimulus oddball task. Those with a history of concussion reported an average of 3.4 years post-injury. No significant differences were found between groups on the ImPACT. Significant decrements in the N2 and P3b amplitudes of the stimulus-locked ERP were noted for those with a history relative to those without a history of concussion. Although the previously concussed participants performed equal to those without injury on the clinical cognitive assessment, these findings support the notion that sport mTBI can no longer be thought of as a transient injury resulting in short-lived neurological impairment. It is not clear if these persistent deficits will manifest into clinical pathologies later in life.

Early gamma-band responses reflect anticipatory top-down modulation in the auditory cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; gamma oscillations; Expectancy; Tone sequences; Good continuation	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HUMAN EEG; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; SEQUENTIAL SOUNDS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT SEQUENCES; P300 COMPONENT; PHASE-LOCKING; TERM-MEMORY	For efficient and fast encoding of our complex acoustic environment, not only aspects of bottorn-up processing are significant, but rather top-down influences Such as attention, memory, and anticipation promote specific behavior and perception. Neural oscillatory activity in the gamma-range (30-80 Hz) is discussed as a conceivable candidate to represent very rapid modulations of top-down factors. We investigated effects of anticipation on early gamma-band responses (GBRs) of the EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to tone sequences. These sequences were composed of six sinusoidal tones, which could be either regularly ascending or descending in frequency. Thus, the sequences reflected a good continuation of pitch, which also resulted in the buildup Of Strong expectancies for the upcoming Stimulus Within the sequence. However, some of the tone sequences contained a violation of the good continuation of pitch at the third or fifth tone position. The early phase-locked portion of the gamma-band activity was significantly increased when tones were in line with the good continuation of sequences compared to deviant tones. Further, a pronounced early negative ERP response, starting at 150 ins, was elicited by deviant tones at the third and fifth position. Our results support the notion that gamma-band oscillations reflect perceptual grouping processes of concurrent Sounds and anticipatory top-down modulation, which involves some of the first stages of auditory information processing.

In this study we used a novel approach (intracerebral recordings of event-related potentials) to add to our knowledge of specific brain regions involved in affective picture processing. Ten intractable epileptic patients undergoing pre-surgical depth electrode recording viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures and intracerebral event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. A total of 752 Cortical and subcortical sites were investigated. Significant differences in ERPs to unpleasant as compared to neutral or pleasant pictures were frequently and consistently observed in recordings from Various brain areas - the mesial temporal Cortex (the amygdala, the hippocampus, the temporal pole), the lateral temporal cortex, the mesial prefrontal Cortex (ACC and the medial frontal gyrus). and the lateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, the mean latencies of responses to emotional Stimuli Were somewhat shorter in the frontal lobe structures (with evidently earlier activation within lateral prefrontal areas when compared to mesial prefrontal cortex) and longer in the temporal lobe regions. These differences, however, were not significant. Additional clearly positive findings were observed in some rarely investigated regions - in the posterior parietal cortex, the precuneus, and the insula. All approximately equivalent number of positive findings was revealed in the left and right hemisphere Structures, These results are in agreement with a multisystem model Of human emotion, distributed far beyond the typical limbic system and Substantially comprising lateral aspects of both frontal lobes as well.

The current work further investigated the role of non-phase locked activity in dissociation of the neural processes of environmental and personal risks. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults when they identified risky and safe environmental or personal events depicted in words or phrases. Event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in association with risky and safe environmental and personal events were calculated using Morlet's wavelet analysis. We found that, relative to the identification of safe environmental events, the identification of risky environmental events induced increased theta band power at 260-380 ms over the frontal cortex and increased alpha band power after 700 ms with a wide scalp distribution. Moreover, theta band powers associated with the identification of risky environmental events correlated positively with subjective ratings of the risk degree of environmental events. In contrast, the identification of risky personal events was linked to decreased alpha band power at 740-900 ms with a wide scalp distribution compared with the identification of safe personal events. Our findings indicate that theta and alpha band neural oscillations are involved in differentiation between environmental and personal risks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a previous study, we employed dense array EEG methodology to delineate the involvement of these two systems as human participants learn, through trial and error, to associate manual responses with arbitrary digit codes. The results were generally consistent with the dual-system learning model, pointing to the importance of both systems as learning progressed. In the present study, we replicate and extend the previous findings by examining the brain responses to error trials as well as examine the activity of these two systems' response to feedback processing. The results confirmed the role of these two systems in learning but they also provide a more complex view of their makeup and function. The frontal system includes ventral (inferior frontal gyrus, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal lobe) corticolimbic structures that are involved early in learning whereas the posterior system includes dorsal (anterior and posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobe) corticolimbic circuits that are engaged later in learning. Importantly, the engagement of each system during the course of learning is dependent on the nature of the events within the learning task. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Feature extraction in brain-computer interface (BCI) work is an important task that significantly affects the success of brain signal classification. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied together with Student's two-sample t-statistics for 2D time-scale feature extraction, where features are extracted from EEG signals recorded from subjects performing left and right MI. First, we utilize the CWT to construct a 2D time-scale feature, which yields a highly redundant representation of EEG signals in the time-frequency domain, from which we can obtain precise localization of event-related brain desynchronization and synchronization (ERD and ERS) components. We then weight the 2D time-scale feature with Student's two-sample t-statistics, representing a time-scale plot of discriminant information between left and right MI. These important characteristics, including precise localization and significant discriminative ability, substantially enhance the classification of mental tasks. Finally, a correlation coefficient is used to classify the MI data. Due to its simplicity, it will enable the performance of our proposed method to be clearly demonstrated. Compared to a conventional 2D time-frequency feature and three well-known time-frequency approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed method provides reliable 2D time-scale features for BCI classification.

The transient post-synaptical potential could be observed from the recorded electroencephalogram (EEC) signal. Properties derived from time domain and frequency domain such as event-related motor potential and suppression in band power could be useful EEG features. In this report, lateralised motor potential (LMP) and band power ratio (BPR) are used to classify cued left-fingers and right-fingers movements. Two classifiers are employed in this experiment: minimum distance classifier (MDC) and normal density Bayes classifier (NDBC). The results show that the features from LMP has more discriminative power than band power ratio. They also show that NDBC has a perfect performance in this task.

This may result from magnetic susceptibility effects which lead to signal drop-out and image distortion, as well as the perturbation of the radiofrequency fields, which can cause local signal changes and a global reduction in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of magnetic resonance images. Here, we quantify the effect of commercially available 32 and 64 electrode caps on the quality of MR images obtained in scanners operating at magnetic fields of 1.5, 3 and 7 T, via the use of MR-based, field-mapping techniques and analysis of the SNR in echo planar image time series. The electrodes are shown to be the dominant source of magnetic field inhomogeneity, although the localised nature of the field perturbation that they produce means that the effect on the signal intensity from the brain is not significant. In the particular EEG caps investigated here, RF inhomogeneity linked to the longer ECG and EOG leads causes some reduction in the signal intensity in images obtained at 3 and 7 T. Measurements of the standard deviation of white matter signal in EPI time series indicates that the introduction of the EEG cap produces a small reduction in the image signal to noise ratio, which increases with the number of electrodes used.

In this letter, parametric spectral analysis, specifically partial directed coherence (PDC), is used to study the cortical connective causal-interdependence network under audiovisual cognitive processes within the time window of the NI component, i.e., 96-145 ms post-stimulus in the event-related potential (ERP). A total of 13 subjects (age: 22.9 +/- 0.8 years; male/female = 9/4) performed an audiovisual recognition task. Multichannel EEG signals were analyzed using an adaptive multivariate autoregressive model to identify causal influences between different cortical areas. Three different cortical connective networks were detected, and by comparing the cortical PDC network in the early cognitive process of audiovisual (VA) perception with that in unimodal situations (V or A), it was found that the left temporal cortex (TC) might be responsible for audiovisual integration. Such electrophysiological findings were highly consistent with previous functional neuroimaging results. Moreover, the results presented here show the dynamics of lateral causal influences during audiovisual integration.

Global theta oscillatory activity includes a posterior phase-locked component related to stimulus processing and a frontal-induced component modulated by directed attention. To investigate the presence of early deficits in the directed attention-related network in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), time-frequency analysis at baseline was used to assess global and induced theta oscillatory activity (4-6 Hz) during n-back working memory tasks in 29 individuals with MCI and 24 elderly controls (EC). At 1-year follow-up, 13 MCI patients were still stable and 16 had progressed. Baseline task performance was similar in stable and progressive MCI cases. Induced theta activity at baseline was significantly reduced in progressive MCI as compared to EC and stable MCI in all n-back tasks, which were similar in terms of directed attention requirements. While performance is maintained, the decrease of induced theta activity suggests early deficits in the directed-attention network in progressive MCI, whereas this network is functionally preserved in stable MCI.

Exploring event-related brain dynamics with tests on complex valued time-frequency representations	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						event related brain dynamics; EEG; intertrial coherence; complex statistics; phase locking; local FDR	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PHASE-RESET; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA; GAMMA; THETA; TASK	A question subject to intense debate is whether scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials are due to phase resetting of the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) or rather to the superimposition of time-locked components on background activity. The two hypotheses are usually assessed by means of statistics in the time-frequency domain, for example, through wavelet transformation of multiple EEG trials that yield for each time and frequency a scatter plot of complex values coefficients. Currently, intertrial phase correlation (phase locking or phase coherence) is taken as evidence for phase resetting at a given frequency and latency. Here we present a formal analysis using a complex t-statistic to illustrate that such measures are, in effect, tests for the mean vector of the repeated trials, and as such on their own are inappropriate measures of phase resetting. We also propose simple t-like statistics for testing changes in (i) the mean (presence of an event-related potential), (ii) the amplitude variance (presence of (de)synchronization) and (iii) the concentration of phases (phase locking). The first two statistics are found to be proper measures of the presence of a non-zero mean activity and induced activity, respectively. In the third case, two different tests are introduced: one based on measuring the alignment of coefficients in the complex plane and another derived from the argument that phase locking persists when the mean of the coefficients is removed. Both statistics gave unambiguous evidence of the presence of phase locking suggesting that they constitute promising tools in the analysis of event-related brain dynamics.

The task consisted of visually presented random ball shape stimuli, of which the 25% were target and 75% were standard stimuli. There were two tasks for a subject - EMF exposed task and sham exposed task. One task lasted 10 minutes, during the exposed task the EMF was switched on and off in one-minute intervals, so that the participants performed half of the task in exposed condition (EMF ON) and half of the task without the exposure (EMF OFF). The sham exposed task was identical to exposed task, except the EMF generator was switched off all the time. For analysis of the EEG event-related responses the channel Pz was used. The EEG responses of a task were grouped into four different categories taking into account the EMF exposure condition (ON, OFF) during the response and the response type (standard, target). The responses were averaged by categories. The EMF ON and OFF potentials were compared pair-wise. There were no statistically significant differences in responses in sham exposed tasks, neither in standard nor in target response components. In the exposed task the group mean N100 amplitude (measured from standard response) was -3,41+/-4,54 mu V in EMF ON category and -2,50+/-4,71 mu V in EMF OFF category, this difference was statistically highly significant (p< 0,00009). Differences in another components' amplitudes, latencies and in RT between EMF ON and OFF conditions were not significant during exposed tasks. It was concluded that modulated microwave effect has stronger impact on sensory components of EEG visual event-related potentials compared to later stages of visual information processing.

Sensory gating in intracranial recordings - The role of phase locking	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory evoked potentials; Electrocorticography; Schizophrenia; Auditory cortex; Electroencephalography	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; FREELY-MOVING RATS; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; POPULATION RESPONSES; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; SINGLE-UNIT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P50	For patients with schizophrenia, a deficient gating (or filtering) of sensory input has been described. One major approach to study this sensory gating is to measure event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to paired clicks. In these experiments, sensory gating is quantified as amplitude reduction of the ERP components P50 and N100 from the 1st to the 2nd stimulus. In ERP studies brain electrical signals are averaged over single trials. Alterations in phase locking might be one factor contributing to the observed deficits in sensory gating, but findings have been inconclusive as yet. In particular, the contribution of different frequency bands to the deficit required further investigation. We studied N100 gating by intracranial recordings in a sample of epilepsy patients and subdivided the group into good and poor gators of the intracranial ERP component N100. Data were evaluated by frequency specific wavelet-based phase and power analyses. Poor N100 gators had an increased phase locking in the frequency range from 6.0-15.1 Hz after the 2nd stimulus, as compared to good gators. Other group differences were apparent already before the 2nd stimulus. Poor gators had less phase locked beta band activity (20.2-30.0 Hz) than good gators 200 315 ms after the onset of the 1st stimulus. Within the group of poor gators, lower values of phase locking in this frequency range were also associated with lower gating ratios. The reduced beta band response in response to the 1st stimulus may reflect poorer memory encoding of the 1st stimulus in poor gators. This in turn might lead to increased demands to process the 2nd stimulus. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Age-related delay in information accrual for faces: Evidence from a parametric, single-trial EEG approach	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL CORTICAL-CELLS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SENESCENT RHESUS-MONKEYS; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL DEGRADATION; NEURAL SPECIALIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVOKED POTENTIALS; WHITE-MATTER	Background: In this study, we quantified age-related changes in the time-course of face processing by means of an innovative single-trial ERP approach. Unlike analyses used in previous studies, our approach does not rely on peak measurements and can provide a more sensitive measure of processing delays. Young and old adults (mean ages 22 and 70 years) performed a non-speeded discrimination task between two faces. The phase spectrum of these faces was manipulated parametrically to create pictures that ranged between pure noise (0% phase information) and the undistorted signal (100% phase information), with five intermediate steps. Results: Behavioural 75% correct thresholds were on average lower, and maximum accuracy was higher, in younger than older observers. ERPs from each subject were entered into a single-trial general linear regression model to identify variations in neural activity statistically associated with changes in image structure. The earliest age-related ERP differences occurred in the time window of the N170. Older observers had a significantly stronger N170 in response to noise, but this age difference decreased with increasing phase information. Overall, manipulating image phase information had a greater effect on ERPs from younger observers, which was quantified using a hierarchical modelling approach. Importantly, visual activity was modulated by the same stimulus parameters in younger and older subjects. The fit of the model, indexed by R(2), was computed at multiple post-stimulus time points. The time-course of the R(2) function showed a significantly slower processing in older observers starting around 120 ms after stimulus onset. This age-related delay increased over time to reach a maximum around 190 ms, at which latency younger observers had around 50 ms time lead over older observers. Conclusion: Using a component-free ERP analysis that provides a precise timing of the visual system sensitivity to image structure, the current study demonstrates that older observers accumulate face information more slowly than younger subjects. Additionally, the N170 appears to be less face-sensitive in older observers.

A dose-response investigation of the benefits of napping in healthy young, middle-aged and older adults	SLEEP AND BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS			English	Article						aging; daytime napping; event-related potentials; quantitative electroencephalography; sleep	EVOKED K-COMPLEX; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG ACTIVITY; DAYTIME NAP; 20-MIN NAP; SLEEP LOSS; POPULATION; DENSITY; BRAIN	Older adults experience more fragmented sleep, greater daytime sleepiness and, nap more often than younger adults. Little research has investigated the effects of napping on waking function in older adults. In the present study, waking cognitive performance was examined in 10 young (mean age = 28 years), 10 middle-aged (mean age = 42 years) and 12 older adults (mean age = 61 years) following 60-min, 20-min and no nap conditions. It was expected that the older adults would need a longer nap to accrue benefits. Napping led to improvements for all age groups in subjective sleepiness, fatigue and accuracy on a serial addition/subtraction task. Waking electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmed that the participants were more physiologically alert following naps. There were no age differences in subjective reports or cognitive tasks; however, older adults had higher beta and gamma in the waking EEG, suggesting that they needed increased effort to maintain performance. Overall, older adults had smaller P2 amplitudes, reflecting their difficulty in inhibiting irrelevant stimuli, and delayed latencies and smaller amplitude P300s to novel stimuli, reflecting deficits in their frontal lobe functioning. Although older adults did garner benefits from napping, there was no evidence that they required longer naps to experience improvement.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) of the event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in 19 adult humans who passively listened to a standard stimulus and spectrally and temporally deviant sounds. We predicted modulations of the MMN amplitude in response to spectrally and temporally graded deviants. Based on recent models of functional hemispheric lateralisation, we further hypothesized a left-lateralized source of the MMN in response to temporal deviants and, in contrast, a right-lateralized source of the MMN in response to spectral deviants. In agreement with our hypothesis, we showed that spectrally and temporally deviant sounds lead to robust MMNs recorded from frontocentral scalp electrodes. The amplitudes of the MMNs were modulated by the grade of spectral and temporal deviation from the standard sound. Furthermore, by using an assumption-free source localization approach (LORETA) we demonstrated functionally lateralized activations with dominance of the right hemisphere for the processing of spectral characteristics and of the left hemisphere for the processing of temporal acoustic properties. Results of our study further contribute to the ongoing debate on the role of low-level acoustic feature perception in functional hemispheric lateralization in the context of auditory and speech processing. Our data indicate that the pre-attentive feature-specific deviant processing is mediated by partly distinct neural subsystems for temporal and spectral information.

BCI can help users send messages and commands to the external world without using their brain's normal output channels or muscles. The central element in each BCI system is to rind a reliable method to detect the specific feature patterns extracted from the raw brain signals, and then translate it into usable control signals. In this paper, we introduce our approach to detect N170 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) based on its spatiotemporal patterns in single-trial EEG signals. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method and machine-learning technique support vector machine (SVM) are adopted for N170 feature extraction and translation, i.e. they convert electrophysiological input from the user into on-off signal to control external devices. Our results indicate that the CSP can effectively extract discriminatory information, and SVM has an efficient performance for N170 classification. Comparing to several other methods, high performances of our framework show that the temporal and spatial features of N170 are very stable and it is promising for new type BCI applications.

The neural mechanisms of MPH action on sensory information processing, however, remain poorly understood. To the authors' knowledge, this present study is the first to investigate whether a single dose of MPH affects neural substrates of passive attention in healthy adults studied with simultaneous whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Methods Monaural left-ear auditory stimuli were presented in an oddball paradigm with infrequent deviant tones differing in frequency and duration. Neuronal activity was recorded with simultaneous whole-head MEG and EEG in 13 healthy subjects (five females; aged 27 +/- 5 years) after oral administration of 40 mg MPH or placebo in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. We analysed both electric and magnetic N100, P200 and mismatch negativity (MMN) components. Results MPH increased arousal levels in visual analogue scales. MPH had no effect on the dipole strength of MMN or MMNm in either frequency or duration deviations. MPH did, however, reduce P200 amplitudes in EEG. Conclusions The lack of effect of MPH on either MMN or MMNm suggests no association between catecholaminergic activities and MMN generation. However, our findings imply that MPH may change the neural bases of auditory information processing such as the early stimulus evaluation reflected in the P200 component. Dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmitter systems could be responsible for the modulation of these processes. The exclusive effect of MPH on the P200 component could have a clinical application.

Out-of-synch and out-of-sorts: Dysfunction of motor-sensory communication in schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						corollary discharge; EEG; motor; neural oscillations; schizophrenia	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; ACTIVE MOVEMENT; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SPECIFICITY; INTEGRATION; PREDICTION	Background: Phase synchronization of neural activity preceding a motor act may reflect an efference copy of the motor plan and its expected sensory consequences (corollary discharge), which is sent to sensory cortex to herald the arrival of self-generated sensations and dampen the resulting sensory experience. We performed time-frequency decomposition of response-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine phase synchronization of oscillations across trials (phase-locking factor [PLF]) to self-paced button presses. If prepress PILF reflects the activity in motor cortex, it should be contra lateralized. If it reflects the action of the efference copy, it should be related to subsequent sensory suppression. If efference copy/corollary discharge mechanisms are abnormal in schizophrenia, it should be reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Electroencephalogram was collected while 23 patients (20 schizophrenia; 3 schizoaffective) and 25 age-matched control subjects pressed a button, at will, every 1 to 2 sec. Phase-locking factor preceding and following button presses was calculated from single-trial EEG; averaging single trials yielded response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) to the tactile response associated with button pressing. Results: Consistent with its hypothesized reflection of efference copy/corollary discharge signals, prepress gamma band neural synchrony was 1) maximal over the contralateral sensory-motor cortex in healthy subjects, 2) correlated with the ipsilateralized somatosensory ERP amplitude evoked by the press, and 3) reduced in patients. Prepress neural synchrony in the beta band was also reduced in patients, especially those with avolition/apathy. Conclusions: These data are consistent with dysfunction of forward model circuitry in schizophrenia and suggest that the specific motor-sensory system affected is selectively linked to symptoms involving that system.

J	Sela, I; Breznitz, S; Breznitz, Z				Sela, Itamar; Breznitz, Shlomo; Breznitz, Zvia			The correlation-based model: An alternative system for analyzing ERP data in cognitive research	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						dyslexia; EEG; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN; COMPONENTS; TASK; INFORMATION; LANGUAGE; LATENCY; SKILLS	This study is focused on the development of a model for analyzing electrophysiological data (EEG) utilizing the evoked potentials (ERP) method used in cognitive research. The aim of the model is to overcome several limitations arising from traditional methods of ERP analysis. The model was tested for its ability to distinguish between dyslexic and regular readers. ERP data collected during a typical experiment contain a large amount of information that is not utilized during data analysis. For instance, it is acceptable to define a component such as the P300 according to the peak of a wave based on a few electrodes. Furthermore, this is often accomplished based on the researcher's subjective impression. Information such as the pattern of the wave, its width, rate of ascent, rate of descent, and the impact of the stimulus that evoked it over the entire scalp, is left out. In contrast, the modeling method proposed here considers all available information, utilizing a precise algorithm that allows fully automated analysis. The method produces a typical profile for a given type of subject and can determine for each new subject his/her similarity to that type. The basic idea behind the model is that two subjects exposed to the same task would share certain similarities in their electrophysiological data. However, the latency of this shared similarity might differ from person to person. It is thus possible to take the data from one subject and systematically seek the point of maximal similarity across all electrodes. Consequently, the data matrix of subject A in the area of P300 (e.g., all information on all electrodes between 250 and 350 ms) will be correlated with the data of subject B of the same width, i.e., 100 ms running from 200 ms throughout 400 ms. The correlation between the two matrices is expected to rise as the area of similarity gets closer, and descend once past that point. The size of the maximal correlation indicates the similarity between the two subjects, and its location in time indicates differential latencies. The averaging of data across subjects should be carried out at the points of maximal similarity.In order to demonstrate the power of the method, this study constructed two separate models for a dyslexic and regular reader, respectively. The models were based on ERP data recorded during a lexical decision task. The similarity of each subject to both models was calculated. This method correctly classified 68% of subjects. In addition, the model was able to detect sub-groups within each diagnostic category with distinct behavioral patterns. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Still, little is known about bottom-up and top-down signaling during the formation and retrieval of WM representations. In the current set of experiments, we combine complementary fMRI and EEG measures to obtain high-resolution spatial and temporal measures of neural activity during WM encoding and retrieval processes. Across both experiments, participants performed a face delayed recognition WM task in which the nature of sensory input across stages was held constant. In experiment 1, we utilized a latency-resolved fMRI approach to assess temporal parameters of the BOLD response during stage-specific encoding and retrieval waveforms. Relative to the latency at encoding, the PFC exhibited an earlier peak of fMRI activity at retrieval showing stage-specific differences in the temporal dynamics of PFC engagement across vim operations. In experiment 2, we analyzed the first 200 ms of the ERP response during this Vim task providing a more sensitive temporal measure of these differences. Divergence of the ERP pattern during encoding and retrieval began as early as 60 ms post-stimulus. The parallel fMRI and ERP results during memory-guided decisions support a key role of the PFC in top-down biasing of perceptual processing and reveal rapid differences across WM component operations in the presence of identical bottom-up sensory input.

An auditory warning signal was followed 2-3 s later by a noxious YAG laser stimulation as an imperative signal delivered to the left hand dorsum. Ten normal subjects performed three different conditions, Control, Movement, and Count. In Control, the subjects were asked to relax and rest quietly with no task. In Movement, the subjects extended the left index finger after imperative stimuli. In Count, the subjects counted the number of imperative stimuli silently. The amplitude of the N2 component recorded by EEG, which peaked about 220 ms after noxious stimulation, was significantly attenuated in Movement, but not in Count, compared to Control. The root-mean-square (RMS) from both hemispheres, and areal mean signal (AMS) amplitudes and the equivalent current dipole (ECD) strengths from SI/PPC and bilateral SII recorded at around 170 ms by MEG were not significantly different among the three conditions. In contrast, ECD strengths and AMS amplitudes from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which showed a similar peak to the N2 component, were smaller in Movement than Control and Count. We therefore suspect that neural activities related to generator mechanisms of N2, especially including ACC, are inhibited by movement-related neural activities during the preparatory period. The present findings indicate a characteristic of pain-motor integration in a movement preparatory period. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This effect is well known as the Stroop effect. It is still an unresolved issue how the brain deals with interference in this type of task. To explore this question, an electroencephalogram (EEG) study was carried out. By analyzing several measures of EEG activity, two main findings emerged. First, the event-related potential (ERP) showed increased fronto-central negativity in a time window around 400 msec for incongruent items in contrast to congruent and neutral items. Source localization analysis revealed that a source in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributed most to the difference. Second, time-frequency analysis showed that theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) in the ACC increased linearly with increasing interference and that phase coupling between the ACC and the left prefrontal cortex was longer persistent for incongruent items compared to congruent and neutral items. These effects occurred at a time window around 600 msec. We conclude that interference between color naming and word meaning in the Stroop task manifests itself at around 400 msec and mainly activates the ACC. Thereafter, sustained phase coupling between the ACC and the prefrontal cortex occurs, which most likely reflects the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms.

The present study investigated the time course of children's ERP responses to facial expression and personal familiarity, and the effect of these variables on ERP measures of effortful attention in a Go-Nogo task. Dense-array EEG was collected from 48 4-6-year-old children who were presented with pictures of their mothers' and strangers' happy and angry faces. ERPs were scored following face presentation and following a subsequent cue signaling a Go or Nogo response. Responses to face presentation showed early perceptual components that were larger following strangers' faces, suggesting facilitated rapid processing of personally important faces. A mid-latency frontocentral negativity was greatest following angry mothers' faces, indicating increased attentional monitoring and/or recognition memory evoked by an angry parent. Finally a right-lateralized late positive component was largest following angry faces, suggesting extended processing of negatively valenced social stimuli in general. Following the Go-Nogo response cue, a right-lateralized mid-latency negativity thought to measure effortful attention was larger in Nogo than Go trials, and following angry than happy faces, possibly reflecting increased effortful control required in those conditions. The present study suggests that overlapping but differentiated networks for both rapid and elaborative processing of important socio-affective information are established by 4-6 years. Moreover, the extended spatial and temporal distribution of components suggests a pattern of response to social stimuli in which more rapid processes may index personal familiarity, whereas temporally extended processes are sensitive to affective valence on both familiar and unfamiliar faces.

We tested the hypothesis that auditory sensory cortical activity is affected by encoding and retrieval of spatial information. Methods: Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during working memory and passive listening conditions. Trials contained three noise bursts (two "items" at different locations, followed by a "probe"). In the working memory task subjects determined if the probe matched an item location. The influence of long-term memory was evaluated by training to one location that was always a non-match. Auditory ERPs were analyzed to items and probes (N100, P200, late positive wave-LPW). Results: Reaction times varied significantly among probes (trained non-match < matches < non-match). In only the Passive condition N100 and P200 amplitudes to the first item were significantly larger than the second item. Probe ERP amplitudes (N100, LPW) were comparable for match and trained non-match probes relative to non-matches. Conclusions: Findings suggest that top-down factors during encoding modify sensory responses to successive items. Probe ERPs reflect sequence factors, such as recency and stimulus probability, and retrieval mechanisms not evident in passive listening. Significance: Results support a contribution of auditory cortex to working memory. (c) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

EEG was recorded from 21 electrodes on the scalp, according to the International 10-20 system, and EEG power spectra were calculated by fast Fourier transform for 3 min before and during odor presentation. ERPs were recorded from 15 electrodes on the scalp before, during and after exposure to incense with intervals of 10 min. In a push/wait paradigm, two Japanese words, 'push' as the go stimulus and 'wait' as the no-go stimulus, appeared randomly on a CRT screen with equal probability. The subjects were instructed to push a button whenever the 'push' signal appeared. Fast alpha activity (10-13 Hz) increased significantly in bilateral posterior regions during incense exposure compared to that during rose oil exposure. The peak amplitudes of no-go P3 at Fz and Cz were significantly greater during incense inhalation. The latencies of go P3 and no-go P3, and the amplitude and latencies of no-go N2 did not change by exposure to the odors of both incense, rose and odorless air.

Event-related Brain Potentials Suggest a Late Interaction of Meter and Syntax in the P600	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; SPEECH SEGMENTATION; LEXICAL STRESS; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; CUES; ERP; RHYTHM; EXPECTANCY; ACCENTS	Many studies refer to the relevance of metric cues in speech segmentation during language acquisition and adult language processing. However, the on-line use (i. e., time-locking the unfolding of a sentence to EEG) of metric stress patterns that are manifested by the succession of stressed and unstressed syllables during auditory syntactic processing has not been investigated. This is surprising as both processes rely on abstract rules that allow the building up of expectancies of which element will occur next and at which point in time. Participants listened to metrically regular sentences that could either be correct, syntactically incorrect, metrically incorrect, or doubly incorrect. They either judged syntactic correctness or metric homogeneity in two different sessions. We provide first event-related potential evidence that the metric structure of a given language is processed in two stages as evidenced in a biphasic pattern of an early frontal negativity and a late posterior positivity. This pattern is comparable to the biphasic pattern reported in syntactic processing. However, metric cues are processed earlier than syntactic cues during the first stage (LAN), whereas both processes seem to interact at a later integrational stage (P600). The present results substantiate the important impact of metric cues during auditory syntactic language processing.

Contributions of spectral frequency analyses to the study of P50 ERP amplitude and suppression in bipolar disorder with or without a history of psychosis	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						auditory evoked response; bipolar disorder; P50; sensory gating	EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; DEFICITS; EEG; NORMALIZATION; STIMULATION	Objective: The present study investigated event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of auditory processing and sensory gating in bipolar disorder and subgroups of bipolar patients with or without a history of psychosis using the P50 dual-click procedure. Auditory-evoked activity in two discrete frequency bands also was explored to distinguish between sensory registration and selective attention deficits. Methods: Thirty-one individuals with bipolar disorder and 28 non-psychiatric controls were compared on ERP indices of auditory processing using a dual-click procedure. In addition to conventional P50 ERP peak-picking techniques, quantitative frequency analyses were applied to the ERP data to isolate stages of information processing associated with sensory registration (20-50 Hz; gamma band) and selective attention (0-20 Hz; low-frequency band). Results: Compared to the non-psychiatric control group, patients with bipolar disorder exhibited reduced S1 response magnitudes for the conventional P50 peak-picking and low-frequency response analyses. A bipolar subgroup effect suggested that the attenuated S1 magnitudes from the P50 peak- picking and low-frequency analyses were largely attributable to patients without a history of psychosis. Conclusions: The analysis of distinct frequency bands of the auditory-evoked response elicited during the dual-click procedure allowed further specification of the nature of auditory sensory processing and gating deficits in bipolar disorder with or without a history of psychosis. The observed S1 effects in the low-frequency band suggest selective attention deficits in bipolar patients, especially those patients without a history of psychosis, which may reflect a diminished capacity to selectively attend to salient stimuli as opposed to impairments of inhibitory sensory processes.

Brain potentials during affective picture processing in children	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; Children; Early posterior negativity; Late positive potential; Event-related potentials	EMOTION REGULATION; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; AFFECTIVE STYLE; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; P300; REAPPRAISAL; DIRECTIONS; MODULATION	in adults, emotional (e.g., both unpleasant and pleasant) compared to neutral pictures elicit an increase in the early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive potential (LPP); modulation of these ERP components are thought to reflect the facilitated processing of, and increased attention to, motivationally salient stimuli. To determine whether the EPN and LPP are sensitive to emotional content in children, high-density EEG was recorded from 18 children who were 5-8 years of age (mean age = 77 months, SID = 11 months) while they viewed developmentally appropriate pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. Self-reported ratings of valence and arousal were also obtained. An EPN was not evident following emotional compared to neutral pictures; however, a positivity maximal at occipital-parietal recording sites was increased from 500 to 1000 ms following pleasant pictures and from 500 to 1500 ms following unpleasant Pictures. Comparisons between the EPN and LPP observed in children and adults, and implications for developmental studies of emotion, are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it has not been investigated whether time-locked brain activity can be measured using this stimulus, and whether the itching sensation induced by electrical stimulation of the skin is associated with C-fibers. Thus, we investigated these problems in this study. Itching sensations were elicited when electrical stimuli were applied to the skin of the right wrist and right forearm. EEG activity was recorded from 5 electrodes (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz and Pz). When the right wrist was stimulated, the reaction time (RT) and latency of the positive component of somatosensory evoked potentials (P1) were 1215 ms and 963 ms, respectively. When the right forearm was stimulated, the RT and peak latency of the P1 were 1013 ms and 772 ms, respectively. The conduction velocity estimated from the RT and latency of the P1 was 1.04 m/s and 0.92 m/s, respectively. In addition, the itching sensation and P1 were inhibited when the current intensity was increased into the range eliciting pain and touch sensations, implying interaction between C- and A-fibers. These findings demonstrate that time-locked brain activity can be measured using electrically evoked itching and that the itching sensation induced by the electrically evoked itching is associated with C-fibers. Thus, this method is useful for research into the central processing of itching. (C) 2008 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we review our recent series of experiments which have tracked the independent contributions of different types of visual attention and awareness to electrophysiological brain responses. and then we report a new experiment focusing on spatial attention, nonspatial selection of objects, and visual consciousness at the same time. The results indicate that the earliest electrophysiological correlate of consciousness, assumed to correlate with "phenomenal consciousness", was dependent on spatial attention, suggesting that spatial attention is a prerequisite for the internal representations of space that provide the medium for phenomenal experience. The correlate of phenomenal consciousness emerged independent of nonspatial selection of objects, but its later part was modified by it. By contrast, the correlate of access to later conscious processing stages ("reflective consciousness") that take the selected contents of phenomenal consciousness as input for conceptual thought and working memory, was dependent on both spatial attention and nonspatial selection. These results imply that one should distinguish between different types of attention and different forms of awareness, when describing the relationship between attention and awareness.

A failure to stop and attention fluctuations: An evoked oscillations study of the stop-signal paradigm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; evoked oscillations; stop-signal task; inhibition; attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ERP COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; EEG; IMPULSIVITY; CHILDREN	Objective: It is not always clear whether inhibition or attention deficit underlies a failure to stop a prepared motor response. One possible way to approach this question is to resort to measures of evoked oscillations since functional correlates of different frequency oscillations are relatively well understood. Methods: The present study examined event-related oscillations during a stop-signal task in non-clinical adults. In 25% of trials of an auditory discrimination tasks subjects had to refrain from a prepared motor response. Results: In successful stop trials, the Go N2 peaked later and the Stop N2 peaked earlier than in failed stop trials. Relative to successful, failed stop trials were associated with a larger N1-N2 and Go P3, and a smaller Stop P3 in the central and posterior cortical regions. The latter effect was exclusively determined by evoked delta oscillations, whereas all other frequency bands contributed to enhanced responses in failed comparative to successful stop trials. Conclusions: The sum of presented evidence seems to show that success or failure to stop mostly depends on how the subject prepares for the Go and Stop stimuli in advance. If attention is more directed towards the Stop signal, the stopping succeeds, otherwise it fails. Significance: These data may contribute to understanding the cognitive basis of successful and unsuccessful stopping performance. (C) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The musician's brain is also regarded as an ideal model to investigate plasticity of the human brain. In this paper, an EEG-based neural network is proposed to assess neuroplasticity induced by musical training. A musical chord perception experiment is designed to acquire and compare the behavioral and neural responses of musicians and non-musicians. The ERPs elicited by the consonant and dissonant chords are combined together as the features of the model. The principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions and the dimension-reduced features are input to a feedforward neural network to recognize the brain potentials belong to a musician or a non-musician. The accuracy can reach 97% in average for leave-one-out cross validation of six subjects in this experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of assessing effects of musical training by ERP signals elicited by musical chord perception.

This study is an attempt to find the relation of electrode location and latencies of EEG data with specific aspects of facial emotions. A neural network was applied to single trial EEG data for classifying the type and intensity level of facial emotions. Images of two types of facial emotions (happiness and disgust) with two intensity levels (high and low) were parametrically controlled and presented as main stimuli to evoke brain signals. Results of this study indicated that data from electrodes over the right-posterior area in the time-range window 80 to 200 ms post stimulus presentation contains P100 and N170 components strongly related to the process of recognition of facial emotions. Relative to other components, N170 was strongly related to the intensity levels of facial emotion, where it could be used for classifying low and high intensity levels of facial emotion. P100 and N170 can be used for classifying the type of facial emotions, with the accuracy when using P100 being slightly higher. Time-range window 200 to 280 ms contains N2, which can also be used for classifying the intensity level of facial emotion, but its accuracy is less than that of N170. Data from time-range window 300 to 360 ms, which contains the P300 component, was not significant for classifying type and intensity level of facial emotion relative to that of other components. This study is the first to show the possibility of using other components besides P300 for EEG-based BC Is. The results also suggest the mechanism of recognition of facial emotion, started by recognizing the type of facial emotion followed by how intense the facial emotion is expressed.

In 3 conditions, visual warning stimuli were followed by visual target stimuli associated with an electrical painful stimulation at left index finger. In the Pain (control) condition, no task was required after the target stimuli. In the "Pain + ipsilateral movement" condition, the subjects had to perform a movement of the left index finger. In the "Pain + contralateral movement" condition, they had to perform a movement of the right index finger. Meanwhile, electroencephalographic data were recorded (n = 18) from 128 scalp electrodes. Off line, these data were spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian transformation. Sensorimotor cortical activation before the painful stimulation was probed by the percentage power reduction of alpha rhythms at approximately 8 to 12 Hz (event-related desynchronization, ERD). Results showed that the subjects perceived a lower stimulus intensity in both "Pain + ipsilateral" and "Pain + contralateral" conditions compared with the control "Pain" condition. Furthermore, wide anticipatory alpha ERD (approximately 10-12 Hz) was lower in amplitude in the "Pain + ipsilateral" than in the "Pain + contralateral" condition. These results suggest that modulation of alpha rhythms is a putative physiological mechanism underlying anticipatory processes preceding the integration of painful and motor information at cortical level. Furthermore, these processes show a marked interference ("gating") when the sensorimotor integration refer to the same hand as opposed to both hands. Perspective: We showed that cortical alpha rhythms preceding painful stimulation are influenced by the preparation of contralateral and ipsilateral finger movements. These results motivate further investigation for testing the hypothesis that chronic pain patients might exaggerate the anticipatory activation of sensorimotor cortex to negligible pain stimuli.

We investigated the event-related potentials to positive, negative and neutral pictures in 32 adults with ADHD and 32 control subjects. For this study we measured 21 electrodes placed in accordance with the international 10-20 system and calculated the early posterior negativity (EPN), which physiologically is characterized by more negative values for emotional as compared to neutral stimuli. We found significantly reduced EPN values for the ADHD patients compared to the healthy controls, but only in the positive stimuli condition, without any significant differences in the negative stimuli condition. Our data indicate that ADHD patients show less reactivity to positive visual stimuli which might be relevant in the context of described dysfunctions of the motivational-reward system in ADHD.

Deviance-elicited changes in event-related potentials are attenuated by ketamine in mice	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; EVOKED POTENTIALS; GENETIC RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; ERPS; MMN	Background: People with schizophrenia exhibit reduced ability to detect change in the auditory environment, which has been linked to abnormalities in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate neurotransmission. This ability to detect changes in stimulus qualities can be measured with electroencephalography using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). For example, reductions in the N100 and mismatch negativity (MMN), in response to pitch deviance, have been proposed as endophenotypes of schizophrenia. This study examines a novel rodent model of impaired pitch deviance detection in mice using the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Methods: ERPs were recorded from unanesthetized mice during a pitch deviance paradigm prior to and following ketamine administration. First, N40 amplitude was evaluated using stimuli between 4 and 10 kHz to assess the amplitude of responses across the frequency range used. The amplitude and latency of the N40 were analyzed following standard (7 kHz) and deviant (5-9 kHz) stimuli. Additionally, we examined which portions of the ERP are selectively altered by pitch deviance to define possible regions for the mouse MMN. Results: Mice displayed increased N40 amplitude that was followed by a later negative component between 50 and 75 msec in response to deviant stimuli. Both the increased N40 and the late N40 negativity were attenuated by ketamine. Ketamine increased N40 latency for both standard and deviant stimuli alike. Conclusions: The mouse N40 and a subsequent temporal region have deviance response properties similar to the human N100 and, possibly, MMN. Deviance responses were abolished by ketamine, suggesting that ketamine-induced changes in mice mimic deviance detection deficits in schizophrenia.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during picture naming at baseline and after a period of therapy for anomia. All patients had severe anomia at baseline assessment and improved significantly in naming during the study period. Waveform analyses and temporal segmentation were carried out on the ERPs of each patient in comparison with 15 healthy control subjects. Normalisation as well as an increase of abnormal electrophysiological correlates accompanied recovery. An increase of abnormal amplitudes appeared in a patient with semantic impairment during the first 300 ms after picture onset, while only normalisation of amplitudes and topographic maps accompanied recovery in the three patients wit h lexical-phonological impairment in this early time-window. Abnormal amplitudes and topographic maps emerged during recovery in the patients with lexical-phonological impairment in later time-windows, starting between 250 and 300 ms. Follow-up ERP recordings carried out 6 months later in two of them showed normalisation of amplitudes and persistence of abnormal maps. The results suggest that electrophysiological changes accompanying recovery from anomia in the post-acute stage are observed in specific time-windows, probably corresponding to different encoding processes and that recovery correlates with normalisation of EEG patterns as well as with the emergence of abnormalities, which presumably indicates compensation mechanisms of specific encoding processes.

Evoked and event-related potentials have been used to predict emergence from coma. This study aimed to determine whether they can help prediction of consciousness recovery in post-traumatic vegetative state (VS). Methods: Thirty-four patients in post-traumatic VS were assessed clinically and neurophysiologically at 2-3 months after injury and followed up to 1 year. Patients were assessed with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and with electroencephalogram (EEG), brainstem auditory (BAEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and P300. Demographic, clinical and neurophysiological measures were analysed by descriptive and logistic regression techniques. Results: At 1 year from injury, 26 patients (76%) had recovered consciousness and eight patients (24%) had not. In univariate analyses, a detectable P300, a reactive EEG and lower DRS scores were found at entry assessment more frequently (p<0.05) in patients who later recovered consciousness than in those who did not. Logistic regression analysis revealed that P300 was the only factor contributing to prediction of conscious recovery with an area under the ROC curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99). Conclusions: P300 is a strong predictor of conscious recovery in VS.

The features of the presented visual stimulus determined the type of cognitive task that should be solved. Methods: For each experimental task and everybody's subject FFT Analysis module calculated the total power histograms from a fixed frequency band (3-20 Hz or 8-13 Hz) for each 3-second EEG sample with 50% overlay and all electrodes. From the histograms the software derived two FFT single values - The average Total Power (TP) and Frequency at Maximum Power (FMP). Results: It has been shown that during the solution of cognitive tasks the marked changes of ongoing EEG activity appeared. The short lasting and localized amplitude decrease in rhythmic activity (ERD) and the change of EEG frequency were among the most frequent. The ERD extent was determined by an informational content of processed visual stimuli and by the site of scalp-recording electrode. A higher mental load related to the solution of cognitive tasks shifted the average FM to lower frequencies. Conclusion: The suitability of an analysis of ongoing EEG activity to uncover differences in people's brain activation patterns when engaged in performing cognitively demanding tasks was proved.

Utilizing both of these methods is therefore desirable in neuroimaging studies to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of brain function. While several studies have investigated the relationship between EEG and positive (+) BOLD (activation), little is known about the relationship between EEG signals and negative (-) BOLD (deactivation) responses. In this study, we used a visual stimuli designed to shift cortical activity from anterior to posterior regions of the visual cortex. Using EEG and FMRI, we investigated how shifts in +BOLD and -BOLD location were correlated to shifts in the N75 and P100 visual evoked potential (VEP) dipolar sources. The results show that the N75 dipole along with +BOLD, were indeed shifted from posterior to anterior regions of the visual cortex. The P100 VEP component, along with the -BOLD were not shifted to the same extent, indicating that N75 is better correlated to +BOLD than to -BOLD. These findings indicate how different components of the EEG signal are related to the positive and negative BOLD responses, which may aid in interpreting the relationship between visually evoked EEG and FMRI signals.

The aim of this system is to detect user's intentions or thoughts from brain activities which are measured as EEG (electroencephalogram) or other non-invasive recording techniques. We have developed the BCI system to detect user's motor imagery from motor-related EEG activities. It was shown that online training with a feedback of EEG band-power on specified frequency range made the accuracy of command detection higher. And we proposed an auditory BCI based on auditory stream segregation, on which users were requested to attend to one of the tone streams and their object of interest was detected from auditory event-related potentials. In this article, the concept and some of our recent researches on BCI are introduced.

A combination of visual evoked potential (VEP) analyses and analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent spectral power) was carried out. Significant differences were found for the N2 component of VEP for optic flow versus random visual motion within and between groups. Both adults and infants showed shorter latencies for structured optic flow than random visual motion, and infants showed longer latencies, particularly for random visual motion, and larger amplitudes than adults. Both groups also showed significant differences in induced activity when TSE of the two motion stimuli (optic flow and random visual motion) was compared with TSE of a static dot pattern. Infants showed an induced decrease in the amplitudes in theta-band frequency, while adults showed an induced increase in beta-band frequency. Differences in induced activity for the two motion stimuli could, however, not be observed. Brain activity related to motion stimuli is different for infants and adults and the differences are observed both in VEPs and in induced activity of the EEG. To investigate how changes in locomotor development are related to accompanying changes in brain activity associated with visual motion perception, more data of infants with different experiences in self-produced locomotion are required.

Feedback from area human motion complex hMT/V5+ to V1 has been hypothesized to play an important role in this illusory perception of motion. We measured event-related responses to illusory motion stimuli of varying apparent motion (AM) content and retinal location using Electroencephalography. Detectable cortical stimulus processing started around 60-ms poststimulus in area V1. This component was insensitive to AM content and sequential stimulus presentation. Sensitivity to AM content was observed starting around 90 ms post the second stimulus of a sequence and most likely originated in area hMT/V5+. This AM sensitive response was insensitive to retinal stimulus position. The stimulus sequence related response started to be sensitive to retinal stimulus position at a longer latency of 110 ms. We interpret our findings as evidence for feedback from area hMT/V5+ or a related motion processing area to early visual cortices (V1, V2, V3).

Phase-locking within human mediotemporal lobe predicts memory formation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Memory; Rhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Intracranial EEG; Phase-locking	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; WORD RECOGNITION; HIPPOCAMPAL; POTENTIALS; ALPHA; RESET	Lesion and imaging studies have demonstrated that encoding of declarative memories, i.e. consciously accessible events and facts, is supported by processes within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus. two substructures of the mediotemporal lobe (MR). Successful memory, formation has, for instance been shown, to be accompanied by the rhinal N400 component, followed by a hippocampal positivity, as well as by transient rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization. However, it has been an open question, which mediotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) measures predict memory formation most accurately. Therefore, we analyzed and compared the association of different mediotemporal EEG measures with successful memory formation. EEG characteristics were extracted from intracranial rhinal and hippocampal depth recordings in 31 epilepsy patients performing a Continuous Word recognition paradigm. Classical event-related potential measures, rhinal-hippocampal synchronization, as well as inter-trial phase-locking and power changes within rhinal cortex and hippocampus were evaluated. We found that inter-trial phase-locking is superior to other EEG measures in predicting subsequent memory. This means that memory formation is related to the precise timing of EEG phases within the MTL with respect to stimulus onset. In particular, early rhinal and hippocampal phase-locking in the alpha/beta range reaching its Maximum already between 100 and 300 ms after stimulus onset appears to be a precursor of successful memory formation. Our data Suggest that early mediotemporal phase adjustments constitute a relevant mechanism underlying declarative memory encoding. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 15 subjects in response to +100, +200 and +500 cents pitch-shifted voice auditory feedback during active vocalization and passive listening to the playback of the self-produced vocalizations. Results: The amplitude of the evoked P-1 (latency: 73.51 ms) and P-2 (latency: 199.55 ms) ERP components in response to feedback perturbation were significantly larger during vocalization than listening. The difference between P-2 peak amplitudes during vocalization vs. listening was shown to be significantly larger for +100 than +500 cents stimulus. Conclusions: Results indicate that the human auditory cortex is more responsive to voice F-0 feedback perturbations during vocalization than passive listening. Greater vocalization-induced enhancement of the auditory responsiveness to smaller feedback perturbations may imply that the audio-vocal system detects and corrects for errors in vocal production that closely match the expected vocal output. Significance: Findings of this study support previous suggestions regarding the enhanced auditory sensitivity to feedback alterations during self-vocalization, which may serve the purpose of feedback-based monitoring of one's voice.

Timing of caffeine's impact on autonomic and central nervous system measures: Clarification of arousal effects	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						arousal; activation; caffeine; EEG; skin conductance level; cardiovascular measures	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; EEG DIFFERENCES; BODY POSTURE; PERFORMANCE; SLEEP; HABITUATION; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	The timing of caffeine effects on arousal levels was examined. From previous work in our laboratory, an increase in skin conductance level (SCL) was used as the marker of arousal increase, and we sought to identify the timing of this and related effects following caffeine ingestion. A single oral dose of caffeine (250 mg) was used in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled repeated-measures cross-over study. Eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and autonomic data (SCL, heart rate, respiration rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) during 2 min epochs that commenced every 4 min after ingestion, were analysed. The SCL placebo data were used to identify potential arousal measures prior to examining caffeine effects. Caffeine was associated with increased SCL, increased respiratory rate and a global reduction in alpha power. There were no significant cardiovascular effects of caffeine-induced arousal. These caffeine results are consistent with our recent electrodermal and EEG studies of arousal, and confirm the potential use of caffeine as a simple means of experimentally modifying arousal levels without task-related confounds.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of audiovisual speech processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							AUDITORY-VISUAL INTEGRATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; CONSONANT RECOGNITION; CROSSMODAL BINDING; CORTEX ACTIVATION; SEEING VOICES; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; ORGANIZATION	The cortical processing of auditory-alone, visual-alone, and audiovisual speech information is temporally and spatially distributed, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) cannot adequately resolve its temporal dynamics. In order to investigate a hypothesized spatiotemporal organization for audiovisual speech processing circuits, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Stimuli were congruent audiovisual /ba/, incongruent auditory /ba/ synchronized with visual /ga/, auditory-only /ba/, and visual-only /ba/ and /ga/. Current density reconstructions (CDRs) of the ERP data were computed across the latency interval of 50-250 ms. The CDRs demonstrated complex spatiotemporal activation patterns that differed across stimulus conditions. The hypothesized circuit that was investigated here comprised initial integration of audiovisual speech by the middle superior temporal sulcus (STS), followed by recruitment of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), followed by activation of Broca's area [Miller, L.M., d'Esposito, M., 2005. Perceptual fusion and stimulus coincidence in the cross-modal integration of speech. Journal of Neuroscience 25, 5884-5893]. The importance of spatiotemporally sensitive measures in evaluating processing pathways was demonstrated. Results showed, strikingly, early (< 100 ms) and simultaneous activations in areas of the supramarginal and angular gyros (SMG/AG), the IPS, the inferior frontal gyros, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Also, emergent left hemisphere SMG/AG activation, not predicted based on the unisensory stimulus conditions was observed at approximately 160 to 220 ms. The STS was neither the earliest nor most prominent activation site, although it is frequently considered the sine qua non of audiovisual speech integration. As discussed here, the relatively late activity of the SMG/AG solely under audiovisual conditions is a possible candidate audiovisual speech integration response. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The distribution obtained is closely related to the noncentral F distribution. Based on such sampling distribution, critical values as well as confidence limits for the index may be obtained and hence ERS/ERD can now be evaluated under a statistical basis. An example of the technique was also provided in the EEG signals from 10 normal subjects during intermittent photic stimulation.	[Infantosi, A. F. C.; Miranda de Sa, A. M. F.

Yet this band contains subtle but valuable physiological signatures such as fast gamma oscillations or evoked high-frequency (600 Hz) bursts related to spiking of thalamocortical and cortical neurons. Here we introduce a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach that integrates hard and software modifications for continuous acquisition of ultrafast EEG oscillations during fMRI. Our approach is based upon and extends the established method of averaged artifact subtraction (AAS). Particularly for recovery of ultrahigh-frequency EEG signatures, AAS requires invariantly sampled and constant imaging-artifact waveforms to achieve optimal imaging-artifact correction. Consequently, we adjusted our acquisition setup such that both physiological ultrahigh-frequency EEG and invariantly sampled imaging artifacts were captured. In addition, we extended the AAS algorithm to cope with other, non-sampling related sources of imaging-artifact variations such as subject movements. A cascaded principal component analysis finally removed remaining imaging-artifact residuals. We provide a detailed evaluation of averaged ultrahigh-frequency signals and unaveraged broadband EEG spectra up to 1 kHz. Evoked nanovolt-sized high-frequency bursts were successfully recovered during periods of MR data acquisition afflicted by imaging artifacts in the millivolt range. Compared to periods without imaging artifacts they exhibited the same mean amplitudes, latencies and waveforms and a signal-to-noise ratio of 72%. Furthermore we identified consistent dipole sources. In conclusion, ultrafast EEG oscillations can be continuously monitored during fMRI using the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It elicits several classic event-related potentials (ERPs), the most prominent being the P300 which is seen as a neural correlate of subjects' detection of rare (target) stimuli. Though trial-averaging is typically used to identify and characterize such ERPs, their latency and amplitude can vary on a trial-to-trial basis reflecting variability in the underlying neural information processing. Here we simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI during an auditory oddball task and identified cortical areas correlated with the trial-to-trial variability of task-discriminating EEG components. Unique to our approach is a linear multivariate method for identifying task-discriminating components within specific stimulus- or response-locked time windows. We find fMRI activations indicative of distinct processes that contribute to the single-trial variability during target detection. These regions are different from those found using standard, including trial-averaged, regressors. Of particular note is the strong activation of the lateral occipital complex (LOC). The LOC was not seen when using traditional event-related regressors. Though LOC is typically associated with visual/spatial attention, its activation in an auditory oddball task, where attention can wax and wane from trial to trial, indicates that it may be part of a more general attention network involved in allocating resources for target detection and decision making. Our results show that trial-to-trial variability in EEG components, acquired simultaneously with fMRI, can yield task-relevant BOLD activations that are otherwise unobservable using traditional fMRI analysis.

An EEG study	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) Alpha rhythms; Theta rhythms; Neural efficiency; Encoding and retrieval	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA-BAND ERD; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; LAPLACIAN ESTIMATE; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; TASK; POTENTIALS	More intelligent persons (high IQ) typically present a higher cortical activity during tasks requiring the encoding of visuo-spatial information, namely higher alpha (about 10 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD; Doppelmayr et al., 2005 [23]). The opposite is true ("neural efficiency") during the retrieval of the encoded information, as revealed by both lower alpha ERD and/or lower theta (about 5 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS; Grabner et al, 2004 [19]). To reconcile these contrasting results, here we evaluated the working hypothesis that more intelligent male subjects are characterized by a high cortical activity during the encoding phase. This deep encoding would explain the relatively low cortical activity for the retrieval of the encoded information. To test this hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 22 healthy young male volunteers during visuo-spatial information processing (encoding) and short-term retrieval of the encoded information. Cortical activity was indexed by theta ERS and alpha ERD. It was found that the higher the subjects' total IQ, the stronger the frontal theta ERS during the encoding task. Furthermore, the higher the subjects' total IQ, the lower the frontal high-frequency alpha ERD (about 10-12 Hz) during the retrieval task. This was not true for parietal counterpart of these EEG rhythms These results reconcile previous contrasting evidence confirming that more intelligent persons do not ever show event-related cortical responses compatible with "neural efficiency" hypothesis Rather, their cortical activity would depend on flexible and task-adapting features of frontal activation.

The aim of this study was to examine the extent of overlap in cognitive and electrophysiological disturbances identified in children experiencing sleep problems and children with AD/HD or both. Four groups (aged 7-18) were compared: children with combined AD/HD and sleep problems (n = 32), children with AD/HD (n = 52) or sleep problems (n = 36) only, and children with neither disorder (n = 119). Electrophysiological and cognitive function measures included: absolute EEG power during eyes open and eyes closed, event-related potential (ERP) components indexing attention and working memory processes (P3). and a number of standard neuropsychological tests. Children with symptoms of both AD/HD and sleep problems had a different profile from those of children with either AD/HD or sleep problems only. These findings suggest it is unlikely that disturbances in brain and cognitive functioning associated with sleep problems also give rise to AD/HD symptomatology and consequent diagnosis. Furthermore, findings suggest that children with symptoms of both AD/HD and sleep problems may have a different underlying aetiology than children with AD/HD-only or sleep problems-only, perhaps requiring unique treatment interventions.

To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: "peak picking" and "template matching". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines.

Adjective declension in German differs from previously studied morphosyntactic regularities in that the required suffixes depend not only on the syntactic case, gender, and number features to be expressed, but also on whether or not these features are already expressed on linearly preceding elements in the noun phrase. Violation phrases and matched controls were presented over three test phases ( pretest and training on the first day, and a posttest one week later). During the pretest, no electrophysiological differences were observed between violation and control conditions, and participants' classification performance was near chance. During the training and posttest phases, classification improved, and there was a P600-like violation response to declension but not gender violations. An error-related response during training was associated with improvement in grammatical discrimination from pretest to posttest. The results show that rapid changes in neuronal responses can be observed in adult learners of a complex morphosyntactic rule, and also that error-related electrophysiological responses may relate to grammar acquisition.

Methods: Electroencephalographic data were recorded in 15 normal weight adults during a visual "oddball" paradigm. The subjects were given frequent (70%) and rare (30%) stimuli depicting faces (FACE), food (FOOD), and landscapes (CONTROL). The task was to click the mouse after the rare stimuli. These stimuli depicted the same frequent stimuli graphically dilated by 25% along the horizontal axis. Analysis of bioelectrical impedance indexed subjects' body fat percentage. Cortical attentional responses were probed by the difference between positive event-related potentials peaking around 200-600 ms post-stimulus for the frequent minus rare stimuli (P300). LORETA estimated P300 cortical sources. Results: Main results showed that in the FACE condition, there was a negative correlation between the body fat percentage and the reaction time to the rare stimuli, and a positive correlation between the body fat percentage and the amplitude of prefrontal P300 Sources (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results disclose a relationship between body fat and prefrontal attentional processes to body image in normal weight adults. Significance: The present study motivates future research testing the hypothesis that this relationship might be altered in patients with eating and weight disorders.

Evidence is accumulating that motor imagery and motor execution have many common features. The extent of the similarity and whether it spreads into the preparation phase is however unclear. This study used electroencephalographic recordings to compare the effects of providing advance information about upcoming movements on preparatory processing in a motor imagery and execution paradigm. Event-related potential data were recorded in a priming task where participants were cued to perform simple or complex finger movements. We hypothesized that a high degree of functional similarity of motor imagery and motor execution should be reflected in similar alterations of lateralized preparatory activity. Lateralized preparatory activity was indeed very similar, showing both motor-related (lateralized readiness potential, LRP) and cognitive components (anterior directing-attention negativity or ADAN, late directing-attention positivity or LDAP). Dipole analysis revealed that LRP, ADAN, and LDAP Sources were very comparable for motor imagination and execution. Results generally support the idea of common underlying functional networks subserving both the preparation for execution and imagery of movements. They also provide a broader context for this notion by revealing similarities in cognitive components associated with the movement tasks. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3275-3286, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss. Inc.

An ERPs investigation	SLEEP			English	Article						psychophysiological insomnia; arousal; inhibition; event-related potentials; wake; sleep onset; sleep	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLEEP PHASE SYNDROME; ATTENTION BIAS; P300 AMPLITUDE; EEG ACTIVITY; STIMULI; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INVENTORY; MODEL	Study Objectives: Chronic primary insomnia has been hypothesized to result from conditioned arousal or the inability to initiate normal sleep processes. The event-related potentials (ERPs) N1, P2, and N350 are useful indexes of arousal. The objective is to compare these ERPs in primary chronic psychophysiological insomniacs (INS) and good sleepers (GS) during multiple recordings. Participants: Participants were 15 INS (mean age = 46 years, SD 7.5) and 16 GS (mean age = 37 years, SID = 10.1). Methods and Procedure: Following a multistep clinical evaluation, INS and GS participants underwent 4 consecutive nights of PSG recordings (N1 to N4). ERPs were recorded on the 3(rd) and 4(th) nights in the sleep laboratory (N3 and N4). ERPs recordings were made during wake on both nights (in the evening and upon awakening), with the addition of sleep-onset recordings on N4. Auditory stimuli consisted of "standard" and "deviant" tones. Statistical Analysis: Repeated measures ANOVAs were computed for each ERP for each recording for each type of stimulus. Results: The amplitude of P2 and N350 was greater for the deviant than for the standard stimulus in both groups. The amplitude of N1 was larger in INS than GS in the morning and the evening. While the amplitude of N350 was larger in GS than in INS at sleep onset, the amplitude of P2 was greater in INS than in GS at that time. Conclusion: Signs of greater cortical arousal in psychophysiological insomnia individuals are observed, especially upon awakening in the morning. However, at sleep onset, difficulties from disengaging from wake processes and some inability at initiating normal sleep processes appear also present in individuals with insomnia compared to good sleepers.

Reflection of Anxiety in the Characteristics of Evoked EEG Potentials in 10-to 11-Year-Old Children	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EPs; wave P300; anxiety; children; Prikhozhan's questionnaire; "House-Tree-Person" test Lusher's test	SOURCE LOCALIZATION; PANIC DISORDER; PLASTICITY; SYSTEMS; CORTEX; ERP	We studied the peculiarities of the amplitude/time parameters of evoked EEG potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in 10- to 11-year-old children characterized by low and high anxiety levels. The latter levels were estimated using the scale of the manifest anxiety test of Prikhozhan and projective techniques ("House-Tree-Person," HTP, and the Luscher color test). For children with a high anxiety level, the amplitudes of the following EP components and ERPs were lower than those in low-anxiety children of the same age: P1 ( predominantly in the occipital region of the left hemisphere), P2 ( in the right occipital region), and P300 wave ( in different loci of both hemispheres). In high-anxiety children, we also more frequently observed increased amplitudes of the N2 component in the left parietal and right occipital regions. High-anxiety individuals were characterized by longer latencies of component P1 ( mostly in the right frontal and left central regions) and, at the same time, shorter latencies of component N1 ( in the parietal and occipital regions of the left hemisphere and also in the right temporal region). Thus, we found that the amplitude/time characteristics of a few EP components and ERPs in children with high anxiety levels differ statistically significantly from the parameters of corresponding EPs/ERPs in individuals of the same age but with low anxiety levels.

The presence of a significant spatial correspondence is a prerequisite for direct integration of the two modalities, enabling to combine the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of ERPs. Four separate tasks were employed: visual stimulation with a pattern-reversal chequerboard, recognition of images of nameable objects, recognition of written words, and auditory stimulation with a piano note. ERPs were acquired with 19 recording channels, and source localisation was performed using a realistic head model, a standard cortical mesh and the multiple sparse priors method. Spatial correspondence was evaluated at group level over 10 subjects, by means of a voxel-by-voxel test and a test on the distribution of local maxima. Although not complete, it was significant for the visual stimulation task, image and word recognition tasks (P < 0.001 for both types of test), but not for the auditory stimulation task. These findings indicate that partial but significant spatial correspondence between the two modalities can be found even with a small number of channels, for three of the four tasks employed. Absence of correspondence for the auditory Stimulation task was caused by the unfavourable situation of the activated cortex being perpendicular to the overlying scalp, whose consequences were exacerbated by the small number of channels. The present study corroborates existing literature in this field, and may be of particular relevance to those interested in combining fMRI with ERPs acquired with the standard 10-20 system.

For a given set of responses, the variation in the data is summarized by means of a small set of meaningful prototypes accompanied with a low-dimensional graph capturing their relative relationships. CFCM enables prototyping in a principled manner. User-defined constraints, which are imposed by the nature of experimental data and/or dictated by the neuroscientist's intuition, direct the process of knowledge extraction and can robustify single-trial analysis. The method is introduced using simulated data and demonstrated using actual encephalographic data. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A self-paced brain-computer interface system with a low false positive rate	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; MOTOR IMAGERY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; BETA-RHYTHM; MU-RHYTHM; EEG; BCI; POWER	The performance of current EEG-based self-paced brain-computer interface (SBCI) systems is not suitable for most practical applications. In this paper, an improved SBCI that uses features extracted from three neurological phenomena (movement-related potentials, changes in the power of Mu rhythms and changes in the power of Beta rhythms) to detect an intentional control command in noisy EEG signals is proposed. The proposed system achieves a high true positive (TP) to false positive (FP) ratio. To extract features for each neurological phenomenon in every EEG signal, a method that consists of a stationary wavelet transform followed by matched filtering is developed. For each neurological phenomenon in every EEG channel, features are classified using a support vector machine classifier (SVM). For each neurological phenomenon, a multiple classifier system (MCS) then combines the outputs of the SVMs. Another MCS combines the outputs of MCSs designed for the three neurological phenomena. Various configurations for combining the outputs of these MCSs are considered. A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed to simultaneously select the features, the values of the classifiers' parameters and the configuration for combining MCSs that yield the near optimal performance. Analysis of the data recorded from four able-bodied subjects shows a significant performance improvement over previous SBCIs.	[Fatourechi, M.; Ward, R. K.; Birch, G.

Human facial expressions of emotions are readily recognized but may also evoke the same experiential emotional state in the observer. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and multi-channel electroencephalography to determine in 14 right-handed healthy volunteers (29 +/- 6 years) which brain structures mediate the perception of such a shared experiential emotional state. Statistical parametric mapping showed that an area in the dorsal medial frontal cortex was specifically activated during the perception of emotions that reflected the seen happy and sad emotional face expressions. This area mapped to the pre-supplementary motor area which plays a central role in control of behavior. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography-based analysis of the encephalographic data revealed that the activation was detected 100 ms after face presentation onset lasting until 740 ms. Our observation substantiates recently emerging evidence suggesting that the subjective perception of an experiential emotional state-empathy-is mediated by the involvement of the dorsal medial frontal cortex.

It is often assumed that the major artifacts that compromise non-invasive EEG, such as caused by blinks and eye movement, are absent in invasive EEG recordings. Quantitative investigations on the signal quality of simultaneously recorded invasive and non-invasive EEG in terms of artifact contamination are, however, lacking. Here we compared blink related artifacts in non-invasive and invasive EEG, simultaneously recorded from prefrontal and motor cortical regions using an approach suitable for detection of small artifact contamination. As expected, we find blinks to cause pronounced artifacts in non-invasive EEG both above prefrontal and motor cortical regions. Unexpectedly, significant blink related artifacts were also found in the invasive recordings, in particular in the prefrontal region. Computing a ratio of artifact amplitude to the amplitude of ongoing brain activity, we find that the signal quality of invasive EEG is 20 to above 100 times better than that of simultaneously obtained non-invasive EEG. Thus, while our findings indicate that ocular artifacts do exist in invasive recordings, they also highlight the much better signal quality of invasive compared to non-invasive EEG data. Our findings suggest that blinks should be taken into account in the experimental design of ECoG Studies, particularly when event related potentials in fronto-anterior brain regions are analyzed. Moreover, our results encourage the application of techniques for reducing ocular artifacts to further optimize the signal quality of invasive EEG. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This method was first applied to the case of the MIX ( p) system, and then was compared with the approximate entropy which had been successfully used to analyze the biological and medical experimental data. The complexity of ERPs in the Oddball paradigm was calculated with the symbolic dynamics. It was found that the complexity of ERPs over the frontal, central, and parietal areas declined significantly during the processing of tasks, reached at the minimum corresponding to the latency of P300 component, and rose back after the response was performed. In addition, this method was sensitive to the discrimination between target stimuli and non-target stimuli. The results indicate that the complexity based on the symbolic dynamics can sensitively reflect the processing of the cognitive task, and will be a promising tool to analyze the neural activity associated with the cognitive task.

Space-time-frequency analysis of EEG data using within-subject statistical tests followed by sequential PCA	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; PARALLEL ANALYSIS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; NUMBER; VARIANCE; SPECTRA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MISALLOCATION	A new method is developed for analyzing the time-varying spectral content of EEG data collected in cognitive tasks. The goal is to extract and summarize the most salient features of numerical results, which span space, time, frequency, task conditions, and multiple subjects. Direct generalization of an established approach for analyzing event-related potentials, which uses sequential PCA followed by ANOVA to test for differences between conditions across subjects, gave unacceptable results. The new method, termed STAT-PCA, advocates statistical testing for differences between conditions within single subjects, followed by sequential PCA across subjects. In contrast to PCA-ANOVA, it is demonstrated that STAT-PCA gives results which: 1) isolate task-related spectral changes, 2) are insensitive to the precise definition of baseline power, 3) are stable under deletion of a random subject, and 4) are interpretable in terms of the group-averaged power. Furthermore, STAT-PCA permits the detection of activity that is not only different between conditions, but also common to both conditions, providing a complete yet parsimonious view of the data. It is concluded that STAT-PCA is well suited for analyzing the time-varying spectral content of EEG during cognitive tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Orientation sensitivity of the N1 evoked by letters and digits	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						visual-evoked potentials; ERP; EEG; P1; N1; object orientation; letters; digits	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEPENDENT OBJECT RECOGNITION; FACE-INVERSION; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; MENTAL ROTATION; CATEGORIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; EXPERTISE; FAMILIAR; BRAIN	Orientation sensitivity of the amplitude and latency of the P1 and the N1 was investigated while participants performed letter-digit category judgments and red-blue color judgments. These two tasks were used in order to ascertain whether the orientation effects reflect access to object identity, which would be necessary for category, but not color, judgments. Character misorientation significantly affected both the latency and the amplitude of the N1, but not the P1, component. The N1 amplitude increased gradually up to 90 degrees, then leveled off up to 150 degrees, and dipped somewhat for 180 degrees. The effect of orientation on N1 latency differed between the hemispheres, with a quadratic function characterizing the effect of orientation on the left, and linear and quadratic trends characterizing the effect on the right. The effects of orientation were attributed to perceptual learning rather than object recognition, and the hemispheric differences in N1 latency suggest feature-based processing in the left hemisphere and holistic processing in the right.

In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach for robust asynchronous control using electroencephalogram (EEG) and a P300-based odd-ball paradigm. In this approach, we first address the mathematical modeling of target P300, nontarget P300, and noncontrol signals, by using Gaussian distribution models in a support vector margin space. Furthermore, we derive a method to compute the likelihood of control state in a time window of EEG. Finally, we devise a recursive algorithm to detect control states in ongoing EEG for online application. We conducted experiments with four subjects to study both the asynchronous BCI's receiver operating characteristics and its performance in actual online tests. The results show that the BCI is able to achieve an averaged information transfer rate of approximately 20 b/min at a low false positive rate (one event per minute).

With the present experiment we aimed to study age effects on advance movement preparation, a key characteristic of motor behaviour that is known to involve premotor and primary motor circuits. The respective brain regions are subject to age-related brain atrophy of grey and white matter, and we therefore hypothesized that motor preparation mechanisms may be altered in older persons. Using a motor priming paradigm, performance data and event-related potentials were recorded in older (68-83 years) and younger (21-25 years) participants. The effect pattern observed for the younger group fully replicated previous findings, showing significant reaction time benefits and greater foreperiod activity for valid trials, as well as lateralized activation over motor regions. In older participants, the validity effect was insignificant, which corresponded to markedly reduced foreperiod amplitudes and the absence of lateralized activity. At the same time, the event-related potential showed a frontocentrally distributed positive component peaking in the P300 latency range after presentation of the prime. The amplitude of this potential was enhanced in elderly compared with young participants. The data suggest that the information processing related to the anticipation and preparation of an upcoming response changes substantially with age. In contrast to younger participants, older participants show no indication of effector-specific activation and recruit frontal areas in anticipation of a response signal. It is therefore not only movement execution that changes with age but also motor cognition.

The application is based on detecting P300 event-related potentials in EEG signals recorded on the scalp of the subject. The BCI uses a simple classifier which relies on a linear feature extraction approach. The accuracy of the presented system is comparable to the state-of-the-art; for on-line P300 detection; but with the additional benefit that its much simpler design supports a power-efficient on-chip implementation.

We recorded the electrocorticogram directly from the exposed cortical surface of awake neurosurgical patients during the presentation of auditory syllable stimuli. All patients were unanesthetized as part of a language-mapping procedure for subsequent left-hemisphere tumor resection. Time-frequency analyses showed significant high-gamma (gamma(high): 70-160 Hz) responses from the left superior temporal gyrus, but no reliable response from the left inferior frontal gyrus. Alpha suppression (alpha: 7-14 Hz) and event-related potential responses exhibited a more widespread topography. Across electrodes, the alpha suppression from 200 to 450 ms correlated with the preceding (50-200 ms) gamma(high) increase. The results are discussed in terms of the different physiological origins of these electrocortical signals.

Methods: Latencies and amplitudes of the motion (N2 with subcomponents) and oddball responses (N200 and P3b) were analysed after age correction. Results: With increasing load, latencies increased and the amplitudes of the oddball components tended to be reduced. The latency increase between the high- and low-loaded children was about 13 ms (P < 0.004) and the oddball response showed an amplitude decrease of 12% (P = 0.009). Conclusions: It may be concluded that, during the end-80s/early-90s, exposure to background levels in industrialized regions seems to have resulted in small underdevelopment or damage to visual motion processing and visual cognition. Significance: Since dioxin pollution by incinerators still exists in many regions in developing countries and also still, although at a smaller scale, in the industrialized world, perinatal loads of similar magnitude and possibly more as measured in this study may occur and as a consequence might affect the developing brain.

The 4 stimulus conditions were (1 and 2) supraliminal acquaintance name primed by subliminal acquaintance name (A-A) versus subliminal nonacquaintance name (N-A) and (3 and 4) supraliminal nonacquaintance name primed by subliminal acquaintance name (A-N) versus subliminal nonacquaintance name (N-N). In Experiment 1 and replication, principal components analysis-derived event-related potential components revealed significant differences between dishonestly answered supraliminal acquaintance conditions with differing primes (A-A vs. N-A). In Experiment 2 subjects were required to lie in A-N and N-N conditions, in contrast to Experiment 1, in which subjects lied in A-A and N-A conditions. No significant effects were found. In Experiment 3, the lying task was removed and no significant differences were found. We conclude that subliminal primes modulate ERPs in conditions with supraliminal acquaintance name when the task involves lying.

AN APPLICATION OF FEATURE SELECTION TO ON-LINE P300 DETECTION IN BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE			BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; COMMUNICATION; EEG	We propose a new EEG-based wireless brain computer interface (BCI) with which subjects can "mind-type" text on a computer screen. The application is based on detecting P300 event-related potentials in EEG signals recorded on the scalp of the subject. The BCI uses a linear classifier which takes as input a set of simple amplitude-based features that are optimally selected using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) feature selection procedure. The accuracy of the presented system is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems for on-line P300 detection, but with the additional benefit that its much simpler design supports a power-efficient on-chip implementation.

Methods: Electroencephalographic data were recorded in 19 obese and 15 normal-weight adults during an "oddball" paradigm. The subjects were given frequent (70%) and rare (30%) stimuli depicting faces (FACE), food (FOOD), and landscapes (CONTROL), and clicked the mouse after the rare stimuli. These stimuli depicted the same frequent stimuli graphically dilated by 25% along the horizontal axis. Bioelectrical impedance indexed subjects' body fat percentage. Cortical attentional responses were probed by the difference between positive event-related potentials peaking around 400-500 ms post-stimulus for the rare minus frequent stimuli (P300). Low resolution electromagnetic Source tomography (LORETA) estimated P300 sources. Results: In the FOOD condition, the amplitude of medial prefrontal P300 sources (Brodniann area 9) was lower in the obese than normal-weight subjects, and there was a negative correlation between the body fat percentage and the amplitude of these Sources in all subjects as a single group. Conclusions: These results disclose that prefrontal attentional processes to food size are abnormal in obese subjects. Significance: The present study motivates future research evaluating the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in obese subjects. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Logeswaran, N; Bhattacharya, J				Logeswaran, Nidhya; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Crossmodal transfer of emotion by music	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Music; Face; Emotion; Priming; ERP	ASYMMETRY; EEG; PERCEPTION	Music is one of the most powerful elicitors of subjective emotion, yet it is not clear whether emotions elicited by music are similar to emotions elicited by visual stimuli. This leads to an open question: can music-elicited emotion be transferred to and/or influence subsequent vision-elicited emotional processing? Here we addressed this question by investigating processing of emotional faces (neutral, happy and sad) primed by short excerpts of musical stimuli (happy and sad). Our behavioural experiment showed a significant effect of musical priming: prior listening to a happy (sad) music enhanced the perceived happiness (sadness) of a face irrespective of facial emotion. Further, this musical priming-induced effect was largest for neutral face. Our electrophysiological experiment showed that such crossmodal priming effects were manifested by event related brain potential components at a very early (within 100ms poststimulus) stages of neuronal information processing. Altogether, these results offer new insight into the crossmodal nature of music and its ability to transfer emotion to visual modality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bonnefond, M; Van der Henst, JB				Bonnefond, Mathilde; Van der Henst, Jean-Baptiste			What's behind an inference? An EEG study with conditional arguments	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Inference; Conditional reasoning; N2; P3b; PSW; CNV	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL BASIS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; P300; BRAIN; ATTENTION; PARADIGM	Conditional reasoning studies typically involve presenting a major conditional premise (If P then Q), a minor premise (P) and a conclusion (Q). We describe how most fMRI studies investigate reasoning and point out that these studies neglect to take into consideration the temporal sequence of cognitive steps generated by the interaction of the premises. The present study uses EEG to address this issue and compares the processing of the minor premise P when it is presented before vs. after the conditional statement ((P) under bar; If P then Q vs. If P then Q; (P) under bar). When the minor premise comes after the conditional statement and matches the antecedent its processing results in a P3b component, known to reflect the satisfaction of expectations, and in two later components, a PSW component and a CNV component. These two components are discussed in light of a conclusion generation phase and a maintenance phase. We also investigated the effect of violating expectations through the presentation of a minor premise that mismatches the antecedent of the conditional statement (If P then Q; (R) under bar). The data indicate that the processing of such a premise yields an N2 component which is known to reflect perceptual conflict. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Language; Prediction; Working memory capacity; Reading span	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; TIME-COURSE; INFERENCE GENERATION; SENTENCE; LEVEL; ERPS; SUPPRESSION; CONTEXT	Prior research has indicated that readers and listeners can use information in the prior discourse to rapidly predict specific upcoming words, as the text is unfolding. Here we used event-related potentials to explore whether the ability to make rapid online predictions depends on a reader's working memory capacity (WMC). Readers with low WMC were hypothesized to differ from high WMC readers either in their overall capability to make predictions (because of their lack of cognitive resources). High and low WMC participants read highly constraining stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun, mixed with coherent but essentially unpredictive 'prime control' control stories that contained the same content words as the predictive stories. To test whether readers were anticipating upcoming words, critical nouns were preceded by a determiner whose gender agreed or disagreed with the gender of the expected noun. In predictive stories, both high and low WMC readers displayed an early negative deflection (300-600 ms) to unexpected determiners, which was not present in prime control stories. Only the low WMC participants displayed an additional later negativity (900-1500 ms) to unexpected determiners. This pattern of results suggests that WMC does not influence the ability to anticipate upcoming words per se, but does change the way in which readers deal with information that disconfirms the generated prediction.

Responding is predicted to be foster on consistent trials, when concepts that are associated in memory share a response key, than on inconsistent trials, when less associated items share a key. In the current study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were engaged in an IAT task. Two positively valenced stimuli (baby and romance) and two negatively valenced stimuli (spider and snake) were employed as category labels. Results showed shorter response latencies on consistent relative to inconsistent trials. Differential EEG activity was also observed.. Consistent trials tended to generate more positive waveforms in the central and parietal areas relative to inconsistent trials during the 300- to 400-ms interval following stimulus onset. During the 400- to 600-ms interval, inconsistent trials were significantly more positive than consistent trials at the two prefrontal sites and significantly more negative at the two central sites. Comparisons between the EEG activity generated in the current IAT study and that generated by semantic priming are discussed.

A brief description of EPs, characteristics of their components, sources of generation, and functional correlates is presented. Possible effects of the emotional significance of the stimulus and of individual peculiarities of the personality on the amplitude/temporal characteristics of EPs are considered. It is supposed that the aminergic cerebral systems play a crucial role in the formation of peculiarities of emotional responses, expression of the definite EP components, and biologically determined features of the human personality.

However, the identification and interpretation of independent components is time-consuming and involves subjective decision making. We developed and evaluated a semi-automatic tool designed for clustering independent components from different subjects and/or EEG recordings. Methods: CORRMAP is an open-source EEGLAB plug-in, based on the correlation of ICA inverse weights, and finds independent components that are similar to a user-defined template. Component similarity is measured using a correlation procedure that selects components that pass a threshold. The threshold can be either user-defined or determined automatically. CORRMAP clustering performance was evaluated by comparing it with the performance of 11 users from different laboratories familiar with ICA. Results: For eye-related artifacts, a very high degree of overlap between users (phi > 0.80), and between users and CORRMAP (phi > 0.80) was observed. Lower degrees of association were found for heartbeat artifact components, between users (phi < 0.70), and between users and CORRMAP (phi < 0.65). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CORRMAP provides an efficient, convenient and objective way of clustering independent components. Significance: CORRMAP helps to efficiently use ICA for the removal EEG artifacts. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Event-related potentials for interaural time differences and spectral cues	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory-evoked potential; auditory segregation; dichotic pitch; interaural time difference	DICHOTIC PITCH; PERCEPTUAL SEGREGATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG	Dichotic pitches and mistuned harmonics can each lead to the perception of one or two auditory objects. Comparison of event-related potentials for the perception of one versus two objects reveals an early negative and a late positive component. The relationship of these components with auditory segregation was further investigated using stimuli containing monaural spectral cues to pitch, binaural timing cues to pitch, or a combination of both, interleaved with control stimuli (no pitch). Stimuli containing timing cues or a combination of timing and spectral cues reliably elicited both components, which were of larger amplitude when both cues were present.

The neural mechanisms underlying this condition are not clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the general effects of spinal deafferentiation and of bNP on electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity. In addition, the relationship between the presence of bNP and impaired function of the spinothalamic tract was studied. Measurements were performed in complete and incomplete spinal cord-injured subjects with and without bNP as well as in a healthy control group. Spinothalamic tract function, assessed by contact heat evoked potentials, did not differ between subjects with and without bNP; nevertheless, it was impaired in 94% of subjects suffering from bNP. In the EEG recordings, the degree of deafferentiation was reflected in a slowing of EEG peak frequency in the 6-12-Hz band. Taking into account this unspecific effect, spinal cord-injured subjects with bNP showed significantly slower EEG activity than subjects without bNP. A discrimination analysis in the subjects with spinothalamic tract dysfunction correctly classified 84% of subjects as belonging to either the group with bNP or the group without bNP, according to their EEG peak frequency. These findings could be helpful for both the development of an objective diagnosis of bNP and for testing the effectiveness of new therapeutic agents.

Forty-five female participants were divided into three groups and were either led to believe the odor was a natural, healthy extract (positive bias), potentially hazardous (negative bias), or a common test odorant (control). The odor (isobornyl acetate) was presented via a constant-flow olfactometer and the EEG was recorded from 60 scalp locations. In the negative bias condition, participants reported reduced well-being and judged the odor as less pleasant. However, neither the thresholds nor the intensity ratings were changed by the context condition. Chemosensory event-related potential (CSERP) analysis revealed that the latencies of the N1 and P2 components were prolonged in the negative bias condition and shortened in the positive bias condition. Current source densities were most prominent in the frontal lobe in negatively biased participants. The findings show that expecting to perceive an emotionally significant odor affects the early encoding of odors. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Intermodal attention affects the processing of the temporal alignment of audiovisual stimuli	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electrophysiology; EEG; ERP; Multisensory; SOA	PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER; AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; TIME; CONJUNCTIONS; CAPTURE; NEURONS; HUMANS	The temporal asynchrony between inputs to different sensory modalities has been shown to be a critical factor influencing the interaction between such inputs. We used scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the effects of attention on the processing of audiovisual multisensory stimuli as the temporal asynchrony between the auditory and visual inputs varied across the audiovisual integration window (i.e., up to 125 ms). Randomized streams of unisensory auditory stimuli, unisensory visual stimuli, and audiovisual stimuli (consisting of the temporally proximal presentation of the visual and auditory stimulus components) were presented centrally while participants attended to either the auditory or the visual modality to detect occasional target stimuli in that modality. ERPs elicited by each of the contributing sensory modalities were extracted by signal processing techniques from the combined ERP waveforms elicited by the multisensory stimuli. This was done for each of the five different 50-ms subranges of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA: e. g., V precedes A by 125-75 ms, by 75-25 ms, etc.). The extracted ERPs for the visual inputs of the multisensory stimuli were compared among each other and with the ERPs to the unisensory visual control stimuli, separately when attention was directed to the visual or to the auditory modality. The results showed that the attention effects on the right-hemisphere visual P1 was largest when auditory and visual stimuli were temporally aligned. In contrast, the N1 attention effect was smallest at this latency, suggesting that attention may play a role in the processing of the relative temporal alignment of the constituent parts of multisensory stimuli. At longer latencies an occipital selection negativity for the attended versus unattended visual stimuli was also observed, but this effect did not vary as a function of SOA, suggesting that by that latency a stable representation of the auditory and visual stimulus components has been established.

An ERP investigation of the Stroop task: The role of the cingulate in attentional allocation and conflict resolution	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Stroop; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC); Attention; Interference; Facilitation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FRONTAL-LOBE; INTERFERENCE; CORTEX; COLOR; PERFORMANCE; FMRI; PET	The majority of studies support a role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the attentional control necessary for conflict resolution in the Stroop task; however, the time course of activation and the neural substrates underlying the Stroop task remain contentious. We used high-density EEG to record visual-evoked potentials from 16 healthy subjects while performing a manual version of the traditional Stroop colour-word task. Difference waveforms for congruent-control and incongruent-control conditions were similar in amplitude and had a similar spatial distribution in the time window of 260-430 ms post stimulus onset. Source estimation indicated particularly middle cingulate involvement in congruent-control and incongruent-control difference waveforms. In contrast, the difference waveform for the incongruent-congruent contrast was observed later (in the time window of 370-480 ms), had a different spatial distribution, and source estimation indicated that the anterior cingulate underlies this difference waveform. As congruent-control and incongruent-control differences have a similar timeframe and cingulate source, we propose that this indicates early attentional allocation processes. That is, the identification of two sources of information (the word and the colour it is printed in) and the selective attention to one. The later peak in the incongruent-congruent difference wave, originating in anterior cingulate, likely reflects identification (and subsequent resolution) of conflict in the two sources of information.

Prognostic role of somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials in paediatric hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy managed with hypothermia: An illustrative case	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Postanoxic coma; Somatosensory evoked potentials; Mismatch negativity; Children; EEG; Prognosis	SEVERE BRAIN-INJURY; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; CARDIAC-ARREST; COMA; CHILDREN	Introduction.-The contribution of clinical neurophysiology in the neurological prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic coma has been well established in adults: the bilateral absence of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) is considered the single best indicator of adverse outcome, while the presence of the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is thought to herald arousal. Study aim.-To use MMN combined with serial EEG recordings, somatosensory and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) in a paediatric case of postanoxic coma managed with hypothermia, since they have not yet been described in children. Methods.-We report the case of a nine-year-old boy with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to cardiorespiratory arrest after accidental burial in sand, who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours. Serial EEG recordings, evoked potentials, brain CT scan and brain MRI were performed in the first few days after the event. Results.-SEP to median nerve stimulation showed bilateral absence of the N20 component, while the N13 and P14 peaks were preserved; BAEP showed normal I-V interpeak latency and normal hearing threshold. At the same time, the MMN component of auditory event related potentials, recorded in the classical oddball paradigm, was absent. Seventeen months after the accident, the patient is alive in persistent vegetative state. Conclusions.-This case illustrates the particular significance of SEP and MMN together with EEG in gaining prognostic information, even in sedated and hypothermic patients, and encourages systematic study of these prognostic tools in paediatric postanoxic coma.

In the ideal case, these responses can predict cognitive problems later in life. We employed a multiple deviant paradigm for a fast assessment of the ability of the newborn brain to respond to various types of acoustic changes. Methods: In 12 healthy newborns, we recorded all electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram while presenting auditory stimuli. Between repeated stimuli, four types of acoustic changes (frequency intensity, duration, and a gap) were presented, varying in deviance magnitude. Results: One major response was present in the neonatal evoked potentials and fields at 250-260 ms. Magnetic mismatch responses were elicited to all change types except for the duration deviant and they were positive in polarity. The frequency deviant elicited more positive EEG amplitudes than the standard, whereas the response to the duration deviant was more negative. Conclusions: These results show that newborns can detect changes to at least four types of deviances within a Sound stream. Furthermore, the use of magneto- and electroencephalography is complementary in newborns, since the methods may reveal different outcomes. Significance: Further studies are warranted to determine whether the present study design can play a role in testing auditory function in clinical infant populations.

The data demonstrated that relative energy measurements based on wavelet transform could be a useful alternative approach to analyzing short duration EEG signals on a time scale of seconds.				zhangtao@nankai.edu.cn	Wu, Jie/I-3755-2014	Wu, Jie/0000-0002-0989-8115					7	0	0	0	0	HUMANA PRESS INC	TOTOWA	999 RIVERVIEW DR, STE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512-1165 USA			978-1-4020-8386-0				2008							631	635		10.1007/978-1-4020-8387-7_109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8387-7_109			5	Neurosciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Neurosciences & Neurology	BIR74					2022-08-02	WOS:000262360700109

Electrophysiological evidence of functional integration between the language and motor systems in the brain: A study of the speech Bereitschaftspotential	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Bereitschaftspotential; Lexical access; ERP; Language; Motor; Speech	POTENTIALS PRECEDING SPEECH; MOVEMENT; HANDEDNESS; EVOLUTION	Objective: We investigated whether the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), an event related potential believed to reflect motor planning, would be modulated by language-related parameters prior to speech. We anticipated that articulatory complexity would produce effects on the BP distribution similar to those demonstrated for complex limb movements. We also hypothesized that lexical semantic operations would independently impact the BP. Methods: Eighteen participants performed 3 speech tasks designed to differentiate lexical semantic and articulatory contributions to the BP. EEG epochs were time-locked to the earliest source of speech movement per trial. Lip movements were assessed using EMG recordings. Doppler imaging was used to determine the onset of tongue movement during speech, providing a means of identification and elimination of potential artifact. Results: Compared to simple repetition, complex articulations produced an anterior shift in the maximum midline BP. Tasks requiring lexical search and selection augmented these effects and independently elicited a left lateralized asymmetry in the frontal distribution. Conclusions: The findings indicate that the BP is significantly modulated by linguistic processing, suggesting that the premotor system might play a role in lexical access. Significance: These novel findings support the notion that the motor systems may play a significant role in the formulation of language.

Multichannel EEG recordings and pain ratings were obtained during the presentation of 800 painful electrical intramuscular and intracutaneous stimuli to the left m. erector spinae and the left m. extensor digitorum. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to 50% between pain threshold and tolerance. Detection and pain thresholds were significantly lower in the fibromyalgia syndrome group. Sensitization occurred for both groups during intramuscular stimulation. In the EEG data the fibromyalgia syndrome patients showed higher N80 amplitudes compared with the healthy controls. Arm stimulation and intramuscular stimulation yielded higher N80 and N150 amplitudes compared with intracutaneous stimulation or stimulation of the back. These results indicate lower pain thresholds in the fibromyalgia syndrome patients after electrical stimulation and a higher N80 amplitude both indicative of enhanced sensory processing in this group.

This BCI application is of particular interest for disabled patients who have lost all means of verbal and motor communication. We report on the implementation of a feature extraction procedure on a new ultra low-power 8-channel wireless EEG device. The feature extraction procedure is based on downsampled EEG signal epochs, the Student's t-statistic of the Continuous Wavelet Transform, and the Common Spatial Pattern technique. For classification, we use a linear Least-Squares Support Vector Machine. The results show that subjects are potentially able to communicate a character in less than ten seconds with an accuracy of 94.5%, which is more than twice as fast as the state of the art. In addition since our EEG device is wireless it offers an increased comfort to the subject.

Five naive subjects performed either sustaining or stopping a motor task with time locking to a predefined time window by using motor execution with physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored. The performance of the proposed BCI was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the hand moved for both motor execution and motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity in the contralateral hemisphere over the motor cortex provided the best detection of either sustained or ceased movement of the right or left hand. The offline classification of four motor tasks (sustain or cease to move right or left hand) provided 10-fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88% for motor execution and 73% for motor imagery. The subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with motor execution at an average accuracy of 85.5 +/- 4.65%; the subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed BCI provides a new practical multidimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training.

Synchronized oscillations in the Gamma-Band (>30Hz; induced Gamma-Band Responses, iGBRs), are regarded as a plausible mechanism to re-integrate these regions into a meaningful cortical object representation. Using electroencephalography (EEG) it was demonstrated that the generators of iGBRs can be localized to temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. The present magnetoencephalogram (MEG) study intended to replicate these findings in order contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the possible functional difference of high-frequency signals as measured by both techniques. During a standard object recognition task we found an augmentation of the iGBR after the presentation of meaningful as opposed to meaningless stimuli at similar to 160-440 ms after stimulus onset. This peak was localized to inferior temporal gyri, superior parietal lobules and the right middle frontal gyrus. Importantly, most of these brain structures were significantly phase-locked to each other. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) they present further evidence for the view that iGBRs signify neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. (2) MEG is well suited to detect induced high-frequency oscillations with a very similar morphology as revealed by EEG recordings, thereby eliminating known problems with electroencephalographical methods (e.g. reference confounds). In contrast to the iGBR, the localization of event-related fields (ERFs) and evoked Gamma-Band Response (eGBRs) revealed generators in focal visual areas, and thus, seem to mirror early sensory processing.

The proposed combination involves two sequential steps: At first, the EEG noise level is reduced from -5 to 0 dB owing to the LMA based on the singular-value-decomposition. In the secondary process, the EEG noise remaining on the projected data is removed by using the SSF. A small number of sweeps are composed as a raw matrix to project the data without using the ensemble averaging at the beginning of the proposed method. Then, single sweeps are individually filtered in wavelet domain by using the SSF in the secondary step. The experimental results show that the SSF can extract the clear single-sweep auditory EP waveform where the LMA is used as a primary filtering. As well, the results indicate that the EP signal and background EEG noise create different wavelet coefficients due to their different characteristics. However, this characteristic difference can be considered to distinguish the EP signal and the EEG noise when the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio is higher than 0 dB.

Scanning strategies for simultaneous EEG-fMRI evoked potential studies at 3 T	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Multimodal Imaging: Integration of EEG and fMRI data held at the 32nd German Congress on Psychology and the Brain	2006	Dresden, GERMANY			simultaneous EEG-fMRI; EEG data quality; BCG artefact removal; VEPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; RECORDINGS; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MRI	There are two basic strategies for applying simultaneous EEG-fmRI: either the fMRI data are acquired continuously, or the stimulus is presented during a brief gap in scanning when the EEG data is clear of gradient artefact. The former has the advantage that the protocol for the fMRI data acquisition is not affected by the presence of EEG. This study investigated the effect of these different strategies and the subsequent ballistocardiogram artefact removal methods (Average Artefact Subtraction (AAS) and Optimal Basis Set (OBS)) on EEG data quality recorded in response to a visual stimulus. Continuous scanning generally resulted in VEPs that were no worse, and in some cases were better, than those measured during a gap in scanning. The AAS and OBS methods lead to comparable results at the level of the grand average visual evoked potential (VEP), although when examined at the level of the single trial the OBS method was more effective. The spectral quality of the data was similar across scanning protocols, as demonstrated by the proportion of spectral power in each frequency band, although there was an effect of the artefact removal method on the overall spectral power. Some differences in the VEPs were also noted when a TR of 1.5 s was used relative to a TR of 3 s. The results indicate improved EEG quality when fMRI scanning is continuous and BCG artefacts are removed using the OBS method, confirming that EEG can be added to an fMRI experiment with minimal change to the experimental protocol.

Movement intention is expressed as a slow negative deflection in amplitude of the EEG signal recorded above the motor cortex. This deflection is known as a movement-related cortical potential (MRCP). Detection of movement intention implies discrimination between MRCPs and noise. The signal-to-noise ratio of MRCPs was improved by an optimized spatial filter. Features were extracted with principal component analysis or locality preserving projections from the spatially filtered signals and classification between MRCPs and noise was performed with a k-nearest neighbors algorithm, modified by adjusting the decision rule to improve specificity, and a support vector machine approach. In one representative subject the sensitivity and specificity in detection were in the range 80-90% and 98-99.5%, respectively. The method seems promising for the development of asynchronous brain-computer interfaces (BCls) based on MRCPs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Knowing we know before we know: ERP correlates of initial feeling-of-knowing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Feeling-of-knowing; Metacognition; Arithmetic; ERP; EEG; P200	STRATEGY SELECTION; MEMORY; WORD; RETRIEVAL; DISCRIMINATION; RECOLLECTION; SENSITIVITY; FAMILIARITY; POTENTIALS; REPETITION	Subjects performed a rapid feeling-of-knowing task developed by (Reder, L M., & Ritter, F. (1992). What determines initial feeling of knowing? Familiarity with question terms, not with the answer. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 435-451), while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to identify the time course of "feeling-of-knowing" signals. Subjects were shown a series of math problems, some of which were repeated multiple times during the course of the experiment, and subjects had to rapidly decide whether the answer to a given problem could be quickly retrieved from memory (retrieval trials) or had to be calculated on scrap paper (calculate trials). Behavioral results replicated the 1992 study, showing that subjects can estimate whether the answer is known much faster than the answer can be retrieved. ERPs time-locked to the onset of the math problem showed that accurate retrieval trials were associated with greater positivity for an early frontal P2 component (epoched from 180 to 280 ms) and a frontal-central P3 component (epoched from 300 to 550 ms). Moreover, this feeling-of-knowing signal was not found for subjects who never obtained a successful on-time retrieval. We interpret these findings as suggesting that initial feeling-of-knowing relies on a rapid assessment of the.. perceptual fluency" with which the stimulus is processed. If a stimulus is deemed sufficiently familiar, the activation level of an internal problem representation is used to arrive at a decision of whether to search for the answer or to calculate it.

EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS AS RISK MARKERS IN GENETIC MOUSE MODELS OF HIGH ALCOHOL PREFERENCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						HAP-1 mice; LAP-1 mice; C57BL/6 mice; DBA/2 mice; EEG; neuroendophenotype	CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION; HUMAN BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; RECOMBINANT INBRED MICE; GAMMA BAND RESPONSE; VISUAL ODDBALL TASK; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PREFERRING MICE; EVOKED GAMMA; HUMAN EEG; STIMULUS CHARACTERISTICS	Mouse models have been developed to simulate several relevant human traits associated with alcohol use and dependence. However, the neurophysiological substrates regulating these traits remain to be completely elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) responses can be found that distinguish high-alcohol preferring from low alcohol preferring mice that resemble differences seen in human studies of individuals with high and low risk for alcohol dependence. Recently, evidence of genes that affect event-related oscillations (EROs) and the risk for alcohol dependence has emerged, however, to date EROs have not been evaluated in genetic mouse models of high and low alcohol preference. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize EROs in mouse models of high (C57BL/6 [B6] and high alcohol preference I [HAP-1] mice) and low (DBA/2J [D2] and low alcohol preference-1 [LAP-1] mice) alcohol preference. A time-frequency representation method was used to determine delta, theta and alpha/beta ERO energy and the degree of phase variation in these mouse models. The present results suggest that the decrease in P3 amplitudes previously shown in 136 mice, compared to D2 mice, is related to reductions in evoked delta ERO energy and delta and theta phase locking. In contrast, the increase in P1 amplitudes reported in HAP-1 mice, compared to LAP-1 mice, is associated with increases in evoked theta ERO energy. These studies suggest that differences in delta and theta ERO measures in mice mirror changes observed between groups at high- and low-risk for alcoholism where changes in EROs were found to be more significant than group differences in P3 amplitudes, further suggesting that ERO measures are more stable endophenotypes in the study of alcohol dependence. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between expression of these neurophysiological endophenotypes and the genetic profile of these mouse models. (C) 2009 IBRO.

Toward enhanced P300 speller performance	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; event related potentials; P300 speller; stepwise linear discrimmant analysis	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI COMPETITION 2003; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; POTENTIALS; EEG; ATTENTION; IIB	This study examines the effects of expanding the classical P300 feature space on the classification performance of data collected from a P300 speller paradigm [Farwell LA, Donchin E. Talking off the top of your head: toward a mental prosthesis utilizing event-related brain potentials. Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 1988;70:510-23]. Using stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) to construct a classifier, the effects of spatial channel selection, channel referencing, data decimation, and maximum number of model features are compared with the intent of establishing a baseline not only for the SWLDA classifier, but for related P300 speller classification methods in general. By supplementing the classical P300 recording locations with posterior locations, online classification performance of P300 speller responses can be significantly improved using SWLDA and the favorable parameters derived from the offline comparative analysis.

The cognitive and information processing take place in different brain regions at different time. To investigate how these distributed brain regions are linked together and the information is exchanged with time, this paper proposes a modem time-frequency coherent analysis that employs an alternative way for quantifying synchronization with both temporal and spectral resolution. Wavelet coherent spectrum is defined and computed from the EEG data set such that the cross wavelet magnitude spectra serves to indicate the degree of coherence and the cross wavelet phase can be used to provide the direction of information flow between channels on different brain regions. Several real ERP data are collected based on the cognitive tasks of sentences identification in both English and Chinese. It is observed from the time-varying synchronization that there are obviously differences during identifying both Chinese and English sentences.

Mass nouns elicited greater left-lateralization over frontal locations while Count nouns were more lateralized in the left occipito-parietal sites. In the 430-490 ms interval activity and lateralization shifted to anterior sites and a different distribution was found between Mass nouns, Count nouns and Pseudowords. Mass nouns showed greater left-lateralization both in anterior and posterior regions, whereas Count nouns showed relatively less left-lateralization especially over frontal cortex. Results point to a functional distinction between Mass and Count nouns as indicated by the very early automatic N150 difference between the two categories. Count nouns involved left visual associative regions that are typically relevant for object recognition and categorization. Mass nouns, instead, required the activation of more widely spread out linguistic networks that included also left frontal sites, a result that indicates a more difficult and engaging automatic retrieval and an extended cortical representation of these nouns.

Though of high relevance in research, the data obtained is very noisy and nonstationary. In the present article we investigate the applicability of a nonlinear data analysis method, the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to Such data. The method solely rests on the natural property of recurrence which is a phenomenon inherent to complex systems, such as the brain. We show that this method is indeed suitable for the analysis of EEG data and that it might improve contemporary EEG analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose a new BCI method, where users perform either sustaining or stopping a motor task with time locking to a predefined time window. Nine healthy volunteers, one stroke survivor with right-sided hemiparesis and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) participated in this study. Subjects did not receive BCI training before participating in this study. We investigated tasks of both physical movement and motor imagery. The surface Laplacian derivation was used for enhancing EEG spatial resolution. A model-free threshold setting method was used for the classification of motor intentions. The performance of the proposed BCI was validated by an online sequential binary-cursor-control game for two-dimensional cursor movement. Event-related desynchronization and synchronization were observed when subjects sustained or stopped either motor execution or motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity over sensorimotor area provided the largest discrimination. With simple model-free classification of beta band EEG activity from a single electrode (with surface Laplacian derivation), the online classifications of the EEG activity with motor execution/motor imagery were: >90%/similar to 80% for six healthy volunteers, >80%/similar to 80% for the stroke patient and -90%/similar to 80% for the ALS patient. The EEG activities of the other three healthy volunteers were not classifiable. The sensorimotor beta rhythm of EEG associated with human natural motor behavior can be used for a reliable and high performance BCI for both healthy subjects and patients with neurological disorders. Significance: The proposed new non-invasive BCI method highlights a practical 130 for clinical applications, where the user does not require extensive training.

Random Fields-Union Intersection Tests for Detecting Functional Connectivity in EEG/MEG Imaging	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						connectivity; random fields; union-intersection	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL SYSTEMS; BRAIN; FMRI; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS	Electrophysiological (EEG/MEG) imaging challenges statistics by providing two views of the same underlying spatio-temporal brain activity: a topographic view (EEG/MEG) and tomographic view (EEG/MEG source reconstructions). It is a common practice that statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for these two Situations is developed separately. In particular, assessing statistical Significance of functional connectivity is a major challenge in these types Of Studies. This work introduces statistical tests for assessing simultaneously the significance of spatio-temporal correlation Structure between ERP/ERF components as well as that Of their generating Sources. We introduce a greatest root statistic as the multivariate test statistic for detecting functional connectivity between two sets of EEG/MFG measurements at a given time instant. We use some new results in random field theory to solve the multiple comparisons problem resulting from the correlated test statistics at each time instant. In general, our approach using the Union-intersection (UI) principle provides a framework for hypothesis testing about my linear combination of sensor data, which allows the analysis of the correlation structure of both topographic and tomographic views. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated with real ERP data obtained from a face recognition experiment. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2477-2486, 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In addition, recent evidence points to impaired odor hedonics in schizophrenia. It was the aim of the present study to investigate olfactory information processing in schizophrenia patients with positive symptoms, by means of chemosensory event-related potential (CSERP) analysis. To control for modality-specific effects, these data were compared to visual event-related potentials (VERP), and in order to control for disorder-specific effects, the schizophrenia patients were compared to healthy controls as well as to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In each group, nine subjects were investigated. During EEG recording (32 scalp locations) two odors (positive valence: phenyl-ethylalcohol, negative valence: isobutyraldehyde) were presented using the constant flow method. Afterwards, two colors (red, yellow) were presented. The schizophrenia patients responded to both odors with shorter CSERP latencies than healthy controls and MDD-patients. This effect was most pronounced for the early processing (N1 component) of the emotionally negative odor. However, in response to colors, schizophrenia patients showed increased NI latencies and a reduced P3 amplitude. It will be discussed whether schizophrenia patients with positive symptoms show a general processing advantage for emotionally negative (threat-related) information. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Four children (aged 7, 9, 10 and 16 years) with intractable left-hemispheric focal epilepsy underwent extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) as well as language mapping using neurostimulation and auditory-language-induced gamma-oscillations on ECoG. The audible communication was recorded concurrently and integrated with ECoG recording to allow for accurate time lock on ECoG analysis. In three children, who successfully completed the auditory-language task, high-frequency gamma-augmentation sequentially involved: i) the posterior superior temporal gyrus when listening to the question, ii) the posterior lateral temporal region and the posterior frontal region in the time interval between question completion and the patient's vocalization, and iii) the pre-and post-central gyri immediately preceding and during the patient's vocalization. The youngest child, with attention deficits, failed to cooperate during the auditory-language task, and high-frequency gamma-augmentation was noted only in the posterior superior temporal gyrus when audible questions were given. The size of language areas suggested by statistically significant high-frequency gamma-augmentation was larger than that defined by neurostimulation. The present method can provide in vivo imaging of electrophysiological activities over the language network areas during language processes. Further studies are warranted to determine whether recording of language-induced gamma-oscillations can supplement language mapping using neurostimulation in presurgical evaluation of children with focal epilepsy.

Methods: ERPs were recorded during a target categorization task. Automated classification of average target ERPs versus average non-target ERPs was performed by extracting different combinations of features from the P300 and N200 components, which were used to train six classifiers: Euclidean classifier (EC), Mahalanobis discriminant (MD), quadratic classifier (QC), Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: The best classification performance (accuracy: 91-92%; sensitivity: 85-86%; specificity: 95-99%) was provided by QC, MLP, SVM on feature vectors extracted from P300 recorded at multiple sites. In general, non-linear and non-parametric classifiers (QC, MLP, SVM) performed better than linear classifiers (EC, MD, FLD). The N200 did not explain variance beyond that of P300 recorded at multiple sites. Conclusions: The results suggest that automatic characterization and classification of average target and non-target ERPs is feasible. Features of P300 recorded at multiple sites used to train non-linear classifiers are recommended for optimal classification performance. Significance: Automatic characterization of target ERPs can provide an objective approach for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities and evaluating interventions for clinical populations, paving the way for future real-time monitoring of attentional processes.

Such changes enhance information processing capacity, which can be indexed by estimation of neural signal complexity. Here, we show that during development, EEG signal complexity increases from one month to 5 years of age in response to auditory and visual stimulation. However, the rates of change in complexity were not equivalent for the two responses. Infants' signal complexity for the visual condition was greater than auditory signal complexity, whereas adults showed the same level of complexity to both types of stimuli. The differential rates of complexity change may reflect a combination of innate and experiential factors on the structure and function of the two sensory systems.

In this work, we present a new method of continuous VEPs/fMRI recording to study visual function in seven normal subjects. Our real-time artifact filtering is characterized by a procedure based on an analytical study of echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence parameters related electro-encephalogram (EEG)-artifact shapes. The magnetic field artifacts were minimized by using a dedicated amagnetic device and by a subtraction algorithm that takes into account the EPI sequence parameters. No significant decrease in signal-to-noise ratio was observed in case of EEG recording simultaneously with MR acquisition; similarly, transient and steady-state VEPs parameters were comparable during fMRI acquisition and in the off-phase of fMRI recording. We also applied this method to one patient with optic neuritis, and, compared with controls, found different results. We suggest that our technique can be reliably used to investigate the function of human visual cortex and properly correlate the electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging related changes.

However, the strong electromagnetic field of the MR scanner generates artifacts that obscure the EEG and diminish its readability. Among them, the ballistocardiographic artifact (BCGa) that appears on the EEG is believed to be related to blood flow in scalp arteries leading to electrode movements. Average artifact subtraction (AAS) techniques, used to remove the BCGa, assume a deterministic nature of the artifact. This assumption may be too strong, considering the blood flow related nature of the phenomenon. In this work we propose a new method, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and blind source separation (BSS) techniques, to reduce the BCGa from simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI. We optimized the method to reduce the user's interaction to a minimum. When tested on six subjects, recorded in 1.5 T or 3 T, the average artifact extracted with BSS-CCA and AAS did not show significant differences, proving the absence of systematic errors. On the other hand, when compared on the basis of intra-subject variability, we found significant differences and better performance of the proposed method with respect to AAS. We demonstrated that our method deals with the intrinsic subject variability specific to the artifact that may cause averaging techniques to fail.

In this paper, major concepts and advantages of event-related oscillations (EROs) are considered, with a focus on their relevance for developmental research. Findings from previous studies in passive and oddball conditions are summarized to demonstrate that the age-dependent power decrease of theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) EROs is accompanied by an increase in the synchronization of these oscillations. New data are presented to test whether this dissociation depends on processing demands in a frequency-specific manner. Results from an auditory serial learning task with working memory activation performed by 70 subjects (children from 6 to 10 years of age and adults) indicate that this effect was observed for theta and slow alpha oscillations, whereas an age-dependent decrease in event-related phase synchronization was found for fast alpha oscillations. It is concluded that phase synchronization of only the major theta and alpha EROs may reflect the neurobiological maturation of neural networks involved in perception. Phase synchronization of EROs, however, especially from faster frequency bands, essentially depends on the mode of network involvement and functional competence, which is associated with cognitive processing abilities or strategies in the course of development.

Correlations between Indices of P300 EEG Potential, Cognitive Tests, and Variational Pulsometry in Parkinsonian Patients	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						P300 potential; variational pulsometry; cognitive functions; Parkinson's disease	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; COMPONENT; DISEASE; PROGRESSION; NUCLEUS	The parameters of an event-related EEG potential (ERP), P300 wave, are now extensively used as objective neurophysiological indices of the state of cognitive functions. At the same time, information on the effects of the autonomic nervous system on the parameters of P300 is limited. In Parkinson's disease clinics, in addition to the leading motor disorders, more or less clear psychoemotional, cognitive, and autonomic (in particular cardiovascular) impairments are usually observed. This allows one to study the dependence between the cardiovascular dysfunction and intensity of cognitive disorders in Parkinsonian patients. In our study on this contingent, we analyzed correlations between the parameters of P300 potential, indices of the state of the cognitive sphere (determined using a questionnaire, Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE, and a Luriya's test), and indices of variational pulsometry. Thirty-five Parkinsonian patients (49 to 74 years, severity of disease 1.5 to 3.0 by the international classification) were examined. We found a negative influence of excessive sympathetic tonus in cardiovascular control on the state of cognitive functions. The latency of P300 potential was longer in patients with greater intensities of sympathetic influences on the cardiovascular system. The coefficients of correlation of the latency of P300 with the amplitude of mode of R-R intervals (AMo), index of tension in the regulatory systems by Baevskii (IT), and index of autonomic balance by Baevskii (IAB) were 0.52 (P < 0.01), 0.36 (P < 0.05), and 0.37 (P < 0.05), respectively. The above autonomic indices demonstrated significant negative correlations with the volume of short-term memory measured by Luriya's test. The P300 latency, in turn, showed negative correlations with the memory volume estimated by the MMSE scale and Luriya's test. With increase in the age of patients, the degree of the above-mentioned correlations between the P300 latency, memory volume (by Luriya's test), and parameters of variational pulsometry increased. Our data emphasize the expedience of "routine" studies of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic control in pathological states accompanied by clear or subclinical cognitive disorders. Early recognition of cardiovascular dysfunction and its corresponding therapeutic correction should improve the state of brain functions and quality of life in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, in particular from Parkinson's disease.

Recent research work has demonstrated that the amplitudes and latencies of the event-related potentials (ERPs) vary front trial to trial, the features of P300 is unstable and make the detection more difficult. In order to acquire better recognizing performance of P300 component, the Variable Signal Plus Ongoing Activity (VSPOA) model are employed to analyze the EEG waves. Based on this model, the amplitudes and latencies of the components are estimated trial by trial through maximizing the likelihood function. With the estimated scale and shift from this component analysis tool, further analysis is made to determine the existence of typical P300 and its stimulus style. Finally, the trials containing target components can be distinguished from the non-target ones successfully in both tests. Hence this method can be used in the BCI applications. Out method is tested on the simulated datasets and the BCI Competition III datasets, results indicate that this approach is effective and efficient in BCI applications.

Twenty subjects were tested during the sound of a woman's scream and the sound of birds. A greater negative N200 and positive P300 amplitude was exhibited for a woman's scream compared with the sound of birds. A shorter N200 and P300 latency was exhibited Also, a greater right frontal activity was found during a woman's scream. Furthermore, the affective style of subjects according to an auditory stressor was found Subjects in the stress group compared to other groups reported a higher level of stress on Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. These results demonstrate that a woman's scream results in relatively greater right frontal activity and psychological stress and serves as an auditory stressor.

However, in cochlear implant users, electrophysiological measures are challenging due to implant-created artefacts in the EEG. Here, we used independent component analysis to reduce cochlear implant-related artefacts in event-related EEGs of cochlear implant users (n = 12), which allowed detailed spatio-temporal evaluation of auditory evoked potentials by means of dipole source analysis. The present study examined hemispheric asymmetries of auditory evoked potentials to musical sounds in cochlear implant users to evaluate the effect of this type of implantation on neuronal activity. In particular, implant users were presented with two dyadic tonal intervals in an active oddball design and in a passive listening condition. Principally, the results show that independent component analysis is an efficient approach that enables the study of neurophysiological mechanisms of restored auditory function in cochlear implant users. Moreover, our data indicate altered hemispheric asymmetries for dyadic tone processing in implant users compared with listeners with normal hearing (n = 12). We conclude that the evaluation of auditory evoked potentials are of major relevance to understanding auditory cortex function after cochlear implantation and could be of substantial clinical value by indicating the maturation/reorganization of the auditory system after implantation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of visual perception in individuals with and without ASD by carrying out a detailed analysis of the dynamic brain processes elicited by perception of a simple visual stimulus. Methods: We investigated perception in 20 individuals with ASD and 20 control subjects with electroencephalography (EEG). Visual evoked potentials elicited by Gabor patches of varying spatial frequency and stimulus-induced changes in alpha- and gamma-frequency bands of independent components were compared in those with and without ASD. Results: By decomposing the EEG data into independent components, we identified several processes that contributed to the average event related potential recorded at the scalp. Differences between the ASD and control groups were found only in some of these processes. Specifically, in those components that were in or near the striate or extrastriate cortex, stimulus spatial frequency exerted a smaller effect on induced increases in alpha- and gamma-band power, and time to peak alpha-band power was reduced, in the participants with ASD. Induced alpha-band power of components that were in or near the cingulate gyrus was increased in the participants with ASD, and the components that were in or near the parietal cortex did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: Atypical processing is evident in individuals with ASD during perception of simple visual stimuli. The implications of these data for existing theories of atypical perception in ASD are discussed.

EEG data was recorded from 17 young schizophrenia patients in a stable phase of their illness and 17 healthy controls performing an auditory oddball task. Evoked and induced delta and theta activity, N100, P300 amplitude were computed. Between 200-500 ms after a stimulus was presented, patients displayed significantly reduced P300, less evoked and induced delta and theta activity than controls. We conclude that the well known finding of P300 reduction in schizophrenia can be linked to reductions in delta and theta activity, which are a manifestation of impaired stimulus evaluation, memory retrieval, and a lack of sustained attention.

However, frequency characteristics of the underlying processes have been less studied. Besides, most of the studies did not take into account personality-related individual differences. In this study, effects of explicit and implicit anxiety on the oscillatory dynamics of cortical responses elicited by presentation of angry, neutral, and happy faces were investigated using time-frequency decomposition by means of wavelet transform. Both explicit and implicit anxiety were associated with higher alpha band desynchronization, which was most pronounced during presentation of angry faces. Within theta and delta bands, effects appeared to be opposite for explicit and implicit anxiety measures. In implicitly anxious subjects, frontal delta and theta synchronization upon the presentation of angry and happy (but not neutral) faces was found to be higher than in low anxiety ones, whereas explicit anxiety was associated with a lower theta band synchronization. The results are discussed in terms of conscious and controlled vs. unconscious and intuitive information processing associated with explicit and implicit personality measures.

The authors isolated file ictal epileptic activity, and applied a Source localization algorithm to identify its estimated location. Ten ictal EEG scalp recordings from five different patients were analyzed. The patients were known to have temporal lobe epilepsy with a single epileptic focus that had a concordant MRI lesion. The patients had become seizure-free following partial temporal lobectomy. A midinterval (similar to 5 seconds) period of ictal activity was used for Principal Component Analysis starting at ictal onset. The level of epileptic activity at each electrode (i.e., the eigenvector of the component that manifest epileptic characteristic), was used its an input for low-resolution tomography analysis for EEG inverse solution (Zilberstain et al., 2004). The algorithm accurately and robustly identified the epileptic focus in these patients. Principal component analysis and source localization methods can be used in the future to monitor the progression of an epileptic seizure and its expansion to other areas.

However, by sliding window and cross validation, DSP can not catch MRP temporal feature effectively. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called temporal-spatial filter (TSF). Given MRP signals, TSF employs alternate optimization to seek a pair of temporal-spatial projections that simultaneously maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter. The experimental results show that TSF outperforms DSP in extracting MRP feature. If combining the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and MRP, TSPF still obtains better performance than DSP.

This study tested the hypothesis that the same holds for the amplitude of vertex N2-P2 potentials evoked by brief noxious laser stimuli, an issue of interest for clinical perspective. EEG data were recorded in 10 subjects from 30 electrodes during laser noxious stimulation. The artifact-free vertex N2-P2 complex was spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian transformation. Pre-stimulus alpha power was computed at three alpha sub-bands according to subject's individual alpha frequency peak (i.e. about 6-8 Hz for alpha 1, 8-10 Hz for alpha 2 and 10-12 Hz for alpha 3 sub-band). Individual EEG single trials were divided in two sub-groups. The strong-alpha sub-group (high band power) included halfway of all EEG single trials, namely those having the highest pre-stimulus alpha power. Weak-alpha sub-group (low band power) included the remaining trials. Averaging procedure provided laser evoked potentials for both trial sub-groups. No significant effect was found for alpha I and alpha 2 sub-bands. Conversely, compared to strong-alpha 3 sub-group, weak-alpha 3 sub-group showed vertex N2-P2 potentials having significantly higher amplitude (p < 0.05). These results extend to the later phases of pain processing systems the notion that generation mechanisms of pre-stimulus alpha rhythms and (laser) evoked potentials are intrinsically related and subjected to fluctuating "noise". That "noise" could explain the trial-by-trial variability of laser evoked potentials and perception. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) gain more and more interest for basic neurophysiological research and possibly diagnostic purposes. In addition, the effect of TMS to the attentional processes has been reported in many studies. In this paper, the effect of TMS on auditory attention in the EEG is discussed with applying a phase stability measure and adaptive features extraction by optimized filter banks. The phase stability measure clearly shows that TMS has influence in synchronizing the N1-P2 component of event related potentials (ERPs) where the measure in TMS evoked ERPs is much higher than ERPs without TMS. The influence of TMS and attention can also be discriminated very well and illuminate the effect of TMS in auditory attention.

Explicit, conscious types of memory have been demonstrated to benefit particularly from slow-wave sleep (SWS), implicit, non-conscious types particularly from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. By comparing the effects of early-night sleep, rich in SWS, and late-night sleep, rich in REM sleep, we aimed to separate the contribution of these two sleep stages in a metacontrast masking paradigm in which explicit and implicit aspects in perceptual learning could be assessed separately by stimulus identification and priming, respectively. We assumed that early sleep intervening between two sessions of task performance would specifically support stimulus identification, while late sleep would specifically support priming. Apart from overt behavior, event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) were measured to record the cortical mechanisms associated with behavioral changes across sleep. In contrast to our hypothesis, late-night sleep appeared to be more important for changes of behavior, both for stimulus identification, which tended to improve across late-night sleep, and for priming, with the increase of errors induced by masked stimuli correlating with the duration of REM sleep. ERP components proved sensitive to presence of target shapes in the masked stimuli and to their priming effects. Of these components, the N2 component, indicating processing of conflict, became larger across early-night sleep and was related to the duration of S4 sleep, the deepest substage of SWS containing particularly high portions of EEG slow waves. These findings suggest that sleep promotes perceptual learning primarily by its REM sleep portion, but indirectly also by way of improved action monitoring supported by deep slow-wave sleep.

Event-related oscillations in mice: Effects of stimulus characteristics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Auditory system; EEG; ERO; ERPs; Mice	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA SYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION TASK; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; DELTA-OSCILLATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS	Event-related oscillations (EROs) are rhythmic changes that are evoked by sensory and/or cognitive processes that influence the dynamics of the EEG. EROs are estimated by a decomposition of the EEG signal into phase and magnitude information for a range of frequencies and then changes in those frequencies are characterized over a millisecond time scale with respect to task events. EROs have been demonstrated to be sensitive measures of both normal and abnormal cognitive functioning in humans but have not been fully described in mice. The results of these studies demonstrate that EROs can be generated in cortical sites in mice in the delta, theta, alpha/beta frequency ranges in response to auditory stimuli. Oscillations in the 7.5-40 Hz frequencies were significantly affected in the 0-50 ms time range in response to differences in tone frequency. Whereas, changes in tone loudness produced changes in oscillations in the 7.5-40 Hz frequencies in the 350-800 ms range. No significant changes in EROs were found to differences in tone probability. These studies suggest that EROs are an electrophysiological assay sensitive to tone characteristics and as such may be suitable for the exploration of the effects of genetic or neuropharmacological manipulations on neurosensory processing in mice.

Previously this effect has been suggested to be due to increased readiness in somatosensory cortex. Presently, we examine whether regularity of stimulus occurrence increases the proprioceptive evoked response as an indication of increased readiness. This is achieved through detailed analysis of both evoked and induced responses in the time-frequency domain. Electroencephalography in a 64 channels montage was recorded in four-teen healthy subjects. Two paradigms were explored: A Regular alternation between hand of presentation and a Random sequence of hand of presentation. The ERPWAVELAB toolbox was used for decomposition of the wavelet transformed data (7 to 47 Hz, -300 to +1S00 ms)" yielding the evoked amplitude (AvVvrT) and inter-trial phase coherence as well as the increase of nontime-locked activity (induced). After initial exploration of the AvVVT and Induced collapsed files of all subjects using two-way factor analyses (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization), further data decomposition was performed in restricted windows of interest (WOI). Main effects of side of stimulation, onset or offset, regularity and habituation on the evoked and induced activity are described for each WOI. The Regular paradigm evoked more activity than Random in the fast beta range (18-28 Hz) (mean: normalized amplitude 0.38 at 90 ins and 20.9 Hz) including increased phase precision. The findings confirm the possibility of modulation of middle-latency activity by regularity and suggest that this is due to facilitation of activity in secondary somatosensory cortices. Future studies need to examine whether the increased amplitude is associated with increased perceptual acuity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the relevant reports on auditory central mechanisms concerning Chinese tones are limited. In this study, mismatch negativity (MMN), one of the event related potentials (ERP), was used to investigate pre-attentive processing of Chinese tones, and the differences between the function of oddball MVM and that of control MMN are discussed. Methods Ton subjects (six men and four women) with normal hearing participated in the study. A sequence was presented to these subjects through a loudspeaker, the sequence included four blocks, a control block and three oddball blocks. The control block was made up of five components (one pure tone and four Chinese tones) with equiprobability. The oddball blocks were made up of two components, one was a standard stimulus (tone 1) and the other was a deviant stimulus (tone 2 or tone 3 or tone 4). Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded when the sequence was presented and MMNs were obtained from the analysis of the EEG data. Results Two kinds of MMNs were obtained, oddball MMN and control MMN. Oddball MMN was obtained by subtracting the ERP elicited by standard stimulation (tone 1) from that elicited by deviant stimulation (tone 2 or tone 3 or tone 4) in the oddball block; control MMN was obtained by subtracting the ERP elicited by the tone in control block, which was the same tone as the deviant stimulation in the oddball block, from the ERP elicited by deviant stimulation (tone 2 or tone 3 or tone 4) in the oddball block. There were two negative waves in oddball MMN, one appeared around 150 ms (oddball MMN 1), the other around 300 ms (oddball MMN 2). Only one negative wave appeared around 300 ms in control MMN, which was corresponding to the oddball MMN 2. We performed the statistical analyses in each paradigm for latencies and amplitudes for oddball MMN 2 in discriminating the three Chinese tones and reported no significant differences. But the latencies and amplitudes for control MMN in discriminating the three tones all were significantly different. Conclusions There are evident waveforms for oddball and control MMN obtained in normal hearing persons, indicating that the change of Chinese tones could be detected in the pre-attentive stage. Because control MMN can eliminate reflects for physical characteristics of sound, it is the genuine memory-based pre-attentive processing. Since control MMN can reflect the differences of Chinese tones processing better than oddball MMN, it is more sensitive in evaluating pre-attentive processing in Chinese tones discrimination.

The ratio of the number of correct answers to the number of questions is a simple measure of the achievement of the learner. However, such a simple measure may not accurately reflect the real progress of the learner. Event Related Potentials (ERPs for short) are measured from electroencephalograms (EEGs for short). We consider that ERPs may contain meaningful information about the level of the learner's achievement. We had experiments measuring ERPs of subjects learning chemical formulae on an e-learning system. We try to characterize the relation among the learner's achievement, hardness of learning, and the waveforms of his ERPs. This kind of characterizations may be useful for evaluating the learner's achievement.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to examine the temporal evolution of experience-dependent changes in connectivity induced by repeated stimuli. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during frequency changes of a repeating tone. Bayesian inversion of dynamic causal models (DCM) of ERPs revealed systematic repetition-dependent changes in both intrinsic and extrinsic connections, within a hierarchical cortical network. Critically, these changes occurred very quickly, over interstimulus intervals that implicate short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, intrinsic (within-source) connections showed biphasic changes that were Much faster than changes in extrinsic (between-source) connections, which decreased monotonically with repetition. This study shows that auditory perceptual learning is associated with repetition-dependent plasticity in the human brain. It is remarkable that distinct changes in intrinsic and extrinsic connections could be quantified so reliably and non-invasively using EEG. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, considerable insight has been gained in recent years into a common psychiatric condition, i.e., chronic alcoholism. Material and methods. - We reviewed various physiological. parameters that are altered in chronic alcoholic patients compared to healthy individuals - continuous electroencephalogram, oculomotor measures, cognitive event-related potentials and event-related oscillations - to identify links between these physiological parameters, altered cognitive processes and specific clinical symptoms. Results. - Alcoholic patients display: (1) high beta and theta power in the resting electroencephalogram, suggesting hyperarousal of their central nervous system; (2) abnormalities in smooth pursuit eye movements, in saccadic inhibition during antisaccade tasks, and in prepulse inhibition, suggesting disturbed attention modulation and abnormal patterns of prefrontal activation that may stem from the same prefrontal "inhibitory" cortical. dysfunction; (3) decreased amplitude for cognitive event-related potentials situated along the continuum of information-processing, suggesting that alcoholism is associated with neurophysiological deficits at the level of the sensory cortex and not only disturbances involving associative cortices and limbic structures; and (4) decreased theta, gamma and delta oscillations, suggesting cognitive disinhibition at a functional level. Discussion. - The heterogeneity of alcoholic disorders in terms of symptomatology, course and outcome is the result of various pathophysiological processes that physiological parameters may help to define. These alterations may be related to precise cognitive processes that could be easily monitored neurophysiologically in order to create more homogeneous subgroups of alcoholic individuals.

To study the localization and relative activation timing of P300 generators, we implemented simultaneous EEG/fMRI to identify BOLD signal changes and record 64-channel EEG in 10 subjects during a Landolt ring task inside a 1.5-T fMRI scanner using an MR-compatible EEG recording system. MRI artifact subtraction software was applied to obtain continuous EEG data. Then, the simultaneous collecting of EEG and fMRI was validated in preserving relevant ERPs. The fMRI-constrained source analysis resulted in an 8-dipole solution. The bilateral middle frontal and the right inferior parietal dipole waveforms showed a short latency peak corresponding to the early P300 activity, while the four parietal and the anterior cingulate dipole waveforms showed a long latency peak corresponding to the late P300 activity. The longest latency peak of the anterior cingulate dipole agrees with its role in initiation of motor response after successful target recognition. Target detection in the Landolt ring task produces the strongest and most extensive parietal activation (especially superior parietal activation), which might be due to its particular visual attention switching.

Correlations of the Peculiarities of the Motivational Sphere and Characteristics of Event-Related EEG Potentials in Humans	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						achievement motivation; Mechrabian's questionnaire; need for achievement; Orlov's questionnaire; cerebral event-related potentials (ERPs)	CORTEX	We studied the relations between generalized characteristics of the state of the motivational sphere, the levels of need for achievements (N-Ach) and achievement motivation (AchM) typical of an individual, and the parameters of cerebral event-related potentials (ERPs). The examined group included 70 adults of both sexes. The ERPs were recorded in the course of realization of two behavioral test acts with motor components. In task., the subject should press a button with the minimum delay with respect to an imperative signal preceded by a warning signal (with the measurement of the time of sensorimotor reaction); in this case, the contingent negative variation (CNV) and P300 potential were recorded. Under conditions of task B, the subject should measure a definite time interval limiting the latter by two pushings of the button; in this case, the readiness potential (RP) was recorded in addition to CNV and P300. The ERPs were recorded in the C3 and C4 leads (according to the 10-20 system). The peculiarities of the motivational sphere were diagnosed using Orlov's and Mechrabian's questionnaires. We found that a relatively high amplitude of the early CNV component (CNV-O) and low amplitudes of the integral CNV and P300 in task A and a low amplitude of the RP can serve as task B-related EEG markers of a high NA level. In task A, high levels of the AchM correlated with higher amplitudes of the CNV and P300, and amplitudes of these potentials were higher in the left hemisphere. The observed interrelations were probably determined by a considerable dependence of the N-Ach and AchM characteristics, on the one hand, and CNV amplitude parameters, on the other hand, on the hereditary factors, in particular neurochemical ones. It is obvious that such peculiarities of the neurodynamic constitution of an individual are, to a considerable extent, determined by the specificity of organization and functioning of a few neurotransmitter (in particular aminergic) and neurohumoral systems.

Induced and evoked gamma-band activity (GBA) was investigated using electroencephalograms recorded during visual oddball tasks of two difficulty levels. Significant phase synchronization (PS) in the gamma-band was determined by a double-threshold strategy, devised to detect prominent increases with respect to prestimulus baseline and surrogate data. A considerable increase in the early evoked GBA was observed for both difficulties, and this tended to be delayed for the hard task. Induced GBA was increased at the P300 latency period, but no difficulty-related change was observed. Intense PS among anterior and posterior regions along the midline was observed in a 30-38 Hz band, which was enhanced in the easy task throughout task execution, although the overall pattern of connectivity was similar for both difficulties. This may be the underlying basis of the faster and more accurate response to the easy task. The results showed that the most apparent change in the gamma-band associated with difficulty was observed in the PS pattern, not in the spectral power itself. This may imply that the difficulty-related change in cortical information processing was implemented as a change in the spatiotemporal pattern of interregional connectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The visual evoked oscillatory responses in AD subjects without cholinergic treatment (n = 11) show significant differences (df = 2.38. F = 4.957, P = 0.012) from the controls and the AD subjects treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (n = 11). Higher theta oscillatory responses in untreated AD subjects are seen on the electrode locations over bi-parietal and right occipital regions after simple light stimuli with less, if any, cognitive load. These changes were restricted to the theta frequency range only and are related to location, frequency bands and drug effects. In our previous work we observed that visual event related oscillations elicited after the visual stimuli with a higher cognitive load, i.e. an oddball target, display lower amplitudes: between controls and AD subjects in delta frequency band without a drug effect, over the left and mid-central region. These differences between the visual evoked oscillations and the visual event related oscillations imply that there are at least two different cognitive circuits that are activated upon visual stimuli in AD patients.

In contrast with existing knowledge-based approaches, we expend additional space in the database to reduce reasoning at query time. This implementation significantly improves query response time by allowing the system to disregard integrity constraints and other kinds of inferences at run-time. The surprising result of our approach is that load-time appears unaffected, even for medium-sized ontologies. We applied our methodology to the study of brain electroencephalographic (EEG and ERP) data. This case study demonstrates how our methodology can be used to proactively drive the design, storage and exchange of knowledge based on EEG/ERP ontologies.

We investigated whether proprioceptive cues interact with auditory attention to one of two sound sources in free-field. The participant's task was to attend to either the left or right speaker and to respond to occasional increased-bandwidth targets via a footswitch. We recorded high-density EEG in three experimental conditions: the participants either held the speakers in their hands (Hold), reached out close to them (Reach), or had their hands in their lap (Lap). In the last two conditions, the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a prominent negativity around 200 ms post-stimulus (N2 wave) over fronto-central areas, which is a reliable index of further processing of spatial stimulus features in free-field. The N2 wave was markedly attenuated in the 'Hold' condition, which suggests that proprioceptive cues apparently solidify spatial information computed by the auditory system, in so doing alleviating the need for further processing of spatial coordinates solely based on auditory information.

Uncovering the Neural Signature of Lapsing Attention: Electrophysiological Signals Predict Errors up to 20 s before They Occur	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ACTIVITY; ALPHA; INDEXES; CORTEX; MODULATION; POWER; REFLECT; PATHWAY; RHYTHM	The extent to which changes in brain activity can foreshadow human error is uncertain yet has important theoretical and practical implications. The present study examined the temporal dynamics of electrocortical signals preceding a lapse of sustained attention. Twenty-one participants performed a continuous temporal expectancy task, which involved continuously monitoring a stream of regularly alternating patterned stimuli to detect a rarely occurring target stimulus whose duration was 40% longer. The stimulus stream flickered at a rate of 25 Hz to elicit a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP), which served as a continuous measure of basic visual processing. Increasing activity in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) was found beginning similar to 20 s before a missed target. This was followed by decreases in the amplitude of two event-related components over a short pretarget time frame: the frontal P3 (3-4 s) and contingent-negative variation (during the target interval). In contrast, SSVEP amplitude before hits and misses was closely matched, suggesting that the efficacy of ongoing basic visual processing was unaffected. Our results show that the specific neural signatures of attentional lapses are registered in the EEG up to 20 s before an error.

It is obvious that a combination of both techniques is a very attractive aim in neuroscience, in order to achieve both high temporal and spatial resolution for the non-invasive study of cognitive brain function. During the last decade a number of research groups have taken up this challenge. Here, we review the development of the combined EEG-fMRI approach. We summarize the main data integration approaches developed to achieve such a combination, discuss the current state-of-the-art in this field and outline challenges for the future success of this promising approach.

J	Marino, AA; Carrubba, S				Marino, Andrew A.; Carrubba, Simona			The Effects of Mobile-Phone Electromagnetic Fields on Brain Electrical Activity: A Critical Analysis of the Literature	ELECTROMAGNETIC BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY MAGNETIC-FIELDS; AUDITORY MEMORY TASK; AFFECTS HUMAN SLEEP; CELLULAR PHONES; SHORT-TERM; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; RF EXPOSURE; HUMAN EEG	We analyzed the reports in which human brain electrical activity was compared between the presence and absence of radio-frequency and low-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from mobile phones, or between pre- and post-exposure to the EMFs. Of 55 reports, 37 claimed and 18 denied an EMF-induced effect on either the baseline electroencephalogram (EEG), or on cognitive processing of visual or auditory stimuli as reflected in changes in event-related potentials. The positive reports did not adequately consider the family-wise error rate, the presence of spike artifacts in the EEG, or the confounding role of the two different EMFs. The negative reports contained neither positive controls nor power analyses. Almost all reports were based on the incorrect assumption that the brain was in equilibrium with its surroundings. Overall, the doubt regarding the existence of reproducible mobile-phone EMFs on brain activity created by the reports appeared to legitimate the knowledge claims of the mobile-phone industry. However, it funded, partly or wholly, at least 87% of the reports. From an analysis of their cognitive framework, the common use of disclaimers, the absence of information concerning conflicts of interest, and the industry's donations to the principal EMF journal, we inferred that the doubt was manufactured by the industry. The crucial scientific question of the pathophysiology of mobile-phone EMFs as reflected in measurements of brain electrical activity remains unanswered, and essentially unaddressed.

Sound level dependence of auditory evoked potentials: Simultaneous EEG recording and low-noise fMRI	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Multimodal Imaging: Integration of EEG and fMRI data held at the 32nd German Congress on Psychology and the Brain	2006	Dresden, GERMANY			EEG; low-noise fMRI; simultaneous; AEPs; loudness; sound intensity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRIGGERED FUNCTIONAL MRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; ALPHA-RHYTHM; 3-T FMRI; CORTEX; INTENSITY; ACQUISITION; SCANNER; LOCALIZATION	The simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI offers the advantage of combining precise spatial information about neuronal processing obtained by fMRI data with the high temporal resolution of EEG data. One problem for the analysis of auditory processing, however, is the noisy environment during fMRI measurements, especially when EPI sequences are employed. While EEG studies outside an MRI scanner repeatedly demonstrated a clear sound level-dependent increase of N1 amplitude, this finding was less obvious in simultaneous recordings inside a scanner. Based on the assumption that this inconsistency might be due to the confounding effect of the rather loud EPI noise, we employed a low-noise fMRI protocol. This method was previously used to reveal level-dependent fMRI activation in auditory cortex areas. We combined this method with simultaneous EEG recordings to investigate the effect of different sound intensities on the auditory evoked potentials. Eight participants without hearing deficits took part in our experiment. Frequency modulated tones (FM) were presented monaurally with two sound intensities (60 and 80 dB HL). The task of the participants was to categorize the FM-direction (rising vs. falling). Our results inside the scanner replicate the sound level dependence of AEPs from previous EEG studies outside the scanner. The data analysis revealed a significant shortening of N1 latency and an increase in the N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitude for the higher sound intensity. On a descriptive level, the 80 dB HL stimulation yielded more activated voxels in fMRI and stronger activations. This effect was pronounced over the right hemisphere. Our results suggest that low-noise sequences might be advantageous for the examination of auditory processing in simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These activities are often partially overlapped in time and frequency, so that they are even more difficult to be separated in single-trial. Therefore, online applications based on induced brain activity require specific online processing methods to separate both activities efficiently. Here we propose a module-based methodology for the online extraction and quantification of induced brain activity during cognitive-related tasks. Further, the role of electrode montages and the minimization of the evoked activity are examined in both simulated and real data as part of the optimization process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Differential effects of acute alcohol on EEG and sedative responses in adolescent and adult Wistar rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						adolescence; alcohol; EEG; alcoholism; age; gamma	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE; DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES; DIVERSE REGIONS; SENSITIVITY; AGE; GABA(A); RECEPTORS; TOLERANCE; BRAIN	Age-related developmental differences in sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol may play an important role in the development of alcoholism. The present study was designed to evaluate the acute effects of alcohol on cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) in adolescent (P36) and adult (P78) Wistar rats. Five minutes of EEG was recorded after administration of 0, 0.75 or 1.5 g/kg alcohol. The righting reflex was performed to measure the sedative effects of alcohol (33 g/kg) and total sleeping time for each rat. Our results showed that alcohol (1.5 g/kg) increased power in the 1-2 Hz band and decreased the power in the 32-50 Hz band in the parietal cortical region of adolescent rats. Alcohol (1.5 g/kg) also increased stability of the EEG power in the slow-wave frequency bands (2-4 Hz, 4-6 Hz, and 6-8 Hz) of adolescent rats. In the frontal cortex of adult ran, but not in adolescent rats, alcohol (1.5 or 0.75 g/kg) decreased the power in the 16-32 Hz frequency band. Alcohol (1.5 g/kg) differentially increased power in a multiple of slow-wave frequency bands (2-4 Hz and 4-6 Hz) in the parietal cortex of adult rats as compared to adolescent rats. Adolescent rats were shown significantly shorter sleeping time and higher blood alcohol levels after regaining reflex than adult rats. Our results provide additional evidence of age-related differences in the effects of acute alcohol on cortical EEG, sedation and tolerance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Parametric study of EEG sensitivity to phase noise during face processing	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TIME-COURSE; CORTICAL RESPONSES; DECISION-MAKING; NATURAL IMAGES; BOLD FMRI; OBJECT; N170; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; RECOGNITION	Background: The present paper examines the visual processing speed of complex objects, here faces, by mapping the relationship between object physical properties and single-trial brain responses. Measuring visual processing speed is challenging because uncontrolled physical differences that co-vary with object categories might affect brain measurements, thus biasing our speed estimates. Recently, we demonstrated that early event-related potential (ERP) differences between faces and objects are preserved even when images differ only in phase information, and amplitude spectra are equated across image categories. Here, we use a parametric design to study how early ERP to faces are shaped by phase information. Subjects performed a two-alternative force choice discrimination between two faces (Experiment 1) or textures (two control experiments). All stimuli had the same amplitude spectrum and were presented at 11 phase noise levels, varying from 0% to 100% in 10% increments, using a linear phase interpolation technique. Single-trial ERP data from each subject were analysed using a multiple linear regression model. Results: Our results show that sensitivity to phase noise in faces emerges progressively in a short time window between the P1 and the N170 ERP visual components. The sensitivity to phase noise starts at about 120-130 ms after stimulus onset and continues for another 25-40 ms. This result was robust both within and across subjects. A control experiment using pink noise textures, which had the same second-order statistics as the faces used in Experiment 1, demonstrated that the sensitivity to phase noise observed for faces cannot be explained by the presence of global image structure alone. A second control experiment used wavelet textures that were matched to the face stimuli in terms of second-and higher-order image statistics. Results from this experiment suggest that higher-order statistics of faces are necessary but not sufficient to obtain the sensitivity to phase noise function observed in response to faces. Conclusion: Our results constitute the first quantitative assessment of the time course of phase information processing by the human visual brain. We interpret our results in a framework that focuses on image statistics and single-trial analyses.

The relationship between preattentive sensory processing deficits and age in schizophrenia patients	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Mismatch negativity; Preattentional processes; Neurophysiology; Aging	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; AMPLITUDE REDUCTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; AUDITORY-STIMULI; CLINICAL-TRIALS; BRAIN; P300	Objective: Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a index preattentive detection of rare stimuli. Their amplitudes normally decrease with age. Previous studies have reported generally smaller than normal MMN and P3a in schizophrenia patients. We aimed to further characterize the course of these deficits over schizophrenia patients' lifespan. Methods: In 253 schizophrenia patients and 147 normal comparison participants (NCPs) encompassing a wide age range (18-65), event-related potentials were recorded while participants watched a silent video and were presented binaurally with 1-kHz tones 500 ms apart, including standards (P = .90, 50-ms duration) and deviants (P = 0.10, 100-ms). Results: Over the entire age range, MMN and P3a were smaller in schizophrenia patients than NCPs. MMN amplitude declined with age in both groups, though slightly less steeply in schizophrenia patients than NCPs. P3a amplitude declined with age in NCPs but not in schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: In our cohort of schizophrenia patients, MMN and P3a deficits were already present at the youngest ages. MMN declined further with age, whereas P3a amplitude remained stable. Significance: This knowledge about how MMN and P3a amplitudes vary with age in schizophrenia patients compared to NCPs can help improve the utility of these indices as clinical endophenotypes or biomarkers.

Although some individuals feel little discomfort when facing the unknown, those high in neuroticism find it aversive. We examined neurophysiological responses to uncertainty using an event-related potential framework. Participants completed a time-estimation task while their neural activity was recorded via electroencephalography. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), an evoked potential that peaks approximately 250 ms after the receipt of feedback information, was examined under conditions of positive, negative, and uncertain feedback. The magnitude of these responses was then analyzed in relation to individual differences in neuroticism. As expected, a larger FRN was observed after negative feedback than after positive feedback for all participants. For individuals who scored highly on trait neuroticism, however, uncertain feedback produced a larger neural response than did negative feedback. These results are discussed in terms of affective responses to uncertainty among neurotic individuals.

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e. g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) are employed to encode user messages. User-specific setup and training are important issues for robust and reliable classification. Furthermore, in order to implement small and thus affordable systems, focus is put on the minimization of the number of EEG sensors. The system also supports the self-paced operation mode, that is, users have on-demand access to the system at any time and can autonomously initiate communication. Flexibility, usability, and practicality are essential to increase user acceptance. Here, we illustrate the possibilities offered by now from EEG-based communication. Results of several studies with able-bodied and disabled individuals performed inside the laboratory and in real-world environments are presented; their characteristics are shown and open issues are mentioned. The applications include the control of neuroprostheses and spelling devices, the interaction with Virtual Reality, and the operation of off-the-shelf software such as Google Earth.

BOLD correlates of EEG alpha phase-locking and the fMRI default mode network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; FREQUENCY-BANDS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MATHEMATICAL RATIONALE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TIME-SERIES	Phase locking or synchronization of brain areas is a key concept of information processing in the brain. Synchronous oscillations have been observed and investigated extensively in EEG during the past decades. EEG oscillations occur over a wide frequency range. In EEG, a prominent type of oscillations is alpha-band activity, present typically when a subject is awake, but at rest with closed eyes. The spectral power of alpha rhythms has recently been investigated in simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings, establishing a wide-range cortico-thalamic network. However, spectral power and synchronization are different measures and little is known about the correlations between BOLD effects and EEG synchronization. Interestingly, the fMRI BOLD signal also displays synchronous oscillations across different brain regions. These oscillations delineate so-called resting state networks (RSNs) that resemble the correlation patterns of simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. However, the nature of these BOLD oscillations and their relations to EEG activity is still poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the subunits constituting a specific RSN may be coordinated by different EEG rhythms. In this study we report on evidence for this hypothesis. The BOLD correlates of global EEG synchronization (GFS) in the alpha frequency band are located in brain areas involved in specific RSNs, e. g. the 'default mode network'. Furthermore, our results confirm the hypothesis that specific RSNs are organized by long-range synchronization at least in the alpha frequency band. Finally, we could localize specific areas where the GFS BOLD correlates and the associated RSN overlap. Thus, we claim that not only the spectral dynamics of EEG are important, but also their spatio-temporal organization. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, LM; Hinrichs, H				Sun, Limin; Hinrichs, Hermann			Simultaneously Recorded EEG-fMRI: Removal of Gradient Artifacts by Subtraction of Head Movement Related Average Artifact Waveforms	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; gradient artifact; resampling; head movement	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG/FMRI; REDUCTION; TESLA; ECG	Electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are corrupted by large repetitive artifacts generated by the switched MR gradients. Several methods have been proposed to remove these distortions by Subtraction of averaged artifact templates from the ongoing EEG. Here, we present a modification of this approach which accounts for head movements to improve the extracted template. Using the fMRI analysis package statistical parametric mapping (SPM; FIL London) the head displacement is determined at each half fMRI-volume. The basic idea is to apply a moving average algorithm for template extraction but to include only epochs that were obtained at the same head position as the artefact to be removed. This approach was derived from phantom EEG measurements demonstrating substantial variations of the artefact waveform in response to movements of the phantom in the MRI magnet. To further reduce the residual noise, we applied a resampling algorithm which aligns the EEG samples in a strict adaptive manner to the fMRI timing. Finally, we propose a new algorithm to suppress residual artifacts Such as those occasionally observed in case of brief strong movements, which are not reflected by the movement indicator because of the limited temporal resolution of the fMRI sequence. On the basis of EEG recordings of six subjects these measures combined reduce the residual artefact activity quantified in terms of the spectral power at the gradient repetition rate and its harmonics by roughly 20 to 50%, (depending on the amount of movement) predominantly in frequencies beyond 30 Hz.

Neuroelectric measurement of cognition during aerobic exercise	METHODS			English	Article						event-related brain potentials (ERPs); electroencephalogram (EEG); cognition; physical activity; acute exercise; cardiorespiratory fitness; P3; neuroimaging	CORTICAL PLASTICITY; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; FITNESS; OBESITY; BRAIN; P300; OVERWEIGHT; CHILDREN; GENDER	The application of neuroimaging techniques to assess changes in brain and cognition during exercise has received little attention due to issues related to artifact associated with gross motor movement inherent in physical activity behaviors. Although many neuroimaging techniques have not yet progressed to a point where movement artifact may be controlled, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which measure neuroelectric responses to specific events, can account for such issues in controlled environments. This paper discusses the deviations from standard neuroelectric recording procedures and signal processing that are necessary for the collection and analysis of ERPs during gross motor movement. Considerations include the properties of the exercise behavior, task instructions, and the position of materials in the stimulus environment, as well as issues related to electrode impedance, additional reduction techniques, and the plotting of single trials to identify movement artifacts. These techniques provide a means for collecting clean data from the neuroelectric system to provide further understanding of changes in brain and cognition that occur online during exercise behavior, and serves as a novel application of neuroimaging to the kinesiological sciences.

Consistent with this view, behavioral and electrocortical studies suggest that reduced sensitivity to rewards may be a fundamental feature of depression. Within the event-related potential literature, the feedback negativity (FN) has been identified as a component that is sensitive to feedback indicating non-rewards versus rewards, and has been linked to phasic changes in midbrain dopamine levels that indicate whether events are better or worse than expected; thus, the FN may be a useful marker for abnormalities in reward sensitivity associated with depression. In the current study, a simple gambling task was used to elicit an FN in participants, and the magnitude of the FN was related to levels of depressive symptoms, as well as levels of anxiety and stress. The enhancement of the FN to non-rewards relative to rewards was found to be inversely related to depression and stress reactivity; only the relationship between the FN and stress remained significant after controlling for the other psychological variables. The P3 to feedback, meanwhile, was inversely related to depression and anxiety scores regardless of feedback type. These results are discussed within the context of current models of depression and reward sensitivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, a definitive and unequivocal diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed histopathogically via postmortem autopsy, demonstrating the need for objective measures of cognitive functioning for those at risk for AD. The single most important genetic risk factor of AD is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon 4 allele. The present study investigated olfactory and cognitive processing deficits in ApoE epsilon 4(+) individuals using a cross-modal recognition memory task and an objective electrophysiological measure, the event-related potential (ERF). Ten epsilon 4(+) individuals (5 M, 5 E, mean [M] = 75.1 years) and 10 age- and gender-matched epsilon 4(-) individuals (5 M, 5 E, M = 71 years) sequentially encoded a set of 16 olfactory stimuli and were subsequently shown names of odors previously presented (targets) or not (foils). EEG activity was recorded from 19 electrodes as participants distinguished targets from foils using a two-button mouse. P3 latencies were significantly longer in epsilon 4(+) individuals, and intraclass correlations demonstrated differential activity between the two groups. These findings are consistent with a compensatory hypothesis, which posits that nondemented epsilon 4(+) individuals will expend greater effort in cognitive processing or engage in alternative strategies and therefore require greater activation of neural tissue or recruitment of different neural populations. The findings also suggest that cross-modal ERP studies of recognition memory discriminate early neurocognitive changes in ApoE epsilon 4(+) and ApoE epsilon 4(-) individuals and may contribute to identifying the phenotype of persons who will develop Alzheimer's disease.

J	Garagnani, M; Wennekers, T; Pulvermuller, F				Garagnani, Max; Wennekers, Thomas; Pulvermueller, Friedemann			A neuroanatomically grounded Hebbian-learning model of attention-language interactions in the human brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; neural networks; perisylvian cortex; simulation; synaptic plasticity	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; INTERMODAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CONNECTIONIST MODEL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS	Meaningful familiar stimuli and senseless unknown materials lead to different patterns of brain activation. A late major neurophysiological response indexing 'sense' is the negative component of event-related potential peaking at around 400 ms (N400), an event-related potential that emerges in attention-demanding tasks and is larger for senseless materials (e.g. meaningless pseudowords) than for matched meaningful stimuli (words). However, the mismatch negativity (latency 100-250 ms), an early automatic brain response elicited under distraction, is larger to words than to pseudowords, thus exhibiting the opposite pattern to that seen for the N400. So far, no theoretical account has been able to reconcile and explain these findings by means of a single, mechanistic neural model. We implemented a neuroanatomically grounded neural network model of the left perisylvian language cortex and simulated: (i) brain processes of early language acquisition and (ii) cortical responses to familiar word and senseless pseudoword stimuli. We found that variation of the area-specific inhibition (the model correlate of attention) modulated the simulated brain response to words and pseudowords, producing either an N400- or a mismatch negativity-like response depending on the amount of inhibition (i.e. available attentional resources). Our model: (i) provides a unifying explanatory account, at cortical level, of experimental observations that, so far, had not been given a coherent interpretation within a single framework; (ii) demonstrates the viability of purely Hebbian, associative learning in a multilayered neural network architecture; and (iii) makes clear predictions on the effects of attention on latency and magnitude of event-related potentials to lexical items.

EEG differences in children between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Children; EEG; Arousal; Activation; Baseline task	CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TASK; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORIENTING REFLEX; STATE AROUSAL; ACTIVATION; ALPHA; HABITUATION; ATTENTION	Objective: Recent work on arousal vs. activation in adults showed that skin conductance levels (SCLs) increased, and global alpha levels decreased, from eyes-closed to eyes-open resting baseline conditions. This study explored whether similar effects occur in children. Methods: EEG activity was recorded from 30 children aged 8-12 years during counterbalanced eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions; SCL was measured as an index of arousal. Results: SCLs were negatively correlated with mean alpha levels in the eyes-closed condition, and increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open. Reductions were found in across-scalp mean absolute delta, theta, alpha, and beta from eyes-closed to eyes-open. Topographic changes were evident in all bands except alpha. Conclusions: Results confirm the use of mean alpha level as a measure of resting-state arousal under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. Focal changes in the other bands suggest that these reflect differences in activation, rather than the simple increase in arousal shown in alpha. Significance: This child study confirms the generality of eyes-closed vs. eyes-open non-alpha EEG measures differing in mean power levels and topography, the latter indicating brain activity related to visual processing. Such differences should be considered when evaluating EEG research, and in choosing baseline conditions for different paradigms. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

CNS arousal and neurobehavioral performance in a short-term sleep restriction paradigm	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						electroencephalogram; performance; sleep restriction; sleepiness; spectral analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; WAKING EEG; NEURAL BASIS; DEPRIVATION; TASK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; WAKEFULNESS; FREQUENCIES	Few studies have investigated waking electrophysiological measures of arousal during sleep restriction. This study examined electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and performance during a 96-hour laboratory protocol where participants slept a baseline night (8 h), were randomly assigned to 3-, 5-, or 8-hour sleep groups for the next two nights sleep restriction (SR1, SR2), and then slept a recovery night (8 h). There were dose-dependent deficits on measures of mood, sleepiness, and reaction time that were apparent during this short-term bout of sleep restriction. The ratio of alpha to theta EEG recorded at rest indicated dose-dependent changes in CNS arousal. At 9:00 hours, both the 3- and 5-hour groups showed EEG slowing (sleepiness) during restriction, with the 3-hour group exhibiting greater deficits. Later in the day at 13:00 hours, the 5-hour group no longer exhibited EEG slowing, but the extent of slowing was more widespread across the scalp for the 3-hour group. High-frequency EEG, a measure of effort, was greater on the mornings following sleep restriction. The 5-hour group had increased beta EEG at central-parietal sites following both nights of restriction, whereas the 3-hour group had increased beta and gamma EEG at occipital regions following the first night only. Short-term sleep restriction leads to deficits in performance as well as EEG slowing that correspond to the amount and duration of sleep loss. High-frequency EEG may be a marker of effort or compensation.

Brain substrates of implicit and explicit memory: The importance of concurrently acquired neural signals of both memory types	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Review						EEG; Event-related potentials; ERPs; Explicit memory; Implicit memory; Neuroimaging; fMRI	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; CONCEPTUAL FLUENCY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; REPETITION; RETRIEVAL; DISSOCIATION; INFERIOR; RECOLLECTION	A comprehensive understanding of human memory requires cognitive and neural descriptions of memory processes along with a conception of how memory processing drives behavioral responses and subjective experiences. One serious challenge to this endeavor is that an individual memory process is typically operative within a mix of other contemporaneous memory processes. This challenge is particularly disquieting in the context of implicit memory, which, unlike explicit memory, transpires without the subject necessarily being aware of memory retrieval. Neural correlates of implicit memory and neural correlates of explicit memory are often investigated in different experiments using very different memory tests and procedures. This strategy poses difficulties for elucidating the interactions between the two types of memory process that may result in explicit remembering, and for determining the extent to which certain neural processing events uniquely contribute to only one type of memory. We review recent studies that have succeeded in separately assessing neural correlates of both implicit memory and explicit memory within the same paradigm using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with an emphasis on studies from our laboratory. The strategies we describe provide a methodological framework for achieving valid assessments of memory processing, and the findings support an emerging conceptualization of the distinct neurocognitive events responsible for implicit and explicit memory.

Brain oscillations: pathophysiological and therapeutic role in some neurological and psychiatric diseases	ANALES DEL SISTEMA SANITARIO DE NAVARRA			Spanish	Article						Oscillations; Basal ganglia; Parkinson's disease; Epilepsy; Schizophrenia	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; DEPENDENT CHANGES	The terms "oscillations" or "oscillatory activity" are frequently used not only to define the rhythmic fluctuations of the postsynaptic potentials of a neuronal group (local field potentials) or a cortical region (EEG, MEG), but also to indicate the rhythmic discharge pattern of action potentials from a neuron or a small group of neurons. Oscillatory activity makes possible the synchronization of different neuronal groups from nearby or distant cortical regions that participate in the same motor, sensory or cognitive task. The presence of oscillatory activity is usually associated to the existence of synchronization, but both phenomena are not necessarily always equivalent. Abnormalities of oscillatory activities or synchronization within or between different brain structures have been described in several neurological and psychiatric diseases; these abnormalities might play a relevant pathophysiological role in Parkinson's disease (and other movement disorders), schizophrenia or epilepsy. This review discusses all these aspects, with emphasis on their potential role both as a basic mechanism in brain function and as a pathophysiological Substrate for some of the symptoms and signs observed in several diseases.

Prototype system which would be a practical brain computer interface is established and evaluated. Visual stimuli consisted of six small squares (visual angle of 0.7 x 0.7 deg) surrounded by frames/a frame (2 x 2 deg). Squares were flashed with an interval of 180 ms to elicit event-related potential of P300, and luminance of each frame was modulated, based on pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) of 10.23 seconds. Six visual stimuli were simultaneously presented on the monitor and subjects were instructed to focus attention successively on an appointed square and EEG was recorded during this task. The cross correlation functions (kernels) of EEGs and each PRBS were calculated and used to determine the subject gazed target. Clear P300 and kernel response for target were simultaneously detected, indicating that this technique could be useful as a practical brain computer interface system.

Transient post-traumatic locked-in syndrome: A case report and a literature review	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Locked-in syndrome; Head trauma; EEG; Somatosensory evoked potentials; Event related potentials; P300	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VEGETATIVE STATE; HEAD; CONSCIOUSNESS; TOMOGRAPHY; PARADIGM; COMA	Introduction.-Post-traumatic locked-in syndrome may be particularly difficult to recognize, especially when it follows a state of coma and presents the clinical feature of a "total" locked-in syndrome. Patient and methods.-A 56-year-old male with a closed head injury was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) with GCS = 4 (V1, M2, E1). Computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed a limited subarachnoid haemorrhage in the sylvian region without any brain oedema or ventricular shift. The GCS did not change until day 6. At the same time EEG showed a reactivity to acoustic stimuli consisting in the paradoxical appearance of a posterior rhythm in alpha range (10-12c/s), blocked by passive eye opening. Early cortical components (N20-P25) of somatosensory evoked potentials were normal on both hemispheres; middle components were also clearly evident. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed both diffuse and midbrain axonal injuries, particularly in a strategic lesion involving both cerebral peduncles. Event related potentials showed N2 and P3 components to stimulation by rare tones. Conclusions.-A comprehensive multimodal neurophysiological approach, using the more informative tests and the proper time of recording, should be included in protocols for patients with severe head trauma, in order to establish the actual patient's clinical state and to avoid that a locked-in syndrome state be mistaken for prolonged coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state or akinetic mutism. Neurophysiological evaluation before discharge from ICU can be a baseline evaluation useful for the follow-up of low-responsive patients in the neuro-rehabilitation unit.

These reviews establish presence of electrophysiological abnormalities in symptom-based diagnoses of schizophrenia, dementia, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and childhood disorders. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity remain modest in most studies as may be expected for the relationship of indicators of underlying dimensions of brain organization and function when compared by interview-obtained symptom assessment. The power of electrophysiology to mirror pharmacological effects and treatment susceptability is an important research direction for electrophysiology.

Cortical Source Localization of Infant Cognition	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED-POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NIH MRI; EEG; FACE; SEPARATION	Neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission topography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been utilized with older children and adults to identify cortical sources of perceptual and cognitive processes. However, due to practical and ethical concerns, these techniques cannot be routinely applied to infant participants. An alternative to such neuroimaging techniques appropriate for use with infant participants is high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and cortical source localization techniques. The current article provides an overview of a method developed for such analyses. The method consists of four steps: (1) recording high-density (e.g., 128-channel) EEG. (2) Analysis of individual participant raw segmented data with independent component analysis (ICA). (3) Estimation of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) that represent cortical sources for the observed ICA component clusters. (4) Calculation of component activations in relation to experimental factors. We discuss an example of research applying this technique to investigate the development of visual attention and recognition memory. We also describe the application of realistic head modeling to address some of the current limitations of infant cortical source localization.

Electrophysiological evidence for incremental lexical-semantic integration in auditory compound comprehension	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Cognition; Language comprehension; Lexical processing; Compound word; Semantic composition; Conceptual combination; German; ERP; EEG	BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; WORDS; SEGMENTATION; FREQUENCY; GERMAN; ACCESS; REPRESENTATION; COMPLEXITY; MORPHEMES	The present study investigated the time-course of semantic integration in auditory compound word processing. Compounding is a productive mechanism of word formation that is used frequently in many languages. Specifically, we examined whether semantic integration is incremental or is delayed until the head, the last constituent in German, is available. Stimuli were compounds consisting of three nouns, and the semantic plausibility of the second and the third constituent was manipulated independently (high vs. low). Participants' task was to listen to the compounds and evaluate them semantically. Event-related brain potentials in response to the head constituents showed an increased N400 for less plausible head constituents, reflecting the lexical-semantic integration of all three compound constituents. In response to the second (less plausible) constituents, an increased N400 with a central-left scalp distribution was observed followed by a parietal positivity. The occurrence of this N400 effect during the presentation of the second constituents suggests that the initial two non-head constituents are immediately integrated. The subsequent positivity might be an instance of a P600 and is suggested to reflect the structural change of the initially constructed compound structure. The results suggest that lexical-semantic integration of compound constituents is an incremental process and, thus, challenge a recent proposal on the time-course of semantic processing in auditory compound comprehension.

This study compares the patterns of cognitive dysfunction in two conditions characterized by working memory dysfunction, schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Three matched groups (Schizophrenia, PTSD, Control) of 16 subjects had event related potentials recorded, using a 27 electrode array, while they performed a working memory auditory target detection task. Both disorders were associated with impaired task performance, with greater impairment in schizophrenia. Reduction in N1 amplitude was found only in schizophrenia, and an increase in target N2 amplitude and latency was found only in PTSD. Both patient groups showed a reduction in the amplitude of the non-target and target P3, but the groups were distinguished by a reduction in non-target parietal P3 amplitude in the schizophrenia group and a reduction in target P3 amplitude over the left posterior parietal region in the PTSD Group. This study demonstrates that there are specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia and with PTSD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Early visual processing deficits in dysbindin-associated schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						dysbindin; EEG; ERP; P1; schizophrenia; sensory processing	RISK HAPLOTYPE; DTNBP1; GENE; ATTENTION; POTENTIALS; EXPRESSION; GENERATION; GENOTYPE; CORTEX; BRAIN	Background: Variation at the dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) has been associated with increased risk for schizophrenia in numerous independent samples and recently with deficits in general and domain-specific cognitive processing. The relationship between dysbindin risk variants and sensory-level deficits in schizophrenia remains to be explored. We investigated P1 performance, a component of early visual processing on which both patients and their relatives show deficits, in carriers and noncarriers of a known dysbindin risk haplotype. Methods: Event-related potential responses to simple visual isolated-check stimuli were measured using high-density electrical scalp recordings in 26 individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, comprising 14 patients who were carriers of the dysbindin risk haplotype and 12 patients who were nonrisk haplotype carriers. Results: Carriers of the dysbindin risk haplotype demonstrated significantly reduced P1 amplitudes compared with noncarriers. A large effect size of d =.89 was calculated for the difference in P1 amplitude over scalp sites where the deficit was maximal. Conclusions: The P1 deficits associated with a dysbindin risk haplotype previously identified in our sample presents functional confirmation of its deleterious effect on brain activity. Building on evidence of dysbindin's role in higher cognitive function, these early visual processing deficits suggest a generalized role for dysbindin in brain function and is likely to be part of the mechanism by which illness susceptibility is mediated.

MECHANISMS UNDERLYING STATE DEPENDENT SURFACE-EVOKED RESPONSE PATTERNS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; rat; quiet sleep; slow-wave sleep; delta	NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; SLEEP STATES; POTENTIALS; RAT; WAKING; VARIABILITY; CAT; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; MODULATION	Cortical evoked response potentials (ERPs) display a rich set of waveforms that are both context and state dependent. However, the mechanisms that underlie state dependent ERP patterns are unclear. Determining those mechanisms through analysis of single trial ERP waveform signatures may provide insight into the regulation of cortical column state and the roles that sleep plays in cortical function. We implanted rats with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes to record ERPs and to assess sleep/wake states continuously during 1-2 s random auditory clicks. Individual cortical auditory ERPs were sorted into one of eight behavioral states, and fell into three categories based on amplitude and latency characteristics. ERPs within waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were predominantly low amplitude and short latency. Approximately 50% of ERPs during light quiet sleep (quiet sleep 1 and quiet sleep 2) exhibited low amplitude, short latency responses, and the remaining ERPs had high amplitude, long latency responses. This distribution was characteristic of EEG fluctuations during low frequency delta waves. Significantly more individual ERPs showed very low amplitudes during deep quiet sleep (quiet sleep 3 and quiet sleep 4), resulting in a lower average ERP. These results support the hypothesis that evoked response amplitudes and waveform patterns follow specific EEG patterns. Since evoked response characteristics distribute differently across states, they could aid our understanding of sleep mechanisms through state-related and local neural signaling. (C) 2009 IBRO.

Previous functional MRI studies have demonstrated that primary visual cortex (V1) activation by peripheral distractors is reduced by higher task difficulty at fixation, but it remains unknown whether such changes affect initial processing in V1 or subsequent feedback. Here we manipulated attentional load at fixation while recording peripheral visual responses with high-density EEG in 28 healthy Volunteers, which allowed us to track the exact time course of attention-related effects on V1. Our results show a modulation of the earliest component of the visual evoked potential (C1) as a function of attentional load. Additional topographic and source localization analyses corroborated this finding, with significant load-related differences observed throughout the first 100 ms post-stimulus. However, this effect was observed only when stimuli were presented in the upper visual field (VF), but not for symmetrical positions in the lower VF. Our findings demonstrate early filtering of irrelevant information under increased attentional demands, thus supporting models that assume a flexible mechanism of attentional selection, but reveal important functional asymmetries across the VF.

Delta responses of 21 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and 16 healthy elderly controls were evaluated by an active oddball paradigm. Averaged and single sweep potentials were analyzed during target tone processing. As far as time domain averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) are concerned, no significant group differences were observed for N100 and P200 components (both latency and amplitude); also, N200 and P300 amplitude did not differ between groups, whilst N200 and P300 latency were significantly prolonged in AD patients. Concerning delta frequency component of the averaged ERPs, no significant differences between groups were obtained for delta response amplitude as well as delta response topography (Fz, Cz, Pz). Analysis of delta responses was performed for single sweep maximal peak-to-peak amplitude. Significant between groups differences were revealed at the level of single sweep amplitude at the 3 midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz), during target tone processing. In particular, the difference between healthy controls and AD subjects was at the level of stimulus-related delta amplitude changes: in all locations a significant enhancement of the delta response is recorded in healthy subjects (especially at the frontal location), whilst this delta reactivity was not detectable in AD patients. From a clinical point of view, the lack of delta reactivity might relate to a decision-making function impairment since mild Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seven naive subjects participated in the study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed. The multi-class classification for four-directional control was evaluated offline from 10-fold cross-validation using direct-decision tree classifier and genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance. Beta band (15-30Hz) event-related desynchronization and event related synchronization were observed in right and left hand movement related motor areas for physical movements as well as motor imagery. The cross-validation accuracy for the proposed four-direction classification from SAM-filtered MEG signal was as high as 95-97% for physical movements and 86-87% for motor imagery. The high classification accuracy suggests that a reliable high performance two-dimensional BC! can be achieved from single trial detection of human natural movement intentions from SAM-filtered MEG signals, where user may not need extensive training.

Six healthy subjects were enrolled in a study to test this hypothesis. We estimated dipoles from somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) elicited by electrical stimulation to the left median nerve. We also created individual three-layered (scalp, skull, and brain) head models from each subject's magnetic resonance imaging scan, and dipoles were estimated from the individual averaged SEP with each individual head model. We then estimated dipoles using grand averaged SEP across all subjects on the standard head model created from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard coordinate system brain template to compare the estimated dipoles located on our own head model and those on the MNI. The dipoles in the post-central gyrus were estimated from negative potentials at 20 ms from the grand averaged data incorporated with the MNI head model, corresponding to a typical location related to SEP stimulation. The results suggest the validity of estimating the dipole location from the grand averaged potential of all subjects with the MNI model if we focus on typical regions related to the task.

Single-epoch analysis of interleaved evoked potentials and fMRI responses during steady-state visual stimulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multi-modal imaging; BOLD-fMRI; Steady-state evoked potentials; Visual stimulation; Single-epoch; Correlation analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TRIAL VARIABILITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; FREQUENCY; ARTIFACT; DYNAMICS	Objective: Aim of the study was to record BOLD-fMRI interleaved with evoked potentials for single-epochs of visual stimulation and to investigate the possible relationship between these two measures. Methods: Sparse recording of fMRI and EEG, allowed us to measure BOLD responses and evoked potentials on an epoch-by-epoch basis. To obtain robust estimates of evoked potentials, we used blocks of contrast-reversing visual stimuli eliciting steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). For each block we acquired one Volume of fMRI data and we then tested for co-variations between SSVEPs and fMRI signals. Our analyses tested for frequency-specific co-variation between the two measurements that could not be explained by the mere presence/absence of the visual stimulation. Results: Condition-specific single-epoch SSVEPs and fMRI responses were observed at occipital sites. Combined SSVEPs-fMRI analysis at the single-epoch level did not reveal any significant correlation between the two recordings. However, both signals contained stimulation-specific linear decreases that may relate to neuronal habituation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate robust estimation of single-epoch evoked potentials and fMRI responses during interleaved recording, using visual steady-state stimulation. Significance: Single-epochs analysis of evoked potentials and fMRI signals is feasible for interleaved SSVEPs-fMRI recordings. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Mostly used functional neuroimaging techniques include Electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging. Among these techniques EEG has the best time resolution, while fMRI has the best spatial resolution. High temporal resolution of EEG is an attractive property for neuroimaging studies. EEG inverse problem is needed to be solved in order to identify the locations and the strength of the electrical sources forming EEG/ERP topographies. Low spatial resolution of the scalp topography causes this localization problem more complicated. In this paper, a spatial preprocessing method. which separates a topography into two or more subtopographies is proposed. The decomposition procedure is based on defining a spatial map with radial basis functions which forms the subtopographies. A simulated data is used to exhibit, the advantage of using this decomposition technique prior to EEG Source localization. It is shown that the accuracy of the source localization problem is improved by using the subtopographies instead of using the raw topography.

Brain responses strongly correlate with Weibull image statistics when processing natural images	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						natural image statistics; event-related potential; covariate; Weibull distribution; model; early vision; X-cell; Y-cell	RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; PERCEPTION; EDGES; INFORMATION; BLOBS	The visual appearance of natural scenes is governed by a surprisingly simple hidden structure. The distributions of contrast values in natural images generally follow a Weibull distribution, with beta and gamma as free parameters. Beta and gamma seem to structure the space of natural images in an ecologically meaningful way, in particular with respect to the fragmentation and texture similarity within an image. Since it is often assumed that the brain exploits structural regularities in natural image statistics to efficiently encode and analyze visual input, we here ask ourselves whether the brain approximates the beta and gamma values underlying the contrast distributions of natural images. We present a model that shows that beta and gamma can be easily estimated from the outputs of X-cells and Y-cells. In addition, we covaried the EEG responses of subjects viewing natural images with the beta and gamma values of those images. We show that beta and gamma explain up to 71% of the variance of the early ERP signal, substantially outperforming other tested contrast measurements. This suggests that the brain is strongly tuned to the image's beta and gamma values, potentially providing the visual system with an efficient way to rapidly classify incoming images on the basis of omnipresent low-level natural image statistics.

For this purpose, 40-Hz amplitude-modulated tones and a stream of flickering (7.5 Hz) random letters were presented concurrently. By means of an auditory or visual target detection task, participants' attention was directed to the respective modality for several seconds. Attention to the auditory stream led to a significant enhancement of the ASSR compared to when the visual stream was attended. This attentional modulation was located mainly in the right superior temporal gyrus. Vice versa, attention to the visual stream especially increased the second harmonic response of the SSVEP. This modulation was focused in the inferior occipital and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus of both hemispheres. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of amplitude modulation of the ASSR and the SSVEP by intermodal sustained attention. Our results open a new avenue of research to understand the basic neural mechanisms of intermodal attention in the human brain.

However, the standard statistical methods are inappropriate for these multivariate, highly correlated datasets. We introduce a procedure to identify spatially extended scalp fields that correlate with some external, continuous measure (reaction-time, performance, clinical status) and to test their significance. Methods: We formally deduce that the channel-wise covariance of some experimental variable with scalp field data directly represents intracerebral sources associated with that variable. We furthermore show how the significance of such a representation can be tested with resampling techniques. Results: Simulations showed that depending on the number of channels and subjects, effects can be detected already at low signal to noise ratios. In a sample analysis of real data, we found that foreign-language evoked ERP data were significantly associated with foreign-language proficiency. Inverse solutions of the extracted covariances pointed to sources in language-related areas. Conclusions: Covariance mapping combined with bootstrapping methods has high statistical power and yields unique and directly interpretable results. Significance: The introduced methodology overcomes some of the 'traditional' statistical problems in EEG/MEG scalp data analysis. Its application can improve the reproducibility of results in the field of EEG/MEG. (c) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here we use electroencephalography to determine whether the planning of reaching movements to visual and somatosensory targets involves a similar spatio-temporal pattern of neural activity. Subjects performed reaching movements toward spatial locations defined either by visual (light-emitting diode) or somatosensory (vibration of a fingertip of the contralateral hand) stimuli. To identify the activations associated with sensorimotor transformations, we Subtracted the event-related potentials recorded in a "static" task (the stimuli were presented but no movement was initiated) from those recorded in a "reach" task (a reach had to be initiated toward the spatial location of the stimuli). In the visual condition, reach-related activities were observed over parietal, premotor and sensorimotor areas contralateral to the reaching hand. Activation was first observed over parietal areas 140 ms after stimulus onset and progressed to frontal areas. The proprioceptive condition recruited a similar set of structures as for visual targets. However, the temporal pattern of activity within these cortical areas differed greatly. Activity was Sustained over premotor and sensorimotor areas throughout the reaction time interval, occurring simultaneously with the parietal activation. These results Suggest that a common cortical network serves to transform visual and somatosensory signals into motor commands, but that the interactions between the structures of this network differ. This raises the possibility that different coordinate frames are used to encode the motor error for the two target modalities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Individuals strategically employ the self-serving bias to maintain and protect positive self-views. The current study investigated the neural correlates of the self-serving bias using dense array EEG, giving 20 participants false (success or failure) feedback during a facial working memory task. Participants made self-serving attributions during the task, primarily following failure feedback. Voltage and source analyses in response to attribution stimuli revealed that, compared to self-serving responses, non-self-serving attributions were preceded by enhanced dorsomedial frontal cortex activity. This finding suggests that unbiased attributions require greater self-control, overriding the automatic tendency for self-enhancement.	[Krusemark, Elizabeth A.; Campbell, W.

Command of a simulated wheelchair on a virtual environment using a brain-computer interface	IRBM			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Robotics simulation; Smart wheelchair; Virtual environment	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; EEG; TECHNOLOGY; POTENTIALS; BCI	Objective. - The goal of this research was to design, set up, use and evaluate a realistic simulation platform that could host real-time simulated robotics applications controlled with a brain-computer interface based on an event-related potential paradigm. Materials and methods. - The platform is composed of the following modules: (i) six band-limited channels of electroencephalographic signal acquisition; (ii) signal processing and classification with the BCI2000 software platform; (iii) stimulus presentation and (iv) robotics simulation. A modified Donchin speller matrix that uses iconic elements to indicate diverse navigational commands was implemented as the stimuli for the brain-computer interface, and an alternative interface was also included for independent manual navigation. A physically realistic wheelchair model with both autonomous and user control was used as the robotic element in the system. Results. - Two healthy subjects were asked to perform a given navigation task throughout a simulated home environment using both navigational interfaces. For each task, each subject drove the wheelchair along similar paths and distances. The task execution time was greater when using the brain-computer interface, but both subjects were successful in adequately driving the wheelchair with the BCI. Discussion. - The wheelchair model within the simulation and control platform serves as a proof of purpose of the proposed system and demonstrates its potential. Further tests and experiments are needed, along with the definition of adequate metrics to characterize the entire user-controller-robot-task ensemble. Conclusions. - With the developed platform, evaluation of prospective brain-computer interfaces can go beyond classical measurements of error and bit transfer rates, to include metrics accounting for the integrated system.

Twenty-four pairs of healthy college students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions: the informed (12 pairs) and the naive (12 pairs) conditions. EEG of one subject in each pair was recorded when the 'feeling of being seen through' was evoked. The findings showed a prominent positive deflection of the difference wave within the time window 200 ms-400 ms after stimuli presentation (0 ms) in the naive group. The ERP amplitude of frontal and central scalp sites was significantly different between high and low paranoia rating scores.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional relationships between oscillatory electroencephalographic (EEG) dominant components with event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) method for idiopathic non-demented Parkinson's patients (PP) and control subjects (CS) during auditory discrimination tasks within two post-stimulus intervals of 0-250 and 250-600 ms. When comparing the CS and PP during the first post-stimulus period, we found delta- and theta-ERS significantly pronounced in CS for both tone types (low-800, high-1,000 Hz) with the following exceptions: at Fz, PP displayed higher delta-ERS, while at C3' theta-ERD in response to a high tone. Alpha-ERS was found in PP in response to either tone at all electrodes and mainly alpha-ERD in CS. In the second post-stimulus interval, the significant differences between the groups were: (i) delta-ERS in CS and delta-ERD in PP in response to the low tone and (ii) delta-ERS for both groups in answer to the high tone, more prominent in CS at Cz and Pz, except for delta-ERD in PP at C3'. For both groups, we detected predominantly theta-ERD and alpha-ERD following both tone types within this second interval. PP showed more expressed theta-ERD at Fz and parietal theta-ERS. Alpha-ERD was significantly higher in CS, while frontal alpha-ERD was more prominent in the PP in response to both tones. The data obtained showed specific functional differences of event-related oscillatory activity in cognitive and sensory-motor information processing between the PP and CS.

In the eye of the beholder: Individual differences in reward-drive modulate early frontocentral ERPs to angry faces	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Facial expression; Anger; Aggression; Personality; BIS/BAS system; EEG	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BEHAVIORAL-APPROACH SYSTEM; TIME-COURSE; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; APPETITIVE MOTIVATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; AGGRESSION; ATTENTION	Individual differences in reward-drive have been associated with increased attention toward facial signals of aggression, heightened experience of anger and vulnerability to display aggressive behaviour. Recent fMRI research suggests that these effects rely on reduced ventromedial prefrontal (and increased amygdala) response to aggressive facial displays compared with neutral and sad expressions in subjects scoring high on reward-drive. However, nothing is known about the timing of this modulation. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we provide the first evidence that greater proneness to display hostile and aggressive behaviour (measured by high scores on the reward-drive) is associated with a reduced midline frontocentral response to aggressive faces within 200-300 ms. In addition to confirming a particular interaction between anger processing and aggression related personality traits in ventromedial prefrontal brain regions, our study brings a first indication of when their interaction occurs in the brain, strengthening results from previous classical as well as functional connectivity fMRI studies.

But it is unclear whether the placebo effect can be transferred from one domain to the other, namely from pain to emotion. In this study we led participants to believe in the analgesic effect of magnetic treatment equipment (the placebo) by secretly reducing the intensity of pain stimulus. Then, we examined if this placebo could significantly alter participants' negative affect evoked by watching unpleasant pictures. Our results indicated a significant transferable placebo effect that alleviated negative feelings. EEG recordings showed the transferable placebo treatment induced decreased P2 amplitude and increased N2 amplitude, with source location near the posterior cingulate.

Affective primes suppress attention bias to threat in socially anxious individuals	BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY			English	Article						social anxiety; attention bias; threat; social information processing; priming; ERP	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY-STATES; FACES; AROUSAL; FEARFUL; PHOBIA; TASK; FMRI; CUES; ERP	Anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information. However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears. It remains unclear whether this suppression of attention bias can be caused by a transient activation of the fear system. In the present experiment, high socially anxious and low socially anxious individuals (HSA group, n = 12; LSA group, n = 12) performed a modified dot-probe task in which they were shown either a neutral or socially threatening prime word prior to each trial. EEG was collected and ERP components to the prime and faces displays were computed. HSA individuals showed an attention bias to threat after a neutral prime, but no attention bias after a threatening prime, demonstrating that suppression of attention bias can occur after a transient activation of the fear system. LSA individuals showed an opposite pattern: no evidence of a bias to threat with neutral primes but induction of an attention bias to threat following threatening primes. ERP results suggested differential processing of the prime and faces displays by HSA and LSA individuals. However, no group by prime interaction was found for any of ERP components.

Conventional analysis of SSEP usually use sweep averaging, which requires long time recording and may distort the features (amplitudes, latencies) of SSEP components. Here we conducted single-trial SSEP analysis with wavelet denoising, and our results showed that wavelet denoising kept the information of SSEP components unchanged. Our analysis showed the amplitudes and latencies of N1/P1 all decreased compared the baseline level, indicating the neurological injuries in the somatosensory pathways. We hypothesized the neurological injuries in the thalamus may contribute to the decrease in amplitudes and latencies of SSEP components.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the differences in electrical activity of brain cells while processing pre-cue and post-cue compound stimuli, and to explore brain electrical activity during global and local processing of compound stimuli according to electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A within-subject design study was performed at the School of Psychology, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, China from March to May 2006. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 healthy, undergraduate students, aged 17-24 years, comprising 12 males and 18 females, were voluntarily enrolled from Beijing Normal University. Subjects exhibited normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. No significant non signal wave drift was detected during testing. METHODS: A total of 30 subjects were subjected to pre-cue and post-cue compound stimulus processing using event-related potential and EEG recordings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evoked potential was recorded in different brain regions utilizing event-related potential to observe hemispheric symmetry, cue consistency and global-local features. RESULTS: Pre-cue compound stimuli resulted in hemispheric asymmetry for early wave (N1) and late wave (P3) in anterior brain regions. Early- and late-wave induced hemispheric asymmetry for electrode points (01, 02, P3, P4, Pz, F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz, FP1, FP2, T7, T8, C3, C4, and Cz) during processing of pre-cue compound stimuli (P < 0.05). Post-cue compound stimuli did not induce hemispheric asymmetry of brain waves induced by the above-described electrode points. No significant differences in global and local responses were determined during processing of post-cue compound stimuli. Under pre-cue conditions, significant differences were observed in N1 and P3 in the above-mentioned electrode points (P < 0.05). However, under post-cue conditions, no significant differences were observed in N1 and P3 using the above-mentioned electrode points. Significant differences in early waves (N1 and P1) using the above-mentioned electrode points were detected between anterior and posterior brain regions, regardless of consistent or inconsistent, large or small letters (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cue location effected mechanisms underlying global and local processing of compound stimuli. Pre- or post-cue conditions resulted in differences in hemispheric symmetry, cue consistency, and global and local features. Under pre-cue conditions, hemispheric dominance was detected in global and local processing following compound stimuli. Under post-cue conditions, hemispheric dominance was not determined.

For this purpose, activity was segmented into three different time windows: of 62.5, 250 and 500 ms. Two strategies were used: one a statistical comparison of changes between T-REM, Ph-REM and PRE-EM; the other a descriptive approach using principal component analysis. Significant findings showed that both EEG and MEG gamma activity are higher directly before eye movement onset in PRE-EM periods and during Ph-REM than during T-REM; temporal coupling of electrical activity between the frontal and parietal regions is decreased, while temporal coupling between the right frontal and midline is increased. just before eye movement onset, larger recording sites become related. For the first time, results showed a close temporal link between power and temporal coupling of fast oscillations and rapid eye movements in REM sleep, indicating increased activation, uncoupling between the left frontal executive areas and posterior sensory association regions and increased coupling between the right frontal attentional and midline alerting systems. Brain activity is reorganized by phasic events. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We used intracerebral electroencephalography recordings in 10 patients with epilepsy to directly measure neural activity in the temporal and frontal lobes during written words' recognition, predominantly in the left hemisphere. The patients were presented visually with consonant strings, pseudo-words, and words and performed a hierarchical paradigm contrasting semantic processes (living vs. nonliving word categorization task), phonological processes (rhyme decision task on pseudo-words), and visual processes (visual analysis of consonant strings). Stimuli triggered a cascade of modulations in the gamma-band (>40 Hz) with reproducible timing and task-sensitivity throughout the functional reading network: the earliest gamma-band activations were observed for all stimuli in the mesial basal temporal lobe at 150 ms, reaching the word form area in the mid fusiform gyrus at 200 ms, evidencing a superiority effect for word-like Stimuli. Peaks of gamma-band activations were then observed for word-like stimuli after 400 ms in the anterior and middle portion of the superior temporal gyrus (BA 38 and BA 22 respectively), in the pars triangularis of Broca's area for the semantic task (BAs 45 and 47), and in the pars opercularis for the phonological task (BA 44). Concurrently, we observed a two-pronged effect in the prefrontal cortex (BAs 9 and 46), with nonspecific sustained dorsal activation related to sustained attention and, more ventrally, a strong reflex deactivation around 500 ms, possibly due to semantic working memory reset.

The method first decomposes single trials into three frequency bands, each containing activity primarily associated with one of the three major AEP components, i.e., P50, N100 and P200. Next, single-trial evoked potentials with similar post-stimulus characteristics are clustered and selectively averaged to determine the presence or absence of an AEP component. The method was evaluated on actual AEP and spontaneous EEG data collected from 25 healthy participants using a paradigm in which pairs of identical tones were presented, with the first stimulus (S1) presented 0.5s before the second stimulus (S2). Homogeneous, well-separated clusters were obtained and substantial AEP variability was found. Also, there was a trend for S2 to produce fewer 'complete' (and significantly smaller) responses than S1. Tests conducted on spontaneous EEG produced similar clusters as obtained from EP data, but significantly fewer stimuli produced responses containing all three EP components than seen in AEP data. These findings suggest that the clustering method presented here performs adequately to assess trial-to-trial EP variability. Also, the results suggest that the sensory gating observed in normal controls may be caused by the fact that the second stimulus generates fewer 'responsive' trials than the first stimulus, thus resulting in smaller ensemble averages.

The measurements were performed with eighteen subjects (21.39 +/- 2.75 ages; 12 male). Single type of tactile stimuli was applied to two fingers on the right hand: frequent (non-target) tactile stimuli and targets. The target (25%) stimuli were presented on index finger and nontarget stimuli (75%) were presented on middle finger randomly. Subjects counted the target stimuli mentally. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64 channels, 14 of which (F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-Z, C-3, C-4, T-7, T-8, P-3, P-4, P-7, P-8, O-1, O-2) were primarily analyzed. Peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes and prolongations of delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) were measured in 1000 ms following stimuli. The repeated measures ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. Delta responses to target stimuli were higher than nontarget stimuli at F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-Z, C-3, T-7, P-3, P-4, P-7, P-8 and O-2 recording sites. Delta responses to target stimuli were more prolonged than nontarget stimuli at F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-3, C-4, T-7, P-3, P-4, and O-1. Theta responses to target stimuli were more prolonged than non-targets at F-3, F-4, C-z, C-4, P-3, O-1 and O-2. In tactile oddball paradigm, delta and theta responses to the both stimuli were highly distributed on the scalp. Furthermore, delta and theta oscillations have been differentiated for the target and nontarget stimuli, possibly serving as a reference for future physiological and clinical applications.

Gamma-band activity reflects multisensory matching in working memory	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Multisensory; Crossmodal; Working memory; Gamma; EEG	ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; RESPONSES; TASK; EEG; MODULATION; OBJECTS	In real-world situations, the integration of sensory information in working memory (WM) is an important mechanism for the recognition of objects. Studies in single sensory modalities show that object recognition is facilitated if bottom-up inputs match a template held in WM, and that this effect may be linked to enhanced synchronization of neurons in the gamma-band (>30 Hz). Natural objects, however, frequently provide inputs to multiple sensory modalities. In this EEG study, we examined the integration of semantically matching or non-matching visual and auditory inputs using a delayed visual-to-auditory object-matching paradigm. In the event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by auditory inputs, effects of semantic matching were observed after 120-170 ms at frontal and posterior regions, indicating WM-specific processing across modalities, and after 250-400 ms over medial-central regions, possibly reflecting the contextual integration of sensory inputs. Additionally, total gamma-band activity (GBA) with medial-central topography after 120-180 ms was larger for matching compared to non-matching trials. This demonstrates that multisensory matching in WM is reflected by GBA and that dynamic coupling of neural populations in this frequency range might be a crucial mechanism for integrative multisensory processes.

Methods: Forty-four healthy volunteers, including 23 males and 21 females, participated in the study. MMNs generated by pure-tone and phonetic stimuli were compared, to check for the existence of language-specific gender differences in lateralization. Both EEG amplitude and scalp current density (SCID) data were analyzed. Results: With phonetic MMNs, EEG findings revealed significantly larger amplitude in females than males, especially in the right hemisphere, while SCD findings revealed left hemisphere dominance and contralateral dominance in males alone. With pure-tone MMNs, no significant gender differences in hemispheric lateralization appeared in either EEG or SCD findings. Conclusion: While males exhibited left-lateralized activation with phonetic MMNs, females exhibited more bilateral activity. Further, the contralateral dominance of the SCD distribution associated with the ear receiving deviant stimuli in males indicated that ipsilateral input as well as interhemispheric transfer across the corpus callosum to the ipsilateral side was more suppressed in males than in females. Significance: The findings of the present study suggest that functional lateralization subserving preattentive detection of phonetic change differs between the genders. These results underscore the significance of considering the gender differences in the study of MMN, especially when phonetic stimulus is adopted. Moreover, they support the view of Voyer and Flight [Voyer, D., Flight, J., 2001. Gender differences in laterality on a dichotic task: the influence of report strategies. Cortex 37, 345-362.] in that the gender difference in hemispheric lateralization of language function is observed in a well-managed-attention condition, which fits the condition adopted in the MMN measurement; subjects are required to focus attention to a distraction task and thereby ignore the phonetic stimuli that elicit MMN.

Discrimination of behaviorally irrelevant auditory stimuli in stage II sleep	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory; discrimination; pattern recognition; polysomnography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTENSITY; P300	In sleep, the brain responds to significant stimuli such as one's own name or loud tones. It is, however, not yet known whether in sleep, the brain's response can vary systematically with change in an irrelevant stimulus. Here, we varied the intensity of a 1000 Hz tone and recorded the neural response of the participants by using electroencephalography. The P200 component of the auditory-evoked potential increased linearly and significantly with intensity in wake and in stage 11 sleep. Pattern classification confirmed that there is information about tone intensity in the poststimulus period, especially in the period corresponding to the P200. The sleeping brain is capable of discriminating the fine aspects of a stimulus that is of no significance to the individual.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of visual stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. Targets were preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a three-stimulus predictive sequence signalling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. PFC lesioned patients were impaired in their ability to use local contextual information. The response time for controls revealed a larger benefit for predictable targets than for random targets relative to PFC patients. PFC patients had reduced amplitude of a context-dependent positivity and failed to generate the expected P3b latency shift between predictive and non-predictive targets. These findings show that PFC patients are unable to utilize predictive local context to guide behaviour, providing evidence for a critical role of PFC in local contextual processing.

However, it is still under debate whether the race affects emotion processing or not. The studies based on Event-related potentials indicated many interesting results, but conflicting conclusions to some degree. This paper presents a study on how race influences emotion cognition during a cognitive task through a time-frequency analysis of event-related electroencephalograph. In our study, a recognition task with racial facial stimuli was utilized to address the influence of race-effect and emotion on working memory. Three expressions of each face (happy-positive, sad-negative and neutral) from different races were chosen for the experiments. Since depression is characterized as a typical mental disease with emotion processing deficits, fifteen patients with depression and eighteen normal controls were chosen to participate in the experiment. The repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) of Gamma EEG revealed that a significant interaction between race and emotion in the time-window 200-300ms at the low gamma band (30-60Hz). Subsequent analysis showed that, with other race stimuli, the average iGBA of low gamma band revealed different emotion effects, i.e. positive> negative > neutral. In addition, two trend effects were found, the emotion effect (positive>neutral>negative) for depression patients in the window of 500ms-600ms at high iGBA(65-90Hz), and the interaction between group and race in the 200ms-300ms window. To depressed participants, average high iGBA between 200ms-300ms for other-race faces was larger than that for own race faces, while which didn't happened to the normal controls. In summary we suppose that race-effect did affect the iGBA of the depressed participants while they performing emotion tasks, especially the negative ones.

In this study, we used fMRI and EEG to test the role of medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsolateral (DL) PFC in hypothesis testing using a modified intradimensional/extradimensional rule shift task. Eighteen adults were asked to infer rules about color or shape on the basis of positive and negative feedback in sets of two trials. Half of the trials involved color-to-color or shape-to-shape trials (intradimensional switches; ID) and the other half involved color-to-shape or shape-to-color trials (extradimensional switches; ED). Participants performed the task in separate fMRI and EEG sessions. ED trials were associated with reduced accuracy relative to ID trials. In addition, accuracy was reduced and response latencies increased following negative relative to positive feedback. Negative feedback resulted in increased activation in medial PFC and DLPFC, but more so for ED than ID shifts. Reduced accuracy following negative feedback correlated with increased activation in DLPFC, and increased response latencies following negative feedback correlated with increased activation in medial PFC. Additionally, around 250 msec following negative performance feedback participants showed a feedback-related negative scalp potential, but this potential did not differ between ID and ED shifts. These results indicate that both medial PFC and DLPFC signal the need for performance adjustment, and both regions are sensitive to the increased demands of set shifting in hypothesis testing.

Our objective was to explain specific shape features of interictal spikes in the hippocampus (observed in LFPs) in terms of cell-and network-related parameters of neuronal circuits that generate these events. We developed a neural network model based on "minimal" but biologically relevant neuron models interconnected through GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses that reproduce the main physiological features of the CA1 subfield. Simulated LFPs were obtained by solving the forward problem (dipole theory) from networks including a large number (similar to 3000) of cells. Insertion of appropriate parameters allowed the model to simulate events that closely resemble actual epileptic spikes. Moreover, the shape of the early fast component ("spike") and the late slow component ("negative wave") was linked to the relative contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. In addition, the model provides insights about the sensitivity of electrode localization with respect to recorded tissue volume and about the relationship between the LFP and the intracellular activity of principal cells and interneurons represented in the network.

Striatal LFPs were recorded with a device that allowed us to simultaneously record field potentials and apply drugs by reverse microdialysis at the same site. Administration of the GABA(A)-receptor antagonist gabazine ( SR95531, 10 and 500 mu M) induced large- amplitude LFP fluctuations at the infusion site, occurring every 2-5 s for about 2 h after the start of the 20-min drug administration. These events were prevented by cotreatment with a GABA(A)-receptor agonist ( muscimol, 100 mu M) or a combination of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists ( CNQX and MK-801, each given at 100 mu M). Gabazine ( 10 mu M) also increased the firing of single neurons recorded close to the injection site, but in most cases there was no correlation between single-neuron activity and the concomitantly recorded LFP signals from the same striatal region. In contrast, intrastriatal application of gabazine increased the correlation between striatal LFPs and EEG, and resulted in the appearance of recurrent EEG events that were temporally related to the striatal LFP events. These data provide evidence that a GABAergic "tone" in the monkey striatum controls the spontaneous activity of striatal neurons, as well as the level of striatal and cortical synchrony.

However, this usage has not been validated. We aimed to directly test the theta/beta ratio as a marker of arousal within this population. Methods: Resting state EEG activity was investigated as a function of CNS arousal in two age-matched groups of boys (each n = 30), with and without ADHD. Arousal was defined in terms of skin conductance level (SCL), which has a long history as a measure of CNS arousal. Results: Relative theta power and the theta/beta ratio were elevated, and SCL and relative alpha and beta power were reduced, in the ADHD group compared with control subjects. In both groups, mean alpha level correlated negatively with SCL. There was no significant correlation between the theta/beta ratio and SCL. Conclusions: These data contradict the supposed linkage between the theta/beta ratio and arousal in ADHD, confirming previous results from normal children. They suggest the need for reevaluation of current models of the disorder and reconceptualization of existing EEG data from both normal and atypical populations.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACTS; EOG CORRECTION; EEG; REMOVAL; TISSUES	Conventional eye correction methods subtract portions (propagation coefficients; Bs) of electrooculogram (EOG) voltages from the electroencephalogram (EEG). The frequency domain approach (FDA) uses different Bs for different frequencies whereas the time domain approach (TDA) uses the same Bs. To determine whether measured Bs are dependent on frequency and whether one should employ frequency-dependent methods, 20 min of EEG from eye movement (EM) and blink data (24 participants) were recorded, and Bs were calculated for eye movement ERPs of differing signal-to-noise ratios for frequency bands ranging from 0 to 40 Hz and compared. At high signal to noise, EM Bs for different frequency bands did not differ, for both vertical and horizontal EOG, at all scalp sites tested. There were small differences in blink Bs for different bands, but smaller than the margin of error of this analysis. This indicates that TDA may be more appropriate than FDA.

Attention to human speakers in a virtual auditory environment: Brain potential evidence	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						auditory; attention; virtual reality; event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SOUND LOCALIZATION; BINAURAL HEARING; SPEECH MESSAGES; COCKTAIL PARTY; FREE-FIELD; HEAD; CUES; SEGREGATION	Listening to a speech message requires the accurate selection of the relevant auditory input especially when distracting background noise or other speech messages are present. To investigate such auditory selection processes we presented three different speech messages simultaneously spoken by different actors at separate spatial locations (-70, 0, 70/ azimuth). Stimuli were recorded using an artificial head with microphones embedded in the "auditory canals" to capture the interaural time and level differences as well as some of the filter properties of the outer ear structures as auditory spatial cues, thus creating a realistic virtual auditory space. In a given experimental run young healthy participants listened via headphones and either attended to the rightmost or the leftmost message in order to comprehend the story. Superimposed on the speech messages task irrelevant probe stimuli (syllables sharing spatial and spectral characteristics, 4 probes/s) were presented that were used for the generation of event-related brain potentials computed from 29 channels of EEG. ERPs to probe stimuli were characterized by a negativity starting at 250 ms with a contralateral frontal maximum for the probes sharing spatial/spectral features of the attended story relative to those for the unattended message. The relatively late onset of this attention effect was interpreted to reflect the task demands in this complex auditory environment. This study demonstrates the feasibility to use virtual auditory environments in conjunction with the probe technique to study auditory selection under realistic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Mental Training Enhances Attentional Stability: Neural and Behavioral Evidence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; MEDITATION; CORTEX; TASK; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXPERTISE	The capacity to stabilize the content of attention over time varies among individuals, and its impairment is a hallmark of several mental illnesses. Impairments in sustained attention in patients with attention disorders have been associated with increased trial-to-trial variability in reaction time and event-related potential deficits during attention tasks. At present, it is unclear whether the ability to sustain attention and its underlying brain circuitry are transformable through training. Here, we show, with dichotic listening task performance and electroencephalography, that training attention, as cultivated by meditation, can improve the ability to sustain attention. Three months of intensive meditation training reduced variability in attentional processing of target tones, as indicated by both enhanced theta-band phase consistency of oscillatory neural responses over anterior brain areas and reduced reaction time variability. Furthermore, those individuals who showed the greatest increase in neural response consistency showed the largest decrease in behavioral response variability. Notably, we also observed reduced variability in neural processing, in particular in low-frequency bands, regardless of whether the deviant tone was attended or unattended. Focused attention meditation may thus affect both distracter and target processing, perhaps by enhancing entrainment of neuronal oscillations to sensory input rhythms, a mechanism important for controlling the content of attention. These novel findings highlight the mechanisms underlying focused attention meditation and support the notion that mental training can significantly affect attention and brain function.

Behavioural studies have investigated feature selection and binding in time using fleeting sequences of stimuli in the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm, and found that temporal accuracy is reduced when attentional control is diminished. To reduce the efficacy of attentional deployment, these studies have employed the Attentional Blink (AB) phenomenon. In this article, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to directly investigate the temporal dynamics of conscious perception. Specifically, employing a combination of experimental analysis and neural network modelling, we test the hypothesis that the availability of attention reduces temporal jitter in the latency between a target's visual onset and its consolidation into working memory. We perform time-frequency analysis on data from an AB study to compare the EEG trials underlying the P3 ERPs (Event-related Potential) evoked by targets seen outside vs. inside the AB time window. We find visual differences in phase-sorted ERPimages and statistical differences in the variance of the P3 phase distributions. These results argue for increased variation in the latency of conscious perception during the AB. This experimental analysis is complemented by a theoretical exploration of temporal attention and target processing. Using activation traces from the Neural-ST2 model, we generate virtual ERPs and virtual ERPimages. These are compared to their human counterparts to propose an explanation of how target consolidation in the context of the AB influences the temporal variability of selective attention. The AB provides us with a suitable phenomenon with which to investigate the interplay between attention and perception. The combination of experimental and theoretical elucidation in this article contributes to converging evidence for the notion that the AB reflects a reduction in the temporal acuity of selective attention and the timeliness of perception.

Feasibility and Pragmatics of Classifying Working Memory Load with an Electroencephalograph	CHI 2008: 26TH ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	APR 05-10, 2008	Florence, ITALY	ACM SIGCHI, Microsoft, Google, Autodesk, NSF, Oracle, SAP, SOURCEFORGE, Nokia, eLearn Magazine		Brain-Computer Interface (BCI); electroencephalogram (EEG); cognitive load; memory load; machine-learning; feature selection; classification	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OSCILLATIONS	A reliable and unobtrusive measurement of working memory load could be used to evaluate the efficacy of interfaces and to provide real-time user-state information to adaptive systems. In this paper, we describe an experiment we conducted to explore some of the issues around using an electroencephalograph (EEG) for classifying working memory load. Within this experiment, we present our classification methodology, including a novel feature selection scheme that seems to alleviate the need for complex drift modeling and artifact rejection. We demonstrate classification accuracies of up to 99% for 2 memory load levels and up to 88% for 4 levels. We also present results suggesting that we can do this with shorter windows, much less training data, and a smaller number of EEG channels, than reported previously. Finally, we show results suggesting that the models we construct transfer across variants of the task, implying some level of generality. We believe these findings extend prior work and bring us a step closer to the use of such technologies in HCI research.	[Grimes, David; Shenoy, Pradeep; Rao, Rajesh P.

Biochemical, behavioural and electrophysiological investigations of brain maturation in chickens	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Satellite Meeting of IBRO on Brain Mechanisms, Cognition and Behaviour in Birds	JUL 19-23, 2007	Heron Isl, AUSTRALIA			glutamate receptors; protein phosphorylation; auditory event related potentials; learning; synaptic plasticity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; PREPULSE INHIBITION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; STARTLE MODULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-SYSTEM; AMPA RECEPTORS; FOREBRAIN	It is convenient to divide the development of synaptic networks into two phases: synapse formation during which synaptic contacts are established, and a subsequent maturation phase during which synaptic circuits are fine tuned and the properties of individual synapses are modified. Understanding the complex factors that control the protracted maturation process in humans is likely to be important for understanding a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Chickens provide an ideal experimental model in which maturation specific changes can be identified and the mechanisms controlling them can be elucidated because the maturation phase is protracted and temporally separated from the formation phase. This paper reviews the knowledge about the biological mechanisms involved in the maturation phase of brain development in chickens and presents some new data. Studies of synaptic physiology suggest that maturation may alter the basal set point for stimulus induced synaptic plasticity. Biochemical and pharmacological studies of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) revealed major changes in receptor regulation and the intracellular signalling pathways linked to receptor activation. Not surprisingly, therefore, when immature or mature chickens learn the same behavioural task the learning induced molecular events at the synapse are different. Changes in the features of auditory event related potentials and the basal EEG provide non-invasive techniques for monitoring maturation changes in chicken brain but prepulse inhibition (PPI) is too small and variable in chickens to be useful. Experimentally induced mild late-onset hypothyroidism retards some aspects of brain maturation and may help identify some of the mechanisms controlling maturation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The influence of postural threat on the cortical response to unpredictable and predictable postural perturbations	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						postural threat; postural reactions; predictability; emotional context; electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; ANXIETY; ATTENTION; EMOTION; STANCE; AFFERENT; HUMANS; TASK; GAIT	This study investigated the effects of postural threat on the cortical response associated with postural reactions to predictable and unpredictable perturbations to upright stance. Postural threat was manipulated by having individuals stand on an elevated surface to alter the context in which the postural task was performed. Ten healthy young adults experienced a series of predictable and unpredictable trunk perturbations when standing at ground level and at the edge of a platform located 3.2 m above the ground. Participants felt less confident, more fearful of failing, more anxious and less stable when standing at the high surface height. Unpredictable perturbations generated a large negative potential (NI) which was increased by 84% when standing at the high compared to low surface height. The magnitude of change in this potential was related to the magnitude of change in balance perceptions, such as confidence and fear. Predictable perturbations did not generate a NI potential but instead produced an anticipation-related potential prior to the perturbation. This cortical activity observed in response to predictable perturbations was not influenced by postural threat. A large N1 potential was observed for a 'surprise' perturbation that followed a series of predictable perturbations. There was a trend for the amplitude of this potential to be increased when standing at the high compared to low surface height. The results of this study provide evidence for the modulating influence of psychological factors related to postural threat on the cortical activity associated with postural reactions to unpredictable perturbations.

Development, validation, and comparison of ICA-based gradient artifact reduction algorithms for simultaneous EEG-spiral in/out and echo-planar fMRI recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Imaging artifacts; Independent component analysis (ICA)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN EPILEPSY; REMOVAL; NETWORKS; BOLD; SUBTRACTION; SEPARATION; RESPONSES; EEG/FMRI	EEG data acquired in an MRI scanner are heavily contaminated by gradient artifacts that can significantly compromise signal quality. We developed two new methods based on independent component analysis (ICA) for reducing gradient artifacts from spiral in-out and echo-planar pulse sequences at 3 T, and compared our algorithms with four other commonly used methods: average artifact subtraction (Allen, P., Josephs, O., Turner, R., 2000. A method for removing imaging artifact from continuous EEG recorded during functional MRI. NeuroImage 12, 230-239.), principal component analysis (Niazy, R., Beckmann, C., Iannetti, G., Brady, J., Smith, S., 2005. Removal of FMRI environment artifacts from EEG data using optimal basis sets. NeuroImage 28, 720-737.), Taylor series (Wan, X., Iwata, K., Riera, J., Kitamura, M., Kawashima, R., 2006. Artifact reduction for simultaneous EEG/fMRI recording: adaptive FIR reduction of imaging artifacts. Clin. Neurophysiol. 117, 681-692.) and a conventional temporal ICA algorithm. Models of gradient artifacts were derived from simulations as well as a water phantom and performance of each method was evaluated on datasets constructed using visual event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as resting EEG. Our new methods recovered ERPs and resting EEG below the beta band (< 12.5 Hz) with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR<4). Our algorithms outperformed all of these methods on resting EEG in the theta and alpha bands (SNR>4); however, for all methods, signal recovery was modest (SNR similar to 1) in the beta band and poor (SNR<0.3) in the gamma band and above. We found that the conventional ICA algorithm performed poorly with uniformly low SNR (<0.1). Taken together, our new ICA-based methods offer a more robust technique for gradient artifact reduction when scanning at 3 T using spiral in-out and echo-planar pulse sequences. We provide new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method using a unified subspace framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Periodic epileptiform discharges in hypoxic encephalopathy: BiPLEDs and GPEDs as a poor prognosis for survival	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						PLEDs; BiPLEDs; GPEDs; Hypoxic encephalopathy; Prognosis	TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHIES; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; POSTANOXIC COMA; EEG PATTERNS; NEUROLOGY; ARREST	Introduction: Electrophysiologic tests in hypoxic encephalopathy consist of EEG and evoked/event-related potential studies. In most studies the generalized periodic epileptiform complexes have been reported combined with other EEG patterns and were indicators of a poor outcome in different etiologies of hypoxic encephalopathy (HE), but these have rarely been examined independently. Methodology: We analyzed from 2000 to 2007 the outcome of patients with HE and generalized periodic epileptiform complexes. We abstracted and tabulated clinical information, imaging findings, and outcome from the medical records. Results: We found 52 patients in our database. Fourteen patients (eight BiPLEDs and six GPEDs) were associated with HE. Patients with BIPLEDs were 68 +/- 19.4 years old, 5 female (62%) and 3 (38%) men. GPEDs patients were 52.5 +/- 19.1 years old, 2 women (20%) and 4 (80%) men. Myocardial infarction and ventricular tachycardia were responsible of 57% of the HE cases. Neuroimaging studies in both groups showed cortical structural lesions in 84%. All patients were comatose and died. Two GPEDs patients developed status epilepticus. Conclusion: GPEDs and BIPLEDs after an anoxic insult carried a poor prognosis for survival. Aggressive treatment of patients may not be warranted when these EEG patterns are seen after anoxic brain injury. (C) 2009 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded from subjects performing a four-class motor imaginary task, left hand, right hand, foot and tongue. Temporal features are extracted as squared band pass filtered EEG, and frequency features are extracted as energy in specific rhythms. Features in both domains are projected into a canonical discriminant spatial feature space provided by canonical variates analysis (CVA), and classified by support vector machines (SVM) with different kernel functions and parameters. The classification accuracy is assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. The maximum estimated accuracy is 82.8% at temporal domain using C-SVM with radial basis kernel. The results show that this approach achieves a good performance in multi-class motor imagery task, and has the potential in the application of complicated control device, such as brain-control based meal assistance system.

Our aim was to study whether the post-imagery beta rebound is a suitable feature for a simple "brain switch". Such a brain switch is a specifically designed brain-computer interface (BCI) with the aim to detect only one predefined brain state (e.g. EEG pattern) in ongoing brain activity. Method: One EEG (Laplacian) recorded at the vertex during cue-based brisk foot motor imagery was analysed in 5 healthy subjects. The peri-imagery ERD and the post-imagery beta rebound (ERS) were analysed in detail between 6 and 40 Hz and classified with two support vector machines. Results: The ERD was detected in ongoing EEG (simulation of asynchronous BCI) with a true positive rate (TPR) of 28.4% +/- 13.5 and the beta rebound with a TPR of 59.2% +/- 20.3. In single runs with 30 cues each, the TPR for beta rebound detection was 78.6% +/- 12.8. The false positive rate was always kept below 10%. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the beta rebound at Cz during foot motor imagery is a relatively stable and reproducible phenomenon detectable in single EEG trials. Significance: Our results indicate that the beta rebound is a suitable feature to realize a "brain switch" with one single EEG (Laplacian) channel only.

Repetition effects were modulated by facial expression in three different time windows, starting as early as 40-50 ms in both EEG and MEG, then arising at the time of the N170/M170, and finally between 280-320 ms in MEG only. The very early repetition effect, observed at 40-50 ins over occipito-temporo-parietal regions, showed a different MEG topography according to the facial expression. This differential response to fearful, happy and neutral faces suggests the existence of very early discriminative visual processing of expressive faces, possibly based on the low-level physical features typical of different emotions. The N170 and M170 face-selective components both showed repetition enhancement selective to neutral faces, with greater amplitude for emotional than neutral faces on the first but not the second presentation. These differential repetition effects may reflect valence acquisition for the neutral faces due to repetition, and suggest a combined influence of emotion- and experience-related factors on the early stage of face encoding. Finally, later repetition effects consisted in enhanced M300 (MEG) between 280 and 320 ms for fearful relative to happy and neutral faces that occurred on the first presentation, but levelled out on the second presentation.

Such an inhibition could be implemented actively between the responses defined as possible alternatives by the task instructions or, alternatively, could passively result from some kind of "reciprocal inhibition'' between the two motor cortices. The present study addressed this issue. To this end, we compared the surface Laplacian transforms of electroencephalographic (EEG) waves recorded over the contralateral and ipsilateral motor cortices in between-hand and within-hand choice conditions. The dynamics of the recorded EEG activities suggest that inhibition is implemented in a feed-forward manner between the cortical zones controlling the different response alternatives rather than between homologous motor cortical structures.

Effects of weak mobile phone - Electromagnetic fields (GSM, UMTS) on well-being and resting EEG	BIOELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Editorial Material						mobile phone; EEG; well-being; UMTS; GSM	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EXPOSURE; SLEEP; SENSITIVITY; BRAIN; TIME	Modern mobile phones emit electromagnetic fields (EMFs) ranging from 900 to 2000 MHz which are suggested to have an influence on well-being, attention and neurological parameters in mobile phone users. To date Most studies have investigated Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-EMF and only very few studies were concerned with Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)-EMF. Consequently, we tested the effects of both types of EME 1950 MHz UNITS (SAR 0.1 and 1 W/kg) and pulsed 900 MHz GSM (1 W/kg), on well-being and vaigilance-controlled resting electroencephalogram (eyes closed) in 15 healthy. right-handed subjects. A double-blind, randomised, crossover applications of the test procedure was Used. Neither the UMTS- nor the GSM-EMF produced any significant changes in the measured parameters compared to sham exposure. The results do not give any evidence for a deleterious effect of the EMF oil normal healthy mobile phone users.

Many known techniques use the P300 event-related potential by extracting relevant features from the EEG signal and feeding those features into a classifier. In these approaches, feature extraction becomes the key point, and doing it by hand can be at the same time cumbersome and suboptimal. In this paper we face the issue of feature extraction by using a genetic algorithm able to retrieve the relevant aspects of the signal to be classified in an automatic fashion. We have applied this algorithm to publicly available data sets (a BCI competition) and data collected in our lab, obtaining with a simple logistic classifier results comparable to the best algorithms in the literature. In addition, the features extracted by the algorithm can be interpreted in terms of signal characteristics that are contributing to the success of classification, giving new insights for brain activity investigation.

Right Parietal Brain Activity Precedes Perceptual Alternation of Bistable Stimuli	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article							NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; MULTISTABLE VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TO-TRIAL VARIABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CHANGE BLINDNESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION	Momentary fluctuations of baseline activity have been shown to influence responses to sensory stimulation both behaviorally and neurophysiologically. This suggests that perceptual awareness does not solely arise from physical stimulus properties. Here we studied whether the momentary state of the brain immediately before stimulus presentation indicates how a physically unique but perceptually ambiguous stimulus will be perceived. A complex Necker cube was intermittently presented and subjects indicated whether their perception changed with respect to the preceding presentation. EEG was recorded from 256 channels. The prestimulus brain-state was defined as the spatial configuration of the scalp potential map within the 50 ms before stimulus arrival, representing the sum of all momentary ongoing brain processes. Two maps were found that doubly dissociated perceptual reversals from perceptual stability. For EEG sweeps classified as either map, distributed inverse solutions were computed and statistically compared. This yielded activity confined to a region in right inferior parietal cortex that was significantly more active before a perceptual reversal. In contrast, no significant topographic differences of the evoked potentials elicited by stable vs. reversed Necker cubes were found. This indicates that prestimulus activity in right inferior parietal cortex is associated with the perceptual change.

In both groups, responses to standard and deviant stimuli differed significantly; however, adults produced a typical mismatch negativity (MMN), whereas 6-month-old infants exhibited a slow positive wave. We conclude that 6-month-old infants, like adults, encode melodic information in terms of relative pitch distances, but that the underlying cortical activity differs significantly from that of adults.

The scan modes are governed by a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on Event Related Potentials (Synchronization and Desynchronization events). The user is capable to select a specific position at the robot's workspace, which should be reached by the manipulator. The robot workspace is divided into cells. Each cell has a probability value associated to it. Once the robot reaches a cell, its probability value is updated. The mode the scans are made is determined by the probability of all cells at the workspace. The updating process is governed by a recursive Bayes algorithm. A performance comparison between a sequential scan mode and the ones proposed here is presented. Mathematical derivations and experimental results are also shown in this paper.

Visual sensory processing deficits in patients with bipolar disorder revealed through high-density electrical mapping	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; UNAFFECTED 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CHRONIC-SCHIZOPHRENIA; I DISORDER; RATING-SCALE; 1ST-EPISODE; P300; METAANALYSIS; GENERATION	Background: Etiological commonalities are apparent between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. For example, it is becoming clear that both populations show similar electrophysiological deficits in the auditory domain. Recent studies have also shown robust visual sensory processing deficits in patients with schizophrenia using the event-related potential technique, but this has not been formally tested in those with bipolar disorder. Our goal here was to assess whether early visual sensory processing in patients with bipolar disorder, as indexed by decreased amplitude of the P1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP), would show a similar deficit to that seen in those with schizophrenia. Since the P1 deficit has already been established as an endophenotype in schizophrenia, a finding of commonality between disorders would raise the possibility that it represents a measure of common genetic liability. Methods: We visually presented isolated-check stimuli to euthymic patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and age-matched healthy controls within a simple go/no-go task and recorded VEPs using high-density (72-channel) electroencephalography. Results: The P1 VEP amplitude was substantially reduced in patients with bipolar disorder, with an effect size of f = 0.56 (large according to Cohen's criteria). Limitations: Our sample size was relatively small and as such, did not allow for an examination of potential relations between the physiologic measures and clinical measures. Conclusion: This reduction in P1 amplitude among patients with bipolar disorder represents a dysfunction in early visual processing that is highly similar to that found repeatedly in patients with schizophrenia and their healthy first-degree relatives. Since the P1 deficit has been related to susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, our results raise the possibility that the deficit may in fact be more broadly related to the development of psychosis and that it merits further investigation as a candidate endophenotype for bipolar disorder.

J	Ucles, P; Mendez, M; Garay, J				Ucles, Paulino; Mendez, Mario; Garay, Jose			Low-level Defective Processing of Non-verbal Sounds in Dyslexic Children	DYSLEXIA			English	Article						developmental dyslexia; wavelet transform; early auditory processing; gamma-band oscillations; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; 40 HZ-EEG; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; DISCRIMINATION	We compared processing of non-verbal auditory stimuli by dyslexic and non-dyslexic children using electrophysiological methods. The study included 39 children (17 with dyslexia plus 22 controls) assessed via frontal, central, parietal, and temporal electrodes. As an extension of previous P300 event-related potential studies, we analysed variations in the power values of 40-Hz oscillations (gamma-band oscillations involved in cognitive processing) during a specific time window in response to the auditory 'oddball' paradigm that entail target (random 2 kHz) and standard (frequent 1 kHz) stimuli. Dyslexic children differed significantly from controls (P < 0.001) in the mean power of the wavelet-transformed 40-Hz oscillation in a time interval starting at 25 ms after stimulus onset up to 50 ms. This means defective processing of sounds. Within groups, standard and target tones elicited significantly different power values (P < 0.001). Correlations of values between standard and target responses at each electrode position were not significant within either group, although dyslexics showed a lower correlation than controls. Significant differences in the mean power of these oscillations detected at very early stages of auditory processing in dyslexic children and the wide range of mean values reveal impairment in processing non-verbal sounds in dyslexia.

As understanding the functional neural substrates of aberrant gating would have important implications for schizophrenia, this study examined the location and time-course of the neural generators of the P50 MLAERP and its gating on subgroups of healthy volunteers exhibiting low (n = 12) and high (n = 12) P50 suppression. Suppressor differences were observed with S-1 P50 (high>low) and S-2 P50 (high<low) amplitudes, and current source density analysis with standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) evidenced an S-1 P50-related activation of limbic, temporal and parietal regions in the high but not the low suppressors. Distributed source localization of the Gating Difference Wave (GDW), obtained by subtracting the S-2 P50 response from the S-1 P50 response, also revealed a later and sustained frontal activation to characterize high suppressors. These findings suggest that impaired gating of the kind evident in schizophrenia may involve the deficient functioning of multiple interconnected and temporally overlapping activated brain regions.

Using simultaneous EEG recordings directly from deep brain structures and the scalp, we show that the human thalamus systematically reacts to syntactic and semantic parameters of auditorily presented language in a temporally interleaved manner in coordination with cortical regions. In contrast, two key structures of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus, were not found to be engaged in these processes. We therefore propose that syntactic and semantic language analysis is primarily realized within cortico-thalamic networks, whereas a cohesive basal ganglia network is not involved in these essential operations of language analysis.

M. Gollwitzer & P. Sheeran, 2006), the present studies were conducted to address their effectiveness in regulating emotional reactivity. Disgust-(Study 1) and fear-(Study 2) eliciting stimuli were viewed under 3 different self-regulation instructions: the goal intention to not get disgusted or frightened, respectively, this goal intention furnished with an implementation intention (i.e., an if-then plan), and a no-self-regulation control group. Only implementation-intention participants succeeded in reducing their disgust and fear reactions as compared to goal-intention and control participants. In Study 3, electro-cortical correlates (using dense-array electroencephalography) revealed differential early visual activity in response to spider slides in ignore implementation-intention participants, as reflected in a smaller Pl. Theoretical and applied implications of the present findings for emotion regulation via implementation intentions are discussed.

Both visually derived and stored velocity information provide input to the tracking system when the target is visible, but after occlusion the system receives its input solely from stored velocity representations. We used EEG to investigate the transition to purely memory guided tracking after the initial period of occlusion. Participants fixated while they covertly tracked targets moving horizontally rightward at velocities of 12 or 20 degrees/s. The targets were either continuously visible or disappeared for a short interval mid trajectory. Similar positive event related components were recorded over the right occipitoparietal region in both tasks, providing further evidence that the same neural systems are involved in tracking both visible and occluded targets. Furthermore, when the target was visible, the development of this positivity was linked to the spatial location of the target, peaking earlier in the 20 degrees/s condition. However, in the occluded condition the positive deflection began around 200 ms following the onset of occlusion and was not modulated by target velocity or location. This indicates a neural response after occlusion is cortically registered, consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased reliance on memory guided tracking at this point.

Brief radiant laser pulses can be used to activate cutaneous A delta and C nociceptors selectively and elicit a number of transient brain responses [laser-evoked potentials (LEPs)] in the ongoing EEG. LEPs have been used extensively in the past 30 years to gain knowledge about the cortical mechanisms underlying nociception and pain in humans, by assuming that they reflect at least neural activities uniquely or preferentially involved in processing nociceptive input. Here, by applying a novel blind source separation algorithm (probabilistic independent component analysis) to 124-channel event-related potentials elicited by a random sequence of nociceptive and non-nociceptive somatosensory, auditory, and visual stimuli, we provide compelling evidence that this assumption is incorrect: LEPs do not reflect nociceptive-specific neural activity. Indeed, our results indicate that LEPs can be entirely explained by a combination of multimodal neural activities (i.e., activities also elicited by stimuli of other sensory modalities) and somatosensory-specific, but not nociceptive-specific, neural activities (i.e., activities elicited by both nociceptive and non-nociceptive somatosensory stimuli). Regardless of the sensory modality of the eliciting stimulus, the magnitude of multimodal activities correlated with the subjective rating of saliency, suggesting that these multimodal activities are involved in stimulus-triggered mechanisms of arousal or attentional reorientation.

To this end, both visual and auditory word cues were used to instruct participants to direct attention to a specific visual (color) or auditory (pitch) stimulus feature of a forthcoming multisensory target stimulus. Effects of cue congruency were observed within 200 ms post-cue over frontal scalp regions and related to processes involved in shifting attention from the cue modality to the modality of the task-relevant target feature. Both directing visual attention and directing auditory attention were associated with dorsal posterior positivity, followed by sustained fron-to-central negativity. However, this fronto-central negativity appeared to have an earlier onset and was more pronounced when the visual modality was cued. Together the present results suggest that the mechanisms involved in deploying attention are to some extent determined by the modality (visual, auditory) in which attention operates, and in addition, that some of these mechanisms can also be affected by cue congruency.

Animal models are needed to investigate possible mechanisms underlying NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as development of new therapeutic approaches. A major difficulty in developing animal models for schizophrenia is the identification of quantifiable measures that can be tested in a similar fashion in both humans and animals. The majority of animal models utilize analogous measures, wherein species-specific behaviors are used as presumed parallel manifestations of a common underlying construct. In vivo microdialysis and electrophysiology represent two methodologies in which homologous measures can instead be obtained in both animals and humans. In both techniques, well-validated, NMDA-sensitive measures are analyzed in rodents using probes implanted directly into cortex or subcortical structures. We discuss the currently available data from studies that used these methods in non-human primate and rodent glutamate models. In addition, we emphasize the possible relevance of the amphetamine-challenge studies to positive symptoms and of EEG measures to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

DISCRIMINATIVE CHANNEL SELECTION METHOD FOR THE RECOGNITION OF ANTICIPATION RELATED POTENTIALS FROM CCD ESTIMATED CORTICAL ACTIVITY	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE			HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; BRAIN	Recognition of brain states and subject's intention from electroencephalogram (EEG) is a challenging problem for brain-computer interaction. Signals recorded from each of EEG electrodes represent noisy spatio-temporal overlapping of activity arising from very diverse brain regions. However, un-mixing methods such as Cortical Current Density (CCD) can be used for estimating activity of different brain regions. These methods not only improve spatial resolution but also signal to noise ratio, hence the classifiers computed using this activity may ameliorate recognition performances. However, these methods lead to a multiplied number of channels, leading to the question - "How to choose relevant and discriminant channels from a large number of channels?". In the current paper we present a channel selection method and discuss its application to the recognition of anticipation related potentials from surface EEG channels and CCD estimated cortical potentials. We compare the classification accuracies with previously reported performances obtained using Cz electrode potentials of 9 subjects (3 experienced + 6 naive). As hypothesized, we observed improvements for most subjects with channel selection method applied to CCD activity as compared to surface-EEG channels and baseline performances. This improvement is particularly significant for subjects who are naive and did not show a clear pattern on ERP grand averages.

The present systematic review will focus on the most largely studied electrophysiological indices, i.e., qualitative or quantitative (limited to spectral analysis) EEG and the P300 event-related potential. The PubMed clinical query was used with research methodology filters for each of the following categories: diagnosis/prognosis/aetiology and a broad sensitive search strategy. The key-words: SCHIZOPHRENIA AND EEG/P3/P300 were used. The search results were then narrowed by including the terms "human" and "English language", and cross-referenced. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, when available, were also used for cross-referencing. Case reports and studies irrelevant to the topics and methodologies under examination were excluded. The remaining papers were screened to verify the eligibility for this systematic review, Inclusion criteria were: a) a diagnosis of schizophrenia confirmed by DSM-III/ICD-9 criteria (or later editions of the same classification systems); b) the inclusion of both a schizophrenia study group and an healthy control group (when appropriate, i.e., for P300 and quantitative EEG); c) qualitative or spectral EEG findings and amplitude measures for P300. The included studies were then reviewed to verify homogeneity of the results, as well as the presence of the information needed for the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Previous reviews and studies meeting the above requirements (n=22 for qualitative EEG; n=45 for spectral EEG and n=132 for P300) were classified according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) levels of evidence criteria. For qualitative EEG as a diagnostic test, the majority of studies predated the introduction of DSM-III and were excluded from the review. Few post DSM-III studies investigated the usefulness of qualitative EEG in the differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and psychosis due to general medical condition. None of them was Oxford CEBM level 3b (non-consecutive-study or cohort-study without consistently-applied reference standard) or better (exploratory or validating cohort-study). No meta-analysis could be conducted due to the lack of reliable quantification methods in the reviewed studies. For spectral EEG as a diagnostic test, most studies qualified as level 4 (case-control study with poor reference standard), and only 24% as level 3b or better. An increase of slow activity in patients is reported by most of these studies. As to meta-analyses examining 29 studies, with 32 independent samples for the delta band and 35 for the theta band, a moderate effect size was found and only 1 study yielded findings in the opposite direction for both measures. There was no identified source for the discrepancy. The analysis of moderator factors included medication, band frequency limits, spectral parameters and disease stage. The medication status was significant for the theta band but the effect was unclear as findings for drug-naive and drug-free patients were in a different direction. Chronicity had a significant effect on both delta and theta bands, with slow activity increase larger in chronic than in first episode patients. For P3 amplitude reduction as a diagnostic index, 63% of the studies qualified as level 3b or better. Meta-analysis (52 studies, 60 independent samples) results demonstrated a large effect size. None of the studies reported opposite findings. The analysis of moderator factors, including medication status and disease stage, revealed no significant effect on data heterogeneity. In conclusion, the examined indices are good Candidates but are not ready yet for clinical applications aimed to improve present diagnostic standards for schizophrenia. Further research carried out according to adequate methodological standards and based on large scale multi-center studies is mandatory.

Amending prior findings the influence of neural correlates related to the emotional state termed "romantic love" was investigated. Specifically, the effect of feelings of love on face perception was of interest. Pictures of a "loved person" were presented to female subjects and the elicited responses were compared with responses to pictures showing faces of a "known and appreciated person" or an "unknown person" during EEG recordings (n=20 females). As a control condition light stimulation was employed. The sequence of faces shown was presented in random and block-design. EEG data was analyzed considering maximum amplitudes and topographical differences within the conventional frequency bands of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Differences between light and face stimuli were found in the delta and theta bands and differences between the face types and the two designs were found in the delta band. The delta response to the picture of the "loved person" showed significantly higher amplitude values, not only in comparison with the "unknown person", but also with the picture of the "appreciated person". Frontal lobes appear to react to different types of facial stimuli with specific increases in delta responses. The difference between the response to the "loved person" and of the "known and appreciated person" reflects the component of the emotion denoted as love. The findings and their interpretations are discussed within the framework of event-related oscillations and complex stimulus processing emphasizing the concept of dynamic localization.

Neuroimaging studies show that unfavorable outcomes or situations with high level of conflict engage the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). Recording of event-related potentials revealed that these situations are accompanied by a negative deflection, the so-called error-related negativity (ERN), which appears after an erroneous response or after negative feedback. Both activation of the pMFC and the ERN are thought to represent a signal that indicates the need for behavioral adjustment, and to recruit other brain regions that implement these adjustments. While many fMRI and EEG studies have shed light on the anatomical structures and the cognitive processes involved in performance monitoring, only very recently have researchers begun to investigate the underlying neurochemical mechanisms. Drawing on the putative involvement of dopamine (DA) neurons in coding a reward prediction error, an influential theory has ascribed a pivotal role to DA in performance monitoring. However, although important, DA is certainly not the only neuromodulator involved. Recent studies point to a role for serotonin, norepinephrine and GABA, but also for adenosine in performance monitoring. Here, we review the evidence for neurotransmitter effects on this function in humans. In this light, we critically discuss currently debated models of performance monitoring and potential alternatives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessment of the brain functional state in pathological gamblers with a complex of neurophysiological methods	ZHURNAL NEVROLOGII I PSIKHIATRII IMENI S S KORSAKOVA			Russian	Article						pathological gambling; neurophysiology		A diagnosis of pathological gambling met ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. Based on the electroencephalographic data, two types of disturbances of electric activity were singled out: (1) abnormalities of amplitude and frequency characteristics of a-rhythm and (2) the disturbance of mechanisms of synchronized slow waves generating associated with the a-rhythm abnormalities. Despite the fact that patients did not abuse drugs, they had changes similar to those in drug addicts, i.e. the increase of index and power of beta-rhythm, abnormalities of amplitude and frequency characteristics of alpha-rhythm. Significant correlations between the level of impulsivity and the type of EEG parameters were found. The prolongation of latency of P300 auditory event-related potentials was correlated with the presence of EEG bilaterally synchronized waves of the theta-band that were recorded mostly in the frontal brain areas and with cognitive impairment. The results obtained suggest the dysfunction of brain diencepbalic structures as well as medial-basal regions of frontal lobes that may cause predisposition to pathological gambling.	[Shemchuk, N.

The effect of acute sleep deprivation on visual evoked potentials in professional drivers	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep deprivation; event-related potentials; visual field; driving; circadian effects	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARVOCELLULAR-PATHWAY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERFORMANCE; P300; FIELD; TIME; STIMULATION	Study Objectives: Previous studies have demonstrated that as little as 18 hours of sleep deprivation can cause deleterious effects on performance. It has also been suggested that sleep deprivation can cause a "tunnel-vision" effect, in which attention is restricted to the center of the visual field. The current study aimed to replicate these behavioral effects and to examine the electrophysiological underpinnings of these changes. Design: Repeated-measures experimental study. Setting: University laboratory. Patients or Participants: Nineteen professional drivers (1 woman; mean age = 45.3 +/- 9.1 years). Interventions: Two experimental sessions were performed; one following 27 hours of sleep deprivation and the other following a normal night of sleep, with control for circadian effects. Measurements & Results: A tunnel-vision task (central versus peripheral visual discrimination) and a standard checkerboard-viewing task were performed while 32-channel EEG was recorded. For the tunnelvision task, sleep deprivation resulted in an overall slowing of reaction times and increased errors of omission for both peripheral and foveal stimuli (P < 0.05). These changes were related to reduced P300 amplitude (indexing cognitive processing) but not measures of early visual processing. No evidence was found for an interaction effect between sleep deprivation and visual-field position, either in terms of behavior or electrophysiological responses. Slower processing of the sustained parvocellular visual pathway was demonstrated. Conclusions: These findings suggest that performance deficits on visual tasks during sleep deprivation are due to higher cognitive processes rather than early visual processing. Sleep deprivation may differentially impair processing of more-detailed visual information. Features of the study design (eg, visual angle, duration of sleep deprivation) may influence whether peripheral visual-field neglect occurs.

Thus it is not surprising that nAChRs have been strongly implicated as therapeutic targets for treating cognitive deficits in disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular the alpha7 (alpha 7) nAChR has been closely linked with normalization of P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) gating deficits, and to a lesser extent improvements in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. These two brain phenomena can be considered as pre-attentive, occurring while sensory information is being processed, and are important endophenotypes in schizophrenia with deficits likely contributing to the cognitive fragmentation associated with the disease. In addition alpha 7 nAChRs have been implicated in attention, in particular under high attentional demand, and in more demanding working memory tasks such as long delays in delayed matching tasks. Efficacy of alpha 7 nAChR agonists across a range of cognitive processes ranging from pre-attentive to attentive states and working and recognition memory provides a solid basis for their pro-cognitive effects. This review will focus on the recent work highlighting the role of alpha 7 in cognition and cognitive processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to emotional faces and classification performance were assessed in 12 anorexic females and matched healthy controls. Results: Patients with anorexia nervosa showed no modulation of emotional face processing and displayed significantly increased N200 amplitudes in response to all emotional categories and decreased VEPs in response to unpleasant emotional faces in the P300 time range as compared with healthy controls. They also made more mistakes in emotional face recognition, in particular, for neutral, sad, and disgusted content. Conclusions: There are marked differences in evoked potentials and emotion recognition performances of patients with anorexia nervosa and controls in facial processing. Differences in brain dynamics might contribute to difficulties in the correct recognition of facially expressed emotions, deficits in social functioning, and in turn the maintenance of eating disorders.

Induced Gamma-band Activity Elicited by Visual Representation of Unattended Objects	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FIGURE-GROUND ORGANIZATION; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; HUMAN EEG; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; MODULATION	Object recognition is achieved through neural mechanisms reliant on the activity of distributed neural assemblies that are thought to be coordinated by synchronous firing in the gamma-band range (> 20 Hz). An outstanding question focuses on the extent to which the role of gamma oscillations in object recognition is dependent on attention. Attentional mechanisms determine the allocation of perceptual resources to objects in complex scenes biasing the outcome of their mutual competitive interactions. Would object-related enhancements in gamma activity also occur for unattended objects when perceptual resources are traded off to the processing of concurrent visual material? The present electroencephalogram study investigated event-related potentials and evoked (time- and phase-locked) and induced (non-time- and phase-locked to stimulus onset) gamma-band activity (GBA) using a visual discrimination task of low or high perceptual load at fixation. The task was performed while task-irrelevant familiar or unfamiliar objects coappeared in the surrounding central area. Attentional focus was kept at fixation by varying perceptual load between trials; in such conditions, only holistic object processing or low-level perceptual processing, requiring little or no attention, are thought to occur. Although evoked GBA remained unmodulated, induced GBA enhancements, specific to familiar object presentations, were observed, thus providing evidence for cortical visual representation of unattended objects. In addition, the effect was mostly driven by object-specific activity under low load, implying that, in cluttered or complex scenes, attentional selection likely plays a more significant role in object representation.

A powerful and widely acknowledged BMI approach, so far only applied in invasive recording techniques, uses neuronal signals related to limb movements for equivalent, multidimensional control of an external effector. Here, we investigated whether this approach is also applicable for noninvasive recording techniques. To this end, we recorded whole-head MEG during center-out movements with the hand and found significant power modulation of MEG activity between rest and movement in three frequency bands: an increase for <= 7Hz (low-frequency band) and 62-87 Hz (high-gamma band) and a decrease for 10-30 Hz (beta band) during movement. Movement directions could be inferred on a single-trial basis from the low-pass filtered MEG activity as well as from power modulations in the low-frequency band, but not from the beta and high-gamma bands. Using sensors above the motor area, we obtained a surprisingly high decoding accuracy of 67% on average across subjects. Decoding accuracy started to rise significantly above chance level before movement onset. Based on simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings, we show that the inference of movement direction works equally well for both recording techniques. In summary, our results show that neuronal activity associated with different movements of the same effector can be distinguished by means of noninvasive recordings and might, thus, be used to drive a noninvasive BMI.

Hearing of note: An electrophysiologic and psychoacoustic comparison of pitch discrimination between vocal and instrumental musicians	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory pitch processing; Musician; EEG; MMN; Difference limen frequency	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY-DISCRIMINATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NONMUSICIANS; CORTEX; SENSITIVITY	Cortical auditory evoked potentials of instrumental musicians suggest that music expertise modifies pitch processing, yet less is known about vocal musicians. Mismatch negativity (MMN) to pitch deviances and difference limen for frequency (DLF) were examined among 61 young adult women, including 20 vocalists, 21 instrumentalists, and 20 nonmusicians. Stimuli were harmonic tone complexes from the mid-female vocal range (C4-G4). MMN was elicited by multideviant paradigm. DLF was obtained by an adaptive psychophysical paradigm. Musicians detected pitch changes earlier and DLFs were 50% smaller than nonmusicians. Both vocal and instrumental musicians possess superior sensory-memory representations for acoustic parameters. Vocal musicians with instrumental training appear to have an auditory neural advantage over instrumental or vocal only musicians. An incidental finding reveals P3a as a sensitive index of music expertise.

Prior intention can locally tune inhibitory processes in the primary motor cortex: direct evidence from combined TMS-EEG	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						combined TMS-EEG; intention; motor cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SILENT PERIOD; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION	Human subjects are able to prepare cognitively to resist an involuntary movement evoked by a suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) by anticipatory selective modulation of corticospinal excitability. Uncovering how the sensorimotor cortical network is involved in this process could reveal directly how a prior intention can tune the intrinsic dynamics of M1 before any peripheral intervention. Here, we used combined TMS-EEG to study the cortical integrative processes that are engaged both in the preparation to react to TMS (Resist vs. Assist) and in the subsequent response to it. During the preparatory period, the contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude was found to be smaller over central electrodes (FC1, C1, Cz) when preparing to resist compared with preparing to assist the evoked movement whereas alpha-oscillation power was similar in the two conditions. Following TMS, the amplitude of the TMS evoked-N100 component was higher in the Resist than in the Assist condition for some central electrodes (FCz, C1, Cz, CP1, CP3). Moreover, for six out of eight subjects, a single-trial-based analysis revealed a negative correlation between CNV amplitude and N100 amplitude. In conclusion, prior intention can tune the excitability of M1. When subjects prepare to resist a TMS-evoked movement, the anticipatory processes cause a decreased cortical excitability by locally increasing the inhibitory processes.

The English task showed an overall right visual field advantage for latency and accuracy, which was larger for target words than for nonwords, suggesting independent processing in each hemisphere. The right hemisphere was more sensitive to word frequency than the left, and the left hemisphere was more sensitive to orthographic regularity than the right. All lexical variables (Wordness, Frequency, Regularity, and Word Pronounceability) had physiological correlates, and those correlates were often different in the two hemispheres. Occasionally, the behavioral and physiological measures conflicted and some lexical variables had physiological but no behavioral correlates. The physiological variables can reflect early stages of information processing that are not available to conscious decision. Moreover, different cognitive phenomena may have the same EEG correlates. Thus, gamma changes as a function of Lexicality (Wordness), semantic (Word Frequency), orthographic (Word Regularity), and phonological (Nonword Pronounceability) variables. The Hebrew lexical decision task showed an overall right visual field advantage, but not the same for target word and nonword, suggesting exclusive specialization in the left hemisphere. The EEG at rest was predictive of subsequent hemispheric specialization for lexical decision. We also studied hemispheric error monitoring in the English task. We found that while the left hemisphere was superior for lexical decision, the right hemisphere better monitored errors and adapted to them by slowing down and becoming more accurate. Further, error correction in a given trial was negatively correlated with left asymmetry in the alpha amplitude over mid and posterior electrodes. Thus, effective error monitoring seems to require interhemispheric cooperation. We conclude that the EEG, as currently measured, differentiate all the relevant dimensions of the lateralized lexical decision task, but that it taps different stages of processing. The EEG response in the gamma band multiply determines so that different cognitive states have the same EEG signature. Consequently, a more refined, wider range, and more theoretically informed partitioning of the EEG spectra is now due.

Cognitive process in MR is associated with multi-component neural networks, and elucidation of specific cortical interactions taking place during MR will assist understanding of the cognitive processes involved. In this study, we investigated cortical interactive networks involved in Chinese character MR tasks of different difficulties. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from nine subjects (male/female = 6/3) during MR of a Chinese character presented at different orientations (0 degrees, +/- 60 degrees, +/- 120 degrees and 180 degrees). Partial directed coherence (PDC) analysis based on multivariate Granger causality (GC) was used to assess cortical interactions. At +/- 60 degrees and +/- 120 degrees, lateral interactions from right to left counterparts were found in both the parietal and motor-related areas, and they were enhanced with the increase of rotation angle. The main interactions between parietal and motor-related areas showed feedforward at rotations of +/- 60 degrees and +/- 120 degrees, while feedback interactions appeared at rotations of +/- 120 degrees. However, at 180 degrees of rotation, neither lateral interactions within motor-related areas nor feedback interactions from motor-related to parietal areas were found. These findings show that during MR of Chinese character (1) cortical interactive networks change according to task difficulty, and (2) the right hemisphere plays an initiating role in bilateral cortical activation.

J	Gladwin, TE; t' Hart, BM; de Jong, R				Gladwin, Thomas E.; t' Hart, Bernhard M.; de Jong, Ritske			Dissociations between motor-related EEG measures in a cued movement sequence task	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; wavelet analysis; PLV; preparation; movement sequence	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ATTENTION; ACTIVATION; AREAS; RECONFIGURATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPLEMENTARY; INVOLVEMENT; MODULATION; RESPONSES	Different aspects of preparation, especially processes related to knowing what to prepare versus applying that foreknowledge effectively, may be reflected in different types of brain activity, e.g., the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), beta-band event-related desynchronization and phase locking. In a previous study in which subjects had to switch between response hands, dissociations were found between types of preparatory hand-related lateralization in evoked potentials, amplitude and phase locking (Gladwin et al., 2006) knowing what task set to switch to and effectively preparing that task set affected the different measures of lateralization. Similarly to how, in task switching, stimuli and responses must be correctly related to each other, in the preparation of movement sequences relations must be specified concerning motor processes. Similar dissociations as found in the task switching data might then be found in a cued movement sequence task. This possibility was explored by precueing elements of a two-movement sequence involving the left and right index fingers, and comparing various measures of electroencephalogram activity. Cues could specify the full sequence, either the first or the second element, or neither element. Knowing the first. element was sufficient to lateralize the pattern of phase locking, but effects were found in the LRP and lateralized amplitude only when the full sequence was known. It seems likely that subjects only fully prepared the first response when they had full knowledge of the sequence so that the dissociation may be closely related to that found for task switching. Thus, the present data would appear to agree with previous results that couple response-foreknowledge with phase locking and the transformation of that foreknowledge into effective changes in component processes with evoked potential shifts. The results further underscore the general importance of considering different types of brain activity: depolarization, desynchronization and phase locking all appear to be involved in different aspects of cognitive control.

These responses are used to study how the synchronization of brain electrical responses is associated with cognition such as how the brain detects changes in the auditory world. One such event-related response to auditory change is called mismatch negativity (MMN). It is typically observed by computing a difference wave between ERPs elicited by a frequently repeated sound and ERPs elicited by an infrequently occurring sound which differs from the repeated sounds. Fast and reliable extraction of the ERPs, such as the genuine MMN, is an important focus of studies devoted to basic cognitive brain research. In this study, we compared three procedures for extraction of the MMN elicited by infrequent duration decrements in auditory sound stimulation. These were the conventional difference wave (DW) with average standard sweep, optimal digital filtering (ODF), and recently proposed independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition procedures. The statistical comparison was made in a group of 12 healthy adults aged 23-30 years. The MMN was elicited in a passive oddball protocol presenting an auditory stimulation consisting of frequent tones of 600 Hz of 100 ms duration each (standard stimuli). Infrequently, one of the tones was shortened to 75, 50, or 30 ms (deviant stimuli). The ICA decomposition procedure, similarly to the DW procedure with average standard sweep, extracted a cleaner MMN compared to the ODF procedure. Both procedures extracted the MMN, whose amplitude and latency characteristics concur with substantial number of publications in contrast to the ON procedure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; A-DELTA INPUTS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CORTICAL RESPONSES; HEAT STIMULI; HAIRY SKIN; C-FIBER; HUMANS	Although laser-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) responses are increasingly used to investigate nociceptive pathways, their functional significance remains unclear. The reproducible observation of a robust correlation between the intensity of pain perception and the magnitude of the laser-evoked N1, N2, and P2 responses has led some investigators to consider these responses a direct correlate of the neural activity responsible for pain intensity coding in the human cortex. Here, we provide compelling evidence to the contrary. By delivering trains of three identical laser pulses at four different energies, we explored the modulation exerted by the temporal expectancy of the stimulus on the relationship between intensity of pain perception and magnitude of the following laser-evoked brain responses: the phase-locked N1, N2, and P2 waves, and the non-phase-locked laser-induced synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD). We showed that increasing the temporal expectancy of the stimulus through stimulus repetition at a constant interstimulus interval 1) significantly reduces the magnitudes of the laser-evoked N1, N2, P2, and ERS; and 2) disrupts the relationship between the intensity of pain perception and the magnitude of these responses. Taken together, our results indicate that laser-evoked EEG responses are not determined by the perception of pain per se, but are mainly determined by the saliency of the eliciting nociceptive stimulus (i.e., its ability to capture attention). Therefore laser-evoked EEG responses represent an indirect readout of the function of the nociceptive system.	[Iannetti, G.

The nature of this theta activity is still unclear, that is, whether it is related to error detection, conflict between responses or reinforcement learning processes. We examined slow (e.g., theta) and fast (e.g., gamma) brain rhythms related to rule violation. A time-frequency decomposition analysis on a wide range of frequencies band (0-95 Hz) indicated that the theta activity relates to evaluation processes, regardless of motor/action processes. Similarities between the theta activities found in rule-violation tasks and in tasks eliciting ERN/FRN suggest that this theta activity reflects the operation of general evaluation mechanisms. Moreover, significant effects were found also in fast brain rhythms. These effects might be related to the synchronization between different types of cognitive processes involving the fulfillment of a task (e.g., working memory, visual perception, mathematical calculation, etc.).

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 13 healthy subjects performed the source memory task for the voice of the speaker in spoken words. The source correct condition of old words elicited more positive-going potentials than the correct rejection condition of new words at 400-700 ins post-stimulus and the old/new effects also appeared in the, right anterior region between 1,000 and 1,200 ms. We conducted source reconstruction at mean latencies of 311, 604, 793, and 1,100 ms and used statistical parametric mapping for the statistical analysis. The results of source analysis suggest that the activation of the right inferior parietal region may reflect retrieval of source information. The source elicited by the difference ERPs between the source correct and source incorrect conditions exhibited dynamic change of current density activation in the overall cortices with time during source memory retrieval. These results indicate that multiple neural systems may underlie the ability to recollect context. Hurry Brain Mapp 30:78-91, 2009. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Busch, NA; Dubois, J; VanRullen, R				Busch, Niko A.; Dubois, Julien; VanRullen, Rufin			The Phase of Ongoing EEG Oscillations Predicts Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; STIMULUS ONSET; REACTION TIME; EXCITABILITY	Oscillations are ubiquitous in electrical recordings of brain activity. While the amplitude of ongoing oscillatory activity is known to correlate with various aspects of perception, the influence of oscillatory phase on perception remains unknown. In particular, since phase varies on a much faster timescale than the more sluggish amplitude fluctuations, phase effects could reveal the fine-grained neural mechanisms underlying perception. We presented brief flashes of light at the individual luminance threshold while EEG was recorded. Although the stimulus on each trial was identical, subjects detected approximately half of the flashes (hits) and entirely missed the other half (misses). Phase distributions across trials were compared between hits and misses. We found that shortly before stimulus onset, each of the two distributions exhibited significant phase concentration, but at different phase angles. This effect was strongest in the theta and alpha frequency bands. In this time-frequency range, oscillatory phase accounted for at least 16% of variability in detection performance and allowed the prediction of performance on the single-trial level. This finding indicates that the visual detection threshold fluctuates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG activity. The results support the notion that ongoing oscillations shape our perception, possibly by providing a temporal reference frame for neural codes that rely on precise spike timing.

These measures were recorded during a computerized flanker task designed to assess cognitive control and response monitoring. The sample was recruited from a larger randomized efficacy trial of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P) and included foster children assigned to the intervention condition (n = 10), foster children assigned to a services-as-usual comparison condition (n = 13), and low-income, nonmaltreated community children (n = 11). The children's behavioral and electrophysiological performance on the task was generally consistent with previous research with adults and older children. There were no group differences on the behavioral measures of cognitive control or response monitoring. Notably, however, group differences were observed on the electrophysiological measures of response monitoring. Specifically, the foster children who received services as usual were significantly less responsive to performance feedback about errors than the foster children who received the intervention and the nonmaltreated children. Applications of this methodology and implications of the results for future prevention research are discussed.

Free choices have been associated with activations on the medial frontal Surface, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe. Self-paced movements and free selection between various motor responses were typically used to investigate voluntary behavior. The aim of the present study was to determine neural correlates Of voluntary motor responses and the voluntary inhibition of motor responses in a group of healthy subjects. Hence, a go/nogo/voluntary selection paradigm was used. In the voluntary selection condition subjects decided freely whether or not to respond with a button press after Stimulus presentation. Functional MRI data and event-related potentials were acquired simultaneously in order to reliably investigate spatial and temporal characteristics of these responses. The results showed decision-related enhanced neural responses predominantly in the medial frontal gyrus/supplementary motor area, lateral frontal brain regions and the inferior parietal gyrus. Additional activations associated With voluntary movements were detected in the frontal eye field as well as brain regions directly linked to motor responses (e.g. somatosensory cortical areas). Altogether, decision processes were shown to be relatively independent of the kind of response chosen. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2971-2985, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss. Inc.

Habituation of the orienting reflex and the development of Preliminary Process Theory	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Habituation; Orienting reflex; Dual-process Theory; Preliminary Process Theory; Event-related potentials; ERPs	CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TASK; RESTING-STATE AROUSAL; DISHABITUATION PARADIGM; STIMULUS SIGNIFICANCE; EEG DIFFERENCES; ACTIVATION; FRACTIONATION; COMPONENTS; UNITARY; POTENTIALS	The orienting reflex (OR), elicited by an innocuous stimulus, can be regarded as a model of the organism's interaction with its environment, and has been described as the unit of attentional processing. A major determinant of the OR is the novelty of the eliciting stimulus, generally operationalised in terms of its reduction with stimulus repetition, the effects of which are commonly described in habituation terms. This paper provides an overview of a research programme, spanning more than 30 years, investigating psychophysiological aspects of the OR in humans. The major complication in this research is that the numerous physiological measures used as dependent variables in the OR context fail to jointly covary with stimulus parameters. This has led to the development of the Preliminary Process Theory (PPT) of the OR to accommodate the complexity of the observed stimulus-response patterns. PPT is largely grounded in autonomic measures, and current work is attempting to integrate electroencephalographic measures, particularly components in the event-related brain potentials reflecting aspects of stimulus processing. The emphasis in the current presentation is on the use of the defining criteria of the habituation phenomenon, and Groves and Thompson's Dual-process Theory, in the development of PPT.

This is possible only due to the fast functioning of the self-monitoring system. Surprisingly, no specific data about error monitoring have been published in the music domain. Consequently, the present study investigated the electrophysiological correlates of executive control mechanisms, in particular error detection, during piano performance. Our target was to extend the previous research efforts on understanding of the human action-monitoring system by selecting a highly skilled multimodal task. Pianists had to retrieve memorized music pieces at a fast tempo in the presence or absence of auditory feedback. Our main interest was to study the interplay between auditory and sensorimotor information in the processes triggered by an erroneous action, considering only wrong pitches as errors. We found that around 70 ms prior to errors a negative component is elicited in the event-related potentials and is generated by the anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, this component was independent of the auditory feedback. However, the auditory information did modulate the processing of the errors after their execution, as reflected in a larger error positivity (Pe). Our data are interpreted within the context of feedforward models and the auditory-motor coupling.

The basic principle is to decompose a time series into intrinsic mode functions (IFMs) and each IFM corresponds to an oscillation phenomenon. A statistical description of the oscillatory activities of the EEG has been well known. It is desired to extract single oscillatory process from the EEG by EMD. Mismatch negativity (MMN) can be automatically elicited by the deviant stimulus in an oddball paradigm, in which physically the deviant stimulus occurs among repetitive and homogeneous stimuli. MMN thus reflects the ability of the brain to detect changes in auditory stimuli. So, the MMN trace indeed is the superposition of different event related potentials (ERPs). In theory, different ERPs correspond to different oscillatory phenomena. We assume each oscillatory activity corresponds to an IMF. Hence, EMD can decompose the MMN trace into different IMFs. Based on the timing, spectral and time-frequency infomax of MMN, a MMN detector is also designed to choose the MMN-like IMF. In contrast to the classic methods-averaging and optimal digital filtering (ODF), the EMD can cancel the ERPs overlapped with MMN both in the time and frequency domain. In the computation on the MMN experiment dataset, EMD outperforms averaging and ODF with about 3dB higher support to absence ratio.

J	Ritter, P; Becker, R				Ritter, Petra; Becker, Robert			Detecting alpha rhythm phase reset by phase sorting: Caveats to consider	NEUROIMAGE			English	Editorial Material							ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; WAVES; EEG	One method being proposed for disentangling whether the ERP is generated by an evoked potential that is independent of and adds linearly to the ongoing rhythm or by (partial) phase resetting of the ongoing rhythm is sorting trials according to the pre-stimulus phase of the ongoing rhythm. The subsequent subtraction of phase-sorted resting-state trials is Supposed to correct for phase-sorting effects otherwise maintained in the Post Stimulus time. Consequently, a true phase dependency of the ERP, considered to be indicative for a phase-reset (Risner, M.L., Aura, C.J., Black, J.E., Gawne, T.J., 2009. The visual evoked potential is independent Of surface alpha rhythm phase. Neurolmage), Would then become apparent. Here we disclose possible pitfalls of this approach causing invalid inferences. We also highlight that inferences based oil this approach first depend oil the assumed concept of a phase reset, and second can provide a hint at but are not Sufficient for disentangling different mechanisms of ERP generation. We will discuss other criteria necessary for further confirmation of the phase reset theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They are controlled by the sleep wake rhythm. In both clincial entities the sleep wake rhythm is similarly disturbed by increased arousal due to different causes sustaining the potential for nocturnal motor events. Epilepsies and parasomnias seem to be controlled by the same brain centres and pathways; therefore more attention should be paid to their concomitant occurrence. In a few cases the diagnosis requires long-term polysomnography with epilepsy circuits. The further differentiation of the disorders of arousal (DOA) and epilepsies requires further research and imaging with intelligent algorithms and a detailed analysis of the polysomnographic microstructures.

There is some evidence of an effect of exposure to a Global System for Mobile Telecommunication (GSM)type signal on the spontaneous electroencephalogram ( EEG). This is not corroborated, however, by the results from studies on evoked potentials. Although there is some evidence emerging that there may be an effect of exposure to a GSM-type signal on sleep EEG, results are still variable. In summary, exposure to a GSM-type signal may result in minor effects on brain activity, but such changes have never been found to relate to any adverse health effects. No consistent significant effects on cognitive performance in adults have been observed. If anything, any effect is small and exposure seems to improve performance. Effects in children did not differ from those in healthy adults. Studies on auditory and vestibular function are more unequivocal: neither hearing nor the sense of balance is influenced by short-term exposure to mobile phone signals. Subjective symptoms over a wide range, including headaches and migraine, fatigue, and skin itches, have been attributed to various radiofrequency sources both at home and at work. However, in provocation studies a causal relation between EMF exposure and symptoms has never been demonstrated. There are clear indications, however, that psychological factors such as the conscious expectation of effect may play an important role in this condition.

Hemispheric Asymmetries in Tracking Occluded Moving Targets with the Mind's Eye: Simultaneous Event-Related fMRI and Eye-Movement Recording	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Occlusion; Mental imagery; MT/V5; Hemisphere effect; Eye-tracking during EEG; Multi-modal imaging; Smooth pursuit; Saccade; Evoked potentials; Top-down modulation	PARIETAL; STRIATE; MOTION	The ability of the eyes and brain to predict and track visible and occluded moving targets is essential to goal-directed action. Event-related functional MRI and eye-movements were simultaneously measured during a smooth pursuit task with different levels of visual cuing. Subjects tracked a white dot moving from left to right following a sinusoidal pattern, during which it could be seen over half the screen (visible condition) before disappearing behind the occlusion bar (occluded condition). When tracking occluded, moving targets, we observed a hemisphere asymmetry at the early visual cortex, but not in motion-processing area MT/V5. During eye-tracking, the left early visual cortex responded stronger than the right to visible targets, but the right responded stronger to occluded targets. In contrast, motion-processing area MT/V5 in both hemispheres favored visible over occluded targets. These results suggest the right early visual cortex is the mind's eye, receiving input from higher level memory regions to produce simulated vision during occlusion.

Optimizing the Measurement of Contact Heat Evoked Potentials	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Pain; Human; Brain	HAIRY SKIN; LASER; STIMULATION; PATHWAYS; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Our aim was to determine whether single trial averaging could improve quantification of contact heat evoked potentials measured from fixed position contact heat stimulation. Event-related brain potentials were measured in response to contact heat stimuli applied to the arm and the leg of 10 subjects via a circular thermode, using fixed and varied thermode positions at 41 degrees C and 51 degrees C. Contact heat evoked potentials were successfully recorded from varied position stimulation of the leg at 51 degrees C in 80% of subjects, but from only 60% of subjects using a fixed position. Contact heat evoked potentials were only identified in a small number of subjects when stimulating at 41 degrees C. The amplitude of the N2-112 complex and pain intensity ratings were larger for the varied compared with the fixed thermode position and were also larger when stimulating the arm. Automated single trial analysis of the data resulted in larger amplitude of the N2-P2 complex than standard averaging. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the reduced contact heat evoked potentials amplitude seen for fixed location stimulation can be improved with single-trial averaging.

The aim of this study is the evaluation of the performance of SDTF in the cognitive experiment. We have applied SDTF for the estimation of the pattern of EEG signal transmissions during a Continuous Attention Test (CAT). Time-frequency patterns of propagation were estimated for two experimental conditions. Statistical procedures based on thin-plate spline model were used for estimation of significant changes in respect to the reference epoch. The repeatability of the results for a subject and across the subjects were investigated. The effect of prolonged transmission in the gamma band from the prefrontal electrodes found in all subjects was explained by the active inhibition in the case when a subject had to sustain from performing the action.

Brain potentials related to the human penile erection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPOTENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						phallometry; EEG; ICA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEXUAL AROUSAL; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS; STIMULI; INNERVATION; EMOTION; SYSTEM; ERP	The aim of this study was to elucidate the brain processes preceding penile responses. Electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials and penile circumference were recorded simultaneously while male subjects were exposed to visual sexual stimuli (VSS). The trials were sorted by the penile response of the subjects (erection, maintenance or detumescence). The corresponding EEG recordings were then subjected to independent component analysis. We found that 200 ms after VSS onset brain potentials differ according to the genital response to follow. Whereas early posterior negativity (EPN) was predominantly related to erection and maintenance, P3-like activity was found to precede detumescence. EPN indicates a more 'emotional' processing state of the brain, whereas P3-like activity related to detumescence indicates a more 'cognitive' processing state. The latter is assumed to reflect activity of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Further research should evaluate the contribution of P3-related brain activity to psychogenic erectile dysfunction.

Brain-Computer Interfaces for Virtual Environment Control	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		Brain-Computer Interface; P300; evoked potential; Virtual Environment		A brain-computer interface (130) is a new communication channel between the human brain and a digital computer. Furthermore a BCI enables communication without using any muscle activity for a subject. The ambitious goal of a BCI is finally the restoration of movements, communication and environmental control for handicapped people. However, in more recent research also BCI control in combination with Virtual Environments (VE) gains more and more interest. Within this study we present experiments combining BCI systems and control VE for navigation and control purposes just by thoughts. A comparison of the applicability and reliability of different BCI types based on event related potentials (P300 approach) will be presented. BCI experiments for navigation in VR were conducted so far with (i) synchronous BCI and (ii) asynchronous BCI systems. A synchronous BCI analyzes the EEG patterns in a predefined time window and has 2-3 degrees of freedom. A asynchronous BCI analyzes the EEG signal continuously and if a specific event is detected then a control signal is generated. This study is focused on a BCI system that can be realized for Virtual Reality (VR) control with a high degree of freedom and high information transfer rate. Therefore a P300 based human computer interface has been developed in a VR implementation of a smart home for controlling. the environment (television, music, telephone calls) and navigation control in the house. Results show that the new P300 based BCI system allows a very reliable control of the VR system. Of special importance is the possibility to select very rapidly the specific command out of many different choices. This eliminates the usage of decision trees as previously done with BCI systems.

The statistical significance of the hemodynamic responses was evaluated by a general linear model (GLM) with the boxcar design matrix convoluted with Gaussian function. The resulting NIRS and EEGs data were stereotaxically superimposed on the reconstructed brain of each subject. The NIRS data indicated that changes in oxy-hemoglobin concentration increased at the contralateral primary somatosensory (SI) area; responses then spread to the more posterior and ipsilateral somatosensory areas. The EEG data indicated that positive somatosensory evoked potentials peaking at 22 ms latency (P22) were recorded from the contralateral SI area. Comparison of these two sets of data indicated that the distance between the dipoles of P22 and NIRS channels with maximum hemodynamic responses was less than 10 mm, and that the two topographical maps of hemodynamic responses and current source density of P22 were significantly correlated. Furthermore, when onset of the boxcar function was delayed 5-15 s (onset delay), hemodynamic responses in the bilateral parietal association cortices posterior to the SI were more strongly correlated to electrical stimulation. This suggests that GLM analysis with onset delay could reveal the temporal ordering of neural activation in the hierarchical somatosensory pathway, consistent with the neurophysiological data. The present results suggest that simultaneous NIRS and EEG recording is useful for correlating hemodynamic responses to neural activity.

Several recent studies have looked at analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through the use of wavelets and neural networks. While showing great promise, the final outcomes of these studies have been largely inconclusive. This is mostly due to inherent difficulty of the problem, but also - perhaps - due to inefficient use of the available information, as many of these studies have used a single EEG channel for the analysis. In this contribution, we describe an ensemble of classifiers based data fusion approach to combine information from two or more sources, believed to contain complementary information, for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our emphasis is on sequentially generating an ensemble of classifiers that explicitly seek the most discriminating information from each data source. Specifically, we use the event related potentials recorded from the Pz, Cz, and Fz electrodes of the EEG, decomposed into different frequency bands using multiresolution wavelet analysis. The proposed data fusion approach includes generating multiple classifiers trained with strategically selected subsets of the training data from each source, which are then combined through a modified weighted majority voting procedure. The implementation details and the promising outcomes of this implementation are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We studied 14 right-handed subjects: five patients with AD, five patients with MCI and four healthy controls. Fifty TMS-pulses at an intensity of 110% of individually determined motor threshold were delivered to the hand area of primary motor cortex (M[1) with navigated brain stimulation (NBS). Spreading of primary NBS-evoked neuronal activity was monitored with a compatible 60-channel EEG, and analyzed in time, frequency and spatial-domains. We found significantly reduced TIMS-evoked P30 (time-locked response 30 ms after the magnetic stimulation) in the AD subjects. This reduction was seen in the temporo-parietal area ipsilateral to stimulation side as well as in the contralateral fronto-central cortex corresponding to the sensorimotor network, which is anatomically interconnected with the stimulated M1. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the N100 amplitude in the MCI subjects when compared with the control subjects. Thus, the combination of NBS and EEG revealed prominent changes in functional cortical connectivity and reactivity in the AD subjects. This pilot study suggests that the method may provide a novel tool for examining the degree and progression of dementia. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sensory-evoked gamma oscillations in chronic schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						EEG; evoked potentials; gamma oscillation; schizophrenia	NEURAL SYNCHRONY; DYSFUNCTION; RESPONSES; MEMORY; EEG; ABNORMALITIES; SPECIFICITY; PERCEPTION	Background: The early visual-evoked gamma oscillation (VGO) elicited by Gestalt stimuli is reduced in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy individuals, but it is unknown whether this effect is specific to these particular stimuli and task. In contrast, the early auditory-evoked gamma oscillation (AGO) was reported to be unaffected in a sample of unmedicated, mostly first-episode schizophrenics, but it is unknown whether this oscillation is abnormal in chronic, medicated patients. We investigated these issues by examining the VGO and AGO in chronic schizophrenic (SZ) and matched healthy control (HQ subjects. Methods: Subjects (21 HC, 23 SZ) performed visual and auditory oddball tasks. Visual stimuli were letters, and auditory stimuli were simple tones. Event-related spectral measures (phase locking factor and evoked power) were computed on Morlet wavelet-transformed single epochs from the standard trials. Results: VGO phase locking at occipital electrodes was reduced in SZ compared with HC. In contrast, AGO phase locking and evoked power did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The VGO deficit may be a general phenomenon in schizophrenia, whereas the AGO evoked by simple tone stimuli does not appear to be abnormal in chronic, medicated schizophrenia patients.

Twenty adults looked at emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful) or neutral faces. EEG results showed that motivational significance of face can modulate frequency bands, specifically for theta and gamma. Moreover, gamma can be varied related to degree of arousing feature (high or low) of facial expression. As a function of time, ANOVA and regression analysis revealed that emotional discrimination by gamma and theta is observable mainly within 150-250 time interval and, as revealed also by coherence analysis, that it is more distributed on the anterior-right (theta) or right (gamma) side of the scalp for the emotional stimuli, whereas delta is maximally increased within 250-350 interval and it is more posteriorly (parietal site) distributed for all the stimulus type. We proposed that band modulations respond to variations in processing emotional face. and, whereas delta reflects updating of the stimulus, and theta responds to the emotional significance of face, gamma reflects differences in the arousing power of facial expression.

In addition, behavioural activation (BAS) and behavioural inhibition systems (BIS) were considered as an explicative factor to verify the effect of motivational significance on cortical activity. Nineteen subjects were submitted to an ample range of facial expressions of emotions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral). The results demonstrated that anterior frontal sites were more active than central and posterior sites in response to facial stimuli. Moreover, right-side responses varied as a function of emotional types, with an increased right-frontal activity for negative emotions. Finally, whereas higher BIS subjects generated a more right hemisphere activation for some negative emotions (such as fear, anger, and surprise), Reward-BAS subjects were more responsive to positive emotion (happiness) within the left hemisphere. Valence and potential threatening power of facial expressions were considered to elucidate these cortical differences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Chaotic Non-Linear Dynamics of Alpha-Band of the EEG and Organization of the Cortical Activity of P300 Wave	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						non-linear dynamics; chaos; correlation dimension; event-related potentials; P300	TOPOGRAPHY; COMPLEX	Variations of non-linear dynamic operations in of alpha-band of the EEG are reflected in the peculiarities of the P300 wave cortical field organization. In high-dimensional chaotic processes this field is characterized with high values of integral indices of its activity, the spatial synchronization of generating process as well as with the prevalence of P3a wave generation. The diversity of spatial combinations of P-wave sources reflects the high rate of their spatial complexity organization. The main contribution into this activity is made by symmetrical points of anterior and temporal cortical portions. In low-dimensional dynamics the spatial structure of the positive wave is simplified. It becomes less global and more differentiated. P3b wave generation prevails in this case. The values of integral indices of wave cortical field activity are reduced. The focal topography of positive waves and their sources changes. Chaotic systems of alpha-band wave generators demonstrate good controllability and high plasticity in contingent acoustic stimulation. They change their dynamic characteristics due to biofeedback control, determining thereby P-wave field organization.	[Mogilevsky, A.

J	Garcell, JR; Medina, WR				Ricardo Garcell, Josefina; Rueda Medina, Walfred			Electroencephalogram and event related potentials in obsessive compulsive disorder	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; P300; frequency analysis	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MATTER ABNORMALITIES; EEG	The obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a diverse and multidimensional psychiatric syndrome, characterized by obsess ions and compulsions, where anxiety is considered to be a key clinical component. Imaging studies have shown brain abnormalities in patients with OCD involving mainly the frontotemporal circuits, the orbitofrontal and the anterior cingulate cortex. These techniques have a high spatial resolution to identify brain alterations in this disorder but have less time resolution and are more expensive than electrophysiological studies. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) are the most common electrophysiological techniques used in the research of OCD. The EEG represents the electrical activity of the brain as recorded by electrodes placed on the scalp. The ERPs are voltage fluctuations that are temporarily linked to the presence of a physical or mental event. The best-known type of EEG is the "traditional EEG" (analyzed by visual inspection), which is characterized by the presence and topographic distribution of four frequency bonds: delta (delta), theta (theta), alfa (alpha), and beta (beta). The delta and theta bands are identified as slow activities while the alpha and beta bands are known as fast activities. The slow activity has been referred to as the most common abnormality in OCID, specially in the theta band. Moreover, the Broad Band Spectral Parameters (BBSPs) have contributed, for more than two decades, to the study of psychiatric patients and their values con be presented in a compact form as a topographic map on the scalp (Brain Mapping in the frequency domain). The Absolute Power (AP) and the Relative Power (RP) are the most common BBSPs used. Is difficult to determine if AP is abnormal at certain age due to the fad that AP values vary with age. To solve it, it is suggested to transform AP's values, in every band, into Z values which indicate how close is the subject to the average values of normal individuals of the some age. Since abnormal increases and decreases have been described in the anterior brain regions by the slow bands (delta and theta) and the fast bands (alpha and beta), some authors have considered inconsistent the alterations that have been observed with the BBSPs. Nevertheless, in accordance with traditional EEG studies, other authors have confirmed the excess of theta activity in patients with OCD. Of special interest for the clinical practice is that some authors have demonstrated, using the BBSPs, the existence of two OCD patients subgroups, which were homogeneous from the clinical point of view: one group with an excess of theta in the RP values, specially in the frontal and fronto-temporal regions, and a significative increase of a RP values for the other group. Eighty per cent of the patients of the first subgroup did not improved with selective serotonine reuptake, inhibitors treatment, whereas 82.4% of the patients of the second group improved. These results were confirmed ten years later and the a RP excess, present in those patients who improved, decreased after three months of treatment. However, it must be reminded that the generator of abnormal brain electrical activity, could be originate in a distant place to the location shown by the scalp electrodes. LORETA and VARETA are two methods used to calculate the origin of the generators above mentioned. The first investigation using LORETA was published in 2005, and it was observed that compared to controls, the OCD group showed an excess of beta activity in the cingulate gyrus (mainly in the middle cingulate gyrus), as well as in the adjacent frontal, parietal and occipital regions. Two years later, in another EEG sources study, but using VARETA, has been found an excess of alpha activity with abnormal EEG sources located in the striatum and in the orbito-frontal and temporo-frontal regions, which decreased after successful treatment with paroxetine. Therefore, it is also heartening to confirm, through the study of generators of the EEG, a result of great clinical value previously proved with BBSPs. The ERPs are divided into two types: exogenous and endogenous. In this paper we shall refer to the endogenous or cognitive type which depends on the nature of the interaction between the subject and the stimulus, so it will vary with attention, relevance of the task and the processing required. The ERPs are small voltage fluctuations that are identified by their latency (time of appearance in milliseconds), its amplitude (voltage in microvolts) and its polarity (positive or negative voltage). Among the most characteristic ERPs components are the N200 and the P300. In most cases these components are elicited through a classical "oddball" paradigm, in which an infrequent stimulus ("target") is randomly interspersed within an ongoing train of a different repeating stimulus ("standard"). There are at least two subcomponents of the P300: a frontal/central maximum amplitude component, the P3a that appears after the occurrence of unexpected distracters, regardless of its relevance for the task and represents an orienting response. The other one is the P3b, which has been more studied, it has a central/parietal distribution and evaluates attention and working memory. The N200 component has been linked to the automatic and voluntary process of identification and categorization of the stimuli. In patients with OCD there have been described shorter latencies and larger amplitudes for the P3b and N200 components, suggesting hyperarousal of the cortex and overfocused attention. However, there have also been described shorter amplitudes and larger latencies for the P300 component in the frontal regions, which have been related to an impairment of working memory or attention. Some authors have observed an inverse correlation between the N200 amplitude and the severity of the symptoms as well as a positive correlation between this variable and the response to treatment with selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors, but others have pointed out that patients that respond to treatment have a lower N200 amplitude, a larger P300 amplitude and a N200 and P300 shorter latencies. As for the possible association between the ERPs and the disease's evolution time, there has been a positive correlation between the N200 amplitude and the chronicity of the disorder. It has also been found that the amplitude of the P300 component is positively associated with the severity of symptoms assessed by the Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale. Finally, it can be considered that, from a clinical point of view, patients with OCD have the feeling that "something is not right" or "of having committed an omission" when it has not been committed, and "get caught" on excessive verification responses when an error mistake has happened. That phenomenological consideration has been associated to an alteration of the action monitoring process, which represents one of the executive functions mediated by the frontal regions, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, which may be "hyperactive" OCD patients when they have the feeling of having made a mistake. The action monitoring process has been evaluated in patients with OCD through an ERP component called "Error-related Negativity" (ERN). The ERN is a negative wave around the 50-150 ms, which appears after the subject committed an error or thinks it has been done. In an ERN study it was found greater ERN amplitudes in the frontal regions in subjects with high obsessivity rates compared to subjects with low obsessivity ones, which is consistent with the hyperactivity hypothesis of the fronto-temporal system proposed for this disorder and is according to the theory that patients with OCD show an increase of the monitoring function when a mistake has been done. However, there are authors who have not found differences in the NRE between healthy subjects and patients with OCD under pharmacological treatment, but they have observed a significant negative association between the ERN amplitude and the severity of the disorder. Hajcak et al. 2008, noticed an amplitude ERN increase in a group of subjects with pediatric OCD compared with the control group, which is consistent with ERN adult studies. In addition, since the ERN was not associated with the symptom severity or the response to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, that is why this alteration of the ERN could be a trait-like marker. Based on the foregoing, these researchers suggested that the increase in the amplitude of the NRE could be considered as an endophenotype. The EEG and ERPs con do an important contribution, in conjunction with clinical and imaging studies, to the identification of the structures and circuits involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. In addition, there are several evidences to support the utility of these electrophysiological techniques as complementary studies in the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with OCD.

Design: Qualitative literature review of the neuroimaging, balance testing, electrophysiology, blood marker and concussion literature. Intervention: PubMed and Medline databases were reviewed for investigations used in the management of adult and paediatric concussion, including structural imaging (computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging), functional imaging (single photon emission computerised tomography, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), spectroscopy (magnetic resonance spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy), balance testing (Balance Error Scoring System, Sensory Organization Test, gait testing, virtual reality), electrophysiological tests (electroencephalography, evoked potentials, event related potentials, magnetoencephalography, heart rate variability), genetics (apolipoprotein E4, channelopathies) and blood markers (S100, neuron-specific enolase, cleaved Tau protein, glutamate). Results: For the adult and paediatric populations, each test has been classified as being: (1) clinically useful, (2) a research tool only or (3) not useful in sports-related concussion. Conclusions: The current status of the diagnostic tests and investigations is analysed, and potential directions for future research are provided. Currently, all tests and investigations, with the exception of clinical balance testing, remain experimental. There is accumulating research, however, that shows promise for the future clinical application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in sport concussion assessment and management.	[Davis, G.

In this study, we investigated whether electroencephalogram (EEG) GBA, and its phase synchronization between electrodes, is necessary for the formation of nonobject higher-order cognitive representations, using both repetition and homophone priming tasks. In a repetition priming task, the formation of orthographic, phonological, and semantic representations is promoted by a prime word, whereas in the homophone priming task, the formation of only phonological representations is promoted. In the present study, the lexical processing of a target word induced GBA. In the repetition priming task, induced GBA and phase synchronization were decreased by presentation of the prime word (i. e., a repetition suppression effect) within both 200 300 msec and 400-500 msec time windows. In the homophone priming task, the repetition suppression effect was observed only within the 400-500 msec time window. The fact that repetition suppression effects were found in both priming tasks indicates that GBA and phase synchronization are necessary for the formation of phonological and semantic representations of a word. These results also suggest that formation of orthographic and higher-order cognitive representations occurred over different time courses.

Tph2 gene variants modulate response control processes in adult ADHD patients and healthy individuals	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						imaging genetics; NoGo-anteriorization; endophenotypes; tryptophan hydroxylase; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; serotonin	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE-2 GENE; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE FUNCTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; DEPLETION; BRAIN; DISINHIBITION	Although therapeutic interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) still focus on the dopaminergic system, recent studies indicate a serotonergic dysfunction in this disease as well. In that respect, several variants of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH2), which codes for the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-HT), have been associated with ADHD. The rs4570625 G-allele polymorphisms of the TPH2 gene have already been related to altered reactivity of the brain during perception tasks with emotional stimuli in healthy adults. Here we investigated the influence of the ADHD related risk alleles for rs4570625 and for rs11178997 on prefrontal brain function during cognitive response control in large samples of adult ADHD patients (n = 124) and healthy controls (n = 84). Response control was elicited with a Go-NoGo task (continuous performance test; CPT) performed during recording of an ongoing EEG. From the resulting event-related potentials in the Go-and NoGo conditions of the CPT, the NoGo-anteriorization (NGA) has been calculated as a valid neurophysiological parameter for prefrontal brain function. In the current study, ADHD risk alleles of both polymorphisms were found to be associated with a reduction in the NGA in both healthy controls and ADHD patients. These findings are in line with the notion that genetic variations associated with altered serotonergic neurotransmission are also associated with the function of the prefrontal cortex during response inhibition. This mechanism might also be relevant in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Molecular Psychiatry (2009) 14, 1032-1039; doi:10.1038/mp.2008.39; published online 22 April 2008	[Baehne, C.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Psychophysiological insomnia; Arousal; Inhibition; Event-related potentials; Sleep efficiency; Sleep quality	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; ONSET PERIOD; EEG ACTIVITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INVENTORY; DEFICITS	Introduction: Our recent ERPs study suggested inhibition deficits in addition to cortical arousal in insomnia sufferers (INS) relative to good sleepers (GS). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between objective sleep parameters and the amplitudes and latencies of ERPs components N1 and P2 in a multi-assessment protocol. Methods: Participants, 15 INS and 16 GS, underwent four consecutive nights of polysomnography recordings (N1 to N4). ERPs in the evening and upon awakening were recorded on N3 and N4. with the addition of sleep-onset recordings on N4. Auditory stimuli consisted of 'standard' and 'deviant' tones. Objective sleep measures were computed on each night [sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST) and sleep-onset latency (SOL)]. The amplitude and latency of N1 and P2 components were assessed for each recorded session on each night and related to measures of sleep of the same nights (N3 and N4). Results: Pearson's correlations between the amplitude and latency of N1 and P2 and objective sleep measures revealed that arousal levels in the evening, before going to bed seem to have an impact on subsequent sleep quality. Furthermore, the sleep quality of the previous night also appeared to have an impact on morning (daily) arousal levels. Conclusion: These results suggest that hyperactivation and inhibition deficits present in insomnia sufferers are directly associated with a poorer sleep quality. This highlights once again that when information processing and/or performance is assessed, the sleep quality of the night preceding the evaluation shall be documented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The longitudinal gradiometer of the sensor unit which presents most prominent SEF was selected on which each single-trial recording was decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The correlation between each IMF of the selected channel and raw data on other channels were created and represented as a spatial map. The sensorimotor-related IMFs with corresponding correlational spatial map exhibiting large values on primary sensorimotor area (SMI) were selected via spatial-template matching process. Trial-specific alpha and beta bands were determined in sensorimotor-related oscillatory activities using a two-spectrum comparison between the spectra obtained from baseline period (-4 to -3 s) and movement-onset period (-0.5 to 0.5 s). Sensorimotor-related oscillatory activities were filtered within the trial-specific frequency bands to resolve task-related oscillatory activities. Results demonstrated that the optimal phase and amplitude information were preserved not only for alpha suppression (event-related desynchronization) and beta rebound (event-related synchronization) but also for profound analysis of subtle dynamics across trials. The retention of high SNR in the extracted oscillatory activities allow various methods of source estimation that can be applied to study the intricate brain dynamics of motor control mechanisms. The present study enables the possibility of investigating cortical pathophysiology of movement disorder on a trial-by-trial basis which also permits an effective alternative for participants or patients who can not endure lengthy procedures or are incapable of sustaining long experiments.

Although collectively labelled 'the Basal Temporal Language Area' (BTLA), these territories are functionally heterogeneous and are involved in language perception (i.e. reading or semantic task) or language production (speech arrest after stimulation). The objective of this Study was to clarify the role of BTLA in the language network in air epileptic patient who displayed jargonaphasia. Methods: Intracerebral evoked related potentials to verbal and non-verbal stimuli in auditory and visual modalities were recorded from BTLA. Time-frequency analysis was perfomed during ictal events. Results: Evoked potentials and induced gamma-band activity provided direct evidence that BTLA is sensitive to language stimuli in both modalities, 350 ms after stimulation. In addition, spontaneous gammaband discharges were recorded from this region during which we observed phonological jargon. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the multimodal nature of this region in speech perception. In the context of transient dysfunction, the patient's lexical semantic processing network is disrupted, reducing spoken output to meaningless phoneme combinations. Significance: This rare opportunity to study the BTLA "in vivo" demonstrates its pivotal role in lexicosemantic processing for speech production and its multimodal nature in speech perception.

Enhanced gamma-band activity in ADHD patients lacks correlation with memory performance found in healthy children	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						40 Hz; Dopamine; Encoding; Gamma activity; Polymorphism; Oscillations	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER GENE; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; VISUAL-DISCRIMINATION TASK; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; D-4 RECEPTOR GENE; HUMAN SCALP EEG	Previous electrophysiological as well as imaging research has contributed to the understanding of impairments in attention, executive functions, and memory in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, there is a lack of studies investigating ADHD related differences in the gamma range of human electroencephalogram (EEG), although gamma activity is strongly associated with cognitive processes impaired in ADHD patients and is also modulated by dopamine polymorphisms linked with ADHD. To close this gap, the present study compared gamma activity in ADHD children with that of healthy controls and correlated it with memory performance. EEG was recorded from 13 ADHD patients as well as 13 healthy control subjects during the encoding phase of a visual memory paradigm. In a subsequent recognition test, participants had to judge pictures as being old or new. Analysis of evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs) during stimulus encoding revealed a strong task-related enhancement for ADHD patients in parieto-occipital areas. Interestingly, this augmentation was not associated with recognition performance, whereas healthy subjects exhibited a strong positive correlation between evoked gamma activity during stimulus encoding and subsequent recognition performance. We interpret this finding as evidence of enhanced excitation levels and unspecific activation of processing resources in ADHD patients. Furthermore, enhanced GBRs in ADHD could also indicate a decrease of neuronal signal-to-noise ratio, partially caused by the genetic variations within the dopaminergic pathway of ADHD patients. The involved genetic polymorphisms have been shown to modulate evoked GBRs, which therefore could be a possible marker of impaired neurotransmission in ADHD. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These deficits are evident in the prepulse inhibition- (PPI) and habituation of the auditory startle response paradigm, the paired tone paradigm in the EEG, and the peak recovery function of auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Administration of NMDA receptor antagonists reliably disrupts PPI and habituation of the startle, but not gating of AEPs in rodents. In the peak recovery paradigm, patients with schizophrenia and primates treated with NMDA receptor antagonists show reduced maximal response at long interstimulus intervals (ISI), but normal responses at short ISIs. Thus reduced NMDA receptor signalling may underlie alterations in these paradigms observed in schizophrenia. We tested the paradigms mentioned in mouse mutants with reduced expression of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (N = 15) and their wild- type littermates (N = 16). The NR1 mutant mice showed impaired habituation and PPI of the auditory startle response, as well as impaired gating in the paired tone paradigm. Deficits between the two gating measures did not correlate, corroborating previous evidence that these paradigms measure distinct processes. In the peak recovery paradigm, the NR1 mutants showed increased responses of the AEPs P1 and N1 at short ISIs but no difference between groups were observed at long ISIs. In conclusion, the NR1 hypomorphic mice modelled sensory and sensorimotor gating and startle habituation deficits observed in schizophrenia, but failed to model alterations in the peak recovery function.

A potential BCI application is that patients may control a neuro-prosthetic robot directly from their brain so that they can achieve virtual interaction with environment. Therefore, a BCI supports multi-dimensional control is highly demanded for a multi-dimensional robot. We hypothesized that human intentions to move his right, left hand, leg and tongue can be detected by the somatotopic spatial activation patterns from single-trial MEG signal. Under reliable detection, human can intentionally control a two-dimensional robotic motion; right, left, up and down. The hypothesis was tested offline; the classification was performed on beta band activation (15-30Hz) of SAM virtual channels. Cross-validation results using linear discrimination provided high detection accuracy (70-90%) when considering a random level of 25%. We demonstrated that noninvasive BCI methods may support reliable multi-dimensional control of neuro-prosthetic robotics.

In the last few years, P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have proven an effective and reliable means of communication for people with severe motor disabilities Such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite this fact, relatively few individuals have benefited from Currently available BCI technology. Independent BCI use requires easily acquired, good-quality electroencephalographic (EEG) signals maintained over long periods in less-than-ideal electrical environments. Conventional, wet-sensor, electrodes require careful application. Faulty or inadequate preparation, noisy environments, or gel evaporation can result in poor signal quality. Poor signal quality produces poor User performance, system downtime, and user and caregiver frustration. This study demonstrates that a hybrid city electrode sensor array (HESA) performs as well as traditional wet electrodes and may help propel BCI technology to a widely accepted alternative mode of communication.

Such a stimulus provides a unique opportunity for understanding the neural basis of visual perception because it dissociates the perception from the visual input. In this paper, we focus on extracting the percept-related features from the local field potential (LFP) in monkey visual cortex for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) perception. Our proposed feature extraction approach consists of two stages. First, we estimate and remove from each LFP trial the nonpercept-related stimulus-evoked activity via a local regression method called the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing because of the dissociation between the perception and the stimulus in our experimental paradigm. Second, we use the common spatial patterns approach to design spatial filters based on the residue signals of multiple channels to extract the percept-related features. We exploit a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We apply the proposed approach to the multichannel intracortical LFP data collected from the middle temporal (MT) visual cortex in a macaque monkey performing an SFM task. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in extracting the discriminative features of the percept-related activity from LFP and achieves excellent decoding performance. We also find that the enhanced gamma band synchronization and reduced alpha and beta band desynchronization may be the underpinnings of the percept-related activity.

Environmental novelty is signaled by reduction of the hippocampal theta frequency	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampus; EEG; acetylcholine; exploration; rat; associative mismatch	HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; NONSPATIAL CHANGES; PHASE PRECESSION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; BEHAVING RAT	The hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in novelty detection, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Novelty detection aids the encoding of new information into memory-a process thought to depend on the HE and to be modulated by the theta rhythm of EEG. We examined EEG recorded in the HF of rats foraging for food within a novel environment, as it became familiar over the next five days, and in two more novel environments unexpectedly experienced in trials interspersed with familiar trials over three further days. We found that environmental novelty produces a sharp reduction in the theta frequency of foraging rats, that this reduction is greater for an unexpected environment than for a completely novel one, and that it slowly disappears with increasing familiarity. These results do not reflect changes in running speed and suggest that the septo-hippocampal system signals unexpected environmental change via a reduction in theta frequency. In addition, they provide evidence in support of a cholinergically mediated mechanism for novelty detection, have important implications for our understanding of oscillatory coding within memory and for the interpretation of event-related potentials, and provide indirect support for the oscillatory interference model of grid cell firing in medial entorhinal cortex.

Semantic processing of mathematical gestures	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Mathematics; N400; Gestures; EEG; Semantics; Language	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ACTION RECOGNITION; ICONIC GESTURES; SPEECH; SENTENCES; LANGUAGE; INTEGRATION; NUMBER; FMRI	Objective: To examine whether or not university mathematics students semantically process gestures depicting mathematical functions (mathematical gestures) similarly to the way they process action gestures and sentences. Semantic processing was indexed by the N400 effect. Results: The N400 effect elicited by words primed with mathematical gestures (e.g. "converging" and "decreasing") was the same in amplitude, latency and topography as that elicited by words primed with action gestures (e.g. drive and lift), and that for terminal words of sentences. Significance and conclusion: Findings provide a within-subject demonstration that the topographies of the gesture N400 effect for both action and mathematical words are indistinguishable from that of the standard language N400 effect. This suggests that mathematical function words are processed by the general language semantic system and do not appear to involve areas involved in other mathematical concepts (e.g. numerosity).

In order to analyze scattering processes at the level of elementary particles Werner Heisenberg proposed the use of the so-called S-Matrix to understand nuclear interactions by studying ingoing at outgoing particles. Later, Richard Feynman developed useful schemes in order to visualize processes of elementary particle interactions. In the present report a metaphor to Feynman Diagrams is developed in order to model the "Ongoing Brain Activity and Event Related Oscillations". The response susceptibility of the brain shows a probabilistic causality similar to uncertain processes in elementary particle physics. A new grammar called Brain Feynman Diagrams is proposed in order to show brain oscillatory responses as a more visible construct in comparison to conventional compound brain potentials.

The current article describes the most important questioning techniques, the Control or Comparison Question Test and the Guilty Knowledge Test, and evaluates their psychometric quality especially with respect to the validity of autonomic physiological measures. Furthermore, recent advantages in this field that mainly concern the application of electroencephalographic and neuroimaging techniques are highlighted and critically discussed. Whereas these latter methods are currently not sufficiently elaborated for practical use, the Guilty Knowledge Test could be implemented in the field as a scientifically accepted test that yields high validity coefficients even on the basis of autonomic measures.

Current models assume that switch costs are located either at the perceptual stage or at the response selection stage. Contrary to this assumption, Hsieh and Liu ([2005. The nature of switch cost: task set configuration or carry-over effect? Cogn. Brain Res. 22,165-1751) found that task switching affects the response-locked lateralized readiness potential and thus provided evidence for a motor locus of switch costs. We hypothesized that this finding may have been due to methodological artefacts. In order to test this hypothesis, we replicated the experiment by Hsieh and Liu (2005) but avoided some potential methodological artefacts of their study. Our results showed a clear effect of task switching on the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential but no effect on the response-locked lateralized readiness potential. Thus, the present study questions the evidence for a late, motor locus of task switch effects but rather indicates a locus at the response selection stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We suggest a novel approach based on a semi-parametric model. This has two components, a parametric component describing known physical characteristics and a more flexible non-parametric component. The latter avoids the need for a detailed model for the sensor, which is often costly to produce and lacking in robustness. We assess our approach using an analysis of electroencephalographic images contaminated by eye-blink artefacts and highly damaged photographs contaminated by non-uniform lighting. These experiments show that our approach provides an effective solution to problems of this type. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Everitt, R. G.; Glendinning, R.

Given the multimodal nature of communication in the classroom a key issue concerns whether the various semiotic resources exploited in teaching produce matching interpretations or not. In this study we used electroencephalography to investigate the effect of gestures on brain activity related to semantic processing. University students were presented with gestures followed by written words and indicated whether there was a semantic match or not. Results show that mathematical gestures produced similar brain activity to that elicited by other gestures and language, demonstrating that they are semantically meaningful and integrated into linguistic semantic processing. Possible didactical consequences for the mathematics classroom are briefly considered.	[Arzarello, Ferdinando] Univ Torino, Turin, Italy; [Thomas, Michael I.

Towards Emotion Aware Computing: a study of Arousal Modulation with Multichannel Event-Related Potentials, Delta Oscillatory Activity and Skin Conductivity Responses	8TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering	OCT 08-10, 2008	Athens, GREECE	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc				Emotion identification has recently been considered as a key element in contemporary studies for advanced human-computer interaction. The achievement of this goal is usually attempted via methods incorporating facial expression and speech recognition, as well as, human motion analysis. In this paper it is attempted to fuse multi-modal physiological signals of the autonomic (skin conductance) and central nervous systems (EEG), through the use of appropriate feature extraction procedures discriminating emotional arousal modulations, to a neural network classifier. Thus, skin conductivity responses, evoked-related potential peaks, and delta frequency oscillatory patterns are analyzed for a comparatively large number of subjects exposed to different emotions, evoked by pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. The achieved neural network classifications were encouraging. It was found that fear was successfully differentiated (100%), pleasant emotions differing in their arousal level were well distinguished (80%), but the discrimination of low arousing negative feelings such as melancholy was more difficult (70%). It is argued that physiological patterning of multimodal recordings may successfully contribute to the enhancement of human computer interaction and emotion aware computing.

Communicative impairments in autism are a core feature of the disorder, and a rapidly expanding literature is exploring language in autism using the tools of cognitive neuroscience, particularly electroencephalography and brain imaging. Recent research indicates consistent differences in the degree to which language-specific processes are lateralized in the brain, and it also suggests that language impairments are linked to differences in brain structure that may lead to inefficient coordination of activity between different neural assemblies to achieve a complex cognitive task, defined as functional connectivity. We review findings from current work and suggest that neurobiological data are critical in our ability to understand the mechanisms underlying behavioral differences in communicative skills. Going beyond simple dichotomies between delayed versus deviant development, we can use such data to ask whether behavior reflects processes that are merely inefficient or, instead, whether impairments at the behavioral level reflect fundamental differences in brain organization and the networks involved in various tasks.

The sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), an electrophysiological marker of storage in VSTM, was measured for words and nonwords as well as scrambled letters. A smaller SPCN was found for words than for nonwords (independently of their pronounceability), indicating that lexical status influences storage in VSTM. One possibility is that words produce a smaller SPCN because they can be recoded to a form that does not require a low-level representation in VSTM. For exploratory purpose, a comparison between the nonwords and the scrambled nonwords was also made. Based on previous research, the SPCN component should not be affected by the size of the region enclosing to-be-encoded objects. Surprisingly, significant differences between the SPCN for nonwords and scrambled letters conditions were found, suggesting that special encoding mechanisms may be recruited to encode word-like letter strings.

Differential Recruitment of Anterior Intraparietal Sulcus and Superior Parietal Lobule during Visually Guided Grasping Revealed by Electrical Neuroimaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reaching; motor cognition; event-related potentials; human; brain microstates; brain plasticity	ONLINE ADJUSTMENTS; MOVEMENTS; ACTIVATION; EXECUTION; DISRUPTS	Dorsal parietal cortex is required for visually guided prehension. Transcranial magnetic stimulation to either the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) or superior parietal lobule (SPL) disrupts on-line adaptive adjustments of grasp when objects are perturbed. We used high-density electroencephalography during grasping to determine the relative timing of these two areas and to test whether the temporal contribution of each site would change when the task goal was perturbed. During object grasping with the right-hand, two distinct evoked responses were present over the 50-100 and 100-200 ms periods after movement onset. Distributed linear source estimation of these scalp potentials localized left lateralized sources, first in the aIPS and then the SPL. The duration of the response from the aIPS area was longer when there was an object perturbation. Initiation of a corrective movement coincided with activation in SPL. These data support a two-stage process: the integration of target goal and an emerging action plan within aIPS and subsequent on-line adjustments within SPL.

In order to study the pathophysiology of this, we have investigated auditory event-related potentials (AERP) and their relation to cognitive function in diabetes patients. AERP was recorded in patients with type I diabetes (n = 119) and in a healthy control group (n = 61). AERP was obtained with an odd-ball and a two-stimulus paradigm. Cognitive function was evaluated in 10 domains in the patients. Patients had normal N100 latency, but a highly significant decrease in auditory N100 amplitude (p < 10(-6)), which correlated with a decrease in psychomotor speed but not with function in other domains. Psychomotor speed also correlated with P300 amplitude, although P300 amplitude was only slightly decreased in the patients. Even stronger correlations were found with the parietal N100-P300 peak-to-peak amplitude, which correlated both to psychomotor speed (rho = 0.61, p < 10(-7)) and processing speed (p < 0.005). P300 latency was increased in patients, and this correlated to low global cognitive score and older age. We conclude that the decline in psychomotor speed in type I diabetes is associated with a highly significant decrease in the auditory N100 peak amplitude. This association and the relatively small abnormality in P300 latency is quite different from those generally found in dementia, and suggest that the underlying defect is located in the brain stem or the white matter. Presumably small conduction defects in ascending fibers can distort the firing synchrony necessary for signal generation in the cortex. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kaan, E; Barkley, CM; Bao, M; Wayland, R				Kaan, Edith; Barkley, Christopher M.; Bao, Mingzhen; Wayland, Ratree			Thai lexical tone perception in native speakers of Thai, English and Mandarin Chinese: An event-related potentials training study	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-CORTEX; DISCRIMINATION; LANGUAGE; PLASTICITY; BRAIN; SOUND; LISTENERS; CONTRASTS; PATTERNS	Background: Tone languages such as Thai and Mandarin Chinese use differences in fundamental frequency (F-0, pitch) to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that native speakers of a non-tone language have difficulty discriminating among tone contrasts and are sensitive to different F-0 dimensions than speakers of a tone language. The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the effect of language background and training on the non-attentive processing of lexical tones. EEG was recorded from 12 adult native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, 12 native speakers of American English, and 11 Thai speakers while they were watching a movie and were presented with multiple tokens of low-falling, mid-level and high-rising Thai lexical tones. High-rising or low-falling tokens were presented as deviants among mid-level standard tokens, and vice versa. EEG data and data from a behavioral discrimination task were collected before and after a two-day perceptual categorization training task. Results: Behavioral discrimination improved after training in both the Chinese and the English groups. Low-falling tone deviants versus standards elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in all language groups. Before, but not after training, the English speakers showed a larger MMN compared to the Chinese, even though English speakers performed worst in the behavioral tasks. The MMN was followed by a late negativity, which became smaller with improved discrimination. The High-rising deviants versus standards elicited a late negativity, which was left-lateralized only in the English and Chinese groups. Conclusion: Results showed that native speakers of English, Chinese and Thai recruited largely similar mechanisms when non-attentively processing Thai lexical tones. However, native Thai speakers differed from the Chinese and English speakers with respect to the processing of late F-0 contour differences (high-rising versus mid-level tones). In addition, native speakers of a non-tone language (English) were initially more sensitive to F-0 onset differences (low-falling versus mid-level contrast), which was suppressed as a result of training. This result converges with results from previous behavioral studies and supports the view that attentive as well as non-attentive processing of F-0 contrasts is affected by language background, but is malleable even in adult learners.

The time course of action and action-word comprehension in the human brain as revealed by neurophysiology	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Review						EEG; MEG; TMS; action; action-words; word recognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LANGUAGE; SPEECH; MIRROR; REPRESENTATION; FACILITATION; RECOGNITION	Numerous previous neuroimaging studies suggest an involvement of cortical motor areas not only in action execution but also in action recognition and understanding. Motor areas of the human brain have also been found to activate during the processing of written and spoken action-related words and sentences. Even more strikingly, stimuli referring to different bodily effectors produced specific somatotopic activation patterns in the motor areas. However, metabolic neuroimaging results can be ambiguous with respect to the processing stage they reflect. This is a serious limitation when hypotheses concerning linguistic processes are tested, since in this case it is usually crucial to distinguish early lexico-semantic processing from strategic effects or mental imagery that may follow lexico-semantic information access. Timing information is therefore pivotal to determine the functional significance of motor areas in action recognition and action-word comprehension. Here, we review attempts to reveal the time course of these processes using neurophysiological methods (EEG, MEG and TMS), in visual and auditory domains. We will highlight the importance of the choice of appropriate paradigms in combination with the corresponding method for the extraction of timing information. The findings will be discussed in the general context of putative brain mechanisms of word and object recognition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous studies reported an early (similar to 200 ms) right anterior negative component (ERAN) by traditional event-related-potential analysis during music-syntactical irregularities, vet little is known about the underlying oscillatory and synchronization properties of brain responses which are supposed to play a crucial role in general cognition including music perception. First we showed that the ERAN was primarily represented by low frequency (<8 Hz) brain oscillations. Further, we found that music-syntactical irregularities as compared with music-syntactical regularities, were associated with (i) an early decrease in the alpha band (9-10 Hz) phase synchronization between right fronto-central and left temporal brain regions, and (ii) a late (similar to 500 ms) decrease in gamma band (38-50 Hz) oscillations over fronto-central brain regions. These results indicate a weaker degree of long-range integration when the musical expectancy is violated. In summary, our results reveal neural mechanisms of music-syntactic processing that operate at different levels of cortical integration, ranging from early decrease in long-range alpha phase synchronization to late local gamma oscillations.

J	Kiefer, M; Sim, EJ; Herrnberger, B; Grothe, J; Hoenig, K				Kiefer, Markus; Sim, Eun-Jin; Herrnberger, Baerbel; Grothe, Jo; Hoenig, Klaus			The Sound of Concepts: Four Markers for a Link between Auditory and Conceptual Brain Systems	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						conceptual brain systems; auditory cortex; language; embodied cognition; fMRI; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; DISTRIBUTED ACCOUNT; SEMANTIC MEMORY; MUSICAL IMAGERY; MOTOR; KNOWLEDGE; CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION	Traditionally, concepts are conceived as abstract mental entities distinct from perceptual or motor brain systems. However, recent results let assume modality-specific representations of concepts. The ultimate test for grounding concepts in perception requires the fulfillment of the following four markers: conceptual processing during (1) an implicit task should activate (2) a perceptual region (3) rapidly and (4) selectively. Here, we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging and recordings of event-related potentials, that acoustic conceptual features recruit auditory brain areas even when implicitly presented through visual words. Fulfilling the four markers, the findings of our study unequivocally link the auditory and conceptual brain systems: recognition of words denoting objects, for which acoustic features are highly relevant (e. g.,"telephone"), ignited cell assemblies in posterior superior and middle temporal gyri (pSTG/MTG) within 150 ms that were also activated by sound perception. Importantly, activity within a cluster of pSTG/MTG increased selectively as a function of acoustic, but not of visual and action-related feature relevance. The implicitness of the conceptual task, the selective modulation of left pSTG/MTG activity by acoustic feature relevance, the early onset of this activity at 150 ms and its anatomical overlap with perceptual sound processing are four markers for a modality-specific representation of auditory conceptual features in left pSTG/MTG. Our results therefore provide the first direct evidence for a link between perceptual and conceptual acoustic processing. They demonstrate that access to concepts involves a partial reinstatement of brain activity during the perception of objects.

Phenotypic and genetic correlations between evoked EEG/ERP measures during the response anticipation period of a delayed response task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha oscillations; Theta oscillations; Slow cortical potentials; Individual differences; Endophenotype	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; EEG ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN BRAIN; THETA RESPONSES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; HERITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; POWER	We investigated the relationship between three electrophysiological indices of response anticipation in a spatial delayed response task with a low and high memory load manipulation: a slow cortical potential (SCP), theta desynchronization, and upper alpha synchronization. Individual differences in these three measures were examined in 531 adult twins and siblings. Heritability of the SCP at occipital-parietal leads varied from 30% to 43%. Heritability of upper alpha synchronization (35% to 65%) and theta desynchronization (31% to 50%) was significant at all leads. Theta desynchronization and upper alpha synchronization were significantly correlated (r similar to 43%), but SCP was not correlated with either. The effect of working memory load on all three measures was not heritable. Response anticipation reliably evokes an SCP, upper alpha synchronization and theta desynchronization, but variation in these measures reflects different (genetic) sources.	[Smit, Dirk J.

Effects of rTMS on an auditory oddball task: a pilot study of cortical plasticity and the EEG	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						depression; electroencephaolgraphy; P300; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; 1 HZ RTMS; DOUBLE-BLIND; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DEPRESSION; CORRELATE	The objective of this study was to explore the effects of 1Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on both an EEG index of cortical excitation and inhibition, event-related desynchronization/ synchronization (ERD/S) and on the P300 component of an auditory oddball-induced ERP. Eight normal participants received 15 minutes of 1Hz rTMS at 110% of the resting motor threshold to right DLPFC. ERD/S of alpha and beta bands was measured during an auditory oddball task immediately before and after stimulation. There was significantly less alpha desynchronization post-TMS, and this effect was widespread excepting posterior midline sites. No changes were found to oddball-P300 amplitudes or latencies. In conclusion, the findings of less alpha desynchronization post-TMS are compatible with notions of slow rTMS causing a decrease in cortical excitation.	[Cooper, N. R.; Fitzgerald, P. B.; Upton, D.

Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is used for defining the level of sustained attention. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is applied on 19-channel recorded EEG and the best component is determined based on time, frequency and spatial specifications of the components. The ERPs are extracted for each group of stimuli and eighteen morphological features (including P3) were extracted. Nineteen subjects were divided into three groups according to their attention level. LDA classifier is then used for discrimination of classes. The results are compared with two other common methods. Classification based on the proposed method yields in accuracy of 81% with the advantage of preserving almost all the data. Outcomes represent a significant correlation between CPT result and some parameters of brain signal's components which can be used in evaluating the level of attention.

COGNITIVE EVOKED POTENTIALS IN REMITTING-RELAPSING AND BENIGN FORMS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Auditory oddball; Benign; ERPs; Multiple sclerosis; NI; P3; Remitting-relapsing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; IMPAIRMENT; DISEASE; INJURY; P300	Introduction. The assessment of the cognitive impairment in the multiple sclerosis disease is one of the most relevant challenges nowadays. An essential objective is to obtain diverse approaches that allow valuing objectively this impairment and its correlation with physiological variables. Aim. To analyze the possible modulations in physiological components of the information processing (ERPs) related with an attentional deficit in diverse classes of patients with multiple sclerosis. Subjects and methods. 17 patients with remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis, 9 patients with benign multiple scelerosis and 19 healthy subjects participate in the study. Behavioral performance in a visuo-spatial task (Posner paradigm) and later, an auditory oddball test was carried out where electroencephalography signal was registered to obtain ERPs. Correlation analyses were calculated between patient variables (EDSS or disease duration) and psychophysiological variables. Results. A delay in the reaction time during the development of the Posner task and a delay in the latency of the component P3 during the realization of the oddball task were found in both groups of patient with multiple sclerosis. Conclusion. The data obtained in this experiment confirm the presence of attentional impairment in patients with diverse forms of multiple sclerosis. The exclusive modulation of the P3 latency component suggests that the impairment in these patients, at the beginning of the disease, is localized at a central level of cognitive processing and is product of the demyelinating process.

The aim of the present study was the evaluation of initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) changes, induced by 900 MHz GSM exposure, in a double blind design in healthy volunteers, subjected to a threefold experimental condition, EXPOSED (A), a real GSM phone emitting electromagnetic power, SHAM (B), a real phone where the electromagnetic power was dissipated on an internal load and OFF (C), a phone completely switched-off. Ten healthy right-handed volunteers were evaluated. The CNV was recorded during a 10 min time interval in each of the three experimental conditions A, B, and C, in order to assess the iCNV amplitude and habituation. The iCNV amplitude decreased and habituation increased during both A and B conditions, compared with condition C. This effect was diffuse over the scalp, and there was no significant prevalence of iCNV amplitude reduction on the left side, were the phones were located. Mobile Phones exposures A and B seemed to act on brain electrical activity, reducing the arousal and expectation of warning stimulus. This evidence, limited by the low number of subjects investigated, could be explained in terms of an effect induced by both the GSM signal and the extremely low frequency magnetic field produced by battery and internal circuits.

Location and features of instructive spatial cues do not influence the time course of covert shifts of visual spatial attention	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						visual attention; human EEG; SSVEP; shifting of attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STEADY-STATE; EVOKED POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; ALLOCATION; SPOTLIGHT; VOLUNTARY; STIMULI	The time course of shifting visual spatial attention to flickering stimuli in the left and right visual hemifield was investigated. The goal was to test whether an instructive peripheral salient cue located close to the newly to-be-attended location triggers faster shifts per se compared to a central cue. Besides behavioural data an objective electrophysiological measure, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) was used to measure the time course of visual pathway facilitation in the human brain for centrally and peripherally cued shifts of spatial attention. Results revealed that both spatial cues resulted in identical time courses of shifts of covert spatial attention. This was true with respect to behavioural data and SSVEP amplitude. Results support the notion that a salient peripheral spatial cue does not automatically produce faster shifts of spatial attention to the to-be-attended location when this cue is informative and embedded in an ongoing stimulation.

The network consists of principal cells (pyramidal neurons) and local interneurons and uses GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. For pyramidal cells, this paper introduces a novel two-compartment model that was developed using published data and our own experimental data (intracellular recordings, in vitro). For interneurons, single-compartment models published elsewhere were implemented. The forward problem was solved to calculate the local field potential generated by the network. Our results show that: I) the 'reduced' model approach allows for simulations including a relatively large number of cells, ii) for appropriate changes in model-para meters (related to synaptic transmission), the model can generate "spike" events that closely resemble actual epileptic spikes and iii) some features of spike shape (amplitude, duration) can be explained by the degree of excitatory and inhibitory drive to pyramidal cells.

Predicting outcome in children with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Review						hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; prognosis; evoked potentials; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SEVERE BRAIN-INJURY; CARDIAC-ARREST; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; NEUROLOGIC PROGNOSIS; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; NONTRAUMATIC COMA; VEGETATIVE STATE; LIFE-SUPPORT; KING-COUNTY	Objective. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is common in children, and providing accurate and timely prognostic information is important in determining the appropriate level of care. While practice parameters are available for prognostication in adults, similar reviews are not available for children. This article reviews the current evidence in domains used to provide prognostic information in children with coma due to HIE. These include historical features of the event; physical exam signs; neurophysiologic studies, such as electroencephalogram and evoked potentials; and neuroimaging. Data Source: A literature search of MEDLINE was performed using the search terms HIE and prognosis cross-referenced in series with specific domains used to provide prognostic information, including physical examination, electroencephalogram, evoked potentials, neuroimaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. The results of these searches were scanned by the authors to identify articles pertaining to children (nonneonates). Further literature was identified from the reference lists of the literature identified by MEDLINE search. Clinical, preclinical, and review articles were identified that were related to the current understanding of prognosis in pediatric HIE. Only literature in English was reviewed. Results. When performed at least 24 hrs after the inciting event, abnormal exam signs (pupil reactivity and motor response), absent N20 waves bilaterally on somatosensory evoked potentials, electrocerebral silence or burst suppression patterns on electroencephalogram (not due to metabolic or medication etiology), and abnormal magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion restriction in the cortex and basal ganglia are each highly predictive of poor outcome. Combining these modalities improves the overall predictive value. Conclusions. All testing provides the best prognostic information several days after hypoxic-ischemic injury, and often multiple tests are required to improve prognostic ability and rule out potentially confounding conditions. Thus, when decisions can be postponed several days, neurologic consultation and testing can provide the best prognostic information to families.

J	Meng, LF; Lu, CP; Li, YW				Meng, Ling-Fu; Lu, Chiu-Ping; Li, Yi-Wen			Hemispheric lateralization of event-related brain potentials in different processing phases during unimanual finger movements	SENSORS			English	Article						lateralized behaviors; brain electrophysiology; unimanual movement; hemispheric dominance	DESYNCHRONIZATION; HANDEDNESS; FMRI; HAND; EEG	Previous functional MRI and brain electrophysiology studies have studied the left-right differences during the tapping tasks and found that the activation of left hemisphere was more significant than that of right hemisphere. In this study, we wanted to delineate this lateralization phenomenon not only in the execution phase but also in other processing phases, such as early visual, pre-executive and post-executive phases. We have designed a finger-tapping task to delineate the left-right differences of event related potentials (ERPs) to right finger movement in sixteen right handed college students. The mean amplitudes of ERPs were analyzed to examine the left-right dominance of cortical activity in the phase of early visual process (75-120ms), pre-execution (175-260ms), execution (310-420ms) and post-execution (420-620ms). In the execution phase, ERPs at the left electrodes were significantly more pronounced than those at the right electrodes (F3 > F4, C3 > C4, P3 > P4, O1 > O2) under the situation without comparing the central electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz). No difference was found between left and right electrodes in other three phases except the C3 electrode still showed more dominant than C4 in the pre- and post-execution phase.

Using the high temporal resolution of EEG, we investigated the relationship between prestimulus neuronal oscillations and the perceptibility of two competing somatosensory stimuli embedded in a backward masking paradigm. We identified two prestimulus EEG signatures predictive for a suprathreshold yet weak target stimulus to become perceptually resistant against masking by a stronger distractor stimulus: (i) over left frontal cortex a desynchronization of the regional beta rhythm (similar to 20 Hz) 500 msec prior to a perceived target, and (ii) a subsequent additional attenuation of both mu (similar to 10 Hz) and beta "idling'' rhythms over those pericentral sensorimotor cortices which are going to process the upcoming target stimulus. Furthermore, across subjects the probability for target perception strongly correlates with the individual absolute level of pre-target amplitudes in these frequency bands and locations. These signatures significantly differed from the EEG characteristics preceding detected and undetected single stimuli. We suggest that the early activation of left frontal areas involved in top-down attentional control is critical for preventing backward masking and leads the preparation of primary sensory cortices: The ensuing prestimulus suppression of sensory idling rhythms warrants an intensified poststimulus processing, and thus, effectively promotes conscious perception of suprathreshold target stimuli embedded into an ecologically relevant condition featuring competing environmental stimuli.

Effect of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on P300 of Event-Related Potential	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			EEG RESPONSES; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; INTENSITY; TMS	When the odd stimulation is presented, the positive component of electroencephalograph is induced at around 300 ms after the odd stimulation. This positive component is called P300. Many studies suggest that P300 may result from the summation of activity from multiple generators located in widespread cortical and subcortical areas. However, there is still no conclusive indication of the sources of P300. In this paper, we focus on the left supramaginal gyrus as one of the sources of P300. We investigated the temporal aspect of this area using TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). We investigated the relationship between the latency of the P300 and an effect of TMS when the left supramarginal gyrus was stimulated by TMS. In our previous study, we reported a method of removing stimulus artifact during TMS with Sample-and-Hold circuit and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity evoked by TMS could be measured successfully. In addition to this method, independent component analysis (ICA) was also applied to recorded EEG data in order to remove the stimulus artifact by off-line analysis. By using these methods, short latency (< 15 ms) EEG responses to TMS could be obtained. We stimulated the left supramarginal gyrus using a figure-eight coil during auditory oddball task. The TMS at 150 ms and 200 ms after the oddball sounds were presented. When the TMS was applied at 200 ms after the oddball stimulation, the peak response of P300 was delayed around 50 ms. Difference of the peak latency between the control measurement and the case of TMS applying at 150 ms was not significant. However, the differences of the peak latency of the control measurement and the peak latency of the measurement in the cases of TMS applying at 200 ms and 250 ms was significant (p<0.05). We considered that this delay was due to inhibiting to recognize the target stimulation.

While the "evoked theory" sees no interaction between VEP generation and the alpha rhythm, the "oscillatory theory" (also known as "phase-reset theory") postulates VEP generation to be based on alpha rhythm phase resetting. Previous experimental results are contradictory, rendering a straightforward interpretation difficult. Our approach was to theoretically model the implications of the evoked and oscillatory theory also incorporating stimulus-induced alpha-rhythm desynchronization. As a result, the model based on the oscillatory theory predicts alpha-band dependent VEP amplitudes but constant phase locking. The model based on the evoked theory predicts unaffected VEP amplitudes but alpha-band dependent phase locking. Subsequently, we analyzed experimental data in which VEPs were assessed in an "eyes open" and "eyes closed" condition in 17 subjects. For early components of the VEP, findings are in agreement with the evoked theory, i.e. VEP amplitudes remain unaffected and phase locking decreases during periods of high alpha activity. Late VEP component amplitudes (>175 ms), however, are dependent on pre-stimulus alpha amplitudes. This interaction is contradictory to the oscillatory theory since this VEP amplitude difference is not paralleled by a corresponding difference in alpha-band amplitude in the affected time window. In summary, by using a model-based approach we identified early VEPs to be compatible with the evoked theory, while results of late VEPs support a modulatory but not causative role - the latter implied by the oscillatory theory - of alpha activity for EP generation.

On how the motor cortices resolve an inter-hemispheric response conflict: an event-related EEG potential-guided TMS study of the flankers task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						flankers; lateralized readiness potential; motor control; motor-evoked potential; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ACTION SELECTION; CONTINUOUS-FLOW; SILENT PERIOD; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; COMPATIBILITY	An important aspect of human motor control is the ability to resolve conflicting response tendencies. Here we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to track the time course of excitability changes in the primary motor hand areas (M1(HAND)) while the motor system resolved response conflicts. Healthy volunteers had to respond fast with their right and left index fingers to right- and left-pointing arrows. These central target stimuli were preceded by flanking arrows, inducing premature response tendencies which competed with correct response activation. The time point of maximum premature activation was individually measured as peak latency of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in the EEG. In the subsequent TMS experiment, single pulses were applied to left or right M1(HAND) during the same flanker task. The amplitude of the motor evoked potentials in the contralateral first dorsal interosseus muscle was taken as an index of corticospinal excitability. Guided by the previous LRP measurement, magnetic stimuli were applied 0-90 ms after the individual LRP peak, to cover the epoch of conflict resolution. When flankers were incompatible with the target, excitability of the prematurely activated M1(HAND) gradually decreased during this 90 ms period. This decrease was paralleled by a mirror-symmetrical increase in excitability in the other M1(HAND). These results show that the inappropriate response tendency is cancelled in one M1(HAND) simultaneously with activation of the correct response in the other. This integrated implementation of response activation and cancellation at the level of the M1(HAND) presumably represents a downstream effect orchestrated by premotor brain regions.

In the process of drug development of "cognitive enhancers" for the treatment of schizophrenia, the usefulness of biomarkers is increasingly realized. In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of biomarkers and discuss its application with regard to drugs that are developed for the purpose of cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. While focussing on functional biomarkers, i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG), it will be clearly delineated what is currently feasible, what kind of limitations still exist and what needs to be done in the future to optimise the available functional biomarkers. In addition, those functional biomarkers are listed which are thought to qualify as biomarkers for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia or which are at least close to what one may call a valid biomarker for drug development.

The minimum number of error trials included in grand averages varies across studies; indeed, there has not been a systematic investigation on the number of trials required to obtain a stable ERN and Pe. In the current study, the ERN and Pe were quantified as two random trials were added to participants' (N=53) ERP averages. Adding trials increased the correlation with the grand average ERN and Pe; however, high correlations (rs >.80) were obtained with only 6 trials. Internal reliability of the ERN and Pe reached moderate levels after 6 and 2 trials and the signal-to-noise ratio of the ERN and Pe did not change after 8 and 4 trials, respectively. Combined, these data suggest that the ERN and Pe can be quantified using a minimum of between 6 and 8 error trials.

Human EEG very high frequency oscillations reflect the number of matches with a template in auditory short-term memory	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						40 Hz; auditory; EEG; frequency-modulated sound; gamma activity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; VISUAL-DISCRIMINATION TASK; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; MODULATED TONES; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; RESPONSES; STIMULI; PERCEPTION; PHASE	Auditory perception comprises bottom-up as well as top-down processes. While research in the past has revealed many neural correlates of bottom-up processes, less is known about top-down modulation. Memory processes have recently been associated with oscillations in the gamma-band of human EEG (30 Hz and above) which are enhanced when incoming information matches a stored memory template. Therefore, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) and gamma-band activity in 17 healthy participants in a Go/NoGo-task. They listened to four frequency-modulated (FM) sounds which varied regarding the frequency range traversed and the direction of frequency modulation. One sound was defined as target and required a button press. The results of ERPs (N1, P2, N2, and P3) were consistent with previous studies. Analysis of evoked gamma-band responses yielded no significant task-dependent modulation, but we observed a stimulus dependency, which was also present in a control experiment: The amplitude of evoked gamma responses showed an inverted U-shape as a function of stimulus frequency. Investigation of total gamma activity revealed functionally relevant responses at high frequencies (90 Hz to 250 Hz), which showed significant modulations by matches with STM: Complete matches led to the strongest enhancements (starting around 100 ms after stimulus onset) and partial matches resulted in intermediate ones. The results support the conclusion that very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs) are markers of active stimulus discrimination in STM matching processes and are attributable to higher cognitive functions.

Brain science: On the way to solving the problem of consciousness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Congress of Psychophysiology the Olympics of the Brain	SEP 08-13, 2008	St Petersburg, RUSSIA	Int Org Psychophysiol		Consciousness and brain problem; Event-related potentials; EEG rhythms; Semantic brain systems; Artificial intelligence	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; PERCEPTION; SYSTEMS; WORDS; DISSOCIATION; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS; HYPOTHESIS	Four issues are discussed: the possible mechanism of subjective events, conscious versus unconscious brain functions, the rhythmic coding of mental operations and the possible brain basis of understanding. i. Several approaches have been developed to explain how subjective experience emerges from brain activity. One of them is the return of the nervous impulses to the sites of their primary projections, providing a synthesis of sensory information with memory and motivation [Ivanitsky, A.M., 1976. Brain Mechanisms of the Signal Evaluation. Medicina, Moscow 264 pp. (in Russian)]. Support for the existence of such a mechanism stems from studies upon the brain activity that subserves perception (visual and somato-sensory) and thought (verbal and imaginative). The cortical centres for information synthesis have been found. For perception, these are located in projection areas: for thinking - in frontal and temporal-parietal associative cortex. Closely related ideas were also developed by G. Edelman [Edelman, G.M., 1978. Group selection and phasic reentrant signaling: A theory of higher brain function. In: Eds. Edelman, G.M., Mountcastle, V.B. The Mindful Brain. Cortical Organization and the Group-selective Theory of Higher Brain Function. Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, pp 51-100.] in his re-entry theory of consciousness. Both theories emphasize the key role of memory and motivation in the origin of conscious function. ii. Conscious experience elucidates not all, but only salient brain functions. As a rule, voluntary control is switched on when additional cognitive resources are needed. Even a rather complicated mental operation, such as the discrimination between concrete and abstract words, could be executed very rapidly and implicitly; explicit analysis being engaged only in more difficult tasks. Furthermore, these two different kinds of mental operations, i.e., automatic and conscious, are predominantly associated with two different kinds of memory: a recognition memory for implicit analysis, and an episodic memory for explicit functions. iii. Rearrangements of EEG rhythms underlie mental functions. Certain rhythmical patterns are related with definite types of mental activity. The dependence of one upon the other is rather pronounced and expressive, so it becomes possible to recognize the type of mental operation being performed in mind with few seconds of the ongoing EEG, provided that the analysis of rhythms is accomplished using an artificial neural network. iv. It is commonly recognized that the computer, in contrast to the living brain, can calculate, yet cannot understand [Penrose, R., 1996. Shadows of the Mind: A Search for,the Missing Science of Consciousness New York, Oxford, Oxford University Press 480 pp.]. Comprehension implies the comparison of new and old information that requires the ability to search for associations, grouping similar objects together, and distinguishing different objects from one another. However, these functions may also be implemented on a computer. Still, it is believed that computers perform these complicated operations without genuine understanding. Evidently, comprehension additionally has to be based upon some biologically significant ground. It is hypothesized that the subjective feeling of understanding appears when current information is attributed to a definite need, which is scaled in sign (+/-) coordinates. This coordinate system ceases the brain calculations, when "comprehension" is reached, i.e., the acceptable level of need satisfaction is attained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND EXCESS BETA ACTIVITY IN THE EEG	ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA			English	Article						Inter-modal oddball task; cognitive functions; perceptual functions		Background: This study investigated whether ERPs from an inter-modal oddball task could distinguish between two groups of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) of the combined type, with and without excess beta in their EEG, and controls. Material/Methods: Three age-matched groups of male children (20 typical AD/HD without excess beta, 20 AD/HD with excess beta, 20 controls) were presented with an inter-modal oddball task in which a counter-phasing checkerboard was the non-target visual sti mulus (randomly presented on 80% of trials), and a 2000 Hz tone was the auditory target (20% of trials). Stimuli were presented at a fixed rate (stimulus-onset asynchrony 1.03 s) and participants were required to silently count all targets. Results: Compared with controls, the AD/HD group without excess beta showed reduced P2 and P3 to auditory targets, topographic differences in target N1 and N2, and reduced P2 and P3 to visual non-targets, replicating previous AD/HD research. The AD/HD group with excess beta showed a general reversal of these effects in the auditory target N1, P2, N2, and P3, and visual non-target N1, P2 and P3, appearing similar to the control group. However, their visual non-target P1 was more aberrant than that of the other AD/HD group. Conclusions: These results suggest that the children with excess beta do not demonstrate the impaired discrimination and categorization usually noted in children with AD/HD of the combined type. Further research on the cognitive and perceptual functioning of EEG-defined subgroups of AD/HD is warranted.

It can be hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) manages repetitive stimuli in routine conditions and alerts the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) when stimulation unexpectedly changes. To provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis, intracerebral stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) data were recorded from the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral PFC of eight epileptic patients in a standard Visual oddball task during presurgical monitoring. Two types of stimuli (200 ms duration) such as the letters O (frequent stimuli; 80% of probability) and X (rare stimuli) were presented in random order, with an interstimulus interval between 2 and 5 s. Subjects had to mentally count the rare (target) stimuli and to press a button with their dominant hand as quickly and accurately as possible. EEG frequency bands of interest here 0 (4-8 Hz), alpha(8-12 Hz), beta(14-30 Hz), and gamma(30-45 Hz). The directionality of the information flux within the EEG rhythms was indexed by a directed transfer function (DTF). The results showed that compared with the frequent stimuli, the target stimuli induced a statistically significant increase of DTF values from the anterior cingulate to the dorsolateral PFC at the 0 rhythms (P < 0.01). These results provide support to the hypothesis that ACC directly or indirectly affects the oscillatory activity of dorsolateral PFC by a selective frequency code under typical oddball conditions.

Large-scale gamma-band phase synchronization and selective attention	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						alpha; attention; EEG; gamma; neural synchrony	OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG ACTIVITY; CORTEX; MODULATION; MECHANISM; COHERENCY; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; BINDING	Explaining the emergence of a coherent conscious percept and an intentional agent from the activity of distributed neurons is key to understanding how the brain produces higher cognitive processes. Gamma-band synchronization has been proposed to be a mechanism for the functional integration of neural populations that together form a transitory, large-scale, task- and/or percept-specific network. The operation of this mechanism in the context of attention orienting entails that cortical regions representing attended locations should show more gamma-band synchronization with other cortical areas than would those representing unattended locations. This increased synchronization should be apparent in the same time frame as that of the deployment of attention to a particular location. In order to observe this effect, we made electroencephalogram recordings while subjects attended to one side or the other of the visual field (which we confirmed by event-related potential analysis) and calculated phase-locking statistics between the signals recorded at relevant electrode pairs. We observed increased gamma-band phase synchronization between visual cortex contralateral to the attended location and other, widespread, cortical areas approximately 240-380 ms after the directional cue was presented, confirming the prediction of a large-scale gamma synchronous network oriented to the cued location.

Deficient "sensory" beta synchronization in Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Post-movement beta synchronization; Sensorimotor integration	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; L-DOPA; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BASAL GANGLIA; MOVEMENT; STIMULATION; IMPAIRMENT	Objective: Beta rhythm movement-related synchronization (beta synchronization) reflects motor cortex deactivation and sensory afference processing. In Parkinson's disease (PD), decreased beta synchronization after active movement reflects abnormal Motor Cortex idling and may be involved in the pathophysiology of akinesia. The objectives of the present study were to (i) compare event-related synchronization after active and passive movement and electrical nerve stimulation in PD patients and healthy, age-matched Volunteers and (ii) evaluate the effect of levodopa. Methods: Using a 128-electrode EEG system, we studied beta synchronization after active and passive index finger movement and electrical median nerve Stimulation in 13 patients and 12 control subjects. Patients were recorded before and after 150% of their usual morning dose of levodopa. Results: The peak beta synchronization magnitude in the contralateral primary sensorimotor (PSM) cortex was significantly lower in PD patients after active movement, passive movement and electrical median nerve stimulation, compared with controls. Levodopa partially reversed the drop in beta synchronization after active movement but not after passive movement or electrical median nerve stimulation. Discussion: If one considers that beta synchronization reflects sensory processing, our results suggest that integration of somaesthetic afferences in the PSM cortex is abnormal in PD during active and passive movement execution and after simple electrical median nerve stimulation. Significance: Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the deficient beta synchronization observed here could prompt the development of new therapeutic approaches aimed at strengthening defective processes. The lack of full beta synchronization restoration by levodopa might be related to the involvement of non-dopaminergic pathways. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Memory consolidation has been suggested to occur predominantly during sleep. Very recent findings, however, suggest that important steps in memory consolidation occur also during waking state but may become saturated after some time awake. Sleep, in this model, specifically favors restoration of synaptic plasticity and accelerated memory consolidation while asleep and briefly afterwards. To distinguish between these different views, we recorded intracranial electroencephalograms from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex of human subjects while they retrieved information acquired either before or after a "nap" in the afternoon or on a control day without nap. Reaction times, hippocampal event-related potentials, and oscillatory gamma activity indicated a temporal gradient of hippocampal involvement in information retrieval on the control day, suggesting hippocampal-neocortical information transfer during waking state. On the day with nap, retrieval of recent items that were encoded briefly after the nap did not involve the hippocampus to a higher degree than retrieval of items encoded before the nap. These results suggest that sleep facilitates rapid processing through the hippocampus but is not necessary for information transfer into the neocortex per se.

Methods: We recorded EEG from 17 children (10-12 years), 16 younger adults (20-26 years), and 17 older adults (70-76 years) during a simple choice-reaction task requiring discrimination of squares and circles of different sizes. We examined age-group differences in the effect of stimulus size on early ERP components, evoked gamma-band power, and inter-trial phase-stability in the gamma band as assessed by the phase-locking index (PLI). Results: In the absence of age differences in discrimination accuracy, we observed reliable age differences in patterns of ERP, evoked gamma power, and PLI. PI and NI peak amplitudes were larger and the peak latencies longer in children than in adults. Children also showed lower levels of evoked power and PLI than adults. Older adults showed smaller increments in evoked power with increasing stimulus size than younger adults, but similar amounts of phase locking for small-and medium-sized stimuli as younger adults. Conclusions: The relative importance of different coding mechanisms in early visual areas changes from childhood to old age. Due to synaptic overproduction and immature myelination, the visual system of children is less entrained by incoming information, resulting in less synchronized neuronal responses. Adults primarily rely on sparse representations formed through experience-dependent temporally synchronized neuronal interactions. In old age, senescent decline in neuronal density and neurotransmitter availability further increase the reliance on temporally synchronized processing. Significance: Findings from this study defy the notion that sensory aging consists in a reversal of sensory development in childhood, and point to a high degree of age specificity in mechanisms of visual coding.

The negative effects on quality of life and the large number of involved patients emphasize the need its investigation. Material/Methods: The bedside measurement of simple and choice reaction times (sRT and cRT) has the objectivity of cortical evoked potential analysis without the need for EEG instrumentation and laboratory. This is a functional assessment similar to neuropsychological tests, but requires a significantly shorter time and is less demanding for the patient. Results: Fifty patients who had undergone open heart surgery were investigated. Statistically significant positive correlation of sRT and cRT prolongation and perfusion time was found. At the same time there were no statistically significant changes in mean sRT and cRT values before (sRT: 208 +/- 54 s, cRT: 369 +/- 59 s) and after (sRT: 229 +/- 67 s, cRT: 392 +/- 105 s) the surgery, probably due to the inhomogeneous patient population. The weak correlation (coefficients: 0.1418-0.8484) for sRT and cRT changes as a function of perfusion time confirms the presence of other factors of postoperative brain damage. Conclusions: The investigated bedside test is clinically feasible, simple, and can be completed within 30 minutes. Further studies are encouraged to compare this method with other tests in a larger, stratified cardiac surgery population.

Methods. - MCP were recorded in 21 patients with intractable partial seizures, undergoing presurgical evaluation using stereotaxicatly implanted multilead intracerebral electrodes. Each patient was tested during a single session with three successive experimental paradigms, each comprised of thirty trials: (1) a tone announcing a visual pattern, with no instruction to move; (2) same tone, and instruction to squeeze abruptly a joystick at a visual signal; (3) instruction to perform the same movement paced at will, without any "go" signal. Averaged ERP recorded during task (1) were subtracted from those recorded during task (2) giving the VT-MCP. All records were taken from various cortical sites devoid of overt pathological activity. Results. - MCP recorded from two main sites, perirolandic and centroparietal, were compared. Between all sites, VT-MCP and SP-MCP morphology differed only slightly. lpsilateral and contralateral MCP were also very similar. By contrast, perirolandic MCP were mainly monophasic negative (N component 400 ms after visual stimulus), whereas centroparietal MCP tended to be biphasic, the late negativity being preceded by a positive P component, at 125 ms. Conclusions. - MCP patterns were quasi-identical regardless of how they were elicited (visually-triggered or self-paced).

Extensive neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuropsychiatric testing showed no evidence of a DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnosis, but a decrease in executive functions and abnormalities in the processing of affective stimuli were found. Behavioral and psychophysiological Studies revealed dissociation between knowing how to behave and actually behaving in socially acceptable ways. According to the woman, killing was just her response to "humiliating situations." Two potentially significant conditions in her past history are found: (i) childhood abuse; and (ii) multiple head injuries. It is conjectured that the nature of tier crimes, paranoid and personality traits, a probable frontal brain dysfunction, as well as a specific demographic and social context represent unusual factors accounting for her violent behavior.

First, a total of 144 word pairs were rated by 660 subjects who determined whether the first stimulus (odor or taste word) matched the second one (color or food word). In an electrophysiological experiment, EEG was recorded from 30 electrodes in 24 healthy adults while clearly matching, or nonmatching, word pairs were presented on a monitor. Evoked potentials were computed for different stimulus classes (matching or nonmatching combinations of odor or taste and color or food words). Six components were identified and compared between conditions. Formost components, field strength (GFP) was lower for nonmatching than for matching word pairs. In addition to late effects, electrical brain activity was influenced by experimental conditions as early as at 100 ms latency. Most effects observed were in the time range between 100 and 250 ms. Our data show how color and food words are differently affected when paired with odor or taste words. Complex interactions between stimulus modality (taste/odor) and different target words (color/food) occurred depending on whether the pairs were seen by the subjects as appropriate or inappropriate. Topographical effects indicated that different neural populations were activated in different conditions. Most interestingly, there were many cognitive effects occurring quite early (on the order of 100ms) after stimulus presentation, and our results suggest rapid cognitive processing of information on odor, taste, color, and food items. This is an important prerequisite for the preconscious and fast choice of food items in everyday behavior, and the data confirm earlier findings on rapid and preconscious semantic processing in the visual cortex.

Past attention research suggests that eye movements to lateralised targets should be significantly reduced using a dynamic, offset mask, causing a reduction in attentional capture. The current study attempted to replicate past divided visual field language studies using offset masking procedures. Using a basic offset procedure, eye movements were not reduced in Experiment 1. However, Experiment 2 did show a significant reduction in eye movements using a new dynamic offset masking procedure. Low accuracy rates were a concern throughout. In conclusion, horizontal eye movements can be reduced with a dynamic offset procedure but the low accuracy rates and the inconsistent behavioural findings throughout the study suggest that further study and refinement of the paradigm is needed.

Neurophysiological methods looking directly at the time course of brain activity indexes of comprehension are critical for finding the answer to this question. As the dominant cognitive approaches, models of serial/cascaded and parallel processing, make conflicting predictions on the time course of psycholinguistic information access, they can be tested using neurophysiological brain activation recorded in MEG and EEG experiments. Seriality and cascading of lexical, semantic and syntactic processes receives support from late (latency similar to 1/2 s) sequential neurophysiological responses, especially N400 and P600. However, parallelism is substantiated by early near-simultaneous brain indexes of a range of psycholinguistic processes, up to the level of semantic access and context integration, emerging already 100-250 ms after critical stimulus information is present. Crucially, however, there are reliable latency differences of 20-50 ms between early cortical area activations reflecting lexical, semantic and syntactic processes, which are left unexplained by current serial and parallel brain models of language. We here offer a mechanistic model grounded in cortical nerve cell circuits that builds upon neuroanatomical and neurophysiological knowledge and explains both near-simultaneous activations and fine-grained delays. A key concept is that of discrete distributed cortical circuits with specific inter-area topographies. The full activation, or ignition, of specifically distributed binding circuits explains the near-simultaneity of early neurophysiological indexes of lexical, syntactic and semantic processing. Activity spreading within circuits determined by between-area conduction delays accounts for comprehension-related regional activation differences in the millisecond range. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Typically MMN recordings show a mixture of MMN, P3a, and responses to repeated standard stimuli. NMF may release the source independence assumption and data length limitations required by Fast independent component analysis (FastICA). Thus, in theory NMF could reach better separation of the responses. In the current experiment MMN was elicited by auditory duration deviations in 102 children. NMF was performed on the time-frequency representation of the raw data to estimate sources. Support to Absence Ratio (SAR) of the MMN component was utilized to evaluate the performance of NMF and FastICA. To the raw data, FastICA-MMN component, and NMF-MMN component, SARs were 31, 34 and 49dB respectively. NMF outperformed FastICA by 15dB. This study also demonstrates that children with reading disability have larger P3a than control children under NMF.

Until now most studies have investigated Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-EMF and only very few Studies have focused on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)-EMF. Therefore, we tested the effects of both types of unilaterally presented EMF, 1950 UMTS (0.1 and 1 W/g)and Pulsed 900 MHz GSM (1 W/g), On Visually evoked occipital PI 00, the P300 of a Continuous performance test., auditory evoked central N100 and the P300 during an oddball task as well as oil the respective behavioral parameters, reaction time and false reactions, in 15 healthy, right handed Subjects. A double-blind, randomized. crossover application of the test procedure Was used. Neither the UMTS- nor the GSM-EMF produced any significant changes in the measured parameters compared to sham exposure. The results do not give any evidence for a deleterious effect of the EMF on normal healthy mobile phone users.

Movement restoration for patients with chronic stroke or other brain damage also remains a therapeutic problem and available treatments do not offer significant improvements. This review considers recent research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as promising solutions to these challenges. Recent findings Experimentation with nonhuman primates suggests that intentional goal directed movements of the upper limbs can be reconstructed and transmitted to external manipulandurn or robotic devices controlled from a relatively small number of microelectrodes implanted into movement-relevant brain areas after some training, opening the door for the development of BCI or brain-machine interfaces in humans. Although noninvasive BCIs using electroencephalographic recordings or event-related-brain-potentials in healthy individuals and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or stroke can transmit up to 80 bits/min of information, the use of BCIs - invasive or noninvasive - in severely or totally paralyzed patients has met some unforeseen difficulties. Summary Invasive and noninvasive BCIs using recordings from nerve cells, large neuronal pools such as electrocorticogram and electroencephalography, or blood flow based measures such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and near-infrared spectroscopy show potential for communication in locked-in syndrome and movement restoration in chronic stroke, but controlled phase III clinical trials with larger populations of severely disturbed patients are urgently needed.

To better understand the neural mechanisms involved in concurrent sound processing, we manipulated sound onset asynchrony to induce the segregation or grouping of two concurrent sounds. Each sound consisted of amplitude-modulated tones at different carrier and modulation frequencies, allowing a cortical tagging of each sound. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out in epileptic patients with pharmacologically resistant partial epilepsy, implanted with depth electrodes in the temporal cortex. Patients were presented with the stimuli while they performed an auditory distracting task. We found that transient and steady-state evoked responses, and induced gamma oscillatory activities were enhanced in the case of onset synchrony. These effects were mainly located in the Heschl's gyrus for steady-state responses whereas they were found in the lateral superior temporal gyrus for evoked transient responses and induced gamma oscillations. They can be related to distinct neural mechanisms such as frequency selectivity and habituation. These results in the auditory cortex provide an anatomically refined description of the neurophysiological components which might be involved in the perception of concurrent sounds.

There is no treatment to halt or slow the pathology responsible for AD, however, new drugs are promising to reduce the rate of progression. On the other hand, the efficacy of these new medications critically depends on our ability to diagnose AD at the earliest stage. Currently AD Is diagnosed through longitudinal clinical evaluations, which are available only at specialized dementia clinics, hence beyond financial and geographic reach of most patients. Automated diagnosis tools that can be made available to community hospitals would therefore be very beneficial. To that end, we have previously shown that the event related potentials obtained from different scalp locations can be effectively used for early diagnosis of AD using an ensemble of classifiers based decision fusion approach. In this study, we expand our data fusion approach to include MRI based measures of regional brain atrophy. Our initial results indicate that ERPs and MRI carry complementary information, and the combination of these heterogeneous data sources using a decision fusion approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.

EEG was recorded as participants read targets with voiced and unvoiced final consonants (e.g., fad and fat), preceded by nonword primes that were incongruent or congruent in voicing and vowel duration (e.g., fap or faz). Experiment 1 used a long duration mask (100 ms) between prime and target, whereas Experiment 2 used a short mask (22 ms). Phonological feature congruency began modulating the amplitude of brain potentials by 80 ms: the feature incongruent condition evoked greater negativity than the feature congruent condition in both experiments. The early onset of the congruency effect indicates that skilled readers initially activate sub-phonemic feature information during word identification. Congruency effects also appeared in the middle and late periods of word recognition, suggesting that readers use phonological representations in multiple aspects of visual word recognition.

Signal Informatics as an Advanced Integrative Concept in the Framework of Medical Informatics New Trends Demonstrated by Examples Derived from Neuroscience	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Time-variant signal analysis; model-related analysis; multivariate approach; high-dimensional and multimodal data	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; TIME-SERIES; FMRI-DATA; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; RECORDINGS	Objectives: The main objective is to show current topics and future trends in the field of medical signal processing which are derived from current research concepts. Signal processing as an integrative concept within the scope of medical informatics is demonstrated, Methods: For all examples time-variant multivariate autoregressive models were used. Based on this modeling, the concept of Granger causality in terms of the time-variant Granger causality index and the time-variant partial directed coherence was realized to investigate directed information transfer between different brain regions. Results: Signal informatics encompasses several diverse domains including: processing steps, methodologies, levels and subject fields, and applications. Five trends can be recognized and in order to illustrate these trends, three analysis strategies derived from current neuroscientific studies are presented. These examples comprise high-dimensional fMRI and EEG data. In the first example, the quantification of time-variant-directed information transfer between activated brain regions on the basis of fast-fMRI data is introduced and discussed. The second example deals with the investigation of differences in word processing between dyslexic and normal reading children. Different dynamic neural networks of the directed information transfer are identified on the basis of event-related potentials. The third example shows time-variant cortical connectivity networks derived from a source model. Conclusions: These examples strongly emphasize the integrative nature of signal informatics, encompassing processing steps, methodologies, levels and subject fields, and applications.

Substantial differences were seen between the morphologies of VESPAs obtained using low contrast stimuli when compared with those obtained using high contrast and full contrast range stimuli. Topographic distributions for both responses are compared and the findings are considered in terms of the response characteristics of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways and the VESPA method itself.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						change detection; EEG; ERP; hyperarousal; hyperstimulation; MMN; PTSD; pre-attentive; protective inhibition; sensory memory; stress	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY; AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION; SOUND DURATION; PTSD SYMPTOMS; BRAIN; MMN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ATTENTION; MEMORY	Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is yet poorly understood in the context of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, e.g. [Morgan 3rd, C.A., Grillon, C., 1999. Abnormal mismatch negativity in women with sexual assault-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Biol. Psychiatry 45, 827-832.]). PTSD symptoms like hyperarousal, emotional pressure and avoidance may interfere with pre-attentive sensory processing. We tested this in an optimized MMN design [Naatanen, R., Pakarinen, S., Rinne, T., Takegata, R. (2004) The mismatch negativity (MMN): towards the optimal paradigm. Clin. Neurophysiol. 115: 140-144.] with PTSD victims and a control group without PTSD. A group of PTSD subjects was compared with gender and age-matched, healthy comparison subjects without PTSD. A "memory trace" was elicited by frequently presented "standard" auditory stimuli (50% occurrence) of 1 kHz, 75 ins duration, intermittently with 8 rare "deviants", which differed in frequency (higher/lower), intensity (louder/softer), duration (shorter), direction (left/right) or by the presence of a gap in the sound. During presentation of tones a silent film was shown. Psychometric data were collected by SCID, BSI, Attentiveness Inventory, Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire, and the PTSD Screening Scale by Breslau et al. [Breslau, N., Peterson, E.L., Kessler, R.C., Schultz, L.R. (1999) Short screening scale for DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder. Am. J. Psychiatry 156: 908-911.]. Group comparisons of the MMN were performed for left/right-frontal/temporal, and for midline electrode sites. A good differentiation of both groups was found in psychometric and electrophysiological data. The PTSD group revealed on most BSI scales enhanced values of psychic aberration. The amplitude of the MMN was significantly reduced in the PTSD compared to non-PTSD subjects. MMN was significantly correlated with the total PTSD score. The data suggest a reduction in pre-attentive auditory sensory memory in PTSD due to specific symptom variables such as hyperarousal, sleeplessness, impaired concentration and a general enhanced excitation of the nervous system. This protective inhibition is thought to be a fine-tuning process in PTSD in order to prevent arousal overload. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We examined alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) to analyze brain reactivity during the selection of verbal (word production) and non-verbal motor actions (keyboard pressing) under two different response modes: externally selected and self-elected. Results: An alpha and beta ERD was observed for both the verbal and non-verbal tasks in both the externally and the self-selected modes. For both tasks, the beta ERD started earlier and was longer in the self-selected mode than in the externally selected mode. The overall pattern of results between the verbal and non-verbal motor behaviors was similar. Conclusions: The pattern of alpha and beta ERD is affected by the mode of response selection suggesting that the activity in both frequency bands contributes to the process of selecting actions. We suggest that activity in the alpha band may reflect attentional processes while activity in the beta band may be more closely related to the execution and selection process. Significance: These results suggest that a domain general process contributes to the planning of speech and other motor actions. This finding has potential clinical implications, for the use of diverse motor tasks to treat disorders of motor planning. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

From local inhibition to long-range integration: A functional dissociation of alpha-band synchronization across cortical scales in visuospatial attention	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Neural synchrony; Alpha-band; Oscillatory dynamics; Inhibition; Functional integration; Selective attention	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; EEG; VOLUNTARY; AMPLITUDE; PARIETAL	When attention is allocated to one visual hemifield, increased alpha power is observed in ipsilateral visual cortex. This has been attributed to synchronization of alpha-band oscillations within cortical regions which reflects inhibitory processing. Recent results, however, indicate that synchronization of alpha oscillations between cortical regions is relevant for transient functional coupling. Such coupling is thought to be involved in orienting attention to a specific region of the visual field. We thus hypothesized that alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and higher-level visual brain regions would be increased in the hemisphere contralateral to an attended location. To test this hypothesis we calculated phase synchronization between attention-related EEG source activations occurring between predictive directional cues and expected visual targets. Alpha amplitude (understood as an index of local synchronization) within low-level visual cortex was increased ipsilateral to attended locations and decreased contralateral to attended locations, consistent with alpha-band scalp topography and previous research relating local alpha power to active inhibition. Increased long-range alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and parietal cortex, however, was observed contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, whereas decreased synchronization (phase scattering) was observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These results identify a potential mechanism for the enhanced processing of stimuli appearing at attended locations, as long-range synchronization is thought to increase the fidelity and effectiveness of communication between brain areas. Our observation of inhibitory amplitude changes, interpreted as increased local-area synchronization, and facilitatory long-range synchronization demonstrates a functional dissociation for alpha-band synchronization across cortical scales.

We have previously identified fMRI- and ERP-based neural markers of impaired sentence reading in dyslexia that indicated both deviant basic word processing and deviant semantic incongruency processing. However, it remained unclear how specific these impairments are for dyslexia, as they occurred when children with dyslexia (DYS) were compared to chronological age-matched controls (CA) who also differ in the amount of reading experience. Adding a younger control group at a similar reading level (RL) as the dyslexic group, we examined here which of these markers would be specific for dyslexia despite matched performance, and which would resemble a developmental delay. Both the RL group and the DYS group showed a similar reversal of incongruency effects in the inferior parietal region (fMRI data) and similarly reduced incongruency effects around 400 ms (ERP data) compared to the CA group, suggesting that the semantic impairment in dyslexia resembles a developmental delay. Furthermore, the DYS group showed reduced sentence reading-related activation in the inferior parietal cortex in the fMRI data, and at around 100 ms (trend) and 400 ms in the ERP data when compared to both CA and RL groups, suggesting dyslexia-specific deficits in basic word processing during sentence reading.

Sensory gating in epilepsy - Effects of the lateralization of hippocampal sclerosis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory-evoked potentials; auditory cortex; epilepsy; ammon's horn; hippocampus	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P50 SUPPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; DECREASED HABITUATION; CURRENT-DENSITY; FOCAL EPILEPSY; DIPOLE MODEL; N1 WAVE; RESPONSES	Objective: The role of the hippocampus in sensory gating is unresolved as yet. The current study was conducted in order to examine the effects of hippocampal lesions on the function of auditory sensory gating. Methods: Epilepsy patients with unilateral and bilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) were investigated. Auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded by multichannel scalp EEG in a double-click experiment. Gating was defined as the response decrease of the AEP components from 1st to 2nd click. Results: Diagnosis (left vs. right vs. bilateral HS) did not affect the amplitudes or gating of the P50, N100 or P200 components. However, diagnosis had an impact on the topography of the N100 component after its peak maximum: In right HS patients, the N100 was left-lateralized, while it was nearly symmetrically distributed in patients with left HS and right lateralized in patients with bilateral HS. Besides the N100, the topography of the P200 component was affected by diagnosis. Conclusions: Findings suggest that auditory activity, as reflected in the N100 and P200 components, is modulated by the hippocampus, but not sensory gating in its classical definition. Significance: Deficits in P50 gating in schizophrenia are unlikely to be explained by hippocampal deficits. (c) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The present study examines the effects of prior retrieval practice on evoked (ERPs) and induced (oscillatory power) measures of electrophysiological activity underlying recognition of practiced and unpracticed words. Compared to control material, recognition of unpracticed words was characterized by reduced amplitudes of the P2 ERP component and by reduced early (200-400 msec) oscillatory theta power. The reduction in P2 amplitude was associated with decreased evoked theta power but not with decreased theta phase locking (phase-locking index). Recognition of unpracticed material was further accompanied by a reduction in occipital gamma power (> 250 msec). In contrast, the beneficial effects of retrieval practice on practiced words were reflected by larger parietal ERP positivity (> 500 msec) and by a stronger decrease in oscillatory alpha power in a relatively late time window (> 700 msec). The results suggest that the beneficial and detrimental effects of retrieval practice are mediated by different processes. In particular, they suggest that reduced theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (60-90 Hz) power reflect the specific effects of inhibitory processes on the unpracticed material's memory representation.

It is unclear however whether these changes reflect cognitive processes such as expectancy of the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), or implicit associative learning of the contingencies outside awareness. Here, we used the "gambler's fallacy" phenomenon to parametrically and inversely manipulate the expectancy of an US and the number of conditioning trials: Increasing the number of CS-US pairings was associated with participants expecting the US to be less likely and vice versa. Magnetocortical activity evoked by the CS in occipital and supplementary motor areas was linearly related to the associative strength (number of CS-US pairings), but decreased as a function of expectancy. These results suggest that the cortical facilitation of fear cue processing is determined by associative strength and previous exposure to learning contingencies rather than by the cognitive anticipation for the US.

The objective is to predict left and right movements and accelerate the communication in a brain-computer interface (BCT). The features are attained by localizing the fast Fourier transformations (FFT) of the signals to specific windows localized in time. An interpolation approach is applied to reduce intra-class variations by smoothing the spectra for each signal. Some important parameters such as the overlaps of the FFT window, the points of interpolation during feature extraction are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The time-frequency features are classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The approach achieves a good performance when quantified by classification accuracy (CA) rate, and has the potential to improve the performance of a brain-control based meal assistance system.

Does familiarity or conflict account for performance in the word-stem completion task? Evidence from behavioural and event-related-potential data	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							INTERACTIVE ACTIVATION MODEL; READ-OUT MODEL; LEXICAL DECISION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; NEGATIVITY; FREQUENCY	The conflict monitoring theory (CMT) assumes that word-stems associated with several completions should lead to crosstalk and conflict due to underdetermined responding situation (Botvinick et al. in Psychol Rev 108(3):624-652, 2001). In contrast, the Multiple-Read-Out-Model (MROM) of Jacobs and Grainger (J Exp Psychol 20(6): 1311-1334, 1994) predicts a high level of general lexical activity (GLA) for word-stems with many completions, indicating a higher stimulus familiarity because these stems are more probable to be read. We compared word-stems with several completions against word-stems with one possible completion while measuring response times and electrophysiological recordings. Slowest response times and a distinct FN400 component, which has previously been related to the concept of familiarity (Curran in Memory Cogn 28(6):923-938, 2000), were apparent for word-stems that could only be associated with a single response. These findings support the claims of the MROM. Furthermore, the lack of the N2-component for word-stems with several completions continues to challenge the EEG-extension of the CMT (Yeung et al. in Psychol Rev 111(4):2004).

Anticipatory activity in the human thalamus is predictive of reaction times	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortex; deep brain stimulation; EEG; movement; reaction time; thalamus	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR THALAMUS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VARIATION CNV; CORTEX; STIMULATION; MUSCLE	Responding to environmental stimuli in a fast manner is a fundamental behavioral capacity. The pace at which one responds is known to be predetermined by cortical areas, but it remains to be shown if subcortical structures also take part in defining motor swiftness. As the thalamus has previously been implicated in behavioral control, we tested if neuronal activity at this level could also predict the reaction time of upcoming movements. To this end we simultaneously recorded electrical brain activity from the scalp and the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus in patients undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation. Based on trial-to-trial analysis of a Go/NoGo task, we demonstrate that both cortical and thalamic neuronal activity prior to the delivery of upcoming Go stimulus correlates with the reaction time. This result goes beyond the demonstration of thalamic activity being associated with but potentially staying invariant to motor performance. In contrast, it indicates that the latencies at which we respond to environmental stimuli are not exclusively related to cortical pre-movement states but are also correlated with anticipatory thalamic activity.

P300s are used increasingly frequently in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, being naturally elicited in response to external stimuli, users do not need special training. However, P300 waves are hard to detect and, therefore, multiple stimulus presentations are needed before an interface can make a reliable decision. While significant improvements have been made in the detection of P300s, no particular attention has been paid to the variability in shape and timing of P300 waves and its exploitation in BCI. In this paper we start filling this gap, by first documenting and then exploiting a modulation in amplitude of P300 caused by target-to-target interval (TTI) differences. We demonstrate this within the context of the Donchin's speller, which is perhaps the best known example of a BCI system relying on the detection P300 waves, where target-to-target interval variations are induced by stimuli randomisation. In particular we show that by specialising detectors to work with P300s elicited with each TTI, we can further improve the performance of the best known Donchin's speller with minimal changes.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli before delivery of a target event. EEG was recorded in 12 subjects during auditory and visual sessions. Stimuli were presented in the center of the auditory and visual field and consisted of 15% targets (1000 Hz tone or downward facing triangle) and 85% of equal amounts of three types of standards (1500, 2000, and 2500 Hz tones or triangles facing left, upward, and right). Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a three-standard predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Subjects pressed button in response to targets. Peak target P300 (P3b) amplitude and latency were evaluated for targets after predictive and nonpredictive sequences using conventional averaging and a novel single-trial analysis procedure. Reaction times were shorter for predictable targets than for nonpredicted targets. P3b latency was shorter for predicted targets than for nonpredictive targets, and there were no significant P3b amplitude differences between predicted and random targets, as determined by both conventional averaging and single-trial analysis. Comparable effects on amplitude and latency were observed in both the auditory and visual modalities. The results indicate that local context has differential effects on P3b amplitude and latency, and exerts modality-independent effects on cognitive processing.

J	Balconi, M; Lucchiari, C				Balconi, Michela; Lucchiari, Claudio			Consciousness and arousal effects on emotional face processing as revealed by brain oscillations. A gamma band analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						facial expression; EEG; gamma band; arousal; consciousness	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY BANDS; STIMULI; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXPRESSIONS; ACTIVATION; AWARENESS; HUMANS	It remains an open question whether it is possible to assign a single brain operation or psychological function for facial emotion decoding to a certain type of oscillatory activity. Gamma band activity (GBA) offers an adequate tool for studying cortical activation patterns during emotional face information processing. In the present study brain oscillations were analyzed in response to facial expression of emotions. Specifically, GBA modulation was measured when twenty subjects looked at emotional (angry, fearful, happy, and sad faces) or neutral faces in two different conditions: supraliminal (10 ms) vs subliminal (150 ms) stimulation (100 target-mask pairs for each condition). The results showed that both consciousness and significance of the stimulus in terms of arousal can modulate the power synchronization (ERD decrease) during 150-350 time range: an early oscillatory event showed its peak at about 200 ms post-stimulus. GBA was enhanced by supraliminal more than subliminal elaboration, as well as more by high arousal (anger and fear) than low arousal (happiness and sadness) emotions. Finally a left-posterior dominance for conscious elaboration was found, whereas right hemisphere was discriminant in emotional processing of face in comparison with neutral face.

Colored-hearing synesthetes experience colors when hearing tones or spoken utterances. Based on event-related potentials we employed electric brain tomography with high temporal resolution in colored-hearing synesthetes and nonsynesthetic controls during auditory verbal stimulation. The auditory-evoked potentials to words and letters were different between synesthetes and controls at the N1 and P2 components, showing longer latencies and lower amplitudes in synesthetes. The intracerebral sources of these components were estimated with low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography and revealed stronger activation in synesthetes in left posterior inferior temporal regions, within the color area in the fusiform gyrus (V4), and in orbitofrontal brain regions (ventromedial and lateral). The differences occurred as early as 122 ms after stimulus onset. Our findings replicate and extend earlier reports with functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in colored-hearing synesthesia and contribute new information on the time course in synesthesia demonstrating the fast and possibly automatic processing of this unusual and remarkable phenomenon.

S-cone signals invisible to the motion system can improve motion extraction via grouping by color	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						S-cones; Motion; Color; Grouping; Attention	PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION; SURFACES; BRAIN; EEG; SEGREGATION; ACTIVATION	The purpose of this study was to test whether color-motion correlations carried by a pure color difference (S-cone component only) can be used to improve global motion extraction. We also examined the neural markers of color-motion correlation processing in event-related potentials. Color and motion information was dissociated using a two-colored random dot kinematogram, wherein coherent motion and motion noise differed from each other only in their S-cone component, with spatial and temporal parameters set so that global motion processing relied solely on a constant L-M component. Hence, when color and the local motion direction are correlated, more efficient segregation of coherent motion can only be brought about by the S-cone difference, and crucially, this S-cone component does not provide any effective input to a global motion mechanism but only changes the color appearance of the moving dots. The color contrasts (vector length in the S vs. L-M plane) of both the dots carrying coherent motion and the dots moving randomly were fixed at motion discrimination threshold to ensure equal effectiveness for motion extraction. In the behavioral experiment, participants were asked to discriminate between coherent and random motion, and d' was determined for three different conditions: uncorrelated, uncued correlated, and cued correlated. In the electroencephalographic experiment, participants discriminated direction of motion for uncued correlated and cued correlated conditions. Color-motion correlations were found to improve performance. Cueing a specific color also modulated the N1 component of the event-related potential, with sources in visual area middle temporal. We Conclude that S-cone signals "invisible" to the motion system can influence the analysis by direction-selective motion mechanisms through grouping of local motion signals by color. This grouping mechanism must precede motion processing and is likely to be under attentional control.

Cerebral hemodynamics and brain functional activity during lower body negative pressure. Aviat Space Environ Med 2009; 80:698-702. Introduction: Exposure to high +G(z) acceleration forces on a centrifuge or in an aircraft can severely decrease cerebral blood perfusion and cause rapid G-induced loss of consciousness. However, milder acceleration may gradually reduce cerebral blood flow and affect cognitive function in subtler ways. This study used lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to mimic +G(z) circulatory effects in order to study cerebral hemodynamics and brain function. Methods: Subjects were 15 healthy men, 19-21 yr of age. They were exposed to LBNP at two levels for 5 min each separated by a 10-min recovery period. The conditions were low (LO), -4.00 kPa (-30 mmHg) and high (HI), -6.67 kPa (-50 mmHg). Variables measured before, during, and after LBNP included cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery, blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate (HR), blood pressure, P300 of event-related EEG potentials, reaction time, and tracking error. Results: LO significantly reduced CBFV at 4 and 5 min, increased HR and decreased the amplitude of P300, but none of the other variables changed from baseline. In contrast, HI produced significant changes in most variables: CBFV decreased at 2 min and then fell further at 4 and 5 min, HR increased, and SaO2 decreased. Significant neurocognitive changes included increased latency and reduced amplitude of P300, slower reaction time, and greater tracking error. Conclusion: The higher level of LBNP used here reduced cerebral perfusion sufficiently to impair neurocognitive function. This model may he useful for further studies of these and other variables under closely controlled conditions.

The right profile: Mismatch negativity in schizophrenia with and without auditory hallucinations as measured by a multi-feature paradigm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						MMN; schizophrenia; event-related potentials; hallucinations; sLORETA	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SPEECH SOUNDS; BRAIN; MMN; ATTENTION; MEMORY; DURATION; LORETA	Objective: To examine pre-attentive acoustic change detection in schizophrenia patients with and without auditory hallucinations via mismatch negativity (MMN) extracted from a multi-feature paradigm. Methods: This study examined the electroencephalograph (EEG)-derived MMN, recorded across 32 sites, in 12 hallucinating patients (HPs) with schizophrenia, 12 non-hallucinating patients (NPs) with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls (HCs). MMN was recorded in response to a multi-feature MMN paradigm [Naatanen, R., et al., 2004. The mismatch negativity (MMN): towards the optimal paradigm. Clin. Neurophys. 115, 140-144] which employs frequency, duration, intensity, location and gap deviants. Differences in source localization were probed using standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results: HPs showed significantly smaller MMNs to duration deviants compared to HCs and NPs, as well as smaller MMNs to intensity deviants compared to HCs. Regionalized differences between HCs and each of the patient groups were observed in response to frequency deviants. There were no significant group effects for location or gap deviants, or for MMN latency. Source localization using sLORETA showed no significant differences in MMN generator location across groups for any of the deviant stimuli. Conclusions: The often-reported robust MMN deficit to duration deviants may be specific to schizophrenia patients afflicted with auditory hallucinations. Furthermore, by using symptom-specific groups, novel deficits of pre-attentive auditory processing, such as that observed to intensity deviants in HPs, may be revealed. Significance: The differential responding observed between both groups of patients with schizophrenia has implications for automatic processing within the auditory cortex of hallucinating patients and suggests that care must be taken when recruiting participants in studies involving schizophrenia to ensure consistent, replicable results.

A previous study of P50 sensory gating did not reveal abnormalities in high-functioning school age children [C. Kemner, B. Oranje, M.N. Verbaten, H. van Engeland, Normal P50 gating in children with autism, J. Clin. Psychiatry 63 (2002) 214-217]. Sensory gating deficit may, however, characterize younger children with autism or be a feature of retarded children with autism, reflecting imbalance of neuronal excitation/inhibition in these cohorts. We applied a paired clicks paradigm to study P50 sensory gating, and its relation to IQ and EEG gamma spectral power (as a putative marker of cortical excitability), in young (3-8 years) children with autism (N = 21) and age-matched typically developing children (N = 21). P50 suppression in response to the second click was normal in high-functioning children with autism, but significantly (p < 0.03) reduced in those with mental retardation. P50 gating improved with age in both typically developing children and those with autism. Higher ongoing EEG gamma power corresponded to lower P50 suppression in autism (p < 0.02), but not in control group. The data suggest that ineffective inhibitory control of sensory processing is characteristic for retarded children with autism and may reflect excitation/inhibition imbalance in this clinical group.

The result showed that teacher tended to rate children more behavioral inhibited than parents did, but no difference between mother and father in rating children's behavioral inhibition. Thus, we infer that the environment may exert influence on children's behavioral inhibition. Secondly, we tested the relation between children's behavioral inhibition and their BAS/BIS sensitivity. We found that BI rated by mother positively related to BIS and negatively related to BAS, but In the scores reported by father, BI had no relation with BIS, but negatively related to BAS and its three subscales. Further study will focus on using behavioral observation and EEG/ERP methods to explore children's temperamental stability across different situations.

We describe the application of mixed effect models (MEMs) to brain signature detection. We develop an MEM detector for detecting brain evoked responses generated by perceptual processes in the human brain associated with detecting novel target stimuli. We construct the model using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) bases. We adopt the LDA for dimension reduction. For parameter regularization we use 10-fold cross validation and report experimental results from six subjects. Four out of six subjects achieve very good detection performance with more than 0.9 areas under receiver operating characteristic curves. The results demonstrate that the MEM can provide reliable inference on single-trial ERP detection on the task of target image search.

These oscillations are highly heritable, are modulated by genes controlling neurotransmitters in the brain, and provide links to associative and integrative brain functions. These enclophenotypes represent traits that are less complex and more proximal to gene function than either diagnostic labels or traditional cognitive measures, providing a powerful strategy in searching for genes in psychiatric disorders. These intermediate phenotypes identify both affected and unaffected members of an affected family, including offspring at risk, providing a more direct connection with underlying biological vulnerability. Our group has utilized heritable neurophysiological features (i.e., brain oscillations) as endophenotypes, making it possible to identify susceptibility genes that may be difficult to detect with diagnosis alone. We have discussed our findings of significant linkage and association between brain oscillations and genes in GABAergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic systems (GABRA2, CHRM2, and GRM8). We have also shown that some oscillatory indices from both resting and active cognitive states have revealed a common subset of genetic foci that are shared with the diagnosis of alcoholism and related disorders. Implications of our findings have been discussed in the context of physiological and pharmacological studies on receptor function.

For surface-based recordings such as the event related optical signal (EROS), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), event-related potentials (ERPs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), alignment is typically done using either (1) a landmark-based method involving placement Of Surface markers that can be detected in both modalities; or (2) surface-fitting alignment that samples many points on the surface of the head in the functional space and aligns those points to the surface of the anatomical image. Here we compare these two approaches and advocate a combination of the two in order to optimize coregistration of EROS and NIRS data with structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI). Digitized 3D sensor locations obtained with a Polhemus (R) digitizer can be effectively coregistered with sMRI using fiducial alignment as an initial guess followed by a Marquardt-Levenberg least-squares rigid-body transform (df = 6) to match the surfaces. Additional scaling parameters (df = 3) and point-by-point surface constraints can also be employed to further improve fitting. These alignment procedures place the lower-bound residual error at 1.3 +/- 0.1 mm (mu +/- s) and the upper-bound target registration error at 4.4 +/- 0.6 mm (mu +/- s). The dependence of such errors on scalp segmentation, number of registration points, and initial guess is also investigated. By optimizing alignment techniques, anatomical localization of Surface recordings can be improved in individual subjects. Hum Brain Mapp 29:1288-1301, 2008. (C)2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The purpose was to investigate changes in P300 congnitive evoked potentials, especially the amplitude and latency at the Pz electrode site. Material/Methods: The P300 parameters of perpetrators of various type of criminal offences and those of a control group matched for age, gender, and educational status were compared (N=80). There were 20 subjects with impulsively aggressive delinquent behavior. the observed parameters were compared with the neuropsychophysiological correlates of a group of 20 subjects with deliberately (i.e. non-impulsive) violent behavior, a group of 20 delinquents sentenced for property crimes (theft), and 20 non-delinquent non-impulsive nonviolent persons. To differentiate these groups, Eysenck's IVE questionnaire and a structured interview according to DSM IV criteria conducted by a certified forensic psychiatrist were used. Results: The results showed a significantly lower P300 wave amplitude in the impulsively aggressive individuals than in the other groups. No significant differences were found in terms of latency. The results confirm the results of previous studies. Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility of a neuropsychophysiological correlated of impulsively aggressive individuals behaving is a socially dangerous way. This opens a discussion on the subject of expert evaluation of criminal acts within the context of "uncontrolled affect".

Participants learned a map by (1) reading a text description of the map, (2) touching a wooden topological representation of the map (hidden from view), or (3) both. Subsequently, the participants' ability to use their spatial knowledge was tested in a spatial orientation task. Differential patterns of brain activity as a function of encoding modality were found at the very early (preconscious) stages of processing. In contrast, an analysis of behavioral performance revealed no differences between the encoding groups. A model of spatial memory retrieval is presented to account for the findings.

Method: Twenty participants read words from three experimental conditions: high and low frequency, late and early age of acquisition and high and low imageability. Results: High frequency words produced more positive mean amplitude than low frequency words in the 175-360 ms post-stimulus onset time window and late AoA produced more negative amplitudes than early AoA in the 400-610 ms window. Imageability did not produce any effect in any time window tested. Brain electromagnetic tomography showed the most activated cortical areas for each category of stimuli. Conclusions: The lexical frequency of words seems to affect an early phase in the recognition process, perhaps at the level of the orthographic input lexicon, while AoA was observed at a later stage, indicating that this variable influence processing at a semantic level or at the links between semantics and phonology. Significance: EEG permits the researcher to investigate the time course, and approximate location in the brain, of psycholinguistic variables.

The LUT supplement and placebo samples were randomly assigned to thirteen participants, who took the samples for two LUT (and vice versa) for another 2 week. Each participant completed visual proof reading tasks for 2 h during each of four testing sessions. Saccade tests were administered before and after the proof reading task, during which the participants moved their eyes back and forth between two targets positioned in the center of two checkerboards. We recorded EEG, EOG, heart rate, and facial muscle potential/performance during the saccade tests. Blood pressure was measured and Subjective fatigue and stress scores were collected before and after the proof reading task. We averaged EEG starting at saccade offset in order to analyze eye fixation related potentials (EFRP). Our results suggested that the proof reading task induced visual fatigue. An analysis of EFRP and other psychophysiological data revealed significant differences between the LUT and placebo conditions. These results suggest that supplementation with LUT could help to reduce symptoms of visual fatigue. (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The measurements were performed with thirteen blind subjects (15.07 age +/- 1.65, 10 male) and thirteen healthy subjects (15.92 age +/- 2.90, 8 male). One type of tactile stimuli were applied to middle finger and index finger of the right hand. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64 channels, 3 of which (C(z), C(3), C(4)) were primarily analyzed Peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes and durations of delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) were measured in 1000 ms following stimuli. For the statistical analysis Wilcoxon test was used. In this present study, increases in delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) responses for non-painful tactile stimuli in blind subjects were compared with the control group. In each electrode area (C(z), C(3), C(4)) the amplitude measurements of the blind group found higher than the control group and the difference found statistically significant in C(4) electrode area (p < 0.05). The durations in each electrode area (C(z), C(3), C(4)) for the blind group found statistically longer than the control group (for each one p < 0.05).

We presented vernier targets backward masked by an invariant grating with invariant SOA. EEG data recorded from occipital and parietal electrodes was analyzed for ERPs and time-frequency functions of oscillatory responses. Comparison of data from correct aware trials with data from correct unaware trials showed that conscious awareness of targets was associated with decrease in the latency of ERP/P1, increase in the amplitude of P300, and increase in the power of 70-Hz and 30-Hz gamma band oscillations from SO ms before target onset up to 100 ms after target onset. Results are interpreted in the context of the well-known views about the role of brain-activity oscillations in conscious awareness and as related to the perceptual retouch theory.

This capacity is, among other factors, dependent on the correct anticipation of the dynamics of facially expressed emotions based on our beliefs and experience. Important information about the neural processes involved in mentalizing can be derived from dynamic recordings of neural activity such as the EEG. We here exemplify how the so-called Bayesian probabilistic models can help us to model the neural dynamic involved in the perception of clips that evolve from neutral to emotionally laden faces. Contrasting with conventional models, in Bayesian models, probabilities can be used to dynamically update beliefs based on new incoming information. Our results show that a reproducible model of the neural dynamic involved in the appraisal of facial expression can be derived from the grand mean ERP over five subjects. One of the two models used to predict the individual subject dynamic yield correct estimates for four of the five subjects analyzed. These results encourage the future use of Bayesian formalism to build more detailed models able to describe the single trial dynamic.

Mean field model of acetylcholine mediated dynamics in the thalamocortical system	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Neuromodulation; EEG; ERP	FREELY MOVING RAT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS BASALIS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SLEEP CYCLE; ACTIVATION; RECEPTORS	A recent continuum model of the large scale electrical activity of the thalamocortical system is generalized to include cholinergic modulation. The model is examined analytically and numerically to determine the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on its steady states, linear stability, spectrum, and temporal responses. Changing the ACh concentration moves the system between zones of one, three, and five steady states, showing that neuromodulation of synaptic strength is a possible mechanism by which multiple steady states emerge in the brain. The lowest firing rate steady state is always stable, and subsequent fixed points alternate between stable and unstable. Increasing ACh concentration changes the form of the spectrum. Increasing the tonic level of ACh concentration increases the magnitudes of the N100 and P200 in the evoked response potential (ERP), Without changing the timing of these peaks. Driving the system with a pulse of cholinergic activity results in a transient increase in the firing rate of cortical neurons that lasts over 10s. Step-like increases in cortical ACh concentration cause increases in the firing rate of cortical neurons, with rapid responses due to fast acting nicotinic receptors and slower responses due to muscarinic receptor Suppression of intracortical connections.

It has been suggested that this phasic event has a sleep-protective function. The objective of the present Study was to document one aspect of sleep protection in chronic insomnia sufferers: the number and density of sleep spindles in Stage 2 sleep. Methods: Sleep spindles were scored during Stage 2 sleep oil the second and third nights of a protocol of polysomnographic recordings that lasted for four consecutive nights. The sample included 16 participants suffering from insomnia (INS group; mean age=43.4 years) and 14 good sleepers (GS group; mean age=38.1 years). Participants underwent sleep and psychological evaluations. The INS group participants met the diagnostic criteria for primary psychophysiological insomnia (mean duration of insomnia=9.6 years). Results: The total number of sleep spindles in Stage 2 sleep and the density (sleep spindles per minute) according to the total time spent in Stage 2 sleep were compiled. Repeated-measures analyses of variance showed no significant difference in the number and in the density of sleep spindles between the INS group (68.46 and 0.60, respectively) and the GS group (56.28 and 0.46, respectively). Conclusion: These results suggest no deficiency ill the sleep-protection mechanism of psychophysiological insomnia Sufferers in comparison with good sleeper controls, as measured by the number and density of sleep spindles.

Coding of Visual Object Features and Feature Conjunctions in the Human Brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAMMA BAND RESPONSES; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; TIME-COURSE; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; COLOR; EEG; REPRESENTATIONS	Object recognition is achieved through neural mechanisms reliant on the activity of distributed coordinated neural assemblies. In the initial steps of this process, an object's features are thought to be coded very rapidly in distinct neural assemblies. These features play different functional roles in the recognition process - while colour facilitates recognition, additional contours and edges delay it. Here, we selectively varied the amount and role of object features in an entry-level categorization paradigm and related them to the electrical activity of the human brain. We found that early synchronizations (approx. 100 ms) increased quantitatively when more image features had to be coded, without reflecting their qualitative contribution to the recognition process. Later activity (approx. 200-400 ms) was modulated by the representational role of object features. These findings demonstrate that although early synchronizations may be sufficient for relatively crude discrimination of objects in visual scenes, they cannot support entry-level categorization. This was subserved by later processes of object model selection, which utilized the representational value of object features such as colour or edges to select the appropriate model and achieve identification.

Multiple measures were recorded, such as psychophysiological (skin conductance response, heart rate, and electromyography) and frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and gamma), during viewing IAPS figures, that varied in terms of pleasantness (appetitive vs. aversive) and arousing power (high vs. low intensity). Both BIS and BAS measures were significant in modulating behavioural, autonomic and brain oscillations responses. Withdrawal (BIS system) and appetitive (BAS system) behaviour showed opposite patterns of responses by the subjects. Also, frontal cortical site response was more significant than other sites. Nevertheless, no specific lateralization effect was found as a function of BIS/BAS dichotomy. Moreover, autonomic variables and frequency band modulations were found to be effected by valence and arousal rating per se, with an increased response for high arousing and negative or positive stimuli in comparison with low arousing and neutral stimuli. The effects of subjective evaluation and individual differences were discussed at light of coping activity model of emotion comprehension. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is however difficult to ensure patient engagement during MP in the absence of any on-line measure of the MP. Fortunately in an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI), an on-line measure of MI activity is used to devise neurofeedback for the BCI user to help him/her focus better on the task. This paper reports a pilot study in which an EEG-based BCI system is used to provide neurofeedback to stroke participants during the MP part of the rehabilitation protocol. This helps patients to undertake the MP with stronger focus. The participants included five chronic stroke sufferers. The trial was undertaken for 12 sessions over a period of 6 weeks. A set of rehabilitation outcome measures including action research arm test (ARAT) and motricity index was made use of in assessing functional recovery. Moderate improvements approaching a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were observed for the ARAT. Small positive improvements were also observed in other outcome measures. Participants appeared highly enthusiastic about participating in the study and regularly attended all the sessions. Although without a randomized control trial, it is difficult to ascertain whether the enhanced rehabilitation gain is primarily because of BCI neurofeedack, the positive gains in outcome measures demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using BCI for post-stroke rehabilitation.

These models were derived from indirect measures such as neuropsychological tests and electroencephalography alpha band power. Objective: To determine if high-arousing stimuli directly modulated activity in attention and arousal-related sensory brain regions in patients with MDD. Design: Between-group comparison (patients with MDD vs healthy control subjects) of neuromagnetic oscillatory activity driven by flickering emotional and neutral pictures (steady-state visual evoked fields [ssVEFs]). Setting: Center of magnetoencephalography at a public university and public ambulatory mental health service. Participants: Fifteen female low-anxious patients with MDD and 15 female controls. The groups were matched with respect to age and handedness. Intervention: Magnetoencephalographic recordings and self-report ratings. Main Outcome Measures: Modulation of current source strengths obtained by frequency domain minimum norm source localization of ssVEFs. Results: Controls and patients with MDD showed enhanced current source strengths at ssVEF frequency in occipital and parietal cortex for high-arousing emotional pictures (P<.05 for permutation statistics). While this arousal modulation in controls was pronounced in the right temporoparietal cortex, weak arousal modulation characterized that brain region in patients with MDD (F-1.28=7.2, P<.05 for interaction group by quadratic contrast). Conclusions: Although emotional pictures engaged the dorsal visual stream to a greater extent than neutral pictures in both study groups, only controls showed strong arousal modulation in the right temporoparietal cortex. Because the right temporoparietal cortex is associated with the arousal dimension of emotion, subjects with depression may have difficulties in activating arousal-related brain areas, whereas basic stimulus processing related to activation of the dorsal visual stream is intact.

Whereas one view considers a relatively late positive deflection (LP) as a primary correlate of consciousness, another model links consciousness with earlier negativity (VAN). The present experiment utilized metacontrast masking in investigating the electrophysiological correlates of visual consciousness. The participants were presented with target-mask sequences in three stimulus onset asynchronies. The target stimuli were followed by either a metacontrast mask or a similar-looking, but ineffective pseudomask. The results showed that the first deflection that correlated with target visibility was VAN which was followed by LP. We argue that the VAN is the primary correlate target visibility, while the LP reflects later, postperceptual processing stages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cortical activity prior to predictable postural instability: Is there a difference between self-initiated and externally-initiated perturbations?	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Balance; Cortical; EEG; Postural set; Human	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STANCE PERTURBATION; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; BALANCE; STRATEGY; GAIT; ARM; EMG	Previous work has revealed pre-perturbation cortical activity linked to predictably-timed perturbations to upright stability. Because individuals rely on the ability to anticipate perturbations for independent mobility, we sought to determine whether perturbation-evoked cortical potentials elicited by voluntarily-initiated external perturbations were dissociable from those elicited by externally-cued perturbations. Postural instability was evoked under three experimental conditions: cued external perturbations (EXT-CUE), cued self-initiated perturbations (SELF-CUE), and un-cued self-initiated perturbations (SELF-NO CUE). All conditions were characterized by comparable pre-perturbation slow-wave potentials initiated 1536.83 +/- 44.94 ms prior to perturbation onset, measuring 11.24 +/- 0.94 mu V in amplitude. There were no differences in pre-perturbation cortical activity across tasks. Post-perturbation NI potentials were also evoked, reaching peak amplitude at 132.63 +/- 3.40 ms following perturbation onset. The potentials were significantly larger in the EXT-CUE (17.08 +/- 2.99 mu V) condition than both the SELF-CUE (11.982 +/- 2.53 mu V) and SELF-NO CUE conditions (9.24 +/- 1.79 mu V). There were no significant differences across tasks for measures of tibialis anterior muscle activity prior to or following perturbation onset, nor were there significant differences in centre of pressure excursion amplitude across tasks. This study highlights that despite using different mechanisms to initiate temporally predictable perturbations to upright stability, pre-perturbation cortical events with similar spatio-temporal characteristics and magnitude are evoked, signalling consistency in the cortical processes that optimize compensatory postural responses which are independent from the cues that inform the onset of postural instability. These findings enhance the understanding of cortical involvement in postural control. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the volumetric variations in regional cerebral blood flow that are related with cognitive activity to be indexed with millimeter-level spatial resolution. Much of the interest on cognitive processes has focused on two phenomena: stimulus-driven or bottom-up effects on attentional selection, and goal-driven or top-down influences.

Method: We present a meta-analysis of 29 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and six patients with other severe neurological diseases in different stages of physical impairment who were trained with a BCI In most cases voluntary regulation of slow cortical potentials has been Used as input signal for BCI-control. More recently sensorimotor rhythms and the P300 event-related brain potential were recorded. Results: A strong correlation has been found between physical impairment and BCI performance, indicating that performance worsens as impairment increases. Seven patients were in the complete locked-in state (CLIS) with no communication possible. After removal of these patients from the analysis, the relationship between physical impairment and BCI performance disappeared. The lack of a relation between physical impairment and BCI performance was confirmed when adding BCI data of patients from other BCI research groups. Conclusions: Basic communication (yes/no) was not restored in any of the CLIS patients with a BCI. Whether locked-in patients can transfer learned brain control to the CLIS remains an open empirical question. Significance: Voluntary brain regulation for communication is possible in all stages of paralysis except the CLIS. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Multi-site phasic neural activity mediates the execution of an auditory continuous performance task: A PET and electrophysiological study (vol 18, pg 241, 2008)	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Correction						tomography; emission computed; evoked potential; brain mapping; attention; anterior cingulate	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BLOOD-FLOW; ACTIVATION; TARGET; FMRI; ERP	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We studied an auditory continuous performance task with positron emission tomography (PET) and EEG-derived current density reconstructions (CDRs) to define the spatial and temporal aspects of auditory attention. METHODS The CDRs were employed to segregate responses to targets and non-targets at sites identified by PET. We then studied the time course of brain activity using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of the CDR data. RESULTS In contrast to target EEG activity, non-targets did not produce significant peaks after 300 ms. Pre-300 ms biphasic activation of auditory, left posterior frontal, left supplemental, and primary motor cortices and the anterior cingulate (AC) and biphasic suppression of posterior cingulate and occipital cortex were identical for targets and non-targets and may mediate the target non-target decision. SPM analysis of post-300 ms CDRs showed cingulate cortices were the first to be reactivated, remained active through 672 ms, and were accompanied by reactivation and deactivation of the same sites observed in the pre-P300 responses. CONCLUSIONS The cingulate may play an important role in post-decisional activity and control activity at other sites involved in post-decisional cognitive processing.

Usefulness and feasibility of psychophysical and electrophysiological olfactory testing in the rhinology clinic	RHINOLOGY			English	Article						smell; olfaction; chemosensory event-related potential; olfactometer; olfactory and trigeminal informations; orthonasal testing; retronasal testing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NORMATIVE DATA; TRIGEMINAL SENSITIVITY; ODOR-IDENTIFICATION; SMELL; STIMULATION; DYSFUNCTION; GENDER; AGE	Topic: Olfactory dysfunction may be assessed in the clinic with Psychophysical testing and electro-physiological recording. Chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs) constitute an objective method to assess chemosensory function. Olfactory and trigeminal stimuli activate chemoreceptors from the olfactory neuroepithelium and from the nasal mucosa to evoke an electrophysiological response respectively called olfactory (OERPs) and trigeminal ERPs (TERPs). The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness and feasibility of these diagnostic tools in the rhinology clinic and to correlate these results to the olfactory disorder aetiology. Materials and Methods: This study encompasses a cohort of 229 patients with a complaint of olfactory dysfunction from different origins. Orthonasal (Sniffing stick test with the treshold-discrimination-identification score: maximal score 48) and retronasal olfactory (maximal score 20) testing as well as CSERPs both after olfactory and trigeminal stimuli have been routinely performed. Olfactory dysfunction aetiologies were as follows: congenital (Cong.), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), idiopathic (Idiop.), post-medication (PM), neurologic (Neuro.), post-traumatic (PT) and post-infection (PI). Results: Mean orthonasal and retronasal scores were respectively: 11.8 and 10.1 for Cong., 18.5 and 13.1 for CRS, 15.6 and 10.4 for Idiop., 15.3 and 10.2 for PM, 17 and 10.6 for Neuro., 15 and 9.9 for PT and 18.3 and 12 for PI. Correlations between orthonasal and retronasal scores were present for all subgroups except congenital and chronic rhinosinusitis subgroups. Orthonasal and retronasal scores were different (p < 0.05) when comparing CRS vs Cong., CRS vs PT and PT vs PI. Technical problems (olfactometer or olfactory stimulation, EEG amplifier,...) and patients discomfort (anxiety, stress,...) did not allow to draw any conclusion in 2 patients. Three patients after olfactory stimulus and 6 patients after trigeminal stimulus demonstrated too much eye blinking or muscular artifacts that did not allow us to perform electrophysiological analysis and averaging as 60% of artifact-free recording was not achieved. Olfactory ERPs were recorded in 28% of the patients and trigeminal ERPs were obtained in almost every patient (95%). There was no statistical difference between each subgroup regarding the presence or absence of OERPs. Conclusions: Psychophysical olfactory testing is a useful method to assess olfactory function in patients with olfactory loss and may help us to obtain a semi-objective and a basal evaluation of the olfactory performances. Feasibility and usefulness of CSERPs are also underlined in this study with only a limited number of patients who did not complete the examination. Psychophysical testing gives different results according to the aetiology of the olfactory disorder, which was not the case for electrophysiological recording. Olfactory acuity assessment should be based on psychophysical and CSERPs evaluation in a clinical setting.

Cortical glucose metabolic rate correlates of abstract reasoning and attention studied with positron emission tomography. Intelligence 12, 199-217]. While most early studies confirmed this hypothesis later research has revealed contradictory evidence or has identified some moderating variables like sex, task type, task complexity or brain area. Neuroscientific training studies suggest that neural efficiency also seems to be a function of the amount and quality of learning. From integrating this evidence we conclude that neural efficiency might arise when individuals are confronted with tasks of (subjectively) low to moderate task difficulty and it is mainly observable for frontal brain areas. This is true for easier novel cognitive tasks or after sufficient practice allowing participants to develop appropriate (efficient) strategies to deal with the task. In very complex tasks more able individuals seem to invest more cortical resources resulting in positive correlations between brain usage and cognitive ability. Based on the reviewed evidence we propose future empirical approaches in this field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been proposed that the underlying mechanism builds predictions about the forthcoming sensory input and forwards them to the respective sensory processing levels. The present study investigated whether early auditory processing is suppressed by the top-down influences of such an internal forward model mechanism. To this end, we compared auditory middle latency responses (MLRs) and evoked 40-Hz responses elicited by self-initiated sounds with those elicited by externally initiated but otherwise identical sounds. In the self-initiated condition, the amplitudes of the Pa (27-33 ms relative to sound onset) and Nb (40-46 ms) components of the MLRs were significantly attenuated when compared to the responses elicited by click sounds presented in the externally initiated condition. Similarly, the evoked activity in the 40-Hz and adjacent frequency bands was attenuated. Considering that previous research revealed subcortical and auditory cortex contributions to MLRs and 40-Hz responses, our results support the existence of auditory suppression effects with self-initiated sounds on temporally and structurally early auditory processing levels. This attenuation in the processing of self-initiated sounds most probably contributes to the optimal processing of concurrent external acoustic events.

The information is probably related with the different function, appearance and pathologies of the brain. At the same time this method can also be used to remove those signal's artifacts that do not appear with EP within the same scope of time or frequency. The traditional Fourier filter can hardly attain the similar result. This method is different from other wavelet de-noising methods in that different criteria are employed in choosing wavelet coefficient. It has a biggest virtue of noting the differences among the single training sample and making use of the characteristics of being high time frequency resolution to reduce the effect of interference factors to a maximum extent within the time scope that EP appear. The experiment result proves that this method is not restricted by the signal-to-noise ratio of evoked potential and electroencephalograph and even can recognize instantaneous event under the condition of lower signal-to-noise ratio, as well as recognize more easily the samples, which evoked evident response. In addition, averaging methodology can dramatically reduce the number of record samples needed, thus avoiding the effect of behavior change during the recording process. This methodology pays attention to the differences among single training sample and also accomplishes the extraction of visual evoked potentials from single trainings sample. As a result, system speed and accuracy could be improved to a great extent if this methodology is applied to brain-computer interface system based on evoked responses.

Effects of moderate hypobaric hypoxia on evoked categorical visuocognitive responses	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hypobaric hypoxia; SatO(2)%; categorical visuocognitive ERPs; ERP components peak amplitude and latency; n-ANOVA; productive and inhibitory psychomotor responses	HIGH-ALTITUDE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; STIMULUS CATEGORIZATION; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; MILD HYPOXIA; TIME-COURSE; OBJECT; OXYGEN; EEG; RECOGNITION	Objective: Aim of the current study is to provide electrophysiological evidence about the effects of moderate hypobaric hypoxia on human visual cognition. Methods: We investigate ERPs at occipitoparietal cortical areas in an ultra-rapid categorical discrimination task with psychomotor responses under the conditions of normoxia vs. moderate hypobaric hypoxia. Subjects had to produce motor response upon the categorization of target images containing animals, while suppress it for nontarget images containing only nonanimals. Results: Statistical analysis on peak amplitudes and latencies of ERP components indicated significant: (i) attenuation of PI and enhancement of N1-P3 amplitudes, (ii) delay of P2 latency for both stimuli whereas the delay of P3 latency only for nontargets, (iii) reduction in behavioral performance rates only for nontargets. Conclusions: For both categorical stimuli, impairment of early visual sensory and compensation through late cognitive processes was noticed. For targets, compensatory discrimination-categorization processes (reflected on P3 amplitudes) were sufficient to override our mild transient hypoxic challenge. For nontargets, differential P3 latencies and behavioral performance manifested the early impeding effects of systemic hypoxaemia. Significance: Evoked brain responses allow for early detection of subtle electrophysiological modulations coupled to cognitive-behavioral alterations, assessment of 'functional' hypobaric hypoxic sensitivity thresholds for 'altinauts' and reveal the susceptibilities of complex Visuocognitive processes even to moderate hypoxic insults.

We investigated to what extent a deficit in recognition of emotions in individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) may have its roots in abnormal MSI of emotional cues provided by the sight of a facial expression and an emotional tone of voice. Methods: In twelve high-functioning, adult PDD individuals and thirteen age- and IQ-matched controls, (1) the processing of fearful faces was compared with that of happy faces; (2) MSI was assessed by characterizing the interaction effects of crossmodal presentation, using EEG. Results: Increased PI and N170 amplitudes were seen in response to fearful faces compared with happy faces in both groups. However, PDD individuals differed from healthy controls in NISI of fearful information from visual and auditory cues. Conclusions: Both groups show a similar pattern as concerns the early components of visual emotion processing, but there are anomalies in processing of fearful face-voice combinations in the PDD group. Significance: Because of the importance of rapid MSI for social competence, MSI anomalies in PDD may be linked to the observed deficits in their emotional behavior.

Prediction Errors and Attention in the Presence and Absence of Feedback	CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						prediction error; attention; perceptual learning; categorization; contingency learning; blocking; exposure learning; EEG; ERP; eye tracking	MODEL; POTENTIALS; BLOCKING	Contemporary theories of learning typically assume that learning is driven by prediction errors-in other words, that we learn more when our predictions turn out to be incorrect than we do when our predictions are correct. Results from the recording of electrical brain activity suggest one mechanism by which this might happen; we seem to direct visual attention toward the likely causes of previous prediction errors. This can happen very rapidly-within less than 200 milliseconds of the error-causing object being presented. It is tempting to infer that if learning is driven by prediction errors, then little can be learned in the absence of feedback. Such a conclusion is unwarranted. In fact, the substantial learning that is sometimes the result of simple exposure to objects can also be explained by processes of directing attention toward the likely causes of previous prediction errors.

J	Schwabe, L; Lenggenhager, B; Blanke, O				Schwabe, Lars; Lenggenhager, Bigna; Blanke, Olaf			The Timing of Temporoparietal and Frontal Activations During Mental Own Body Transformations from Different Visuospatial Perspectives	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						mental perspective taking; imagery; first person perspective; electrical brain imaging; event-related; response-locked; LAURA	REFERENCE ELECTRODE; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SELF-RECOGNITION; ROTATION; MOTOR; EXPERIENCE; IMAGERY; AREA; EEG; LOCALIZATION	The perspective from where the world is perceived is an important aspect of the bodily self and may break down in neurological conditions such as out-of-body experiences (OBEs). These striking disturbances are characterized by disembodiment, an external perspective and have been observed after temporoparietal damage. Using mental own body imagery, recent neuroimaging work has linked perspectival changes to the temporoparietal cortex. Because the disembodied perspective during OBEs is elevated in the majority of cases, we tested whether an elevated perspective will interfere with such temporoparietal mechanisms mental own body imagery. We designed stimuli of life-sized humans rotated around the vertical axis and rendered as if viewed from three different perspectives: elevated, lowered, and normal. Reaction times (RTs) in an own body transformation task, but not the control condition, were dependent on the rotation angle. Furthermore, RTs were shorter for the elevated as compared with the normal or lowered perspective. Using high-density EEG and evoked potential (EP) mapping, we found a bilateral temporoparietal and frontal activation at approximate to 330-420 ms after stimulus onset that was dependent on the rotation angle, but not on the perspective. This activation was also found in response-locked EPs. In the time period approximate to 210-330 ms we found a temporally distinct posterior temporal activation with its duration being dependent on the perspective, but not the rotation angle. Collectively, the present findings suggest that temporoparietal and frontal as well as posterior temporal activations and their timing are crucial neuronal correlates of the bodily self as studied by mental imagery.

It has been suggested that this phasic event is a sleep-protective mechanism. Because insomnia sufferers report poor sleep quantity and quality, the objective of this study was to document the occurrence of spontaneous K-complexes in Stage 2 sleep of individuals with chronic insomnia. Specifically, the number and density of spontaneous K-complexes were studied in psychophysiological insomnia sufferers. Setting: This study took place in a sleep and event-related potentials laboratory. Design: Spontaneous K-complexes were scored during Stage 2 sleep on the second and third nights of a four-consecutive-nights protocol of polysomnographic recordings, Participants: The sample included 14 participants suffering from psychophysiological insomnia (INS group; mean age=44.1 years) and 14 good sleepers (mean age=38.1 years). Participants underwent sleep and psychological evaluations. INS group participants met the diagnostic criteria for primary psychophysiological insomnia (mean duration of insomnia=9.6 years). Intervention: Not applicable. Results: The total number of spontaneous K-complexes and the density according to the total time spent in Stage 2 sleep (spontaneous K-complexes per minute) were compiled. Repeated-measures analyses of variance showed no significant difference in the number and density of spontaneous K-complexes between the INS group (313.98 and 2.66) and the GS group (361.10 and 2.88), respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest no deficiency in the sleep-protective mechanism of psychophysiological insomnia sufferers in comparison with good sleepers, as measured by the spontaneous K-complexes' number and density.

Here, we aim to determine the feasibility of performing NIRS measurements of the 'fast optical signal' or Event-Related Optical Signals (EROS) under optimal experimental conditions in awake behaving macaque monkeys. These monkeys were implanted with a 'recording well' to expose the dura above the primary visual cortex (V1). A custom-made optical probe was inserted and fixed into the well. The close proximity of the probe to the brain maximized the sensitivity to changes in optical properties in the cortex. Motion artifacts were minimized by physical restraint of the head. Full-field contrast-reversing checkerboard stimuli were presented to monkeys trained to perform a visual fixation task. In separate sessions, two NIRS systems (CW4 and ISS FD oximeter), which previously showed the ability to measure the fast signal in human, were used. In some sessions EEG was acquired simultaneously with the optical signal. The increased sensitivity to cortical optical changes with our experimental setup was quantified with 3D Monte Carlo simulations on a segmented MRI monkey head. Averages of thousands of stimuli in the same animal, or grand averages across the two animals and across repeated sessions, did not lead to detection of the fast optical signal using either amplitude or phase of the optical signal. Hemodynamic responses and visual evoked potentials were instead always detected with single trials or averages of a few stimuli. Based on these negative results, despite the optimal experimental conditions, we doubt the usefulness of non-invasive fast optical signal measurements with NIRS. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To address this issue, we recorded neurophysiological indicators of syntactic processing to spoken sentences while subjects were distracted to different degrees from language processing. Subjects were either passively distracted, by watching a silent video film, or their attention was actively streamed away from the language input by performing a demanding acoustic signal detection task. An early index of syntactic violations, the syntactic Mismatch Negativity (sMMN), distinguished between grammatical and ungrammatical speech even under strongest distraction. The magnitude of the early sMMN (at < 150 ms) was unaffected by attention load of the distraction task. The independence of the early syntactic brain response of attentional distraction provides neurophysiological evidence for the automaticity of syntax and for its autonomy from other attention-demanding processes, including acoustic stimulus discrimination. The first attentional modulation of syntactic brain responses became manifest at a later stage, at similar to 200 ms, thus demonstrating the narrowness of the early time window of syntactic autonomy. We discuss these results in the light of modular and interactive theories of cognitive processing and draw inferences on the automaticity of both the cognitive MMN response and certain grammar processes in general.

The information is probably related with the different function, appearance and pathologies of the brain. The traditional Fourier filter can hardly attain the similar result. This method is different from other wavelet de-noising methods in that different criteria are employed in choosing wavelet coefficient. It has a biggest virtue of noting the differences among the single training sample and making use of the characteristics of being high time frequency resolution to reduce the effect of interference factors to a maximum extent within the time scope that EP appear. The experiment result proves that this method is not restricted by the signal-to-noise ratio of evoked potential and electroencephalograph and even can recognize instantaneous event under the condition of lower signal-to-noise ratio, as well as recognize more easily the samples which evoked evident response. Therefore, more evident average evoked response could be achieved by denosing the signals obtained through averaging out the samples that can evoke evident responses than de-nosing the average of original signals. In addition, averaging methodology can dramatically reduce the number of record samples needed, thus avoiding the effect of behavior change during the recording process. This methodology pays attention to the differences among single training sample and also accomplishes the extraction of visual evoked potentials from single trainings sample. As a result, system speed and accuracy could be improved to a great extent if this methodology is applied to brain-computer interface system based on evoked responses.

The information is probably related with the different function, appearance and pathologies of the brain. The traditional Fourier filter can hardly attain the similar result. This method is different from other wavelet de-noising methods in that different criteria are employed in choosing wavelet coefficient. It has a biggest virtue of noting the differences among the single training sample and making use of the characteristics of being high time frequency resolution to reduce the effect of interference factors to a maximum extent within the time scope that EP appear. The experiment result proves that this method is not restricted by the signal-to-noise ratio of evoked potential and electroencephalograph and even can recognize instantaneous event under the condition of lower signal-to-noise ratio, as well as recognize more easily the samples which evoked evident response. Therefore, more evident average evoked response could be achieved by denosing the signals obtained through averaging out the samples that can evoke evident responses than de-nosing the average of original signals. In addition, averaging methodology can dramatically reduce the number of record samples needed, thus avoiding the effect of behavior change during the recording process. This methodology pays attention to the differences among single training sample and also accomplishes the extraction of visual evoked potentials from single trainings sample.

Localization of the syntactic mismatch negativity in the temporal cortex: An MEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Syntactic mismatch negativity; Phrase structure violation; Sensory hypothesis; Sylvian fissure; Primary auditory cortex; Superior temporal sulcus; Planum polare	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; AUDITORY INFORMATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENSORY MEMORY; LANGUAGE; SPEECH; ATTENTION; GRAMMAR	Recent auditory oddball studies using syntactic stimuli report a syntactic effect on the mismatch negativity (sMMN) around 100-200 ms. For morphosyntactic violations, this sMMN effect has been localized in the left superior temporal cortex. Independently, a recent visual sentence processing study introduced a "sensory hypothesis" which postulates that sensory cortices are sensitive to syntactic violations when these are overtly marked by closed-class morphemes, and thus contribute to early syntax-related effects in EEG and MEG. The present study aimed to test the sensory hypothesis in the auditory modality by localizing the neuronal sources of the sMMN to phrase structure violations. Using whole head magnetoencephalography, two-word utterances which were syntactically correct, uncommon or incorrect due to a word category violation were presented in an auditory oddball paradigm. In the sMMN time window (100-180 ms), incorrect phrases elicited strongest activation in the left Sylvian fissure ( including the primary auditory cortex) and in the left superior temporal sulcus. Prior to this, a very early grammaticality effect (40-80 ms), focused in the left Sylvian fissure, was found. An additional grammaticality effect in a later time window (280-380 ms) was localized in the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus, the planum polare. Processing of an uncommon phrase did not differ from processing a correct phrase in any of the time windows, indicating the genuinely syntactic nature of the sMMN effect. Our results are in line with previous studies localizing the sMMN to morphosyntactic violations and are furthermore compatible with the sensory hypothesis of closed-class morphology based syntactic processes.

This chapter summarizes results of imaging the processing of these attributes of auditory stimuli that takes place in parallel during a time period of about 100 msec (80-170 msec) after onset of a sound. Electrophysiological functional imaging of auditory processing of sound onset, offset, it's detection as deviant and its formation from a cluster of acoustic features allowed reasonable spatial resolution coupled with unparalleled temporal resolution. Such imaging allowed following the time course of processing a variety of sounds attributes. The time courses that are thus revealed are sensitive to the nature of the stimulus and different aspects of the stimulus were found to be analyzed in parallel in different brain areas. Different modes of processing manifest in different time courses of brain activity as revealed by electrophysiological functional imaging of dyslexics vs. normal readers. These results indicate that the brain is a parallel processor that simultaneously handles many aspects of the processed material and adapts this processing with experience.

Behavioral experiments have led to the proposal that, in fact, peripheral perceptual and motor stages continue to operate in parallel, and that only a central decision stage imposes a serial bottleneck. We tested this model using neuroimaging methods combined with innovative time-sensitive analysis tools. Subjects performed a dual-task visual-auditory paradigm in which a delay of 300 ms was injected into the auditory task either within or outside of the dual-task interference period. Event-related potentials indicated that the first similar to 250 ms of processing were insensitive to dual-task interference, and that the PRP was mainly reflected in a delayed global component. By a clustering analysis based on time-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified networks with qualitatively different timing properties: sensory areas tracked the objective time of stimulus presentation, a bilateral parietoprefrontal network correlated with the PRP delay, and an extended bilateral network that included bilateral posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior part of the insula, and cerebellum was shared by both tasks during the extent of dual-task performance. The results provide physiological evidence for the coexistence of serial and parallel processes within a cognitive task.

However, since most auditory studies focus on head-restrained conditions, it is still unclear whether neurophysiological markers of auditory spatial processing reflect representation in a head-centered or an allocentric coordinate system. Therefore, we used human electroencephalography to test whether the spatial mismatch negativity (MMN) as a marker of spatial change processing is elicited by changes of sound source position in terms of a head-related or an allocentric coordinate system. Subjects listened to a series of virtually localized band-passed noise tones and were occasionally cued visually to conduct horizontal head movements. After these head movements, we presented deviants either in terms of a head-centered or an allocentric coordinate system. We observed significant MMN responses to the head-related deviants only but a change-related novelty P3-like component for both head-related and allocentric deviants. These results thus suggest that the spatial MMN is associated with a representation of auditory space in a head-related coordinate system and that the integration of motor output and auditory input possibly occurs at later stages of the auditory "where" processing stream.

They have recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from subjects viewing four types of Kanji (Chinese characters being used currently in the Japanese language) and arrows that were presented on a CRT. Each of the four characters or symbols denoted direction for upward, downward, leftward and rightward, respectively. Subjects were asked to read the characters or symbols, silently. EEGs were averaged for each stimulus type and direction, and event related potentials (ERPs) were obtained. The equivalent current dipole source localization (ECDL) method has been applied to these ERPs. In both cases, equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) were localized to areas related to the working memory for spatial perception, such as the right upper or the right middle frontal areas. Taking into account these facts, the authors have investigated a single trial EEGs of the subject precisely after the latency at 400 ms, and it was determined effective sampling latencies for the discriminant analysis to four types of arrow: up arrow, down arrow, <- and ->. EEG data have been sampled at latency from 400 ms to 900 ms at 25 ms interval by the three channels in the right upper and the right middle frontal gyri. Results of the discriminant analysis for four type objective variates, presented discriminant rates were above 80%. By four type code of infrared rays according to the discrimination results from a PC, the authors have controlled a micro robot, the e-puck, with four orders: forward, rotate clockwise, rotate counter-clockwise and stop.

In the present study, we investigated whether an early electrophysiological difference between voice and non-voice stimuli could be observed. Results: ERPs were recorded from 32 healthy volunteers who listened to 200 ms long stimuli from three sound categories - voices, bird songs and environmental sounds - whilst performing a pure-tone detection task. ERP analyses revealed voice/non-voice amplitude differences emerging as early as 164 ms post stimulus onset and peaking around 200 ms on fronto-temporal (positivity) and occipital (negativity) electrodes. Conclusion: Our electrophysiological results suggest a rapid brain discrimination of sounds of voice, termed the "fronto-temporal positivity to voices" (FTPV), at latencies comparable to the well-known face-preferential N170.

J. Crow suggested that the genetic variance associated with the evolution in Homo sapiens of hemispheric dominance for language carries with it the hazard of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Individuals lacking the typical left hemisphere advantage for language, in particular for phonological components, would be at increased risk of the typical symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and delusions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Twelve schizophrenic patients treated with low levels of neuroleptics and twelve matched healthy controls participated in an event-related potential experiment. Subjects matched word-pairs in three tasks: rhyming/phonological, semantic judgment and word recognition. Slow evoked potentials were recorded from 26 scalp electrodes, and a laterality index was computed for anterior and posterior regions during the inter stimulus interval. During phonological processing individuals with schizophrenia failed to achieve the left hemispheric dominance consistently observed in healthy controls. The effect involved anterior (fronto-temporal) brain regions and was specific for the Phonological task; group differences were small or absent when subjects processed the same stimulus material in a Semantic task or during Word Recognition, i.e. during tasks that typically activate more widespread areas in both hemispheres. Conclusions/Significance: We show for the first time how the deficit of lateralization in the schizophrenic brain is specific for the phonological component of language. This loss of hemispheric dominance would explain typical symptoms, e. g. when an individual's own thoughts are perceived as an external intruding voice. The change can be interpreted as a consequence of "hemispheric indecision'', a failure to segregate phonological engrams in one hemisphere.

Toward a high-throughput auditory P300-based brain-computer interface	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; EEG; P300; Event-related potential; Rehabilitation	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; STIMULUS PARADIGM; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; P300 TOPOGRAPHY; P3A; BCI; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; SPELLER	Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology can provide severely disabled people with nonmuscular communication. For those most severely disabled, limitations in eye mobility or visual acuity may necessitate auditory BCI systems. The present study investigates the efficacy of the use of six environmental sounds to operate a 6 x 6 P300 Speller. Methods: A two-group design was used to ascertain whether participants benefited from visual cues early in training. Group A (N = 5) received only auditory stimuli during all I I sessions, whereas Group AV (N = 5) received simultaneous auditory and visual stimuli in initial sessions after which the visual stimuli were systematically removed. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis determined the matrix item that elicited the largest P300 response and thereby identified the desired choice. Results: Online results and offline analyses showed that the two groups achieved equivalent accuracy. In the last session, eight of 10 participants achieved 50% or more, and four of these achieved 75% or more, online accuracy (2.8% accuracy expected by chance). Mean bit rates averaged about 2 bits/min, and maximum bit rates reached 5.6 bits/min. Conclusions: This study indicates that an auditory P300 BCI is feasible, that reasonable classification accuracy and rate of communication are achievable, and that the paradigm should be further evaluated with a group of severely disabled participants who have limited visual mobility. Significance: With further development, this auditory P300 BCI could be of substantial value to severely disabled people who cannot use a visual BCI.

We designed a resistor mesh model (RMM), based on the finite volume method (FVM) to simulate the electrical properties of this head model along the three axes for each voxel. Then, we introduced four dipoles of high eccentricity (about 0.8) in this RMM, separately and simultaneously, to compute the potentials for two sets of conductivities. We used the direct cortical imaging technique (CIT) to recover the simulated dipoles, using 60 or 107 electrodes and with or without addition of Gaussian white noise (GWN). The use of realistic conductivities gave better CIT results than standard conductivities, lowering the blurring effect on scalp potentials and displaying more accurate position areas when CIT was applied to single dipoles. Simultaneous dipoles were less accurately localized, but good qualitative and stable quantitative results were obtained up to 5% noise level for 107 electrodes and up to 10% noise level for 60 electrodes, showing that a compromise must be found to optimize both the number of electrodes and the noise level. With the RMM defined in 2 mm voxels, the standard 128-electrode cap and 5% noise appears to be the upper limit providing reliable source positions when direct CIT is used. The admittance matrix defining the RMM is easy to modify so as to adapt to different conductivities. The next step will be the adaptation of individual real head T2 images to the RMM template and the introduction of anisotropy using diffusion imaging (DI).

The present study emphasizes the relevance of prolongation of alpha responses in auditory oddball paradigm. Two types of stimuli were applied to twenty subjects. As standard stimuli 80 dB-1500 Hz tones and the target stimuli 80 dB-1600 Hz tones were used. The prolongations of alpha responses were measured in 13 recording sites in the frequency range of 8-13 Hz. At the Cz recording site, the time period for reaching one third (duration of prolongation) of its peak-to-peak amplitude (1/3 latency) of alpha response to target was 446 ms. The prolongation of nontarget stimuli was 277 ms. Thus, the alpha response to target was significantly more prolonged than the alpha response to nontarget stimuli. Similarly, at C3, the alpha response to target stimuli was prolonged to 373 ms. The alpha response to nontarget stimuli was prolonged to 284 ms. The target alpha response was more prolonged in comparison to the non-target alpha results. The alpha response to target stimuli (431 ms) was also more prolonged in comparison with the alpha response upon non-target stimuli (266 ms) at the C4 recording site. The results indicate that the alpha responses are prolonged under a certain level of cognitive load and working memory. Alpha prolongation is a significant component of P300 responses. It can be Suggested that the cognitive load dependency of alpha responses upon the targets could be related to working memory. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maturation of sensory gating performance in children with and without sensory processing disorders	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory gating; EEG/ERP; Children; Development; Sensory processing deficits	AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSES; P50 SUPPRESSION; POTENTIALS P50; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HABITUATION; DEFICITS; STIMULATION; INHIBITION; MODULATION	Recent interest in sensory gating in children with and without neuropsychological disorders has resulted in a number of studies and the results regarding the developmental trajectory of sensory gating are inconsistent. We investigated the maturational course of sensory gating in samples of typically developing children and children with sensory processing deficits (SPD) and compared their performance to adults. Besides gating ratios, we also examined the brain responses to conditioning and test click stimuli in the sensory gating paradigm separately to clarify if the changes in click amplitudes could explain the maturational change in the T/C ratio in children. Eighteen adults with no known disorders, 25 typical children, and 28 children with SPD participated in this study. The children ranged in ages between 5 and 12 years. The three groups differed in their P50 and N100 ERP components. Both child groups displayed significantly less gating than the adults. Children with SPD demonstrated significantly less gating and more within-group variability compared to typical children. There were significant relationships between age and T/C ratios and between age and peak-to-peak amplitude of the conditioning click in typical children but not in children with SPD. Typical children demonstrated significantly smaller brain response amplitudes to the clicks as compared to adults. These findings suggest that there is a maturational course of sensory gating in typical children and if there is a maturational trajectory in children with SPD it appears to be different than typical children. In addition, children with SPD were found to be lacking in their ability to filter out repeated auditory input and failed to selectively regulate their sensitivity to sensory stimuli.

In Experiment 1, we employed an easy detection task and in Experiment 2 a challenging discrimination task. Sustained attention was manipulated by presenting vibrotactile stimuli simultaneously to the index fingers of both hands for a period of 3 s. These stimuli elicited the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP). Subjects attended to one body side and had to detect target-stimuli that were embedded in the ongoing vibratory streams. When subjects discriminated target-stimuli we found increased SSSEP amplitudes of the to-be-attended vibrotactile stream and greater N140 amplitudes of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). During stimulus detection no such facilitation of the SSSEP was found. Greater N140 amplitudes elicited by to-be-ignored distracters indicated that they pull attention to that body location under conditions of low load. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It manifests mostly by an inability to recognise familiar persons. Electrophysiological research has demonstrated the relevance to face processing of a negative deflection peaking around 170 ms, labelled accordingly as N170 in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and M170 in magnetoencephalography (MEG). The M170 was shown to be sensitive to the inversion of faces and to familiarity-two factors that are assumed to be crucial for congenital prosopagnosia. In order to locate the cognitive dysfunction and its neural correlates, we investigated the time course of neural activity in response to these manipulations. Methodology: Seven individuals with congenital prosopagnosia and seven matched controls participated in the experiment. To explore brain activity with high accuracy in time, we recorded evoked magnetic fields (275 channel whole head MEG) while participants were looking at faces differing in familiarity (famous vs. unknown) and orientation (upright vs. inverted). The underlying neural sources were estimated by means of the least square minimum-norm-estimation (L2-MNE) approach. Principal Findings: The behavioural data corroborate earlier findings on impaired configural processing in congenital prosopagnosia. For the M170, the overall results replicated earlier findings, with larger occipito-temporal brain responses to inverted than upright faces, and more right-than left-hemispheric activity. Compared to controls, participants with congenital prosopagnosia displayed a general decrease in brain activity, primarily over left occipitotemporal areas. This attenuation did not interact with familiarity or orientation. Conclusions: The study substantiates the finding of an early involvement of the left hemisphere in symptoms of prosopagnosia. This might be related to an efficient and overused featural processing strategy which serves as a compensation of impaired configural processing.

The methods used by both of these approaches have been mostly objective. This quest of objectification has led to vigorous use of tools like EEG and ERP, which has definitely led to revealing of marvellous aspects of meditation. However the subjective states of meditation have been much less explored, especially when seen in contrast to the objective states. The need of the hour is to use the qualitative methods for exploration of these states because these methods better depict the unique experiences of meditation. In this context, we conducted a qualitative study in the form of Interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore the subjective experiences associated with the inner-light perception of a group of meditators practising the meditation technique of Vihangam Yoga. It is an ancient meditation technique of India, initiated by HH Sadguru Sadafal Deoji Maharaj in the year 1924 and now being propogated by HH Sadguru Swatantra Deoji Maharaj. When asked in detail, the practitioners often report of many mystique experiences. This particular Yoga group was chosen because in a survey of among four groups, the maximum number of confident mediators reporting of perceiving some sort of luminance during meditation was found in this group. For this study, the inner-light perception experience of this meditation was chosen because (if the divine value attached to this experience across all the cultures and religions. This experience was also chosen because of the great impact on their lives that Vihangam Yogis attributed to this experience. As the results of the study, four major themes were obtained which were: (a) Uniqueness of the nature of light (b) Experiences during light perception (c) Explanations of the source of light (d) Change in outlook towards world and associated changes in thinking.

Transmission of Facial Expressions of Emotion Co-Evolved with Their Efficient Decoding in the Brain: Behavioral and Brain Evidence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL RECOGNITION; SPATIAL SCALES; ERP EVIDENCE; FACE; INFORMATION; AMYGDALA; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; OBJECTS; DISCRIMINATION	Competent social organisms will read the social signals of their peers. In primates, the face has evolved to transmit the organism's internal emotional state. Adaptive action suggests that the brain of the receiver has co-evolved to efficiently decode expression signals. Here, we review and integrate the evidence for this hypothesis. With a computational approach, we co-examined facial expressions as signals for data transmission and the brain as receiver and decoder of these signals. First, we show in a model observer that facial expressions form a lowly correlated signal set. Second, using time-resolved EEG data, we show how the brain uses spatial frequency information impinging on the retina to decorrelate expression categories. Between 140 to 200 ms following stimulus onset, independently in the left and right hemispheres, an information processing mechanism starts locally with encoding the eye, irrespective of expression, followed by a zooming out to processing the entire face, followed by a zooming back in to diagnostic features (e.g. the opened eyes in "fear'', the mouth in "happy''). A model categorizer demonstrates that at 200 ms, the left and right brain have represented enough information to predict behavioral categorization performance.

Currently, prediction is based only on behavioral assessment of early phonological processing deficits associated with dyslexia, but it might be improved by adding brain-based measures. Methods: In a 5-year longitudinal study of children with (n = 21) and without (n = 23) familial risk for dyslexia, we tested whether neurophysiological measures of automatic phoneme and tone deviance processing obtained in kindergarten would improve prediction of reading over behavioral measures alone. Results: Together, neurophysiological and behavioral measures obtained in kindergarten significantly predicted reading in school. Particularly the late mismatch negativity measure that indicated hemispheric lateralization of automatic phoneme processing improved prediction of reading ability over behavioral measures. It was also the only significant predictor for long-term reading success in fifth grade. Importantly, this result also held for the subgroup of children at familial risk. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that brain-based measures of processing deficits associated with dyslexia improve prediction of reading and thus may be further evaluated to complement clinical practice of dyslexia prediction, especially in targeted populations, such as children with a familial risk.

J	Smith, AP				Smith, Andrew Paul			Chewing gum, stress and health	STRESS AND HEALTH			English	Article						Chewing gum; Stress; Health	PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; MEMORY; MOOD; MASTICATION; ATTENTION; HUMANS; SCALE; EEG	Hollingworth described chewing gum as 'a technique of relaxation'. Recent research has examined this issue and there is evidence that chewing gum can prevent the adverse effects of acute stress. There are also plausible biological mechanisms that could explain such effects. It is now important to examine chewing gum and chronic stress and the present study involved a survey of this topic. The survey covered the 'stress process, collecting data on exposure to stressful events, levels of perceived stress and health outcomes. Frequency of chewing gum was also recorded. Potential confounding factors (demographics, personality and health-related behaviours) were also recorded. The web-based survey was completed by a community sample of 2,248 full-time workers (68% female. Mean age: 35 years, range 18-74 years). Sixty-one per cent of the sample were gum chewers. The results showed that chewing gum was associated with lower levels of perceived stress (both at work and life in general). Gum chewers were also less likely to be depressed and to have seen their doctor for high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Chewing gum was associated with lower levels of alcohol consumption and with cigarette smoking. Gum chewers were also more likely to be neurotic extraverts. Those who chewed gum were also more likely to be exposed to negative factors at work. Logistic regression analyses showed that the effects of chewing gum on stress and health remained significant when these confounding factors were controlled for. These results suggest that chewing gum may be a simple way of preventing stress and the negative health outcomes that are often associated with it. Intervention studies are now required and the mechanisms underlying the effects reported here need further investigation. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Methods: P50 and N100 suppression were assessed with an auditory double-click paradigm in five groups: 18 at-risk subjects who did not develop a full psychosis within the follow-up period of 2 years, 21 truly prodromal subjects who developed frank psychosis within the follow-up period, 46 antipsychotic-naive subjects with first-episode schizophrenia, 20 antipsychotic-free subjects with chronic schizophrenia, and 46 healthy control subjects. Results: P50 and N100 suppression indices differed significantly between groups and were lowest in chronic schizophrenia patients. Compared with healthy control subjects, P50 suppression was significantly impaired in at-risk subjects, truly prodromal and first-episode patients (stimulus 2 [S2]/stimulus 1 [S1] P50 amplitude ratio), and chronic schizophrenia patients (difference and ratio), and N100 suppression was significantly reduced in truly prodromal and first-episode patients (S1-S2 difference) and in chronic schizophrenia patients (difference and ratio) but not at-risk subjects. At-risk subjects with and without conversion to psychosis did not significantly differ on any test parameter. Conclusions: Sensory gating is already impaired in early stages of schizophrenia, though this is most prominent in chronic stages. Future studies will have to clarify the type and impact of variables modifying sensory gating disturbances, such as illness progression and genetic load. Furthermore, the meaning and nature of differences between P50 and N100 suppression need further elucidation.

J	Naatanen, R; Kahkonen, S				Naatanen, Risto; Kahkonen, Seppo			Central auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia as revealed by the mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetic equivalent MMNm : a review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Auditory discrimination; magnetoencephalographic equivalent of MMN (MMNm); mismatch negativity (MMN); schizophrenia	NMDA-RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; SENSORY MEMORY; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; PLANUM TEMPORALE; PROGRESSIVE DECREASE; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; SPEECH SOUNDS	Since the early 1990s, the auditory change-detection response, mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetoencephalographic (MEG) equivalent MMNm have been applied in a large number of studies on schizophrenia. These studies have enhanced our understanding of the central auditory dysfunction underlying schizophrenia. The attenuation of the MMN amplitude is a systematic and robust neurophysiological finding in these patients. The gradual attenuation of the MMN amplitude resulting from frequency change reflects the progress of the disease, particularly the impairment occurring as a function of illness duration, whereas the MMN deficiency for duration change may be more closely linked to the genetic aspect of the illness. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies, together, suggest that both the temporal and frontal cortices contributing to MMN generation are affected in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in auditory perception and discrimination revealed by a deficient temporal MMN generator process might be associated with patients' positive symptoms, whereas the dampened frontal attention-switching function, suggested by the attenuated responses of the frontal MMN generator, might contribute to the negative symptoms such as social withdrawal. In addition, gradual MMN amplitude reduction, in particular that for frequency change, reflects cognitive and functional impairment occurring as a function of illness duration. Finally, as MMN can be detected even in animals such as the mouse, it might provide a useful biomarker for assessing the effects of the drugs developed to fight the cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenia patients.

There is a growing interest in the use of recording from the surface of the brain, known as electrocorticography (ECoG), as a practical signal platform for brain-computer interface application. The signal has a combination of high signal quality and long-term stability that may be the ideal intermediate modality for future application. The research paradigm for studying ECoG signals uses patients requiring invasive monitoring for seizure localization. The implanted arrays span cortex areas on the order of centimeters. Currently, it is unknown what level of motor information can be discerned from small regions of human cortex with microscale ECoG recording. Methods. In this study, a patient requiring invasive monitoring for seizure localization underwent concurrent implantation with a 16-microwire array (1-mm electrode spacing) placed over primary motor cortex. Microscale activity was recorded while the patient performed simple contra-and ipsilateral wrist movements that were monitored in parallel with electromyography. Using various statistical methods, linear and nonlinear relationships between these microcortical changes and recorded electromyography activity were defined. Results. Small regions of primary motor cortex (<5 mm) carry sufficient information to separate multiple aspects of motor movements (that is, wrist flexion/extension and ipsilateral/contralateral movements). Conclusions. These findings support the conclusion that small regions of cortex investigated by ECoG recording may provide sufficient information about motor intentions to support brain-computer interface operations in the future. Given the small scale of the cortical region required, the requisite implanted array would be minimally invasive in terms of surgical placement of the electrode array.

Low penetration of oseltamivir and its carboxylate into cerebrospinal fluid in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers	ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; PRODRUG OSELTAMIVIR; ANTIINFLUENZA DRUG; DELIRIOUS BEHAVIOR; ACTIVE METABOLITE; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; EEG FINDINGS; RO 64-0802; INFLUENZA; CHILDREN	Oseltamivir is a potent, well-tolerated antiviral for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Although no relationship with treatment could be demonstrated, recent reports of abnormal behavior in young individuals with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir have generated renewed interest in the central nervous system (CNS) tolerability of oseltamivir. This single-center, open-label study explored the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy adult volunteers over a 24-hour interval to determine the CNS penetration of both these compounds. Four Japanese and four Caucasian males were enrolled in the study. Oseltamivir and OC concentrations in CSF were low (mean of observed maximum concentrations [C-max], 2.4 ng/ml [oseltamivir] and 19.0 ng/ml [OC]) versus those in plasma (mean C-max, 115 ng/ml [oseltamivir] and 544 ng/ml [OC]), with corresponding C-max CSF/plasma ratios of 2.1% (oseltamivir) and 3.5% (OC). Overall exposure to oseltamivir and OC in CSF was also comparatively low versus that in plasma (mean area under the concentration-time curve CSF/plasma ratio, 2.4% [oseltamivir] and 2.9% [OC]). No gross differences in the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir or OC were observed between the Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Oseltamivir was well tolerated. This demonstrates that the CNS penetration of oseltamivir and OC is low in Japanese and Caucasian adults. Emerging data support the idea that oseltamivir and OC have limited potential to induce or exacerbate CNS adverse events in individuals with influenza. A disease-rather than drug-related effect appears likely.	[Rayner, C. R.] F Hoffmann La Roche & Co Ltd, Div Pharmaceut, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Jhee, S.

Development of infant mismatch responses to auditory pattern changes between 2 and 4 months old	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory perception; development; EEG; MMN; pattern perception; pitch	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PRIMITIVE INTELLIGENCE; NEWBORN-INFANTS; MELODIC CONTOUR; SOUND FEATURES; NEGATIVITY MMN; PITCH CHANGE; STIMULI	In order to process speech and music, the auditory cortex must learn to process patterns of sounds. Our previous studies showed that with a stream consisting of a repeating (standard) sound, younger infants show an increase in the amplitude of a positive slow wave in response to occasional changes (deviants) in pitch or duration, whereas older infants show a faster negative response that resembles mismatch negativity (MMN) in adults (Trainor et al., 2001, 2003; He et al., 2007). MMN reflects an automatic change-detection process that does not require attention, conscious awareness or behavioural response for its elicitation (Picton et al., 2000; NAAtAnen et al., 2007). It is an important tool for understanding auditory perception because MMN reflects a change-detection mechanism, and not simply that repetition of a stimulus results in a refractory state of sensory neural circuits while occasional changes to a new sound activate new non-refractory neural circuits (NAAtAnen et al., 2005). For example, MMN is elicited by a change in the pattern of a repeating note sequence, even when no new notes are introduced that could activate new sensory circuits (Alain et al., 1994, 1999;Schroger et al., 1996). In the present study, we show that in response to a change in the pattern of two repeating tones, MMN in 4-month-olds remains robust whereas the 2-month-old response does not. This indicates that the MMN response to a change in pattern at 4 months reflects the activation of a change-detection mechanism similarly as in adults.

A virtually uncountable number of studies in animals and humans have revealed changes in neural activity in this structure during memory formation [Squire LR. Memory and the hippocampus: a synthesis from findings with rats, monkeys, and humans. Psychol Rev 1992;99:195-231; Squire LR, Stark CE, Clark RE. The medial temporal lobe. Annu Rev Neurosci 2004;27:279-306], and hippocampal damage reliably leads to impairments in a large number of memory tests. However, while several correlates of successful memory formation have been found in the hippocampus, it is still an open question why specific neural processes support encoding of a particular item. An answer to this question would help to resolve current debates about which memory functions are actually supported by the hippocampus, and why activity in the neural networks of the hippocampus is involved in, or even necessary for, some memory processes but not for others. In this review, we first summarize findings on the electrophysiological activity within the hippocampus during different memory processes. We try to differentiate whether the hippocampus is merely involved in these processes, or whether the hippocampus appears to be necessary for them. Based on a distinction between a more general "encoding state" and the more specific process of "content-specific memory formation", we review data on neural representations within hippocampus and neocortex. We suggest that during memory formation, the hippocampus renders neural representations more sparse by providing an inhibitory signal to the neocortex. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pioneering studies have demonstrated that hemispheric specializations for language processing are already present in early infancy. However, whether these computational asymmetries can be considered a function of linguistic attributes or a consequence of basic temporal signal properties is under debate. Several studies in adults link hemispheric specialization for certain aspects of speech perception to an asymmetry in cortical tuning and reveal that the auditory cortices are differentially sensitive to spectrotemporal features of speech. Applying concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) and hemodynamic (near-infrared spectroscopy) recording to newborn infants listening to temporally structured nonspeech signals, we provide evidence that newborns process nonlinguistic acoustic stimuli that share critical temporal features with language in a differential manner. The newborn brain preferentially processes temporal modulations especially relevant for phoneme perception. In line with multi-time-resolution conceptions, modulations on the time scale of phonemes elicit strong bilateral cortical responses. Our data furthermore suggest that responses to slow acoustic modulations are lateralized to the right hemisphere. That is, the newborn auditory cortex is sensitive to the temporal structure of the auditory input and shows an emerging tendency for functional asymmetry. Hence, our findings support the hypothesis that development of speech perception is linked to basic capacities in auditory processing. From birth, the brain is tuned to critical temporal properties of linguistic signals to facilitate one of the major needs of humans: to communicate.

Methods: Healthy individuals performed two versions of a manual color-word Stroop task, varying in the probability of incongruent color-words, while EEG was recorded. Results: Stroop interference effect was manifested as longer reaction times for incongruent relative to congruent color-words, and was larger in a task version where incongruent color-words were presented less frequently. Whereas the congruence between color display and word meaning did not affect average stimulus- and response-locked lateralized readiness potential (LRP) onset latencies nor response-locked LRP amplitudes, P3 peak latencies were longer and stimulus-locked LRPs were smaller for incongruent than congruent trials. Conclusions: These data are consistent with the idea that behavioral Stroop interference reflects delays in processing stages preceding color-based selective response activation in a subset of trials. They also do not exclude additional delays after color-based selective response activation, at least up until some 200 ms before the overt response. Significance: This chronometric analysis allows for a parcellation of the Stroop interference process that may be applied in psychopathology.

Cannabis use disrupts eyeblink conditioning: Evidence for cannabinoid modulation of cerebellar-dependent learning	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						THC; cannabinoid; cerebellum; eyeblink conditioning; behavior; human	NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; RETROGRADE INHIBITION; NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; RECEPTOR-BINDING; MARIJUANA USERS; AGONIST GTS-21; RABBIT; BRAIN; ATTENTION	While the cerebellum contains the highest density of cannabinoid receptor (CBI) in the brain, no studies have assessed the effect of exogenous cannabinoids on cerebellar-dependent learning in humans. The current study, therefore, examined the effect of chronic cannabis use on classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a cerebellar-mediated task which has been shown to be disrupted in CBI knockout mice. Chronic cannabis users (24 h abstinence before study; positive THC urine drug test) free of DSM-IV Axis-I or -II disorders, were evaluated. A delay EBC task was utilized, in which a conditioned stimulus (CS; 400 ms tone) co-terminated with a corneal air puff unconditioned stimulus (US; 50 ms), thus eliciting a conditioned blink response (CR). The cannabis group exhibited markedly fewer, and more poorly timed CRs as compared to drug-naive controls. There were no differences between the groups in either the unconditioned response (UR) or an EEG measure of selective attention to the CS (N100 auditory ERP), indicating that the disruption observed in the cannabis group was specific to CR acquisition. These results suggest that cannabis use is associated with functional deficits in the cerebellar circuitry underlying EBC, a finding which corroborates the recent work in CBI knockout mice.

As the subject was watching a silent movie, standard tones (1000-Hz frequency, 100-ms duration) and their duration deviants (50-ms duration, probability of 15%) were randomly delivered binaurally. In addition to localizing the magnetic counterpart of mismatch negativity (MMNm) with equivalent current dipole modeling, we also measured the phase-locking value (PLV) and power change of the oscillatory responses to standard and deviant stimuli by employing the Morlet wavelet-based analysis. The MMNm signals peaking at 150-200 ms after the onset of deviant were localized in bilateral temporal regions with larger amplitudes in the right hemisphere. Then 50 ms after the onset of either standard or deviant stimuli, we observed an increase of PLV and power of theta and alpha oscillations in bilateral temporal regions. PLVs of theta and alpha activities to deviant stimuli were significantly larger in the right than left hemisphere (P < 0.001). Compared with standard stimuli, deviants elicited a larger theta PLV (P < 0.001) at 150-300 ms and a larger theta power change (P < 0.05) at 50-300 ms for the responses in the right temporal region. In addition, a prominent theta phase-locking of deviant-elicited responses was found in the right frontal area at 110-250 ms (P < 0.01). Our current data suggest that a pronounced phase and power modulation on sound-elicited theta oscillations might characterize the change detection processing in the temporo-frontal network as reflected by the mismatch negativity.

However, it is not clear how unpredictability in the timing of the impending pain stimulus interacts with dread and whether the two factors show differential effects on the neural generators of the pain-evoked response. Methods: We manipulated the duration of anticipation of laser-induced pain independently of unpredictability of stimulus delivery timing, to observe the relative effect on 112 amplitudes of the laser-evoked potential (LEP) response and its estimated sources. Results: Subjects (n = 12) reported increased pain ratings after longer pain anticipation, irrespective of Unpredictability in the timing of stimulus delivery. By contrast, Unpredictability in stimulus timing increased the amplitude of the P2 irrespective of anticipation duration. The modulation of P2 amplitude by unpredictability was localized to midcingulate cortex (MCC) and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory (S2) areas. Greater anticipation duration increased activity in a hippocampal-insula-prefrontal network but not in MCC areas. Conclusions: Distinct neural networks contribute to the P2 and are differentially affected by pain anticipation duration and Unpredictability in stimulus timing. Significance: ERP research into dread should be careful to appreciate the neural generators of pain-evoked responses and their potential modulation by unpredictability.

Intracranial Recording and Source Localization of Auditory Brain Responses Elicited at the 50 ms Latency in Three Children Aged from 3 to 16 Years	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Maturation; Auditory ERP; Intracranial recording; Temporal lobe; Source localization	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS; BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VOLUME-CONDUCTOR; SOURCE MODELS; P50; EEG; MATURATION; CORTEX; FIELD	Maturational studies of the auditory-evoked brain response at the 50 ms latency provide an insight into why this response is aberrant in a number of psychiatric disorders that have developmental origin. Here, using intracranial recordings we found that neuronal activity of the primary contributors to this response can be localised at the lateral part of Heschl's gyrus already at the age of 3.5 years. This study provides results to support the notion that deviations in cognitive function(s) attributed to the auditory P50 in adults might involve abnormalities in neuronal activity of the frontal lobe or in the interaction between the frontal and temporal lobes. Validation and localisation of progenitors of the adults' P50 in young children is a much-needed step in the understanding of the biological significance of different subcomponents that comprise the auditory P50 in the adult brain. In combination with other approaches investigating neuronal mechanisms of auditory P50, the present results contribute to the greater understanding of what and why neuronal activity underlying this response is aberrant in a number of brain dysfunctions. Moreover, the present source localisation results of auditory response at the 50 ms latency might be useful in paediatric neurosurgery practice.

J	Sebastian, C; Yasin, I				Sebastian, Catherine; Yasin, Ifat			Speech versus tone processing in compensated dyslexia: Discrimination and lateralization with a dichotic mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dichotic; MMN; Auditory; Speech; Dyslexia; Lateralization	ALTERED HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; CONSONANT-VOWEL SYLLABLES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; LISTENING PERFORMANCE; INTELLIGIBLE SPEECH; PLANUM-TEMPORALE; 2 EARS; BRAIN	This study investigated the possibility of a pervasive auditory-processing deficit in 10 adult dyslexics who had compensated for their reading disability, compared to 10 matched controls. Unlike previous studies [Baldeweg,T., Richardson, A., Watkins, S., Foale, C. & Gruzelier, J. (1999). Impaired auditory frequency discrimination in dyslexia detected with mismatch evoked potentials. Annals of Neurology, 45(4): 495-503], the current EEG study used a dichotic presentation of stimuli in order to probe the relationship between ear advantage and left- and right-hemisphere dominance for processing speech and non-speech stimuli respectively. A dichotic presentation is thought to maximise lateralization effects, as well being a more ecologically valid paradigm. The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) was measured for both speech [consonant-vowel pairs: /ta/ vs. /ka/ and ba/ vs. /da/] and non-speech stimuli (pure tones: 1 kHz vs. 1.2 kHz). Smaller MMNs to tone stimuli were obtained for dyslexics versus controls, but no differences were found for speech stimuli. Controls differentiated between speech and tones, with larger MMNs to tone stimuli. Dyslexics showed significantly greater MMNs to one stop consonant discrimination (/ta/ vs /ka/) than the other (/ba/ vs /da/), but did not differentiate speech from tones, and no or minimal lateralization was found for either group or stimulus type, in line with recent studies [Kershner and Micallef, 1992; Bellis, T.J., Nicol, T., & Kraus, N. (2000). Aging affects hemispheric asymmetry in the neural representation of speech sounds. Journal of Neuroscience, 20, 791-797]. However, analysis of left and right dipole source activity suggested right hemispheric preference for tones in controls, and the lack of such a preference in dyslexics. Lateralization of the auditory system in general may be less specialized in compensated dyslexia, although no specific differences in speech lateralization were seen. The present study also extends previous findings to show that the frequency range over which dyslexics are shown to display impaired frequency discrimination can be extended to 20% (1 kHz vs. 1.2 kHz) if using a dichotic presentation.

Because the amplitude of the SSVEP is modulated by attention such that attended stimuli elicit higher SSVEP amplitudes than do ignored stimuli, the method has been used to investigate the neural mechanisms of spatial attention. However, up to now it has not been shown whether the amplitude of the SSVEP is sensitive to gradations of attention and there has been debate about whether attention effects on the SSVEP are dependent on the tagging frequency used. We thus compared attention effects on SSVEP across three attention conditions-focused, divided, and ignored-with six different tagging frequencies. Participants performed a visual detection task (respond to the digit 5 embedded in a stream of characters). Two stimulus streams, one to the left and one to the right of fixation, were displayed simultaneously, each with a background grey square whose hue was sine-modulated with one of the six tagging frequencies. At the beginning of each trial a cue indicated whether targets on the left, right, or both sides should be responded to. Accuracy was higher in the focused- than in the divided-attention condition. SSVEP amplitudes were greatest in the focused-attention condition, intermediate in the divided-attention condition, and smallest in the ignored-attention condition. The effect of attention on SSVEP amplitude did not depend on the tagging frequency used. Frequency tagging appears to be a flexible technique for studying attention. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The temporal dynamics of implicit processing of non-letter, letter, and word-forms in the human visual cortex	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						word reading; ERPs; visual cortex; visual orthography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE; FACE PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; OBJECT RECOGNITION; IMAGING COGNITION; LEXICAL DECISION; LETTER-STRINGS	The decoding of visually presented line segments into letters, and letters into words, is critical to fluent reading abilities. Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of visual orthographic processes, focusing specifically on right hemisphere contributions and interactions between the hemispheres involved in the implicit processing of visually presented words, consonants, false fonts, and symbolic strings. High-density EEG was recorded while participants detected infrequent, simple, perceptual targets (dot strings) embedded amongst a of character strings. Beginning at 130 ms, orthographic and non-orthographic stimuli were distinguished by a sequence of ERP effects over occipital recording sites. These early latency occipital effects were dominated by enhanced right-sided negative-polarity activation for non-orthographic stimuli that peaked at around 180 ms. This right-sided effect was followed by bilateral positive occipital activity for false-fonts, but not symbol strings. Moreover the size of components of this later positive occipital wave was inversely correlated with the right-sided ROcc180 wave, suggesting that subjects who had larger early right-sided activation for non-orthographic stimuli had less need for more extended bilateral (e. g., interhemispheric) processing of those stimuli shortly later. Additional early (130-150 ms) negative-polarity activity over left occipital cortex and longer-latency centrally distributed responses (>300 ms) were present, likely reflecting implicit activation of the previously reported 'visual-word-form' area and N400-related responses, respectively. Collectively, these results provide a close look at some relatively unexplored portions of the temporal flow of information processing in the brain related to the implicit processing of potentially linguistic information and provide valuable information about the interactions between hemispheres supporting visual orthographic processing.

J	Wang, J; Nicol, T; Skoe, E; Sams, M; Kraus, N				Wang, Jade; Nicol, Trent; Skoe, Erika; Sams, Mikko; Kraus, Nina			Emotion Modulates Early Auditory Response to Speech	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN-STEM; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; STARTLE REFLEX; TIME-COURSE; CORTEX; ATTENTION; FEAR; ERP; EXPRESSIONS	In order to understand how emotional state influences the listener's physiological response to speech, subjects looked at emotion-evoking pictures while 32-channel EEG evoked responses (ERPs) to an unchanging auditory stimulus ("danny'') were collected. The pictures were selected from the International Affective Picture System database. They were rated by participants and differed in valence ( positive, negative, neutral), but not in dominance and arousal. Effects of viewing negative emotion pictures were seen as early as 20 msec (p = .006). An analysis of the global field power highlighted a time period of interest (30.4-129.0 msec) where the effects of emotion are likely to be the most robust. At the cortical level, the responses differed significantly depending on the valence ratings the subjects provided for the visual stimuli, which divided them into the high valence intensity group and the low valence intensity group. The high valence intensity group exhibited a clear divergent bivalent effect of emotion ( ERPs at Cz during viewing neutral pictures subtracted from ERPs during viewing positive or negative pictures) in the time period of interest (r(Phi) = .534, p < .01). Moreover, group differences emerged in the pattern of global activation during this time period. Although both groups demonstrated a significant effect of emotion ( ANOVA, p = .004 and .006, low valence intensity and high valence intensity, respectively), the high valence intensity group exhibited a much larger effect. Whereas the low valence intensity group exhibited its smaller effect predominantly in frontal areas, the larger effect in the high valence intensity group was found globally, especially in the left temporal areas, with the largest divergent bivalent effects ( ANOVA, p < .00001) in high valence intensity subjects around the midline. Thus, divergent bivalent effects were observed between 30 and 130 msec, and were dependent on the subject's subjective state, whereas the effects at 20 msec were evident only for negative emotion, independent of the subject's behavioral responses. Taken together, it appears that emotion can affect auditory function early in the sensory processing stream.

J	Spironelli, C; Angrilli, A				Spironelli, Chiara; Angrilli, Alessandro			Developmental aspects of automatic word processing: Language lateralization of early ERP components in children, young adults and middle-aged subjects	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						N150; Recognition potential; N350; Phonological processing; Semantics; Lateralization; Evoked potentials; Aging; Development	FORM AREA; CEREBRAL SPECIALIZATION; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; ORTHOGRAPHIC TASKS; FUSIFORM GYRUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FACES; INFANTS	Reading words elicits a very early evoked potential termed "recognition potential" with a latency of about 150 ins and clearly located in left posterior regions. A review of the current literature indicates that N150 marks the automatic lexical classification of a word, is relatively independent of the task, and is followed by a later negative and more anterior component which is sensitive to the task. However, from the literature it is not clear whether the left lateralization of the neural networks involved in word recognition changes with age and experience, and how this lateralization is related with behavioral performance. To this aim, based on a previously validated paradigm [Spironelli, C., Angrilli, A., 2006. Language lateralization in Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic tasks: a slow evoked potential study. Behavioral Brain Research 175, 296304; Spironelli, C., Angrilli, A., 2007. Influence of Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic tasks on the early linguistic components N150 and N350. International Journal of Psychophysiology 64, 190-198], we ran an experiment on three samples of subjects, 28 children (mean: 10 years), 22 young adults (23 years) and 20 middle-aged subjects (59 years). Subjects had to read the same sample of words in three blocked tasks, Orthographic, Phonological and Semantic, while EEG was recorded from 38 scalp locations. Analysis performed on N150 and four regions of interest/quadrants revealed typical significant left posterior negativity in young and aged subjects, but reversed lateralization and greater right negativity in children compared with the two adult groups. Analysis of the later N350 revealed a significant three-way group x laterality x task interaction, showing greater left negativity on the Phonological task only in the two adult groups, and a bilateral component in children. Results indicate that the functional lateralization of linguistic neural networks involved in automatic word recognition and in phonological processing is not yet developed in linguistically competent children aged 10 years, whereas the observed lateralization is relatively stable and not degraded in moderately aged subjects. Results are discussed in view of their implications for age-related linguistic pathologies. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.
