Most common method for ERPs detection is averaging. But this method is not suitable for single trial detection, because it requires lot of epochs. When we are performing attention experiments, it is required to detect ERPs ideally from single epoch. To detect ERP means determine its amplitude and latency. EEG signal is quasi-stationary therefore it is necessary to use signal processing methods designed for this task. We decided to use Hilbert-Huang transform. Its capabilities and problematic for ERP detection are discussed in the paper.

Human reliability was first determined by calculating individual reaction accuracy in order to split the entire group into high reliability (HR) and low reliability (LR) subgroups, each with eight subjects. The EEG activities of testing subjects were measured at rest condition for 5 min, and during a modified Eriksen flanker task. Artifact-free EEG segments were used to compute the distribution of EEG at varied frequency bands as well as to detect peak and latency of ERPs of the flanker task. Our results showed that subjects with LR exhibited higher alpha band EEG power at the frontal recording site. Additionally, LR group revealed lower P300 amplitude and predominantly longer P300 latency at centro-parietal recording site than those of the HR group. These findings implied that higher alpha band EEG power at frontal and smaller amplitude, longer latency P300 component of ERP measures at centro-parietal might reveal the trait of lower reliability in healthy controls during visual tasks.

The system explores the feasibility of speeding up image analysis by tapping into split-second perceptual judgments of humans. We present an incremental learning system with less memory storage and computational cost for single-trial event-related potential (ERP) detection, which is trained using cross-session data. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on the task of target image detection. We apply linear and nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) and a linear logistic classifier (LLC) for single-trial ERP detection using data collected from image analysts and naive subjects. For our data the detection performance of the nonlinear SVM is better than the linear SVM and the LLC. We also show that our ERP-based target detection system is five-fold faster than the traditional image viewing paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In humans, MMN is considered to be related to stimulus discrimination at the cortical level. ERP recording in dogs may present an opportunity to increase understanding of cognitive processes without reliance on observable behaviour, which may be confounded by motivation or training. Preliminary data are presented suggesting the existence of MMN, recorded using a minimally-invasive procedure equivalent to that used in humans, in unrestrained, unanaesthetised dogs. This is the first example of this ERP component in dogs and the method has substantial utility for future research exploring auditory, olfactory, and visual discrimination tasks, development, and breed differences.

This paradigm is widely utilized to build letter-by-letter text input systems using BCI. Nevertheless using a BCI-typewriter depending only on EEG responses will not be sufficiently accurate for single-trial operation in general, and existing systems utilize many-trial schemes to achieve accuracy at the cost of speed. Hence incorporation of a language model based prior or additional evidence is vital to improve accuracy and speed. In this paper, we study the effects of Bayesian fusion of an n-gram language model with a regularized discriminant analysis ERP detector for EEG-based BCIs. The letter classification accuracies are rigorously evaluated for varying language model orders as well as number of ERP-inducing trials. The results demonstrate that the language models contribute significantly to letter classification accuracy. Specifically, we find that a BCI-speller supported by a 4-gram language model may achieve the same performance using 3-trial ERP classification for the initial letters of the words and using single trial ERP classification for the subsequent ones. Overall, fusion of evidence from EEG and language models yields a significant opportunity to increase the word rate of a BCI based typing system.

In our study, a predefined sequence of letters was presented to subjects in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm. EEG data were collected and analyzed offline. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was designed as the ERP (Event Related Potential) detector for its simplicity. Different dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods were applied and compared in a greedy wrapper framework. Experimental results showed that PCA with the first 10 principal components for each channel performed best and could be used in both online and offline systems.

While excluding music with vocals, we classified the perception of seven different musical fragments of about three seconds, both individually and cross-participants, using only time domain information (the event-related potential, ERP). The best individual results are 70% correct in a seven-class problem while using single trials, and when using multiple trials we achieve 100% correct after six presentations of the stimulus. When classifying across participants, a maximum rate of 53% was reached, supporting a general representation of each musical fragment over participants. While for some music stimuli the amplitude envelope correlated well with the ERP, this was not true for all stimuli. Aspects of the stimulus that may contribute to the differences between the EEG responses to the pieces of music are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The ERP and EEG of alpha brainwave could be considered whether the person is under relaxation. In the other hand, the beta brainwave means the people represent arousal.

Selecting the most effective medications for depressed subjects having failed previous treatments is especially difficult. There is a clear need for objective biomarkers that could assist and optimize such treatment selection. We will review here a growing body of evidence suggesting that several electroencephalography (EEG)-based methods may be useful for predicting antidepressant response and eventually for guiding clinical treatment decisions. While most of these methods are based on resting-state EEGs (e. g., alpha-and theta-band EEG abnormalities, the combined Antidepressant Response Index (ATR), cordance, referenced EEG), others include EEG source localization and evoked potentials. The limitations of these technologies and the potential clinical uses will also be outlined. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2011;19:144-154.)

Different techniques have been suggested to remove these artifacts prior to ERP analysis. Independent component analysis (ICA) is suggested as an alternative method to "filter" eye movement artifacts out of the EEG, preserving the brain activity of interest and preserving all trials. However, the identification of artifact components is not always straightforward. Here, we compared eye movement artifact removal by ICA compiled on 10 s of EEG, on eye movement epochs, or on the complete EEG recording to the removal of eye movement artifacts by rejecting trials or by the Gratton and Coles method. ICA performed as well as the Gratton and Coles method. By selecting only eye movement epochs for ICA compilation, we were able to facilitate the identification of components representing eye movement artifacts.

Trials are often averaged, and univariate or repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to test hypotheses. The aim of this study was to introduce mixed regression to ERP research and to demonstrate advantages associated with this method. Eighty-five healthy subjects received electrical pain stimuli with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) registration. Analyses first showed that results obtained with mixed regression analyses are highly comparable to those using repeated measures of ANOVA. Second, important advantages of the mixed regression technique were demonstrated by allowing the inclusion of persons with missing data, single trial analysis, non-linear time effects, time x person effects (random slope effects) and a within-subject covariate. Among others, the results showed a strong trial (habituation) effect, which contraindicates the common procedure of averaging of trials. Furthermore, the regression coefficients for intensity and trial varied significantly between persons, indicating individual differences in the effect of intensity and trial on the ERP amplitude. In conclusion, using mixed regression analysis as a statistical technique in ERP research will advance the science of unravelling mechanisms underlying ERP data.

J	Wessel, JR; Ullsperger, M				Wessel, Jan R.; Ullsperger, Markus			Selection of independent components representing event-related brain potentials: A data-driven approach for greater objectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Single-trial analysis; Independent component analysis; Error-related negativity	BLIND SEPARATION; ERROR-DETECTION; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; NEURAL SYSTEM; DYNAMICS; FMRI; IDENTIFICATION; ARTIFACTS; ALGORITHM	Following the development of increasingly precise measurement instruments and fine-grain analysis tools for electroencephalographic (EEG) data, analysis of single-trial event-related EEG has considerably widened the utility of this non-invasive method to investigate brain activity. Recently, independent component analysis (ICA) has become one of the most prominent techniques for increasing the feasibility of single-trial EEG. This blind source separation technique extracts statistically independent components (ICs) from the EEG raw signal. By restricting the signal analysis to those ICs representing the processes of interest, single-trial analysis becomes more flexible. Still, the selection-criteria for in- or exclusion of certain ICs are largely subjective and unstandardized, as is the actual selection process itself. We present a rationale for a bottom-up, data-driven IC selection approach, using clear-cut inferential statistics on both temporal and spatial information to identify components that significantly contribute to a certain event-related brain potential (ERP). With time-range being the only necessary input, this approach considerably reduces the pre-assumptions for IC selection and promotes greater objectivity of the selection process itself. To test the validity of the approach presented here, we present results from a simulation and re-analyze data from a previously published ERP experiment on error processing. We compare the ERP-based IC selections made by our approach to the selection made based on mere signal power. The comparison of ERP integrity, signal-to-noise ratio, and single-trial properties of the back-projected ICs outlines the validity of the approach presented here. In addition, functional validity of the extracted error-related EEG signal is tested by investigating whether it is predictive for subsequent behavioural adjustments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The system is planned to be registered as a source of neuroscience data and metadata. It is one of the reasons we need to provide the system ontology. The scientific papers often describe the domain by using a semantic web language and consider this kind of domain modelling as a crucial point of software solution. However, real software applications use up the underlying data structures such as relational database and object classes. That is why the fundamental differences in semantics between common data structures (relational database, object oriented code) were summarized. The existing tools in semantic web domain were studied and partially tested. The first transformations from the system relational database and object oriented code were performed.

Differential Functional Roles of Slow-Wave and Oscillatory-Alpha Activity in Visual Sensory Cortex during Anticipatory Visual-Spatial Attention	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; biasing; control; EEG; ERP	NEURAL MECHANISMS; EEG; SHIFTS; ERP; PARIETAL; MICROSTIMULATION; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; INHIBITION; INTENTION	Markers of preparatory visual-spatial attention in sensory cortex have been described both as lateralized, slow-wave event-related potential (ERP) components and as lateralized changes in oscillatory-electroencephalography alpha power, but the roles of these markers and their functional relationship are still unclear. Here, 3 versions of a visual-spatial cueing paradigm, differing in perceptual task difficulty and/or response instructions, were used to investigate the functional relationships between posterior oscillatory-alpha changes and our previously reported posterior, slow-wave biasing-related negativity (swBRN) ERP activity. The results indicate that the swBRN reflects spatially specific, pretarget preparatory activity sensitive to the expected perceptual difficulty of the target detection task, correlating in both location and strength with the early sensory-processing N1 ERP to the target, consistent with reflecting a preparatory baseline-shift mechanism. In contrast, contralateral event-related decreases in alpha-band power were relatively insensitive to perceptual difficulty and differed topographically from both the swBRN and target N1. Moreover, when response instructions emphasized making immediate responses to targets, compared with prescribing delayed responses, contralateral alpha-event-related desynchronization activity was particularly strong and correlated with the longer latency target-P3b activity. Thus, in contrast to the apparent perceptual-biasing role of swBRN activity, contralateral posterior alpha activity may represent an attentionally maintained task set linking stimulus-specific information and task-specific response requirements.

Although recent functional MRI studies showed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in conflict monitoring during the interference, precise temporal characteristics of neuronal responses and their relationships with the actual motor response time(i.e., the time of motor action) are still unclear. For this, we modified the class Stroop task using action colored words with two relevant motor responses; button pressing and pedal stepping. Complex EEG waveforms from 13 subjects and their response times for three experimental conditions (congruent, incongruent, and neutral) with two types of motor responses were analyzed for finding a special event related potential (ERP) for conflict monitoring. In results, we found that a component of the event related potential, which was a negative wave around 200ms after the stimulus onset (N2b), was significantly modulated with the amount of interference and correlated with response time. The N2b was high and response time was slow when the action word stimulus was incongruent with the required response action. Our results implied that the relatively early ERP component, N2b could be detected when a current stimulus meaning is conflict with a required response action and this signal might be useful for other mechanical purposes such as BCI applications.

Change in PASAT performance correlates with change in P3 ERP amplitude over a 12-month period in multiple sclerosis patients	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Longitudinal; Auditory event-related potentials; Visual event-related potentials; Cognition; Neuropsychology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SERIAL ADDITION TEST; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; IMPAIRMENT; EEG; LATENCY; MRI	Objective: To examine the correlation between the change in PASAT and the change in P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) over a 12-month period in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and to compare the 12-month change in the P3 ERP between MS patients and controls. Methods: Forty-four subjects (27 MS patients, 17 controls) completed visual and auditory two-stimulus oddball and three-stimulus oddball tasks at Month 0 and Month 12. Data were recorded from a 128-scalp channel electroencephalography array. Data from scalp channels were converted into continuous interpolated images (incorporating the entire scalp and time). Amplitude, topographical differences and correlations were then tested using statistical parametric mapping. Results: The change in visual and auditory P3a correlated significantly with the change in PASAT score (r=0.56, p < 0.001 and r=0.48, p=0.003, respectively). Visual P3b and P3a showed greater decrease in 12 months in MS patients relative to controls. Visual P3b, auditory P3b and auditory P3a amplitudes had significantly decreased in MS patients after 12-month period. Conclusions: Change in visual and auditory P3a ERP amplitudes correlate with change in PASAT scores in MS patients. Visual modality is more sensitive to changes in P3 ERP amplitudes over 12-month period. Significance: P3 ERPs may have utility in monitoring the change in cognitive functioning in MS.

We propose an approach based on the integration of EEG and fMRI, enabling the EEG temporal dynamics of information processing to be characterized within spatially well-defined fMRI large-scale networks. First, the fMRI data are decomposed into networks by means of spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and those associated with intrinsic activity and/or responding to task performance are selected using information from the related time-courses. Next, the EEG data over all sensors are averaged with respect to event timing, thus calculating event-related potentials (ERPs). The ERPs are subjected to temporal ICA (tICA), and the resulting components are localized with the weighted minimum norm (WMNLS) algorithm using the task-related fMRI networks as priors. Finally, the temporal contribution of each ERP component in the areas belonging to the fMRI large-scale networks is estimated. The proposed approach has been evaluated on visual target detection data. Our results confirm that two different components, commonly observed in EEG when presenting novel and salient stimuli, respectively, are related to the neuronal activation in large-scale networks, operating at different latencies and associated with different functional processes.

Comparing ICA-based and Single-Trial Topographic ERP Analyses	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Cortical Network Analysis with Neuroelectromagnetic and Hemodynamic Signals	MAY, 2009	Univ Rome Sapienza, Rome, ITALY		Univ Rome Sapienza	Single-trial; Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Event-Related Potential (ERP)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOURCE SEPARATION; BRAIN; EEG	Single-trial analysis of human electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently proposed for better understanding the contribution of individual subjects to a group-analyis effect as well as for investigating single-subject mechanisms. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been repeatedly applied to concatenated single-trial responses and at a single-subject level in order to extract those components that resemble activities of interest. More recently we have proposed a single-trial method based on topographic maps that determines which voltage configurations are reliably observed at the event-related potential (ERP) level taking advantage of repetitions across trials. Here, we investigated the correspondence between the maps obtained by ICA versus the topographies that we obtained by the single-trial clustering algorithm that best explained the variance of the ERP. To do this, we used exemplar data provided from the EEGLAB website that are based on a dataset from a visual target detection task. We show there to be robust correpondence both at the level of the activation time courses and at the level of voltage configurations of a subset of relevant maps. We additionally show the estimated inverse solution (based on low-resolution electromagnetic tomography) of two corresponding maps occurring at approximately 300 ms post-stimulus onset, as estimated by the two aforementioned approaches. The spatial distribution of the estimated sources significantly correlated and had in common a right parietal activation within Brodmann's Area (BA) 40. Despite their differences in terms of theoretical bases, the consistency between the results of these two approaches shows that their underlying assumptions are indeed compatible.

The time course of self-other discrimination in emotion processing	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Self-other discrimination; Social emotions; Emotional word processing; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE RECOGNITION; ANTERIOR INSULA; ERP EVIDENCE; WORDS; CORTEX; ADJECTIVES; FMRI; FAMILIARITY	This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated at which temporal processing stages self-other discrimination in emotion processing occurs. EEG was recorded in 23 healthy participants during silent reading of unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral pronoun-noun and article-noun expressions that were related to the participants themselves, related to an unknown third person, or had no self-other reference at all. Self- and other-related pronoun-noun pairs elicited larger cortical negativity relative to the processing of article-noun pairs at left posterior electrodes as early as 200 ms after stimulus onset. In the same time windows (from 200 ms to 300 ms and 300 ms to 400 ms) the emotionality of the words enhanced event-related brain potential (ERP) amplitudes at parieto-occipital electrodes. From 350 ms onwards, processing of self-related unpleasant words elicited larger frontal negativity compared to unpleasant words that were related to the other or that had no reference at all. In addition, processing of pleasant words vs. neutral or unpleasant words elicited larger positive amplitudes over parietal electrodes from 450 ms after stimulus onset, in particular when words were self-related. Our findings demonstrate that for verbal emotional stimuli, self-other discrimination first occurs at higher-order, cortical processing stages. This is consistent with the view that categorization of information according to certain stimulus aspects (self-other reference, emotionality) occurs before its meaning is integrated.

As the event-related potential (ERP) is the direct neural electric response to a cognitive task, studying the relationship between the SSVEP and ERP would be meaningful in understanding this underlying mechanism. In this work, the traditional average method was applied to extract the ERP directly, following the stimulus of a working memory task, while a technique named steady-state probe topography was utilized to estimate the SSVEP under the simultaneous stimulus of an 8.3-Hz flicker and a working memory task; a comparison between the ERP and SSVEP was completed. The results show that the ERP can modulate the SSVEP amplitude, and for regions where both SSVEP and ERP are strong, the modulation depth is large.

Middle and late latency ERP components discriminate between adults, typical children, and children with sensory processing disorders	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sensory registration; event-related potentials; brain maturation; auditory processing; discriminant analysis	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; N1 WAVE; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; BRAIN; MATURATION; AUTISM; DYSFUNCTION; ANNOTATION	This study examined whether combinations of middle latency sensory evoked potential components and late components, possibly indicative of cognitive processing, can discriminate between three sample groups; 18 adults (20-55 years), 25 typical children (5-10 years) and 28 children with sensory processing disorders (SPD) (5-12 years). Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were made while participants heard random presentations of two auditory stimuli (1 and 3 kHz) each at two intensities (50 and 70 dB). Amplitude and latency measurements were obtained for the N1, P2, N2, and P3 components from the averaged event-related potential (ERP) for each of the four auditory stimuli. Discriminant analyses revealed two functions, one which described the relationship of the components on SPD deficit continuum and one which described the relationship of these components on a developmental continuum. Together, these two functions correctly classified 90.5% of the participants as to their group membership. These results are discussed in relation to neurodevelopmental theories.

In the present study we focused on time-locked activity by means of phasic (event-related) EEG analysis during a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) over the course of sleep deprivation. Twenty healthy subjects (10 male; mean age +/- SD: 23.45 +/- 1.97 years) underwent sleep deprivation for 24 h. Subjects had to rate their sleepiness hourly (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and to perform a PVT while EEG was recorded simultaneously. Tonic EEG changes in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range were investigated by power spectral analyses. Single-trial (phase-locking index, PLI) and event-related potential (ERP) analyses (P1, N1) were used to examine event-related changes in EEG activity. Subjective sleepiness, PVT reaction times and tonic EEG activity (delta and theta spectral power) significantly increased over the night. In contrast, event-related EEG parameters decreased throughout sleep deprivation. Specifically, the ERP component P1 diminished in amplitude, and delta and theta PLI estimates decreased progressively over the night. It is suggested that event-related EEG measures (such as the amplitude of the P1 and especially delta / theta phase-locking) serve as a complimentary method to track the deterioration of attention and performance during sleep loss. As these measures actually reflect the impaired response to specific events rather than tonic changes during sleep deprivation they are a promising tool for future sleep research.

J	Andrew, C; Fein, G				Andrew, Colin; Fein, George			Event-Related Oscillations Versus Event-Related Potentials in a P300 Task as Biomarkers for Alcoholism	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-Related Potentials; Event-Related Oscillations; Alcoholism; P300; P3b; Biomarker	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-STIMULI; HIGH-RISK; RESPONSES; BOYS; INDIVIDUALS; AMPLITUDE; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN	Objective: It has been proposed that event-related oscillation (ERO) measures of EEG activity recorded in P300 tasks provide more powerful biomarkers of alcoholism than event-related potential (ERP) measures. This study examines this question in a group of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAAs). Methods: EEGs were recorded on 48 LTAAs and 48 age and gender-matched nonalcoholic controls (NACs) during the performance of a 3-condition visual target detection task. The event-related data were analyzed to extract ERP amplitude measures and total and evoked ERO power measures. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance to determine the contributions of ERO versus ERP measures to discriminate between the LTAA versus NAC groups. Results: The LTAA group showed significantly lower evoked delta ERO power and total delta and theta ERO power compared to the control group. The evoked and total ERO power measures provide an alternative (but not more powerful) representation of the group difference than does P3b amplitude. There was a weak suggestion that nonphase-locked theta ERO power (which contributes to total ERO power) might provide independent discriminatory information. Conclusions: Reduced evoked ERO power in the response to target stimuli provided an alternative and comparable representation of the reduced P3b amplitude in LTAA. This is not surprising as the evoked ERO power measures are derived from time-frequency representations of the ERP waveform. Induced theta oscillations might provide independent discriminatory information beyond ERP amplitude measures, but separate analysis of the event-related nonphase-locked activity is required to investigate this further.

Evaluation of Empirical Mode Decomposition for Event-Related Potential Analysis	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS	Current methods for estimating event-related potentials (ERPs) assume stationarity of the signal. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a data-driven decomposition technique that does not assume stationarity. We evaluated an EMD-based method for estimating the ERP. On simulated data, EMD substantially reduced background EEG while retaining the ERP. EMD-denoised single trials also estimated shape, amplitude, and latency of the ERP better than raw single trials. On experimental data, EMD-denoised trials revealed event-related differences between two conditions (condition A and B) more effectively than trials lowpass filtered at 40Hz. EMD also revealed event-related differences on both condition A and condition B that were clearer and of longer duration than those revealed by low-pass filtering at 40Hz. Thus, EMD-based denoising is a promising data-driven, nonstationary method for estimating ERPs and should be investigated further.	[Williams, N.; Nasuto, S. J.; Saddy, J.

However, it is known that there exists a problem for the use of an input support device with this serious problem on considerable time for extracting characteristic event related pattern from brain wave and for the large-scale and large-amount device itself such as the MRI equipment. This study aims at rapid BMI pattern recognition for the eye-ball movement, which is considered to be removed a factor from EEG as an artifact [6]. We investigated the repeatability of eye-ball movement Event Related scalp electroencephalogram Potential (ERP) and the characteristics, which possess steady, high voltage and 50ms prompt reaction. As the ERP pattern discriminator, this paper proposes 2 methods, ISE based Euclid Norm and linear mapped Euclid Norm methods.

We studied these changes using ERP and EEG spectral analyses in subjects playing Space Fortress, a complex video game comprising standard cognitive task components. We hypothesized that training would free up attentional resources for a secondary auditory oddball task. Both P3 and delta EEG showed a processing trade-off between game and oddball tasks, but only some game events showed reduced attention requirements with practice. Training magnified a transient increase in alpha power following both primary and secondary task events. This contrasted with alpha suppression observed when the oddball task was performed alone, suggesting that alpha may be related to attention switching. Hence, P3 and EEG spectral data are differentially sensitive to changes in attentional processing occurring with complex task training.

The present study used 256-channel dense-array electroencephalography (dEEG) and linear-inverse source analysis (sLORETA) to identify changes in brain activity during the early stages of language training. Twenty native English speakers attended two 50-minute sessions of computer-assisted, virtual-reality Dari language instruction. Training-specific changes in neural activity were observed in both articulatory-motor and semantic processing regions, including increases in left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and left lateral inferior frontal regions. Also observed was increasing left lateralization, and an increase in mediotemporal regions suggestive of memory reconsolidation. These findings illustrate the ability to track changes with training in recognized language-processing brain regions using source-localized EEG recorded while listening to continuous, naturalistic speech. Subsequent research will explore individual differences and the development of adaptive training based on neural indices.

If changes in the mental state of the user are reflected in the brain signals used for control, the behavior of a BCI is directly influenced by these states. We investigate the influence of a state of loss of control in a variant of Pacman on the performance of BCIs based on motor control. To study the effect a temporal loss of control has on the BCI performance, BCI classifiers were trained on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the normal control condition, and the classification performance on segments of EEG from the normal and loss of control condition was compared. Classifiers based on event-related desynchronization unexpectedly performed significantly better during the loss of control condition; for the event-related potential classifiers there was no significant difference in performance.

EEG theta and alpha responses reveal qualitative differences in processing taxonomic versus thematic semantic relationships	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Taxonomic relationships; Thematic relationships; Semantic relationships; N400; Event-related potentials; Event-related spectral perturbation; Theta; Alpha; Memory; Inhibition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPHERICAL SPLINES; POWER; COMPLEMENTARY; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; MEMORY	Despite the importance of semantic relationships to our understanding of semantic knowledge, the nature of the neural processes underlying these abilities are not well understood. In order to investigate these processes, 20 healthy adults listened to thematically related (e.g., leash-dog), taxonomically related (e.g., horse-dog), or unrelated (e.g., desk-dog) noun pairs as their EEG was recorded. The data were analyzed using both event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The spatiotemporal ERP and ERSP results were analyzed further with principal component analysis (PCA). When comparing unrelated to related word pairs, the expected N400 effect was confirmed, as well as differences in theta and alpha oscillations. When comparing thematically and taxonomically related word pairs, the ERP revealed no significant differences, but the ERSP did. Specifically, theta power increased over right frontal areas for thematic versus taxonomic relationships and alpha power increased over parietal areas for taxonomic versus thematic relationships. The different oscillatory patterns over different brain regions suggest that thematic and taxonomic relationships engage distinct neural processes. Specifically, thematic relationships engage memory processes, while taxonomic relationships may require additional inhibitory or attention processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this visual event-related potential (ERP) study we investigated whether long-term meditation practitioners exhibit different ERP responses to the emotional load of stimuli (IAPS pictures) than control subjects with no experience in meditation. Differences were observed in the late positive potential (LPP). LPP amplitude is typically greater in ERPs evoked by emotionally arousing scenes, specifically negative images, compared to neutral scenes. This effect was also replicated in our study, but not in case of meditators' frontal scalp regions, who differed significantly in this respect from control subjects. Our findings provide support for different emotional processing in meditation practitioners: at high levels of processing meditators are less affected by stimuli with adverse emotional load, while processing of positive stimuli remains unaltered. To further confirm this observation, a long-term longitudinal random assignment study would be desirable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

Methods: Intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) activity had been recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. During the recording of the intracerebral EEG activity, the subjects performed a computerized version of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after the listening of the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Results: We found that late positive event-related potentials (ERPs) peaking at about 350 ms post-stimulus in amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex had a higher amplitude during the listening of the repeated words that were subsequently recalled than for those that were not recalled. Conclusions: Late positive ERPs reflect a functional mechanism implemented in a human brain network spanning amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex which is at the basis of the memorization processes of verbal materials. Significance: This ERP component is a promising neuromarker of successful memorization of repeated words in humans. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The cerebral cortex is the part of the mammalian brain that is most critical for sensory perception, motor action, and cognition. The ERP yields vital information about neuronal population activity in the cortex in relation to sensory, motor, or cognitive events. The temporal resolution of the ERP is ideally suited for capturing the timing of neurophysilogical processes in the cortex, and hence it provides a sensitive electrophysiological signature of neurocognitive activity. In fact, the ERP is the principal recording methodology currently in use for investigating the fine temporal structure of human cognitive processing. Like the closely linked event-related magnetic field, the ERP can be recorded noninvasively, and is thus of great value for the study of cognition in normal human subjects. The ERP is also valuable in the clinical setting for determining the temporal integrity of cortical processes in neurological patients. First, this chapter discusses the neurophysiological origins of the cortical ERP. Next, the different techniques by which the ERP is measured, and the many forms that it takes, are examined. Finally, the ways in which the ERP is modeled, and the procedures by which it is analyzed, are described.

We introduce a BMI system using electroencephalography (EEG) and the reinforcement learning method, in which event-related potential (ERP) represents a reward reflecting failure or success of BMI operations. In experiments, the P300 speller task was conducted with adding the evaluation process where subjects counted the number of times the speller estimated a wrong character. Results showed that ERPs were evoked in the subjects observing wrong output. Those were estimated by using a support vector machine (SVM) which classified data into two categories. The overall accuracy of classification was approximately 58%. Also, a simulation using the reinforcement learning method was conducted. The result indicated that discriminant accuracy of SVM may improve with the learning process in a way that optimizes the constituent parameters.

The identification of candidate intermediate phenotypes may facilitate the detection of susceptibility genes and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the disorder. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an ideal neuroscientific approach, providing a direct measurement of neural activity that demonstrates reliability, developmental stability and high heritability. This systematic review evaluates the utility of a subset of electrophysiological measures as potential intermediate phenotypes for ADHD: quantitative EEG indices of arousal and intraindividual variability, and functional investigations of attention, inhibition and performance monitoring using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Each measure demonstrates consistent and meaningful associations with ADHD, a degree of genetic overlap with ADHD and potential links to specific genetic variants. Investigations of the genetic and environmental contributions to EEG/ERP and shared genetic overlap with ADHD might enhance molecular genetic studies and provide novel insights into aetiology. Such research will aid in the precise characterisation of the clinical deficits seen in ADHD and guide the development of novel intervention and prevention strategies for those at risk.

These analyses, including quantitative EEG (e.g. brain mapping) and evoked/event-related potentials (EP/ERP), can provide a physiological endpoint that may be used to facilitate drug discovery, optimize lead or candidate compound selection, as well as afford patient stratification and Go/No-Go decisions in clinical trials. Currently, the degree to which these different methodologies hold promise for translatability between preclinical models and the clinic have not been well summarized. To address this need, we review well-established and emerging EEG analytic approaches that are currently being integrated into drug discovery programs throughout preclinical development and clinical research. Furthermore, we present the use of EEG in the drug development process in the context of a number of major central nervous system disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and pain. Lastly, we discuss the requirements necessary to consider EEG technologies as a biomarker. Many of these analyses show considerable translatability between species and are used to predict clinical efficacy from preclinical data. Nonetheless, the next challenge faced is the selection and validation of EEG endpoints that provide a set of robust and translatable biomarkers bridging preclinical and clinical programs.

A filter such as the digital filter is usually considered as a denoising tool. Actually, in filtering ERP recordings by an OF, the ERP' topography should not be changed by the filter, and the output should also be able to be modeled by the linear transformation. Moreover, an OF designed for a specific ERP source or component may remove noise, as well as reduce the overlap of sources and even reject some non-targeted sources in the ERP recordings. The OF can thus accomplish both the denoising and dimension reduction (reducing the number of sources) simultaneously. We demonstrated these effects using two datasets, one containing visual and the other auditory ERPs. The results showed that the method including OF and ICA extracted much more reliable components than the sole ICA without OF did, and that OF removed some non-targeted sources and made the underdetermined model of EEG recordings approach to the determined one. Thus, we suggest designing an OF based on the properties of an ERP to filter recordings before using ICA decomposition to extract the targeted ERP component. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we propose a completely automatic algorithm (ADJUST) that identifies artifacted independent components by combining stereotyped artifact-specific spatial and temporal features. Features were optimized to capture blinks, eye movements, and generic discontinuities on a feature selection dataset. Validation on a totally different EEG dataset shows that (1) ADJUST's classification of independent components largely matches a manual one by experts (agreement on 95.2% of the data variance), and (2) Removal of the artifacted components detected by ADJUST leads to neat reconstruction of visual and auditory event-related potentials from heavily artifacted data. These results demonstrate that ADJUST provides a fast, efficient, and automatic way to use ICA for artifact removal.

Therefore, the first part of the chapter shortly reviews quantitative EEG (qEEG) as well as event-related potential (ERP) studies in children with ADHD. Basically, ADHD children are characterized by a slowing in their qEEG frequencies and by longer latencies and smaller amplitudes in some (but not all) of the ERP components. Generally, neurophysiological impairments described in the few studies on adult ADHD patients are very similar to those of children with ADHD, while others change with age and, therefore, might present a developmental perspective. A promising approach for future studies may be the search for distinct subtypes or endophenotypes in ADHD which can be detected with the help of EEG parameters. This strategy may be useful for the development of more individualized and efficient treatments. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

A potentially promising solution, rapid image triage (RAIT), is essentially a cortically-coupled computer vision technique based on single-trial detection of event-related potentials (ERP). This paper presents a novel feature selection method, termed common spatio-temporal patterns (CSTP), which is critical for robust single-trial detection of ERP. Unlike past methods such as conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) method whereby only spatial patterns of ERP are considered, the proposed method exploits both spatial and temporal patterns of ERP, providing complementary spatial and temporal features for high accurate single-trial ERP detection. Numerical study using data collected from 20 subjects demonstrates that the proposed method offers significant performance improvement over conventional CSP method (p-value < 0.01) for rapid image triage.

However, the use of bivariate correlations precludes studying or correcting for confounding factors. The current study reinvestigated the association between ERP and the subjective experience of pain, using the more extensive statistical approach of multilevel analysis. Using this technique, it was possible to investigate and correct for effects of intensity and habituation. Eighty-five healthy subjects received intracutaneous electrical pain stimuli with simultaneous EEG registration. Each subject was asked to rate the intensity of each stimulus on a numeric rating scale (NRS). The multilevel analyses revealed a within-subject association between the ERP measures (especially P1 and P3) and the NRS score. Furthermore, this association was moderated by intensity of the stimulus and habituation. These results suggest that a direct translation from the pain ERP to subjective experience is delicate and that factors such as stimulus intensity and habituation must be taken into account.

The use of cognitive neuroscience methods along with the assessment of peripheral psychophysiological measures particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography reflecting brain activity have advanced our understanding of the physiological basis of many cognitive processes such as attention, memory, learning, and language in the context of child development and psychiatric disorders. These insights are proving increasingly helpful when evaluating and advancing treatment. The following review introduces the reader to psychophysiological and particularly electrophysiological methods widely used in child and adolescent psychiatry research.

Neural correlates of attentional and mnemonic processing in event-based prospective memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prospective memory; preparatory attention; EEG; ERP; cue detection; lexical decision task	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; AUTOMATIC PROCESSES; TIME-COURSE; INTENTION; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL; DYNAMICS; BRAIN	Prospective memory (PM), or memory for realizing delayed intentions, was examined with an event-based paradigm while simultaneously measuring neural activity with high-density EEG recordings. Specifically, the neural substrates of monitoring for an event-based cue were examined, as well as those perhaps associated with the cognitive processes supporting detection of cues and fulfillment of intentions. Participants engaged in a baseline lexical decision task (LDT), followed by a LDT with an embedded PM component. Event-based cues were constituted by color and lexicality (red words). Behavioral data provided evidence that monitoring, or preparatory attentional processes, were used to detect cues. Analysis of the event-related potentials (ERP) revealed visual attentional modulations at 140 and 220 ms post-stimulus associated with preparatory attentional processes. In addition, ERP components at 220, 350, and 400 ms post-stimulus were enhanced for intention-related items. Our results suggest preparatory attention may operate by selectively modulating processing of features related to a previously formed event-based intention, as well as provide further evidence for the proposal that dissociable component processes support the fulfillment of delayed intentions.

J	Shin, J				Shin, Jonghan			The Interrelationship Between Movement and Cognition: Theta Rhythm and the P300 Event-Related Potential	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						delta; theta; gamma; oscillation; oddball; P300 event-related potential	HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; DELTA; RATS; BAND	The relationship among brain electrophysiological activity, motor activity, and cognition has been a matter of great interest. For example, it has been discussed whether hippocampal theta rhythm reflects motor activity or cognitive activity, whereas it is widely accepted that the P300 event-related potential (ERP) reflects cognitive processes such as updating working memory. Here, we investigated the interrelationships among motor activity, hippocampal theta rhythm, and hippocampal P300 ERP using electrophysiological and behavioral data recorded from rats performing an auditory discrimination task (i.e., the auditory oddball paradigm) in a chamber with and without a running-wheel. We found that the hippocampal theta rhythm generated during locomotion codes information about self-motion, and event-related increases in hippocampal theta rhythm observed when rats performed the auditory discrimination cognitive task reflect a change in motor behavior after learning the cognitive task. Interestingly, the hippocampal P300 ERP occurred coincidently with increases in the power and frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we found that changes in theta rhythm observed during spontaneous wheel running without performing a cognitive task as well as when performing the cognitive task are associated with changes in delta-and gamma-band EEG activities. These major findings are discussed with respect to current hypotheses regarding P300 ERP and theta-, delta-, and gamma-band EEG activities in brain functions. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Emotion and the processing of symbolic gestures: an event-related brain potential study	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gestures; emotion; affect; attention; EEG; ERP	AFFECTIVE PICTURE PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; VISUAL-ATTENTION; FLEETING IMAGES; FEARFUL; ERP; FACES; ADJECTIVES; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	The present study used event-related brain potentials to examine the hypothesis that emotional gestures draw attentional resources at the level of distinct processing stages. Twenty healthy volunteers viewed pictures of hand gestures with negative (insult) and positive (approval) emotional meaning as well as neutral control gestures (pointing) while dense sensor event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Emotion effects were reflected in distinct ERP modulations in early and later time windows. Insult gestures elicited increased P1, early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) components as compared to neutral control gestures. Processing of approval gestures was associated with an increased P1 wave and enlarged EPN amplitudes during an early time window, while the LPP amplitude was not significantly modulated. Accordingly, negative insult gestures appear more potent than positive approval gestures in inducing a heightened state of attention during processing stages implicated in stimulus recognition and focused attention.

Several priming conditions were realized in a mix of control (CO), negative priming (NP), and positive priming (PP) trials. PP and NP effects in reaction times (RTs) were significant. ERP results conceptually replicate earlier findings of left-posterior P300 reduction in PP and NP trials compared to CO. This ERP effect may reflect the detection of prime-probe similarity corresponding to the concept of a retrieval cue. A novel finding concerned amplitude increase of the frontal late positive complex (LPC) in the order NP, CO, and PP. NP therefore seemed to induce brain activity related to cognitive control and/or memory processes, with reduced LPC amplitude indicating effortful processing. Overall, retrieval-based explanations of identity NP are supported.

However, such spontaneous activities are the object of interest for EEG/MEG researchers who study phase-related phenomena, e. g., long-distance synchronization, phase-reset, and event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERD/ERS). We propose a complex-weighted averaging method, called phase-compensated averaging, to investigate phase-related phenomena. In this method, any EEG/MEG channel is used as a trigger for averaging by setting the instantaneous phases at the trigger timings to 0 so that cross-channel averages are obtained. First, we evaluated the fundamental characteristics of this method by performing simulations. The results showed that this method could selectively average ongoing spontaneous activity phase-locked in each channel; that is, it evaluates the directional phase-synchronizing relationship between channels. We then analyzed flash evoked potentials. This method clarified the directional phase-synchronizing relationship from the frontal to occipital channels and recovered another piece of information, perhaps regarding the sequence of experiments, which is lost when using only conventional averaging. This method can also be used to reconstruct EEG/MEG time series to visualize long-distance synchronization and phase-reset directly, and on the basis of the potentials, ERS/ERD can be explained as a side effect of phase-reset.

However, the s-aligned and r-aligned ERP waveforms do not purely reflect, respectively, underlying stimulus (S-) or response (R-) component waveform, due to their cross-contaminations in the recorded ERP waveforms. Zhang [J. Neurosci. Methods, 80, pp. 49-63, 1998] proposed an algorithm to recover the pure S-component waveform and the pure R-component waveform from the s-aligned and r-aligned ERP average waveforms-however, due to the nature of this inverse problem, a direct solution is sensitive to noise that disproportionally affects low-frequency components, hindering the practical implementation of this algorithm. Here, we apply the Wiener deconvolution technique to deal with noise in input data, and investigate a Tikhonov regularization approach to obtain a stable solution that is robust against variances in the sampling of reaction-time distribution (when number of trials is low). Our method is demonstrated using data from a Go/NoGo experiment about image classification and recognition.

In the context of brain-computer interfacing (BCI), EEG recently has become a tool to enhance human-machine interaction. EEG could be employed in a wider range of environments, especially for the use of BCI systems in a clinical context or at the homes of patients. However, the application of EEG in these contexts is impeded by the cumbersome preparation of the electrodes with conductive gel that is necessary to lower the impedance between electrodes and scalp. Dry electrodes could provide a solution to this barrier and allow for EEG applications outside the laboratory. In addition, dry electrodes may reduce the time needed for neurological exams in clinical practice. This study evaluates a prototype of a three-channel dry electrode EEG system, comparing it to state-of-the-art conventional EEG electrodes. Two experimental paradigms were used: first, event-related potentials (ERP) were investigated with a variant of the oddball paradigm. Second, features of the frequency domain were compared by a paradigm inducing occipital alpha. Furthermore, both paradigms were used to evaluate BCI classification accuracies of both EEG systems. Amplitude and temporal structure of ERPs as well as features in the frequency domain did not differ significantly between the EEG systems. BCI classification accuracies were equally high in both systems when the frequency domain was considered. With respect to the oddball classification accuracy, there were slight differences between the wet and dry electrode systems. We conclude that the tested dry electrodes were capable to detect EEG signals with good quality and that these signals can be used for research or BCI applications. Easy to handle electrodes may help to foster the use of EEG among a wider range of potential users.

Methods: The ERP responses of twenty-nine 6-month-olds, nineteen 12-month-olds and 10 adults to an auditory stimulus were derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The most relevant wavelet coefficients corresponding to the first-and second-order moment sequences of the ERP signals were then identified using a feature selection scheme that made no a priori assumptions about the features of interest. These features are then fed into a classifier for determination of age group. Results: We verified that ERP data could yield features that discriminate the age group of individual subjects with high reliability. A low dimensional representation of the selected feature vectors show significant clustering behavior corresponding to the subject age group. The performance of the proposed age group prediction scheme was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method and found to exceed 90% accuracy. Conclusions: This study indicates that ERP responses to an acoustic stimulus can be used to predict the age and consequently the state of brain development of infants. Significance: This study is of fundamental scientific significance in demonstrating that a machine classification algorithm with no a priori assumptions can classify ERP responses according to age and with further work, potentially provide useful clues in the understanding of the development of the human brain. A potential clinical use for the proposed methodology is the identification of developmental delay: an abnormal condition may be suspected if the age estimated by the proposed technique is significantly less than the chronological age of the subject.

Unsupervised movement onset detection from EEG recorded during self-paced real hand movement	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Movement onset detection; Electroencephalography; Self-paced BCI; Gaussian Mixture Models; Unsupervised learning; Post processing	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; ASYNCHRONOUS CONTROL APPLICATIONS; BCI; CLASSIFICATION	This article presents an unsupervised method for movement onset detection from electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during self-paced real hand movement. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to model the movement and idle-related EEG data. The GMM built along with appropriate classification and post processing methods are used to detect movement onsets using self-paced EEG signals recorded from five subjects, achieving True-False rate difference between 63 and 98%. The results show significant performance enhancement using the proposed unsupervised method, both in the sample-by-sample classification accuracy and the event-by-event performance, in comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method suggests its potential application in self-paced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

Event-related potential correlates of suspicious thoughts in individuals with schizotypal personality features	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Schizotypal personality; Suspicious thoughts; Event-related potentials	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOLOGY; PSYCHOSIS; COMMUNITY; IDEATION; NOVELTY; EXPERIENCES; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS	Suspiciousness is a common feature of schizophrenia. However, suspicious thoughts are also commonly experienced by the general population. This study aimed to examine the underlying neural mechanism of suspicious thoughts in individuals with and without schizotypal personality disorder (SPD)-proneness, using an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when the "feeling of being seen through" was evoked in the participants. The findings showed a prominent positive deflection of the difference wave within the time window 250-400 ms after stimuli presentation in both SPD-prone and non-SPD-prone groups. Furthermore, the P3 amplitude was significantly reduced in the SPD-prone group compared to the non-SPD-prone group. The current density analysis also indicated hypoactivity in both frontal and temporal regions in the SPD-prone group, suggesting that the frontotemporal cortical network may play a role in the onset of suspicious thoughts. The P3 of difference wave was inversely correlated with the cognitive-perception factor and the suspiciousness/paranoid ideation trait, which provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for the association of suspiciousness with SPD features.

High resolution event-related potentials analysis of the arithmetic-operation effect in mental arithmetic	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Arithmetic-operation effect; Mental arithmetic processing; High-frequency ERP; Low-frequency ERP	POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY; PROBLEM-SIZE; FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIZATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG-DATA; FACTS; ERP; COMPONENTS; SUBTRACTION; STRATEGIES	Objective: Early, late and slow waves of event-related potentials (erps) appearing around 0-300 ms, 300-500 ms and after 500 ms respectively post-question presentation have been differentially associated to mental arithmetic processing (MAP). We hypothesized that arithmetic-operation effect (AOE) will show greater modulation of early components (P100, P200) in high-frequency erps; late components (P300, N300) and slow waves in low-frequency ERP when large-size problems are employed. Methods: Fourteen normal human subjects mentally processed large-and small-size addition, division, multiplication and subtraction problems. Spatiotemporal differences between these arithmetic-operations were studied by way of comparing amplitudes and latencies of early, late and slow waves. Results: All components were modulated by AOE. Modulated was observed as early as 100 ms post-question presentation (in high-frequency ERP components). AOE was very pronounced in large-size problems (in low-frequency ERP components). Conclusions: Results suggest that modulation by AOE of ERP components is improved when large-size problems and low-frequency ERP components are employed. Thus, differentiation of neuropsychological processes manifested by amplitude and latency of ERP components may be best studied by first separating components into high- and low-frequency erps. Significance: Findings raise the potential of obtaining ERP indices that may improve findings about the degree (and time) of engagement of cognitive processes (e.g. Strategy employed in MAP).

However, the challenge remains to find reliable biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity that can be used to track the functional decline over time and test efficacy of therapeutic intervention. While many recent studies have focused on neuroimaging techniques based on brain hemodynamic activity, comparatively fewer have utilized electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). This review aims to summarise and integrate key electroencephalographical findings from the last two decades in symptomatic and pre-diagnostic HD, in context with recent neuroimaging data, and to use this information to identify promising candidate markers for future research and clinical consideration.

Event-related potentials averaged both on target appearance and on saccade onset were larger in amplitude (increased negativity) for the antisaccade task compared to the saccade task. The relation of RT variability to EEG amplitude was studied by averaging stimulus-aligned and movement-aligned individual trials for each subject into four RT quartile groups. The analysis showed a relation of EEG amplitude to RT for both saccades and antisaccades. More specifically, the ERP negativity at 100-120 ms after stimulus onset in the saccade task and at 160-200 ms after stimulus onset in the antisaccade task for stimulus-aligned ERPs decreased monotonically with increasing RT as would be expected if this signal would be related to the eye movement preparation processes. This was much more pronounced and wide spread for the antisaccades than for visually triggered saccades. The peak negativity before movement onset for movement-aligned ERPs also covaried with RT suggesting no relation of this activity to movement preparation processes. This study then confirmed that only a particular ERP signal variation was related to the saccadic eye movement preparatory processes while other components of the ERP have no specific relation to the movement preparation. This particular signal was more prominent for antisaccades compared to visually triggered saccades supporting previous evidence for the cortical involvement in the preparation of these voluntary eye movements. In conclusion, this study validates the use of ERPs in the study of the planning and execution of saccadic eye movements.

BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; TARGET DETECTION; N1 WAVE; EEG	Background: The oddball paradigm is widely applied to the investigation of cognitive function in neuroscience and in neuropsychiatry. Whether cortical oscillation in the resting state can predict the elicited oddball event related potential (ERP) is still not clear. This study explored the relationship between resting electroencephalography (EEG) and oddball ERPs. The regional powers of 18 electrodes across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were correlated with the amplitude and latency of N1, P2, N2 and P3 components of oddball ERPs. A multivariate analysis based on partial least squares (PLS) was applied to further examine the spatial pattern revealed by multiple correlations. Results: Higher synchronization in the resting state, especially at the alpha spectrum, is associated with higher neural responsiveness and faster neural propagation, as indicated by the higher amplitude change of N1/N2 and shorter latency of P2. None of the resting quantitative EEG indices predict P3 latency and amplitude. The PLS analysis confirms that the resting cortical dynamics which explains N1/N2 amplitude and P2 latency does not show regional specificity, indicating a global property of the brain. Conclusions: This study differs from previous approaches by relating dynamics in the resting state to neural responsiveness in the activation state. Our analyses suggest that the neural characteristics carried by resting brain dynamics modulate the earlier/automatic stage of target detection.

Electroencephalographic data (112 channels) were recorded in 15 normal adults during the presentation of cue stimuli with neutral, happy or sad schematic faces (duration: "threshold time'' inducing about 50% of correct recognitions), masking stimuli (2 s), and go stimuli with happy or sad schematic faces (0.5 s). The subjects clicked left (right) mouse button in response to go stimuli with happy (sad) faces. After the response, they said "seen'' or "not seen'' with reference to previous cue stimulus. Electroencephalographic data formed visual event-related potentials (ERPs). Cortical sources of ERPs were estimated by LORETA software. Reaction time to go stimuli was generally shorter during "seen'' than "not seen'' trials, possibly due to covert attention and awareness. The cue stimuli evoked four ERP components (posterior N100, N170, P200, and P300), which had similar peak latency in the "not seen'' and "seen'' ERPs. Only N170 amplitude showed differences in amplitude in the "seen'' versus "not seen'' ERPs. Compared to the "not seen'' ERPs, the "seen'' ones showed prefrontal, premotor, and posterior parietal sources of N170 higher in amplitude with the sad cue stimuli and lower in amplitude with the neutral and happy cue stimuli. These results suggest that nonconscious and conscious processing of schematic emotional facial expressions shares a similar temporal evolution of cortical activity, and conscious processing induces an early enhancement of bilateral cortical activity for the schematic sad facial expressions (N170).

Pre-stimulus alpha phase-alignment predicts P1-amplitude	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						ERP; P1; Alpha; Phase	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL AWARENESS; AUDITORY ODDBALL; NEURAL DYNAMICS; EEG RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPONENTS; MECHANISM	Since years there is a hotly discussed dispute whether event-related potentials are either generated by an evoked component or by resetting of ongoing phase. We argue that phase-reset must not be proven in order to accept the general involvement of phase in ERP-generation as it is only one of several possible mechanisms influencing or generating certain ERP-components. Supporting data are presented showing that positive peaks of ongoing pre-stimulus alpha activity are not randomly distributed in time across trials. Most importantly, we found that a certain kind of pre-stimulus phase concentration that represents a continuous development of an alpha wave up to the time window where the P1 is generated is associated with an enlarged event-related component. We conclude that ongoing oscillations cannot be considered random background noise (even before stimulus onset) and that there are probably more phase-mechanisms that can contribute to the ERP-generation.

Brain dynamics in the auditory Go/NoGo task as a function of EEG frequency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain dynamics; Event-related potentials; Orthogonal phase effects; Phase synchronisation; Auditory Go/NoGo task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODDBALL TASK; STIMULUS ONSET; ALPHA-PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS	We examined relationships between the phase of narrow-band electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at stimulus onset and the resultant event-related potentials (ERPs) in an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task with a fixed SOA, in the context of a novel conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). ERP responses to each stimulus type were analysed. Prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1 Hz bands from 1 to 13 Hz) at Cz was assessed for each trial using FFT decomposition of the EEG data. For each frequency, the cycle at stimulus onset was used to sort trials into four phases, for which ERPs were derived from the raw EEG activity at 9 central sites. The occurrence of preferred phase-defined brain states was confirmed at a number of frequencies, crossing the traditional frequency bands. As expected, these did not differ between Go and NoGo stimuli. These preferred states were associated with more efficient processing of the stimulus, as reflected in differences in latency and amplitude of the N1 and P3 ERP components. The present results, although derived in a different paradigm by EEG decomposition methods different from those used previously, confirm the existence of preferred brain states and their impact on the efficiency of brain dynamics involved in perceptual and cognitive processing.

Multimodal imaging of functional networks and event-related potentials in performance monitoring	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; Inhibition; ACC; Pre-SMA	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CINGULATE CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG-FMRI; CONFLICT; DYNAMICS; ARTIFACT	The stop-signal task is a prototypical experiment to study cognitive processes that mediate successful performance in a rapidly changing environment. By means of simultaneous recording and combined analysis of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging on single trial level, we provide a comprehensive view on brain responses related to performance monitoring in this task. Three types of event-related EEG components were analyzed: a go-related N2/P3-complex devoid of motor-inhibition, the stop-related N2/P3-complex and the error-related negativity with its consecutive error positivity. Relevant functional networks were identified by crossmodal correlation analyses in a parallel independent component analysis framework. Go-related potentials were associated with a midcingulate network known to participate in the processing of conflicts, a left-dominant somatosensory-motor network, and deactivations in visual cortices. Stop-related brain responses in association with the N2/P3-complex were seen with networks known to support motor and cognitive inhibition, including parts of the basal ganglia, the anterior midcingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area as well as the anterior insula. Error-related brain responses showed a similar constellation with additional recruitment of the posterior insula and the inferior frontal cortex. Our data clearly indicate that the pre-supplementary motor area is involved in inhibitory mechanisms but not in the processing of conflicts per se. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Results showed that Insight solutions elicited a more positive ERP deflection (P400-600) than did Search solutions in the time window of 400-600 ms. Dipole source analysis showed that the generator of P400-600 was localized in the fusiform gyrus, which might be involved in breaking mental sets during reconstruction of the Chinese anagrams. Then, Insight solutions elicited a more positive ERP deflection (LPC) than did Search solutions between 640 and 780 ms. Dipole source analysis showed that the generator of LPC was localized in the right superior temporal gyrus, which might reflect forming novel associations when subjects regrouped the decompositions of the characters.

As MMN is a small event-related potential (ERP), a systematic ICA based approach is designed, exploiting MMN's temporal, frequency and spatial information. Moreover, this study answers which type of EEG recordings is more appropriate for ICA to extract MMN, what kind of the preprocessing is beneficial for ICA decomposition, which algorithm of ICA can be chosen to decompose EEG recordings under the selected type, how to determine the desired independent component extracted by ICA, how to improve the accuracy of the back projection of the selected independent component in the electrode field, and what can be finally obtained with the application of ICA. Results showed that the proposed method extracted MMN with better properties than those estimated by difference wave only using temporal information or ICA only using spatial information. The better properties mean that the deviant with larger magnitude of deviance to repeated stimuli in the oddball paradigm can elicit MMN with larger peak amplitude and shorter latency. As other ERPs also have the similar information exploited here, the proposed method can be used to study other ERPs.

Our goal was to determine whether and when we can reliably predict human natural movement BEFORE it occurs from EEG signals ONLINE IN REAL-TIME. Methods: We developed a computational algorithm to support online prediction. Seven healthy volunteers participated in this study and performed wrist extensions at their own pace. Results: The average online prediction time was 0.62 +/- 0.25 s before actual movement monitored by EMG signals. There were also predictions that occurred without subsequent actual movements, where subjects often reported that they were thinking about making a movement. Conclusion: Human voluntary movement can be predicted before movement occurs. Significance: The successful prediction of human movement intention will provide further insight into how the brain prepares for movement, as well as the potential for direct cortical control of a device which may be faster than normal physical control.

Multimodal imaging techniques rely on the assumption of a common neuronal source for the different recorded signals. In order to maximally exploit the combination of these techniques, one needs to understand the coupling (i.e., the relation) between electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Recently, simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements have been used to investigate the relation between the two signals. Previous attempts at the analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data reported significant correlations between regional BOLD activations and modulation of both event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory EEG power, mostly in the alpha but also in other frequency bands. Beyond the correlation of the two measured brain signals, the relevant issue we address here is the ability of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. Using multivariate machine learning-based regression, we show how it is possible to predict EEG power oscillations from simultaneously acquired fMRI data during an eyes-open/eyes-closed task using either the original channels or the underlying cortically distributed sources as the relevant EEG signal for the analysis of multimodal data.

Superposition Model Predicts EEG Occipital Activity during Free Viewing of Natural Scenes	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED RESPONSES; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LAMBDA WAVES; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PATTERN REVERSAL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; ARTIFACTS	Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) produced by a stimulus are thought to reflect either an increase of synchronized activity or a phase realignment of ongoing oscillatory activity, with both mechanisms sharing the assumption that ERPs are independent of the current state of the brain at the time of stimulation. In natural viewing, however, visual inputs occur one after another at specific subject-paced intervals through unconstrained eye movements. We conjecture that during natural viewing, ERPs generated after each fixation are better explained by a superposition of ongoing oscillatory activity related to the processing of previous fixations, with new activity elicited by the visual input at the current fixation. We examined the electroencephalography (EEG) signals that occur in humans at the onset of each visual fixation, both while subjects freely viewed natural scenes and while they viewed a black or gray background. We found that the fixation ERPs show visual components that are absent when subjects move their eyes on a homogeneous gray or black screen. Single-trial EEG signals that comprise the ERP are predicted more accurately by a model of superposition than by either phase resetting or the addition of evoked responses and stimulus-independent noise. The superposition of ongoing oscillatory activity and the visually evoked response results in a modification of the ongoing oscillation phase. The results presented suggest that the observed EEG signals reflect changes occurring in a common neuronal substrate rather than a simple summation at the scalp of signals from independent sources.

The study also assessed the advantages of aiding the extraction of specific ERP components by means of signal decomposition using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Methods: 'Go-nogo' task stimuli were presented either during fMRI scanning or in the gaps between fMRI scans, resulting in 'gradient' and 'no-gradient' ERPs. 'Go-nogo' differences in the N2 and P3 components were subjected to conventional ERP analysis, as well as single-trial and reliability analyses. Results: Comparable N2 and P3 enhancement on 'nogo' trials was found in the 'gradient' and 'no-gradient' ERPs. ICA-based signal decomposition resulted in better validity (as indicated by topography), greater stability and lower measurement error of the predicted ERP effects. Conclusions: While there was little or no benefit of acquiring ERPs in the gaps between fMRI scans, ICA decomposition did improve the detection of experimental ERP modulations. Significance: Simultaneous and continuous EEG-fMRI acquisition is preferable to interleaved protocols. ICA-based decomposition is useful not only for artifact cancellation, but also for the extraction of specific ERP components. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Guang, OY; Herzmann, G; Zhou, CS; Sommer, W				Guang Ouyang; Herzmann, Grit; Zhou, Changsong; Sommer, Werner			Residue iteration decomposition (RIDE): A new method to separate ERP components on the basis of latency variability in single trials	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mental chronometry; event-related potentials; single-trial responses; component separation; face recognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; WAVE-FORMS; STIMULUS; FACES; P300; KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN; EEG	Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are important research tools because they provide insights into mental processing at high temporal resolution. Their usefulness, however, is limited by the need to average over a large number of trials, sacrificing information about the trial-by-trial variability of latencies or amplitudes of specific ERP components. Here we propose a novel method based on an iteration strategy of the residues of averaged ERPs (RIDE) to separate latency-variable component clusters. The separated component clusters can then serve as templates to estimate latencies in single trials with high precision. By applying RIDE to data from a face-priming experiment, we separate priming effects and show that they are robust against latency shifts and within-condition variability. RIDE is useful for a variety of data sets that show different degrees of variability and temporal overlap between ERP components.

In this study, we proposed a mean-sensitive spatial filtering (MSF) method for linear transformation of event-related potentials (ERP) that is sensitive to mean differences between stimuli conditions and applied it to N170 component to extract category-specific spatio-temporal features contained in EEG. MSF method estimated a set of optimal projecting vectors according to the spatial distribution patterns of N170 means. Then, we applied these spatial filters to single-trial ERP data and performed classification on the extracted features. In this way, the presence of a larger negative component in EEG time courses evoked by faces can be detected robustly in single trial EEG, and hereby we can infer the category of every presented stimulus from faces and objects. Furthermore, we also successfully extracted the unobvious distinct spatial patterns between cars and cats with MSF and separated them correctly. Our remarkable and robust classification performances suggest that MSF works well in extracting stable spatial patterns from N170. Therefore, MSF provides a promising solution for decoding presented visual information basing on single-trial N170 component.

J	Wang, X; Ding, MZ				Wang, Xue; Ding, Mingzhou			Relation between P300 and event-related theta-band synchronization: A single-trial analysis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ASEO; Single trial analysis; ERS/ERD; Theta; P300	RECOGNITION MEMORY; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SPECTRAL DYNAMICS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; WAVELET ANALYSIS; EEG; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS; LATENCY	Objective: Recent reports show that theta-band (4-7 Hz) power is enhanced by target detection in the standard oddball paradigm, which, together with increased P300, is considered as providing complementary neural mechanisms supporting memory and attention processes. We hypothesize that the increased theta event-related synchronization (ERS) may stem largely from not accounting for the trial-to-trial variability of the P300 evoked component and may not reflect a separate mechanism for target detection and related cognitive processing. Methods: EEG was recorded from healthy volunteers performing visual and auditory odd-ball tasks. Ongoing-activity was obtained using two methods: (a) subtracting the ASEO-estimated (analysis of single-trial event-related potentials and ongoing-activity) single-trial ERP from corresponding single-trial EEG time series and (b) subtracting the average event-related potential (AERP) from single-trial EEG time series. Event-related oscillatory activities obtained from the two methods were compared. Results: The amount of power increase in the theta-band was greatly attenuated for the single-trial based method relative to the traditional AERP method. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the theta-ERS arises largely from not modeling the trial-to-trial variability of the P300. Significance: ERP components such as the P300 vary from trial-to-trial in both amplitude and latency. The traditional AERP method leaves traces of evoked responses in the residual data which can negatively impact the inference of ongoing oscillatory dynamics. Thus, caution should be exercised in interpreting such phenomena in basic and clinical contexts. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Fifty-four subjects (17 relapsing remitting (RRMS) patients, 16 secondary progressive (SPMS) patients, and 21 controls) completed visual and auditory oddball tasks while data were recorded from 134 EEG channels. Latency and amplitude differences, calculated using composite mean amplitude measures, were tested using an ANOVA. Topographical differences were tested using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Results: In the visual modality, P2, P3 amplitudes and N2 latency were significantly different across groups. In the auditory modality, P2, N2, and P3 latencies and N1 amplitude were significantly different across groups. There were no significant differences between RRMS and SPMS patients on any ERP component. There were topographical differences between MS patients and controls for both early and late components for the visual modality, but only in the early components for the auditory modality. PASAT score correlated significantly with auditory P3 latency for MS patients. Conclusions: There were significant ERP differences between MS patients and controls. Significance: The present study indicated that both early sensory and later cognitive ERP components are impaired in MS patients relative to controls.

Methods: Neuropsychological tests and ERP study using auditory oddball paradigm were conducted before and after treatment with TPM in drug-naive epilepsy patients. To detect target brain regions in which ERP changed during the cognitive task, cortical current densities of ERP components were analysed using standardised low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results: Neuropsychological tests (n = 18 patients) showed that TPM significantly decreased the score in digit span, Corsi block and Controlled Oral Word Association word fluency. Repeated-measures analysis of variance of ERP data (n = 13 patients) revealed that P2 amplitude was significantly increased at Fz electrode following treatment with TPM. Statistical non-parametric map of sLORETA between pre- and post-TPM ERPs revealed that current density of P200 component was significantly reduced by TPM in bilateral parieto-occipital, temporolimbic and dorsolateral right prefrontal regions. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that TPM affects selective brain regions which may be related to cognitive side effects.

Possibilities of Wavelet-Syncronization Method for Estimation of the Spatial Distribution of Components of Auditory Evoked Potentials in Healthy Subjects	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						auditory evoked potential; phase wavelet synchronization; biopotentials processing; attention	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG	Event-related potentials (ERP) are informative indicators of higher nervous activity of healthy people and patients in pathological states. Traditionally, methods of ERP processing include peak-time characteristics, topographical mapping and localization of equivalent dipole sources. At the same time, estimation of ERP synchronization is complicated by a short duration of the process. The wavelet analysis makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional Furrier analysis and to calculate characteristics of ERP synchronization, in particular, phase synchronization. A new approach to estimation of the auditory ERP in healthy persons is proposed in the article. The method is based on the analysis of phase wavelet-synchronization of ERP individual components under conditions of differentiation of different degrees of attention concentration in healthy persons.

Impaired information processing speed and attention allocation in multiple sclerosis patients versus controls: A high-density EEG study	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Event-related potentials, auditory; Event-related potentials, visual; Neuropsychology; Cognition; Attention	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SERIAL ADDITION TEST; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN ATROPHY; P300; DYSFUNCTION; TOPOGRAPHY; SURROGATES; PARADIGM	Background: The no-go P3a is a variant of the P300 event-related potential (ERP) that indexes speed of information processing and attention allocation. The aim of this study was to compare ERP findings with results from the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) and to quantify latency, amplitude and topographical differences in P3a ERP components between multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls. Patients and methods: Seventy-four subjects (20 relapsing remitting (RRMS) patients, 20 secondary progressive (SPMS) patients and 34 controls) completed a three-stimulus oddball paradigm (target, standard, and non-target). Subjects participated in separate visual and auditory tasks while data were recorded from 134 EEG channels. Latency differences were tested using an ANCOVA. Topographical differences were tested using statistical parametric mapping. Results: Visual P3a amplitude correlated with PASAT score in all MS patients over frontal and parietal areas. There were significant differences in latency, amplitude, and topography between MS patients and controls in the visual condition. RRMS and SPMS patients differed in visual P3a latency and amplitude at frontal and parietal scalp regions. In the auditory condition, there were latency differences between MS patients and controls only over the parietal region. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate that information processing speed and attention allocation are impaired in MS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fang, HH; Zhao, M				Fang, Huanhai; Zhao, Ming			Mechanisms underlying syntactic and semantic processing of Chinese simple sentences Evidence from event-related brain potentials	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Chinese; syntactic; semantic; event-related brain potentials; processing mechanism	ERP	This study sought to test the processing of three types of sentences in Chinese, as correct sentences, semantic violation sentences, and sentences containing semantic and syntactic violations, based on the following sentence pattern: "subject (noun) + yi/gang/zheng + predicate (verb)". Event-related potentials on the scalp were recorded using 32-channel electroencephalography. Compared with correct sentences, target words elicited an early left anterior negativity (N400) and a later positivity (P600) over frontal, central and temporal sites in sentences involving semantic violations. In addition, when sentences contained both semantic and syntactic violations, the target words elicited a greater N400 and P600 distributed in posterior brain areas. These results indicate that Chinese sentence comprehension involves covert grammar processes.

In particular, event-related potential (ERP) studies focusing on emotion recognition in pictures and faces or word processing have pointed toward a distinct component of the visual-evoked potential, the EPN ('early posterior negativity'), which has been shown to be related to attention to emotional content. In the present study, we were interested in the existence of a corresponding ERP component in the auditory modality and a possible relationship with the personality dimension extraversion-introversion, as assessed by the NEO Five-Factors Inventory. We investigated 29 healthy subjects using three types of auditory choice tasks: (1) the distinction of syllables with emotional intonation, (2) the identification of the emotional content of adjectives and (3) a purely cognitive control task. Compared with the cognitive control task, emotional paradigms using auditory stimuli evoked an EPN component with a distinct peak after 170 ms (EPN 170). Interestingly, subjects with high scores in the personality trait extraversion showed significantly higher EPN amplitudes for emotional paradigms (syllables and words) than introverted subjects.

Classification results based on a SFA decomposition are compared to classification results obtained on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition and to those obtained on raw EEG channels. Both PCA and SFA improve classification to a large extend compared to using no signal decomposition and require between one third and half of the maximal number of components to do so. The two methods extract different information from the raw data and therefore lead to different classification results. Choosing between PCA and SFA based on classification of calibration data leads to a larger improvement in classification performance compared to using one of the two methods alone. Results are based on a large data set (n=31 subjects) of two studies using auditory Event Related Potentials for spelling applications.

This algorithm combines greedy matching pursuit (MP) technique with covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to select small number of signal atoms from over-complete wavelet and chirplet dictionaries that offer best approximations of quasi-sparse ERP signals. During the search process, adaptive pruning of signal parameters was used to eliminate redundant or degenerative atoms. As a result, the CMA-ES/MP algorithm is capable of producing accurate efficient and consistent sparse representations of ERP signals and their ICA components. This paper explains the working principles of the algorithm and presents the preliminary results of its use.

The use of electroencephalography in language production research: a review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						overt speech; ERR review; speech production	BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; ERROR NEGATIVITY; ERP; INTERFERENCE; 2ND-LANGUAGE; FACILITATION; INHIBITION	Speech production long avoided electrophysiological experiments due to the suspicion that potential artifacts caused by muscle activity of overt speech may lead to a bad signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements. Therefore, researchers have sought to assess speech production by using indirect speech production tasks, such as tacit or implicit naming, delayed naming, or meta-linguistic tasks, such as phoneme-monitoring. Covert speech may, however, involve different processes than overt speech production. Recently, overt speech has been investigated using electroencephalography (EEG). As the number of papers published is rising steadily, this clearly indicates the increasing interest and demand for overt speech research within the field of cognitive neuroscience of language. Our main goal here is to review all currently available results of overt speech production involving EEG measurements, such as picture naming, Stroop naming, and reading aloud. We conclude that overt speech production can be successfully studied using electrophysiological measures, for instance, event-related brain potentials (ERPs). We will discuss possible relevant components in the ERR waveform of speech production and aim to address the issue of how to interpret the results of ERR research using overt speech, and whether the ERR components in language production are comparable to results from other fields.

EEG was recorded while participants made a decision whether or not visually presented words were related to a given category. Three types of stimuli were presented: familiar words related and unrelated to the given category, and unfamiliar words. Components N170, P170 and N400 of the ERP to familiar words unrelated to the given category and unfamiliar words were higher in the stress condition than in a usual experimental situation. Component P600 was higher in the stress condition for all types of stimuli. It was suggested that enhanced N170/P170 and N400 components reflect changes in the cognitive functions of word processing, whereas the increase in P600 is related to nonspecific arousal in the stress condition.

Preliminary evidence for correlation between PASAT performance and P3a and P3b amplitudes in progressive multiple sclerosis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						attention; auditory event-related potentials; cognition; multiple sclerosis; neuropsychology; visual event-related potentials		Background: The no-go P3a event-related potential (ERP) is a measure of attentional engagement and the P3b is a measure of context updating. The aim of this study was to compare ERP topographies: (i) to Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) results, (ii) of visual and auditory P3a and P3b of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) versus patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and (iii) of both progressive subtypes to healthy controls. Methods: Thirty subjects (10 PPMS, 10 SPMS and 10 age-matched controls) completed visual and auditory no-go P3a and P3b tasks whilst data were recorded from a 128-scalp channel electroencephalography (EEG) array. Data from scalp channels were converted into continuous interpolated images (incorporating the entire scalp and time). Topographical differences and correlations were then tested using statistical parametric mapping. Results: For the patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), PASAT score correlated significantly with parietal regions in the auditory P3b, auditory P3a and visual P3b conditions, and with central regions in the visual P3a condition. Patients with PPMS had significantly lower amplitude than patients with SPMS in the auditory P3b condition over the parietal area. The control group had greater amplitude than the patients with MS in all the P3 tasks, with the exception of the auditory P3b. Conclusions: These data suggest that PASAT performance and P3 ERPs correlate for MS progressive subtypes and that PPMS and SPMS differ in electrophysiological responses during auditory P3b tasks.

The phenomenology of drug addiction can be characterized by a recurrent pattern of subjective experiences that includes drug intoxication, craving, bingeing, and withdrawal with the cycle culminating in a persistent preoccupation with obtaining, consuming, and recovering from the drug. In the past two decades, imaging studies of drug addiction have demonstrated deficits in brain circuits related to reward and impulsivity. The current review focuses on studies employing positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate these behaviors in drug-addicted human populations. We begin with a brief account of drug addiction followed by a technical account of each of these imaging modalities. We then discuss how these techniques have uniquely contributed to a deeper understanding of addictive behaviors.

Insecure mothers, as compared to secure ones, showed a more pronounced negativity in the face-sensitive N170 component and a smaller N200 amplitude. Regarding the P300 component, secure mothers showed a stronger response to face stimuli than insecure mothers. No differences were found for frontal asymmetry scores. The results indicate that attachment differences may be related to neuropsychological functioning.

One particular realization of a BCI is the P300 matrix speller that was originally described by Farwell and Donchin (1988). This speller uses event-related potentials (ERPs) that include the P300 ERP. All previous online studies of the P300 matrix speller used scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and were limited in their communication performance to only a few characters per minute. In our study, we investigated the feasibility of using electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals for online operation of the matrix speller, and determined associated spelling rates. We used the matrix speller that is implemented in the BCI2000 system. This speller used ECoG signals that were recorded from frontal, parietal, and occipital areas in one subject. This subject spelled a total of 444 characters in online experiments. The results showed that the subject sustained a rate of 17 characters/min (i.e., 69 bits/min), and achieved a peak rate of 22 characters/min (i.e., 113 bits/min). Detailed analysis of the results suggests that ERPs over visual areas (i.e., visual evoked potentials) contribute significantly to the performance of the matrix speller BCI system. Our results also point to potential reasons for the apparent advantages in spelling performance of ECoG compared to EEG. Thus, with additional verification in more subjects, these results may further extend the communication options for people with serious neuromuscular disabilities.

Shift Work Sleep Disorder is Associated with an Attenuated Brain Response of Sensory Memory and an Increased Brain Response to Novelty: An ERP study	SLEEP			English	Article						Shift Work Sleep Disorder; Event-Related brain potentials (ERP); MMN; P3a	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; DEPRIVATION; POTENTIALS; INSOMNIA; DEFICITS; RHYTHMS; FMRI	Study Objective: To study the neurophysiological changes in attention and memory functions in shift work sleep disorder (SWSD), using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants: 9 healthy night workers (NW) (mean age = 40 y; SD +/- 8.9 y); 8 night workers meeting diagnostic criteria for SWSD (mean age = 37 y +/- 9.4 y) and 9 healthy day workers (DW) (mean age = 35 y +/- 7.3 y). Methods and Procedure: Using standard PSG the sleep related measures (TIB, TST, SOL, SE, and sleep stage distribution) were obtained prior to EEG/ERP study. Measures of habitual sleep were obtained from 2 week sleep logs and sleepiness was assessed with standardized measures. Using 32-EEG leads the ERPs to 3 types of sounds (novel, duration deviant, and simple tone) were obtained. The mismatch negativity (MMN) reflecting memory processing and P3a-reflecting the shift of involuntary attention were obtained. Statistical Analysis: The statistical comparisons of ERPs and sleep related parameters were performed using repeated measured ANOVAs and t-tests where appropriate. Results: Patients with SWSD had reduced TST and increased WASO relative to healthy workers. ERP results demonstrated significant attenuation of MMN amplitude over frontal regions in SWSD patients relative to NW and DW. In the SWSD patients, the P3a was increased to novelty across frontocentral brain regions with respect to the same locations in healthy controls. Conclusion: The ERP evidence of sensory memory reduction and attentional hyper-reaction to novel sound in conjunction with disturbed sleep suggests the need for more neurophysiological studies in SWSD workers.

However, this parameter only reveals the information derived from the mathematical model and just exhibits the reliability of the algorithms, and the property of EEG can not be reflected. If fits of two algorithms are identical, it is necessary to examine whether the desired components extracted by them are identical too. In order to verify this doubt, we performed NMF and NTF on the same dataset of an auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), and found that the identical fits of NMF and NTF under the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithms corresponded to different desired ERPs extracted by NMF and NTF, moreover, NTF contributed the ERP with much better timing and spectral properties. Such analysis implies that to combine the fit and property of the desired ERP component together helps evaluate the performance of NMF and NTF algorithms in the study of ERPs.

Here, we investigated a similar effect revealed in subdural intracranial recordings in humans. Our results show that the suppression of the subdural ERP is not associated with a reduction in the gamma frequency power, considered to reflect the underlying neural activity. Furthermore, the evoked potential suppression (EPS) phenomenon was not reflected in recognition behavior of the patients. Rather, the EPS was tightly linked to the level of gamma activity preceding the event, and this effect was independent of the interstimulus time interval. Analyzing other frequency bands failed to reveal a similar link. Our results thus show a consistent antagonism between subdural ERP and gamma power although both are considered markers for neural activity. We hypothesize that the ERP suppression is due to a desynchronization of neuronal firing resulting from recurrent neural activity in the vicinity of the freshly stimulated neurons and not an attenuation of the overall neural activity.

Feature selection on movement imagery discrimination and attention detection	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG; Feature selection; Movement imagery; Event-related potentials	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNAL; ONSET	Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate subject's electroencephalogram (EEG) features into device commands. Large feature sets should be down-selected for efficient feature translation. This work proposes two different feature down-selection algorithms for BCI: (a) a sequential forward selection; and (b) an across-group variance. Power rar ratios (PRs) were extracted from the EEG data for movement imagery discrimination. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed in the discrimination of cue-evoked responses. While center-out arrows, commonly used in calibration sessions, cued the subjects in the first experiment (for both PR and ERP analyses), less stimulating arrows that were centered in the visual field were employed in the second experiment (for ERP analysis). The proposed algorithms outperformed other three popular feature selection algorithms in movement imagery discrimination. In the first experiment, both algorithms achieved classification errors as low as 12.5% reducing the feature set dimensionality by more than 90%. The classification accuracy of ERPs dropped in the second experiment since centered cues reduced the amplitude of cue-evoked ERPs. The two proposed algorithms effectively reduced feature dimensionality while increasing movement imagery discrimination and detected cue-evoked ERPs that reflect subject attention.	[Dias, N.

A Roadmap for the Development and Validation of Event-Related Potential Biomarkers in Schizophrenia Research	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Biomarker; ERP; event-related potential; mismatch negativity; P300; schizophrenia	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; PREDICTS TREATMENT RESPONSE; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; P300 AMPLITUDE; HIGH-RISK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY P300; LONG-LATENCY; EEG; MEG	New efforts to develop treatments for cognitive dysfunction in mental illnesses would benefit enormously from biomarkers that provide sensitive and reliable measures of the neural events underlying cognition. Here, we evaluate the promise of event-related potentials (ERPs) as biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We conclude that ERPs have several desirable properties: 1) they provide a direct measure of electrical activity during neurotransmission; 2) their high temporal resolutions make it possible to measure neural synchrony and oscillations; 3) they are relatively inexpensive and convenient to record; 4) animal models are readily available for several ERP components; 5) decades of research has established the sensitivity and reliability of ERP measures in psychiatric illnesses; and 6) feasibility of large N (>500) multisite studies has been demonstrated for key measures. Consequently, ERPs may be useful for identifying endophenotypes and defining treatment targets, for evaluating new compounds in animals and in humans, and for identifying individuals who are good candidates for early interventions or for specific treatments. However, several challenges must be overcome before ERPs gain widespread use as biomarkers in schizophrenia research, and we make several recommendations for the research that is necessary to develop and validate ERP-based biomarkers that can have a real impact on treatment development.

ALS patients may present with subtle behavioural and executive dysfunctions or, less frequently, with a manifest frontotemporal dementia. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a high-temporal resolution technique, which can be used to explore the presence of cognitive dysfunction. All the primary studies reviewed here have shown ERP abnormalities in groups of non-demented patients affected by sporadic ALS compared to healthy controls. The ERP results support findings of neuropsychological and imaging studies. Prospective studies combining simultaneous neuropsychological and imaging investigations are needed to assess the possible role of ERPs in the early detection and follow-up of cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients.</.

For these individuals sensory overload can impair functioning, raise physiological stress, and adversely affect social interaction. Early-stage (i.e. within 200 ms of stimulus onset) auditory processing abnormalities have been widely examined in ASD using event-related potentials (ERP), while ERP studies investigating early-stage visual processing in ASD are less frequent. We wanted to test the hypothesis of early-stage visual processing abnormalities in ASD by investigating ERPs elicited in a visual oddball task using illusory figures. Our results indicate that individuals with ASD have abnormally large cortical responses to task irrelevant stimuli over both parieto-occipital and frontal regions-of-interest (ROI) during early stages of visual processing compared to the control group. Furthermore, ASD patients showed signs of an overall disruption in stimulus discrimination, and had a significantly higher rate of motor response errors.

The combination of spatiotemporal ERP analysis with source imaging and statistical parametric mapping of the concomitant source differences yielded differences in three time windows: reversals showed increased activity in early visual (similar to 120 ms) and in inferior frontal and anterior temporal areas (similar to 400-600 ms) and decreased activity in the ventral stream (similar to 250-350 ms). The combination of source imaging and statistical parametric mapping suggests that these differences were due to differences in generator strength and not generator configuration, unlike the initiation of reversals in right inferior parietal areas. These results are discussed within the context of the extensive network of brain areas that has been implicated in the initiation, implementation, and appraisal of bistable perceptual reversals.

Moreover, theta always modulated gamma activity by phase-amplitude coupling in event-related oscillations. Whether theta modulate gamma by phase-amplitude coupling in pain processing is of interest. In the present study, using EEG of rats after laser nociceptive stimulation, we investigated gamma activity and phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma. It was found that induced gamma power increased starting 200 ms after nociceptive stimulation onset. Moreover, significant coupling between theta phase and gamma amplitude was found over frontal and parietal region after nociceptive stimulation. Our results for the first time suggest that coupling between theta and gamma is involved in nociception processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We demonstrated previously that the positive deflection that follows the error-related negativity (ERN) in young adults is a combination of two ERP components, a fronto-central positive component and a P300. As these findings affect the interpretation of error-related ERP data, it is essential to determine if the componential structure of the ERPs elicited by children's errors is similar to that found in young adults. The results of the current study confirm that, as is the case in adults, both an ERN and a fronto-central positivity are elicited by errors committed by children. In contrast to what has been previously found in adults, errors committed by children elicited a central positivity in addition to a parietal negativity that was elicited by correct responses.

However, the traditional ERP approach discards most oscillatory information in the EEG through grand averaging process. This study tried to focus on ERP component of mismatch negativity (MMN) between control and schizophrenia groups in Taiwan. In addition to traditional (grand average) ERP approach, we also compared the time-frequency analysis results of the mismatch negativity. Methods: MMN values were recorded in 55 schizophrenia patients and 42 controls using an auditory oddball paradigm for the duration of the MMN. Besides the traditional grand average approach, the continuous data files were also used for time-frequency analysis via ERP wavelab. Six parameters were explored: event-related spectral perturbation, WTav, avWT, induced activity, intertrial phase coherence and intertrial linear coherence. Results: Traditional ERP approach discovered that group difference occurred in MMN mean amplitude which was compatible with the previous literature. In time-frequency analysis, schizophrenia subjects have lower intertrial phase coherence than controls. Conclusion: Deficit in preattentive sensory information processing, such as MMN, is prominent in Taiwanese schizophrenia subjects. It may also play a role in the basic integrated neural network activity, which could be further explored by time-frequency approach.

The present study focused on the detection of concealed information using simultaneous recordings of autonomic and brain electrical measures. As a secondary issue, verbal and pictorial presentations were compared with respect to their influence on the recorded measures. Thirty-one participants underwent a mock-crime scenario with a combined verbal and pictorial presentation of nine items. The subsequent CIT, designed with respect to event-related potential (ERP) measurement, used a 3-3.5 s interstimulus interval. The item presentation modality, i.e. pictures or written words, was varied between subjects: no response was required from the participants. In addition to electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory activity, and finger plethysmogram were recorded. A significant probe-vs.-irrelevant effect was found for each of the measures. Compared to sole ERP measurement, the combination of ERP and EDA yielded incremental information for detecting concealed information. Although, EDA per se did not reach the predictive value known from studies primarily designed for peripheral physiological measurement. Presentation modality neither influenced the detection accuracy for autonomic measures nor EEG measures; this underpins the equivalence of verbal and pictorial item presentation in a CIT, regardless of the physiological measures recorded. Future studies should further clarify whether the incremental validity observed in the present study reflects a differential sensitivity of ERP and EDA to different sub-processes in a CIT.

Time course of attentional bias in anxiety: Emotion and gender specificity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Anxiety; Emotion; EEG; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; TRIPARTITE MODEL; STROOP TASK; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PANIC DISORDER; P300 COMPONENT; TRAIT ANXIETY; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE	Anxiety is characterized by cognitive biases, including attentional bias to emotional (especially threatening) stimuli. Accounts differ on the time course of attention to threat, but the literature generally confounds emotional valence and arousal and overlooks gender effects, both addressed in the present study. Nonpatients high in self-reported anxious apprehension, anxious arousal, or neither completed an emotion-word Stroop task during event-related potential (ERP) recording. Hypotheses differentiated time course of preferential attention to emotional stimuli. Individuals high in anxious apprehension and anxious arousal showed distinct early ERP evidence of preferential processing of emotionally arousing stimuli along with some evidence for gender differences in processing. Healthy controls showed gender differences at both early and later processing stages. The conjunction of valence, arousal, and gender is critical in the time course of attentional bias.

The combination of intermittent stimulus presentation and EEG source imaging has begun to shed new light on the neural underpinnings of binocular rivalry. Here, we review the basics of the intermittent paradigm and highlight methodological issues important for interpreting previous results and designing future experiments. We then outline current analytical approaches, including EEG microstates, event-related potentials, and statistically based source estimation, and propose a neural model of the sequence of brain events that may underlie different aspects of binocular rivalry. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of using binocular rivalry as a tool to investigate the neural basis of perceptual awareness.

We used brain Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) obtained in a perceptual/cognitive paradigm with various processing demands to predict which individual Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects will develop AD versus which will not. ERP components, including P3, memory "storage" component, and other earlier and later components, were identified and measured by Principal Components Analysis. When measured for particular task conditions, a weighted set of eight ERP component_conditions performed well in discriminant analysis at predicting later AD progression with good accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The predictions for most individuals (79%) had high posterior probabilities and were accurate (88%). This method, supported by a cross-validation where the prediction accuracy was 70-78%, features the posterior probability for each individual as a method of determining the likelihood of progression to AD. Empirically obtained prediction accuracies rose to 94% when the computed posterior probabilities for individuals were 0.90 or higher (which was found for 40% of our MCI sample).

The BOLD correlates of the visual P1 and N1 in single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings during a spatial detection task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TARGET DETECTION; MR-SCANNER; ARTIFACTS; DYNAMICS; REMOVAL; IDENTIFICATION; VALIDATION; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	Simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements can combine the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of EEG. Therefore, we applied this approach to the study of peripheral vision. More specifically, we presented visual field quadrant fragments of checkerboards and a full central checkerboard in a simple detection task. A technique called "integration-by-prediction" was used to integrate EEG and fMRI data. In particular, we used vectors of single-trial ERP amplitude differences between left and right occipital electrodes as regressors in an ERP-informed fMRI analysis. The amplitude differences for the regressors were measured at the latencies of the visual P1 and N1 components. Our results indicated that the traditional event-related fMRI analysis revealed mostly activations in the vicinity of the primary visual cortex and in the ventral visual stream, while both P1 and N1 regressors revealed activation of areas in the temporo-parietal junction. We conclude that simultaneous EEG-fMRI in a spatial detection task can separate visual processing at 100200 ms from stimulus onset from the rest of the information processing in the brain.

This N1 suppression effect is generally interpreted to reflect an internal prediction mechanism, which enables the discrimination of the sensory consequences of our own actions and those of others. The blocked design used in the forerunner studies (i.e., self- and externally initiated sounds presented in different blocks) seriously limits the relevance of these findings, because the N1 effect can simply be explained by contextual task differences. In the present study, self-and externally initiated sounds were mixed within blocks. N1 suppression was found, and its magnitude was even larger than that observed in a traditional blocked condition. This result supports the involvement of an internal prediction mechanism in the discrimination of the sensory consequences of one's own actions and those of others.

P300 is changed in many cognitive disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer, schizophrenia, and major depression disorder. Therefore, investigation on basis of this component can help to improve our understanding of pathophysiology of such disorders and fundamentals of memory and attention mechanism. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals of 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 age-matched normal subjects are analyzed. The odd-ball paradigm has been used to record the P300, where two stimuli including target and standard are presented with different probabilities in a random order. Data analysis is carried out using conventional averaging techniques as well as P300 source localization with low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The results show that the P300 components stem from a wide cerebral cortex network and defining a small definite cortical zone as its generator is impossible. In normal group, cingulate gyrus, one of the essential components of working memory circuit that was reported by Papez, is found to be the most activated area and it can be in line with the hypothesis that at least a part of the P300 is elicited by working-memory circuit. In schizophrenic group, frontal lobe is the most activated area that was responsible for P300 sources. Our results show that the cingulate gyrus is not activated in comparison with normal group, which is in line with previous results that dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex plays a prominent role in the schizophrenia disorder.

Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG), event-related potentials (ERP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) were recorded in two groups of adolescents (aged 13-16 years), living either at sea-level or high altitude (similar to 3700 m). Results: Neuropsychological testing revealed no deficits in the high altitude group, despite significantly reduced blood oxygen saturation. In agreement, ERPs elicited by oddball target detection and choice reaction time tasks were not different between groups. In contrast, resting state EEG showed reductions in delta and beta frequency amplitudes in adolescents living at high altitude. The EEG attenuations were correlated with lower CBFV, and the EEG group differences diminished during task performance. Conclusions: No indication was found for negative sequelae of chronic hypoxia in adolescents born and living at an altitude of similar to 3700 m, rather evidence for successful neurophysiological adaptation was found under such conditions. Significance: Dynamic regulation of metabolic demand is one adaptive mechanism that preserves cognitive development at high altitude. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In that regard, our data are in line with previous reports. However, the approach presented here is noninvasive and bypasses the inverse problem using only temporal information from the EEG.

Optimum Principal Components for Spatial Filtering of EEG to Detect Imaginary Movement by Coherence	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			POTENTIALS	Several techniques have been used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio to increase the detection rate of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). This work investigates the application of spatial filtering based on principal component analysis (PCA) to detect ERP due to left-hand index finger movement imagination. The EEG signals were recorded of central derivations (C4, C2, Cz, C1 and C3), positioned according to 10-10 International System. The optimal spatial filter was found by using the first principal component and the ERP detection was obtained by magnitude squared coherence technique. The best detection rate, by using original signal (without filtering), was obtained at C2 derivation, with 54.73% for significance level of 5%. For the same significance level, the detection rate of the filtered signal was drastically improved to 96.84%. Results suggest that spatial filter by using PCA might be a very useful tool in assisting the ERP detection for movement imagination for applications on brain machine interface.

In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive framework for decoding ERPs, elaborating on linear concepts, namely spatio-temporal patterns and filters as well as linear ERP classification. However, the bottleneck of these techniques is that they require an accurate covariance matrix estimation in high dimensional sensor spaces which is a highly intricate problem. As a remedy, we propose to use shrinkage estimators and show that appropriate regularization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by shrinkage yields excellent results for single-trial ERP classification that are far superior to classical LDA classification. Furthermore, we give practical hints on the interpretation of what classifiers learned from the data and demonstrate in particular that the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model complexity in regularized LDA relates to a morphing between a difference pattern of ERPs and a spatial filter which cancels non task-related brain activity.

Learning can occur at the level of stimulus-specific features (stimulus learning), associations between stimuli and selected decisions (stimulus-decision learning), and associations between stimuli and selected responses (stimulus-response learning). Although recent functional magnetic resonance imaging results suggest that these distinct forms of learning are associated with repetition suppression (neural priming) in dissociable regions of frontal and temporal cortex, a critical question is how these different forms of learning influence cortical response dynamics. Here, electroencephalography (EEG) measured the temporal structure of neural responses when participants classified novel and repeated stimuli, using a design that isolated the effects of distinct levels of learning. Event-related potential and spectral EEG analyses revealed electrophysiological effects due to stimulus, stimulus-decision, and stimulus-response learning, demonstrating experience-dependent cortical modulation at multiple levels of representation. Stimulus-level learning modulated cortical dynamics earlier in the temporal-processing stream relative to stimulus-decision and stimulus-response learning. These findings indicate that repeated stimulus processing, including the mapping of stimuli to decisions and actions, is influenced by stimulus-level and associative learning mechanisms that yield multiple forms of experience-dependent cortical plasticity.

There are comparatively few studies using EEG which allow us to study the time course of self-recognition. In this study, participants monitored a sequence of images, including 20 distinct images of their own face, a friend's face and a stranger's face articulating different speech sounds, while EEG was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Differences in the ERP waveforms were observed very early on, with increased NI 70 and VPP amplitude to self relative to both friend and stranger measured over posterior and fronto-central sites, respectively. This 'self effect' was also marked at similar to 250 ms where P2/N2 amplitude was significantly reduced for self-faces. By comparison, differences between friend and stranger faces did not emerge until 250 ms and beyond, where a more conventional 'familiarity effect' was observed. The data also point to a 'less lateralized' representation of self over posterior sites. These findings are consistent with both behavioral and fMRI studies which suggest that self-face processing is 'special' and are discussed with reference to EEG studies of face processing.

To reject artifact sources, the projection of the estimated counterpart by independent component analysis (ICA) is often subtracted from EEG recordings. However, the association of performance of ICA decomposition and the subtraction has never been analyzed before. Coincidently, we find that a source can be completely removed from EEG recordings through the subtraction theoretically. The necessary condition of such results is that the estimated ICA model for every source should be entirely correct, that is, each estimated source is just the scaled version of one source. Meanwhile, we also find that the subtraction cannot sufficiently reject one source practically. This is because the estimated ICA model for some sources is inevitably incorrect, that is, some estimated sources are still the mixture of a few sources. To improve the accuracy of the subtraction, it is first necessary to develop better ICA algorithms to separate mixtures as sufficiently as possible and secondly it is necessary to modify the abnormal polarity of the projection of the estimated source in the electrode field. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the modification on the abnormal polarity in rejecting one source.

The aim of our study was to explore these processes as indexed by the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP components in a BD cohort. Methods: Eighteen subjects diagnosed with BD and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers completed an emotional go/no-go inhibition task during electroencephalogram (EEG) and ERP acquisition. Results: Patients demonstrated faster responses to happy compared to sad faces, whereas control data revealed no emotional discrimination. Errors of omission were more frequent in the BD group in both emotion conditions, but there were no between-group differences in commission errors. Significant differences were found between groups in P100 amplitude variation across levels of affect, with the BD group exhibiting greater responses to happy compared to sad faces. Conversely, the control cohort failed to demonstrate a differentiation between emotions. A statistically significant between-group effect was also found for N170 amplitudes, indicating reduced responses in the BD group. Limitations: Future studies should ideally recruit BD patients across all three mood states (manic, depressive, and euthymic) with greater scrutiny of the effects of psychotropic medication. Conclusions: These ERP results primarily suggest an emotion-sensitive face processing impairment in BD whereby patients are initially more attuned to positive emotions as indicated by the P100 ERP component, and this may contribute to the emergence of bipolar-like symptoms.

This paper presents a novel design of the auditory oddball task based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. The subject is presented with a stimulus presentation paradigm in which low-probability auditory targets are mixed with high-probability ones. In the data analysis, we employ a novel algorithm based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition that is used to extract informative brain activity features through thirteen electrodes' recorded signal of each single electroencephalogram (EEC) trial. Comparing to the result of arithmetic mean of all trials, auditory topography of peak latencies of the evoked event-related potential (ER,P) demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient for the detection of P300 or P100 component of the ERP in the subject's EEG. As a result we have found new ways to process EEC signals to improve detection for a P100 and P300 based BCI system.

Therefore, loss in signal magnitude due to cancellation is expected when multiple brain regions are simultaneously active. We characterized these cancellation effects in EEG and MEG using a forward model with sources constrained on an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cortical surface. Prominent cancellation was found for both EEG and MEG in the case of multiple randomly distributed source dipoles, even when the number of simultaneous dipoles was small. Substantial cancellation occurred also for locally extended patches of simulated activity, when the patches extended to opposite walls of sulci and gyri. For large patches, a difference between EEG and MEG cancellation was seen, presumably due to selective cancellation of tangentially vs. radially oriented sources. Cancellation effects can be of importance when electrophysiological data are related to hemo-dynamic measures. Furthermore, the selective cancellation may be used to explain some observed differences between EEG and MEG in terms of focal vs. widespread cortical activity. Hum Brain Mapp 31:140-149, 2010.

The latter may be explored using the analysis of bioelectrical activity such as power and coherence of the electroencephalogram at rest and its reactivity to stimulus processing and cognitive activities, such as event-related desynchronization and event-related potentials. Although these methods are very useful for assessing information processing during cognitive tasks and other activities, their value in detecting cognitive impairment concerning sensitivity and specificity needs to be validated and they have been mostly used for understanding the physiopathology of cognitive impairment in different forms and stages of the diseases. Nevertheless, newer applications such as longitudinal monitoring and effects of treatment, although explored only in pilot studies, seem quite promising allowing objective measures potentially useful as secondary endpoints in clinical trials aimed at preserving or improving cognition in MS patients.

The P300 event-related potential (ERP) has emerged as a valuable (endo) phenotype in neuropsychiatric research. Previous studies suggested the P300 ERP to be reduced in smokers. The main purpose of the present study was to provide an in-depth description of smoking-related behavioral, biological and electrophysiological phenotypes with an emphasis on the P300 ERP and its mutual relationship with other smoking-related parameters. In this case-control study N = 1318 participants (smokers and never-smoking controls) were investigated at 6 German academic institutions. Study participants were randomly selected from the general population. Subjects with mental disorders including alcoholism and drug abuse were excluded. The main outcome measure was the P300 global field power (GFP). We found a lower P300 GFP in current smokers compared to never-smoking controls. Furthermore a correlation between measures of smoking severity and P300 GFP reduction was found. Non-addicted smokers exhibited normal P300 ERP measures. This study provides further evidence that the P300 ERP is reduced in current smokers even in the absence of potentially confounding psychiatric comorbidity. Thus, P300 amplitude reduction clearly is part of the electrophysiological phenotype of smokers. Our results provide the phenotypical groundwork for future multidimensional analyses of genotype-phenotype relationships in the field of smoking and nicotine dependence. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To examine changes in event-related potentials (ERPs) and brain oscillations, we recorded the EEGs of healthy groups of young (n = 14; mean age = 32.3 years) and older adults (n = 14; mean age = 65.1). Both age groups exhibited similar accuracy and exploration times when making old-new judgments. Young and older participants showed a marginally significant ERP old/new effect widely distributed over the scalp between 550-750 ms. In addition, the elders showed lower amplitude than younger participants within 1200-1500 ms. There were age-related differences in brain oscillations as measured by event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP). Older adults showed greater alpha and beta power reductions than young participants, suggesting the recruitment of additional neural resources. In contrast, the two age groups showed a reliable old/new effect in the theta band that temporarily overlapped the ERP old/new effect.

Electrophysiological markers of cognitive deficits in traumatic brain injury: A review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; ERP; Spectral EEG; Cognitive impairment	CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INFORMATION-PROCESSING DEFICITS; DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; ERP COMPONENTS; SEVERE TBI; AWARENESS	Event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity from the human electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a rich source of data that helps elucidate specific processing impairments in TBI patients. This review will focus on some of the central and disabling cognitive deficits in TBI and how broadband ERP markers and the spectral content of the EEG can help explain abnormalities in brain function that impact upon processing speed, sustained attention, performance monitoring, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Physiological signals also provide useful outcome markers in cognitive intervention studies in conjunction with behavioural endpoints. Potential rehabilitation approaches utilising electrophysiological markers of recovery are also discussed. Progress has been made in recent years in defining key pathophysiological mechanisms in the context of sensitive laboratory paradigms. However, aberrant physiological signals need to be understood more clearly in future studies in terms of the neuroanatomical impact of injury, particularly in relation to the most common type of damage in TBI, disrupting extended white matter fibres.

In the results, there are the negative slopes of ERP before steering the wheel. At first, the potentials rise gradually negative (N1) and change rapidly (N2) to the peak at the time of steering the wheel. It is suggested that N1 is the preparatory activity to steer the wheel and N2 is the activity to exercise the muscle in motor preparation from the relationship between the start points of N1, N2, and the responses of EMG, and the amount of steering the wheel with the time lag.

In imagery sessions, subjects were asked to imagine a rhythm during a silent recording period following a series of guide sounds played at 1 Hz. In control sessions, subjects were asked to imagine a vowel sound ("a") continuously during the silent recording period. In eight subjects, relative negative potentials were recorded during imagery sessions (compared with potentials in control sessions), with timing that was similar to that of the guide sounds. Activity in the left frontal region was more significant than that in other areas during beat imagination. These data indicate that a semantic strategy for simple rhythm imagery might involve temporary phasic activation in the left frontal area, although rhythm production and perception might be generated in the right side, as reported in previous studies.

In this study, we utilized an analysis approach for single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze the spatio-temporal activation patterns of visual objects processing in human brains, and attempted to apply it to discriminate different visual objects. The spatial patterns were respectively extracted from scalp EEG and the reconstructed cortical sources, while the experiment participants were perceiving 4 different categories of visual objects (faces, buildings, cats and cars). By classifying the patterns extracted from single-trial EEG, the presented visual objects could be discriminated by a computer, and the classification accuracies may provide a quantitative index to evaluate the spatial differences of the brain activations related to different visual objects. Our results demonstrated that the spatial patterns on both the scalp and the sources levels resulted in higher classification accuracies than chance rate. We also examined the classification results using temporally non-overlapping time intervals of different event-related potential (ERP) components. The temporal changes of classification accuracies may reflect the temporal distribution of the discriminative information in the EEG responses. The present pattern extraction and classification methods may compose a computational model for single-trial EEG data analysis in investigations of the spatio-temporal activation patterns for object recognition. These spatio-temporal patterns in EEG may be useful to identifying the discriminative spatial areas and time stages to improve the accuracies and efficiencies of object discrimination. In addition, investigating and utilizing humans' cognitive mechanisms of object recognition may improve computers' processing efficiency of visual information.

Twelve subjects were assigned the aesthetic processing task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Event-related brain potential (ERP) was required from the 32 scalp electrodes and the ugly buffoon picture produced larger amplitudes for the N1, P2, N2, and late slow wave components. Average ERP from the ugly buffoon picture were larger than that from the beautiful woman picture. The ERP signals shows that the ugly buffoon elite higher emotion waves than the beautiful woman face, because some expression is on the face of the buffoon. Then, chaos time series analysis was carried out to calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent using small data set method and the correlation dimension using G-P algorithm. The results show that the largest Lyapunov exponents of the ERP signals are greater than zero, which indicate that the ERP signals may be chaotic. The correlations dimensions coming from the beautiful woman picture are larger than that from the ugly buffoon picture. The comparison of the correlations dimensions shows that the beautiful face can excite the brain nerve cells. The research in the paper is a persuasive proof to the opinion that cerebrum's work is chaotic under some picture stimuli.

A rhythmic structure can also be generated internally, by placing a subjective accent pattern on an isochronous stimulus train. Here, we investigate the event-related potential (ERP) signature of actual and subjective accents, thus disentangling low-level perceptual processes from the cognitive aspects of rhythm processing. The results show differences between accented and unaccented events, but also show that different types of unaccented events can be distinguished, revealing additional structure within the rhythmic pattern. This structure is further investigated by decomposing the ERP into subcomponents, using principal component analysis. In this way, the processes that are common for perceiving a pattern and self-generating it are isolated, and can be visualized for the tasks separately. The results suggest that top-down processes have a substantial role in the cerebral mechanisms of rhythm processing, independent of an externally presented stimulus.

Waveform Analysis of Non-Oscillatory Independent Components in Single-Trial Auditory Event-Related Activity in Healthy Subjects and Alzheimer's Disease Patients	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory event-related potential (AERP); Alzheimer's disease (AD); Independent component analysis (ICA); Blind source separation (BSS)	BLIND SEPARATION; NOVELTY ODDBALL; BRAIN; P300; POTENTIALS; TASK; FMRI	The objective was to characterize the non-oscillatory independent components (ICs) of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) waveform of an oddball task for normal and newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, and to seek biomarkers for AD. Single trial ERP waveforms were analysed using independent components analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering. Two stages of clustering depended upon the magnitudes and latencies, and the scalp topographies of the non-oscillatory back-projected ICs (BICs) at electrode Cz. The electrical current dipole sources of the BICs were located using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Generally 3-10 BICs, of different latencies and polarities, occurred in each trial. Each peak was associated with positive and negative BICs. The trial-to-trial variations in their relative numbers and magnitudes may explain the variations in the averaged ERP reported, and the delay in the averaged P300 for AD patients. The BIC latencies, topographies and electrical current density maximum locations varied from trial-to-trial. Voltage foci in the BIC topographies identify the BIC source locations. Since statistical differences were found between the BICs in healthy and AD subjects, the method might provide reliable biomarkers for AD, if these findings are reproduced in a larger study, independently of other factors influencing the comparison of the two populations. The method can extract artefact- and EEG-free single trial ERP waveforms, offers improved ERP averages by selecting the trials on the basis of their BICs, and is applicable to other evoked potentials, conditions and diseases.

This possibility has been repeatedly ruled out for the past 30 years, with the prevailing theoretical accounts relying on a memory-based explanation instead. We propose that the MMN is, in essence, a latency- and amplitude-modulated expression of the auditory NI response. generated by fresh-afferent activity of cortical neurons that are under nonuniform levels of adaptation.

The authors performed EEG and ERP analysis during daytime to identify electrophysiologic relations with cognitive dysfunction in unmedicated RLS patients. Methods: Seventeen drug naive RLS patients (53.7 +/- 9.6 years) and 13 age-matched healthy controls participated in the present study. EEG was recorded during the waking-resting state and during a visual odd-ball task. RLS seventies were determined using the International RLS Severity Scale. Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) and bothersomeness visual analog scale (VAS) scores were determined immediately after ERP sessions. EEG power spectra and P300 amplitude and latency were compared for patients and controls. Clinical variables were correlated with P300 findings. Results: Waking-resting EEG showed that RLS patients had significantly higher beta activity in frontocentral regions than controls. SSS scores were not different in the two groups. But the bothersomeness VAS scores of RLS patients were significantly higher than those of controls. Furthermore, P300 latency was significantly longer in patients, and patients had significantly lower P300 amplitudes in frontal and central locations. In addition, P300 latency was found to be significantly correlated with bothersomeness during the ERP test, whereas P300 amplitude showed no such tendency. Conclusions: Our study supports the notion that RLS patients have an underlying cognitive dysfunction. Significant correlations found between P300 latency and bothersomeness, a lack of sleepiness during the ERP test, and increased beta activity in resting state EEGs suggest that a combination of inattention and cortical dysfunction underlie cognitive dysfunction in RLS.

Removal of Movement Artifact From High-Density EEG Recorded During Walking and Running	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; STRIDE INTERVAL; DYNAMICS; FMRI; GAIT; SEPARATION; QUALITY	Gwin JT, Gramann K, Makeig S, Ferris DP. Removal of movement artifact from high-density EEG recorded during walking and running. J Neurophysiol 103: 3526-3534, 2010. First published April 21, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00105.2010. Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in static seated or prone conditions. EEG signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then performed component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to 8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.

Experiment 1 isolated an ERP component, the sustained anterior negativity (SAN), that increased in amplitude with increasing memory load in ASTM using stimuli with equal duration at all memory loads. The SAN load effect found in Experiment 1, when pitch had to be remembered to perform the task, was absent in Experiment 2 using the same sounds when memory was not required. In Experiment 3, the memory task was performed without or with concurrent articulatory suppression during the retention interval to prevent rehearsal via an articulatory loop. Load-related effects observed in Experiment 1 were found again, whether participants engaged in concurrent suppression or not. The results suggest that the SAN reflects activity required to maintain pitch objects in an ASTM system that is distinct from articulatory rehearsal.

However, little attention has been paid to investigate control mechanism of executive functions, i.e., error monitoring, in individuals with KS. Two event-related potential (ERP) components, i.e., error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) and error positivity (Pe), are the electrophysiological markers of error monitoring. This case report presents the findings of error monitoring from an adult with KS using the electrophysiological technique. This KS individual displayed small ERN and Pe amplitudes, suggesting that he may exhibit deficient error detection and reaction, a lack of conscious error recognition, and nonproficient adjustment after an error. The findings of this report should stimulate further study in error monitoring in individuals with KS.

Here we tested for a causal relationship between the activation of category-selective areas and ERP to their preferred categories. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants observed faces and headless bodies. Concurrently with EEG recording, we delivered two pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right occipital face area (OFA) or extrastriate body area (EBA) at 60 and 100 ms after stimulus onset. Results showed a clear dissociation between the stimulated site and the stimulus category on ERP modulation: stimulation of the OFA significantly increased the N1 amplitude to faces but not to bodies, whereas stimulation of the EBA significantly increased the N1 amplitude to bodies but not to faces. These findings provide the first evidence for a specific and causal link between activity in category-selective networks and scalp-recorded ERP to their preferred categories. This result also demonstrates that the face and body N1 reflects several nonoverlapping neural sources, rather than changes in face-selective mechanisms alone. Lastly, because early stimulation (60-100 ms) affected selectivity of a later ERP component (150-200 ms), the results could imply a feed-forward connection between occipital and temporal category-selective areas.

Using a behaviorally relevant no-shift condition as a control, we asked whether ipsi- or contralateral parietal alpha band activity is specifically related to covert shifts of attention. Cue-related event-related potentials revealed an attention directing anterior negativity (ADAN) contralateral to the shift of attention and P3 and contingent negative variation waveforms that were enhanced in both shift conditions as compared to the no-shift task. When attention was shifted away from fixation, alpha band activity over parietal regions ipsilateral to the attended hemifield was enhanced relative to the control condition, albeit with different dynamics in the upper and lower alpha subbands. Contralateral-to-attended parietal alpha band activity was indistinguishable from the no-shift task.

Using a double-blind active-control design, 29 children with AD/HD completed a 5-week at-home training programme and pre-and post-training sessions which included the assessment of overt behaviour, resting EEG, as well as task performance, skin conductance level and event-related potentials (ERPs) during a Go/Nogo task. Results indicated that after training, children from the high-intensity training condition showed reduced frequency of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. Although there were trends for improved Go/Nogo performance, increased arousal and specific training effects for the inhibition-related N2 ERP component, they failed to reach standard levels of statistical significance. Both the low-and high-intensity conditions showed resting EEG changes (increased delta, reduced alpha and theta activity) and improved early attention alerting to Go and Nogo stimuli, as indicated by the N1 ERP component, post-training. Despite limitations, this preliminary work indicates the potential for cognitive training that concurrently targets the interrelated processes of WM and inhibition to be used as a treatment for AD/HD.

Effect of complete stimulus predictability on P3 and N2 components: an electroencephalographic study	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potentials; forward model; N2; P3; predictability	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BRAIN; UNCERTAINTY; SURPRISE; ERP; EEG	In everyday life one may encounter both unpredictable and self-initiated, hence anticipated, events. Here, we analyzed the effects of self-initiated auditory stimulus presentation on P3 and N2 components in an oddball paradigm. If the stimulus sequence was fully self-determined, both components were attenuated in comparison with computer-controlled representation. In contrast, both components were increased when only the stimulus onset was self-initiated, yet the forthcoming stimulus type was unknown. We hypothesize that predictive forward models offer an unifying explanation for the modulation of both P3 and N2 through: (a) attenuation of neuronal responses to anticipated stimuli contingent on one's own motor action and (b) enhancement of responses in case of incongruity between an anticipated action effect and the actual perceptual consequences.

Can we let this matrix be moving (e.g., if attached to a robot) without loosing the efficiency of BCI? We assessed changes of the positive peak at Pz in the time interval 300-500 ms after the stimulus onset (P300) and the negative peak at the occipital electrodes in the range 140-240 ms (N1), both important for the operation of the P300 BCI, during fixating a target cell of a moving matrix in healthy participants (n = 12). Ni amplitude in the difference (target - non-target) waveforms decreased with the velocity, although remained high (M= -4.3, SD = 2.1) even at highest velocity (20 degrees/s). In general, the amplitudes and latencies of these ERP components were remarkably stable in studied types of matrix movement and all velocities of horizontal movement (5, 10 and 20 degrees/s) comparing to matrix in fixed position. These data suggest that, for the users controlling their gaze, the P300 BCI design can be extended to modifications requiring stimuli matrix motion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Riecansky, I; Katina, S				Riecansky, Igor; Katina, Stanislav			Induced EEG alpha oscillations are related to mental rotation ability: The evidence for neural efficiency and serial processing	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERP); Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Slow potentials; Amplitude fluctuation asymmetry; Spatial cognition; Intelligence	SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREMOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TASK; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION	People with better skills in mental rotation require less time to decide about the identity of rotated images. In the present study, alphanumeric characters rotated in the frontal plane were employed to assess the relationship between rotation ability and EEG oscillatory activity. Response latency, a single valid index of performance in this task, was significantly associated with the amplitude of induced oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and the low beta band (14-20 Hz). In accordance with the neural efficiency hypothesis, less event-related desynchronization (ERD) was related to better (i.e. faster) task performance. The association between response time and ERD was observed earlier (similar to 600-400 ms before the response) over the parietal cortex and later (similar to 400-200 ms before the response) over the frontal cortex. Linear mixed-effect regression analysis confirmed that both early parietal and late frontal alpha/beta power provided significant contribution to prediction of response latency. The result indicates that two distinct serially engaged neurocognitive processes comparably contribute to mental rotation ability. In addition, we found that mental rotation-related negativity, a slow event-related potential recorded over the posterior cortex, was unrelated to the asymmetry of alpha amplitude modulation.

Ten adults participated the same measurement session on three separate days. Results for visual ERP P3 amplitude and reaction time (RT) are presented for both task conditions. Both the reaction time of the visual task and the respective P3 latency increased during high memory load. It was also found that P3 amplitude and reaction time correlated only under the high memory load condition. The results indicate that visual P3 to a simple processing task is affected by external working memory load.

The algorithm uses a combination of methods from nonlinear time-series analysis and is based on the construction of pairwise registration functions from cross-recurrence plots of the phase-space representations of ERP signals. The globally optimal multiple-alignment path is approximated by hierarchical cluster analysis, i.e. by iteratively combining pairs of trials according to similarity. By the inclusion of context information in form of externally acquired time markers (e.g. reaction time) into a regularization scheme, the extracted warping functions can be guided near paths that are implied by the experimental procedure. All parameters occurring in the algorithm can be optimized based on the properties of the data and there is a broad regime of parameter configurations where the algorithm produces good results. Simulations on artificial data and the analysis of ERPs from a psychophysical study demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm.	[Ihrke, Matthias; Schrobsdorff, Hecke; Herrmann, J.

This study investigated the specific involvement of each primary motor cortex (M1) during a bimanual load-lifting task in which subjects were required to maintain a stable forearm position during voluntary unloading. Kinematics, electromyographic, and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in eight right-handed healthy subjects lifting a load placed on their left forearm. Two EEG analyses were performed: a time-frequency (TF) analysis and an event-related potential (ERP) analysis. The TF analysis revealed a mean power decrease in the mu rhythm over the left and right M1 concomitant with lifting onset. Each decrease showed specific features: over the right M1, contralateral to the postural forearm, there was a steeper slope and a greater amplitude than over the left M1. Although a mu rhythm desynchronization has until now been the signature of cortical activity related to a motor component, we show that it can also be related to postural stabilization. We discuss the involvement of the mu rhythm desynchronization over the postural M1 in the high temporal precision enabling efficient APAs. ERP analysis showed a negative wave over the left M1 and a concomitant positive wave over the right M1. While the negative wave classically reflects M1 recruitment related to the forthcoming lifting, the novelty here is that the positive wave reflects the transmission of inhibitory commands toward the postural forearm.

In addition, the effect of TMS to the attentional processes has been reported in many studies. In this paper, the effect of TMS on auditory attention in the EEG is discussed with applying a phase stability measure and adaptive feature extraction by optimized filter banks. The phase stability measure clearly shows that TMS has influence in synchronizing the N1-P2 component of event related potentials (ERPs) where the measure in TMS evoked ERPs is much higher than ERPs without TMS. The influence of TMS and attention can also be discriminated very well and illuminate the effect of TMS in auditory attention.

Electroencephalograph (EEG)-derived event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired from 18 FH+ individuals during a facial expression recognition task (neutral and sad, joy and surprise at 50% and 100% intensities). Both early positive (P1 and P2) and the face-specific N170 ERP components were differentially altered by emotional intensity and valence. Increased depression, confusion and total mood disturbance scores, and decreased calmness, were observed with AID (versus placebo). AID was also associated with enhanced P1 and P2 amplitudes for sad versus joyful expressions. The N170 was not modulated by treatment, but was affected by emotive valence. Therefore, AID enhanced ERP-indexed early processing of sad facial expressions, and altered the processing of positive ones, in FH+ individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

In task A, it was necessary to maximally rapidly press the button after an imperative signal preceded by a warning signal, while a definite time interval (limited by two pressings of the button) should be measured in task B. Parameters of the contingent negative variation, CNV, potential P300 and, in task B, readiness potential, RP, were measured in C3 and C4 leads. High amplitudes of ERPs (RP, P300, and CNV in task A) and smaller variability of the indices of working efficiency corresponded, in the whole, to higher estimates of psychological adaptability in general and of separate aspects of the latter estimated according to the scales of the used questionnaire. Probable mechanisms of the peculiarities of neurodynamic constitution determining the level of the psychological adaptability of the individual, on the one hand, and of the ERP parameters, on the other hand, are discussed.

Alterations in brain morphology and function including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are suggested to underlie the increased psychiatric disposition. We assessed response-inhibition in patients with DS22q11.2 (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 13) matched for age, sex, and handedness by means of a Go-NoGo-Task during recording of a multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Analysis of event-related potentials (P300) resulted in an aberrant topographical pattern and NoGo-anteriorisation (NGA) as a parameter of medial prefrontal function was significantly reduced in patients with DS22q11.2 compared to controls. Differences in IQ between groups did not account for the findings. Source localization analysis (LORETA) revealed diminished left temporal brain activation during the Go-condition, but no altered ACC activation in DS22q11 during the NoGo-condition. Despite recent reports of structural alterations of the ACC in DS22q11.2 our findings suggest that response-inhibition mediated by the ACC is not impaired in DS22q11.2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The participants were 114 children, aged 8-16 years. MMNs were elicited by two deviants in duration that occurred in an uninterrupted sound within a passive oddball paradigm, and each trial lasted 650 ms with 130 samples. CoRaST was derived from the frequency-domain MMN model through Fourier transformation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the wavelet transformation-based inter-trial coherence (ITC) was taken as a reference. Results: Performances of the proposed CoRaST and ITC were similar in evaluating the correlation of MMN activity among single trials. However, the analysis of electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings comprising approximately 330 trials at one channel took approximately 0.12 s with CoRaST, whereas ITC required approximately 45 s in our workstation. Conclusions: CoRaST has the potential to evaluate the correlation of MMN activity among single trials in a real-time system. Furthermore, the new method can be facilitated to study other event-related potentials (ERPs) of evoked or induced brain activity. Significance: The correlation of ERP activity among single trials can be immediately inspected during the ERP data collection in a real-time system.

The present investigation aimed at learning more about the neuronal mechanisms of NF training. Methods: Children with ADHD either completed a NF training or a computerized attention skills training (ratio 3: 2). NF training consisted of one block of theta/beta training and one block of slow cortical potential (SCP) training, each comprising 18 training units. At three times (pre-training, between the two training blocks and at post-training), event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded during the Attention Network Test. ERP analysis focused on the P3, reflecting inter alia attentional resources for stimulus evaluation, and the contingent negative variation (CNV), primarily related to cognitive preparation. Results: After NF training, an increase of the CNV in cue trials could be observed, which was specific for the SCP training. A larger pre-training CNV was associated with a larger reduction of ADHD symptomatology for SCP training. Conclusions: CNV effects reflect neuronal circuits underlying resource allocation during cognitive preparation. These distinct ERP effects are closely related to a successful NF training in children with ADHD. In future studies, neurophysiological recordings could help to optimize and individualize NF training. Significance: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying NF training in children with ADHD. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This paper focuses on the assessment of speech discrimination for fitting the parameters of hearing aids using the electroencephalogram (EEG). The characteristic of our method is to utilize the event-related potentials (ERPs) to visual stimuli instead of the conventional auditory stimuli. A letter is played through a speaker as an initial auditory stimulus; then, the same letter is displayed on a screen as a following visual stimulus as a match condition (p = .50), and sometimes a different letter is displayed as a mismatch condition (p = .50). The participant then determines whether the two stimuli represent the same letter or not. The conventional evaluation focused on the evoked potentials just after the initial auditory stimuli. A larger component of late positive potential (LPP) is elicited when a participant detects the mismatch between the auditory and visual stimuli. These results suggest the possibility of assessing speech discrimination using EEG potentials.

FUSION OF CONCURRENT SINGLE TRIAL EEG DATA AND FMRI DATA USING MULTI-SET CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	MAR 10-19, 2010	Dallas, TX	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		biomedical signal analysis; functional magnetic resonance; electroencephalography; multimodal analysis; multi-set canonical correlation analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TARGET	We propose a data fusion method for the fusion of simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single trial electroencephalography (EEG) data from multiple subjects using multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA). Our proposed technique utilizes the common time series information in the multimodal datasets to find trial-to-trial covariations across modalities, and based on these covariations, the data is decomposed into spatial maps for the fMRI data and a corresponding temporal evolution for the EEG data. Additionally, the analysis is performed simultaneously on data from a group of subjects, thus providing an efficient tool to make group inferences about cross-modality covariation. The proposed method is multivariate and hence facilitates the study of brain connectivity along with localization of brain function. We demonstrate the promise of the method in finding covarying trial-to-trial amplitude modulations in an auditory task involving implicit pattern learning.

Methods: Connectivity was assessed using several measures (phase coherence, phase lag index, synchronization likelihood and phase slope index) on 119 patients and 61 healthy controls over several frequency bands (between 0.5 and 45 Hz). Data was further correlated to EEG power, event related potentials, neuropsychological function and demographic variables. Results: Multivariate test on the connectivity data showed a difference between patients and controls both with mastoid reference (p < 0.01) and current source density estimates (p < 0.04). Connectivity and information flow correlated with EEG power but not with event related potentials or neuropsychological function. Conclusions: Connectivity and information flow are decreased in diabetes. These variables assess other functions of the brain than captured by the present cognitive tests. Several tests need to be performed in order to monitor the effect of diabetes on brain function. Significance: The decrease in connectivity and cortical information flow are EEG abnormalities that add to the previously described EEG and ERP abnormalities described for type 1 diabetes.

Advances in computing power and statistics have produced an alternative, mass univariate analyses consisting of thousands of statistical tests and powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Such analyses are most useful when one has little a priori knowledge of effect locations or latencies, and for delineating effect boundaries. Mass univariate analyses complement and, at times, obviate traditional analyses. Here we review this approach as applied to ERP/ERF data and four methods for multiple comparison correction: strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER) via permutation tests, weak control of FWER via cluster-based permutation tests, false discovery rate control, and control of the generalized FWER. We end with recommendations for their use and introduce free MATLAB software for their implementation.

Effects of Correct and Wrong Answers on ERPs Recorded under Conditions of the Continuous Performance Test in ADHD/Normal Participants	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						continuous performance test; event-related potentials; feature extraction; wave P300; sustained attention	ATTENTION; HYPERACTIVITY; REDUCTION; SIGNALS	Parameters of event-related potentials (ERPs) regarding correct and wrong answers under conditions of the continuous performance test (CPT) were measured in 50 adult subjects characterized by different levels of sustained attention with the absence/presence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). For ERP extraction, the average for each group of signals, which were time-locked to the onset of stimuli, was calculated; two ERP groups were considered separately for correct and wrong answers. In both groups, the P300 wave was clearly observed. The time dynamics of ERP components were investigated in six defined time blocks. At the peak of P300, a prominent component of brain activity could be observed. Some ERP morphological features (704 items) were extracted from these potentials. The results indicated that 11 of the obtained features showed a significant (P < 0.01) relation to the level of sustained attention. When comparing correct and wrong answers, 10 features in the normal group and 3 features in the ADHD group demonstrated significant differences (P < 0.05), which means that the participant's response is reflected in the features of EEG signal. The results reveal a promising relation between CPT results and some parameters of brain signals, which can be used for further evaluations of the sustained attention level.	[Ghassemi, F.; Moradi, M.

Aberrant processing of deviant stimuli in schizophrenia revealed by fusion of fMRI and EEG data	ACTA NEUROPSYCHIATRICA			English	Article						data fusion; event-related potential; functional magnetic resonance imaging; independent component analysis; N2; schizophrenia	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TEMPORAL-LOBE; GRAY-MATTER; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; P300 ABNORMALITIES; BLIND SEPARATION	Background: Aberrant electrophysiological and haemodynamic processing of auditory oddball stimuli is among the most robustly documented findings in patients with schizophrenia. However, no study to date has directly examined linked patterns of electrical and haemodynamic differences in patients and controls. Methods: In a recent paper we demonstrated a data-driven approach, joint independent component analysis (jICA) to fuse together functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) data and elucidated the chronometry of auditory oddball target detection in healthy control subjects. In this paper we extend our fusion method to identify specific differences in the neuronal chronometry of target detection for chronic schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Results: We found one linked source, consistent with the N2 response, known to be related to cognitive processing of deviant stimuli, spatially localized to bilateral fronto-temporal regions. This source showed significant between-group differences both in amplitude response and in the fMRI/ERP distribution pattern. These findings are consistent with previous work showing N2 amplitude and latency abnormalities in schizophrenia, and provide new information about the linkage between the two. Conclusions: In summary, we use a novel approach to isolate and identify a linked fMRI/ERP component which shows marked differences in chronic schizophrenia patients. We also show that jointly using both fMRI and ERP measures provides a fully picture of the underlying haemodynamic and electrical changes which are present in patients. Our approach also has broad applicability to other diseases such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, or bipolar disorder.

A mostly used criterion is that percentage of variance of raw data explained by the selected principal components composing the signal space should be over 90%. Recently, a model order selection method named as GAP has been proposed. We investigated the two methods by performing independent component analysis (ICA) on the estimated signal subspace, assuming the number of selected principal components composing the signal subspace is equal to the number of sources of brain activities. Through examining wavelet-filtered EEG recordings (128 electrodes) of ERPs, ICA with the reference to GAP decomposed 14 selected principal components reliably into 14 independent components, and ICA decomposition with the variance explained method was not reliable, indicating that the number of sources, as well as the signal subspace, should be well estimated through GAP.

Coordination task difficulty was equated between age groups by allowing participants to perform the task at self-determined frequencies. The amplitude of the P3b component of the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by visual task targets showed a different pattern across midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz) for younger and older adults. While younger adults showed a parietal maximum, P3b amplitudes in older adults did not differ across midline site, with lower amplitudes at central and parietal sites than younger adults but higher amplitude at the frontal site. Younger adults also had significantly shorter P3b latency than older adults. The results suggest that older adults may rely more on cognitive control of their movements than younger adults.

However, recent studies have found that the phase coherence of ongoing EEG oscillations is also related to stimulus-related brain activities and could reveal some information (e. g. phase-locked modulation in time-frequency domain) that ERPs could not provide. Here, we used inter-trail phase coherence(ITPC) to analyze the ongoing EEG oscillations under face/object stimuli, which aimed to explore the influence of face/object stimuli on EEG oscillations at various frequency bands (alpha, beta and low frequency gamma). Our preliminary results showed that (1) alpha band has relatively high phase synchronization in the time window of P1-N170-P2 under face/object stimuli; (2) EEG for face stimuli showed higher phase synchronization than object did in the time window of 80-350 ms in alpha band; (3) in low frequency gamma band, faces evoked relatively higher phase synchronization around 170ms than objects did. These results indicated that (1) ITPC, the measure of EEG phase synchronization, could be effectively used in face/object perception to provide oscillatory phase information; (2) the modulation of ITPC value in the alpha band might be more suitable to investigate the face preference EEG activities and locate the time range of the early face perception compared with ERPs; (3) the difference between face and object processing could be reflected in the low frequency gamma band via ITPC values.

Electrophysiological measures of conflict detection and resolution in the Stroop task	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Stroop; Electroencephalography (EEG); Cognitive control; Conflict detection; Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) manipulation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; ERROR-DETECTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TIME-COURSE; INTERFERENCE; WORD; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Conflict detection and resolution is crucial in a cognitive task like the Stroop task. Previous studies have identified an early negativity component (N(inc)) as a prominent marker of Stroop conflict in event-related potentials (ERPs). However, to what extent this ERP component reflects conflict detection and/or resolution is still unclear. Here, we report a Stroop task in which the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of color and word stimuli presentation was manipulated in order to disentangle the roles of conflict detection and conflict resolution in generating Stroop-related ERP components. Separating the word from the color information gives us precise control over the timing of conflict. If the N(inc) is related with conflict resolution it should be absent when the word appears during response preparation, as in a long-latency positive SOA. Our data shows that the N(inc) occurs in all SOAs, even after a response has been made, supporting its role in the detection of stimulus conflict rather than conflict resolution. The use of SOA manipulation therefore allows for the examination of a wider temporal spectrum of interference in order to specify the functions of this conflict-related component. These results provide insight into the neural signatures of conflict processes, and have implications for models of cognitive control mechanisms in the brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of artifact correction methods for infant EEG applied to extraction of event-related potential signals	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Development; Infant; Artifact correction; High-density EEG recording; Continuous EEG; Simulation	MISMATCH RESPONSES; MATURATION; PITCH; LAPLACIANS	Objective: EEG recording is useful for neurological and cognitive assessment, but acquiring reliable data in infants and special populations has the challenges of limited recording time, high-amplitude background activity, and movement-related artifacts. This study objectively evaluated our previously proposed ERP analysis techniques. Methods: We compared three artifact removal techniques: Conventional Trial Rejection (CTR), Independent Channel Rejection (ICR; He et al., 2007), and Artifact Blocking (AB; Mourad et al., 2007). We embedded a synthesized auditory ERP signal into real EEG activity recorded from 4-month-old infants. We then compared the ability of the three techniques to extract that signal from the noise. Results: Examination of correlation coefficients, variance in the gain across sensors, and residual power revealed that ICR and AB were significantly more successful than CTR at accurately extracting the signal. Overall performance of ICR and AB was comparable, although the AB algorithm introduced less spatial distortion than ICR. Conclusions: ICR and AB are improvements over CTR in cases where the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Significance: Both ICR and AB are improvements over standard techniques. AB can be applied to both continuous and epoched EEG. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the pulse-to-pulse neural effects of rapid delivery of multiple TMS pulses are unknown largely because of TMS-evoked electrical artifacts limiting recording of brain activity. Objective In this study, TMS-related artifacts were removed with independent component analysis (ICA), which allowed for the investigation of the neurophysiologic effects of rTMS with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Methods Repetitive TMS trains of 10 Hz, 3 seconds (110% of motor threshold) were delivered to the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule in 16 young adults. Simultaneous EEG recordings were made with a TMS-compatible system. The stereotypical pattern of TMS-related electrical artifacts was identified by ICA. Results Removal of artifacts allowed for identification of a series of five evoked brain potentials occurring within 100 milliseconds of each TMS pulse. With the exception of the first potential, for both areas targeted, there was a quadratic relationship between potential peak amplitude and pulse number within the TMS train. This was characterized by a decrease, followed by a rise in amplitude. Conclusions ICA is an effective method for removal of TMS-evoked electrical artifacts in EEG data. With the use of this procedure we found that the physiologic responses to TMS pulses delivered in a high-frequency train of pulses are not independent. The sensitivity of the magnitude of these responses to recent stimulation history suggests a complex recruitment of multiple neuronal events with different temporal dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

RSVP triage is essentially a cortically-coupled computer vision technique that relies on single-trial detection of event-related potentials (ERP). In RSVP triage, images are shown to a subject in a rapid serial sequence. When a target image is seen by the subject, unique ERP characterized by P300 are elicited. Thus, in RSVP triage, accurate detection of such distinct ERP allows for fast searching of target images in large volume imagery. The accuracy of the distinct ERP detection in RSVP triage depends on the feature extraction method, for which the common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) was used with limited success. This paper presents a novel feature extraction method, termed common spatio-temporal pattern (CSTP), which is critical for robust single-trial detection of ERP. Unlike the conventional CSP, whereby only spatial patterns of ERP are considered, the present proposed method exploits spatial and temporal patterns of ERP separately, providing complementary spatial and temporal features for high accurate single-trial ERP detection. Numerical study using data collected from 20 subjects in RSVP triage experiments demonstrates that the proposed method offers significant performance improvement over the conventional CSP method (corrected p-value <0.05, Pearson r = 0.64) and other competing methods in the literature. This paper further shows that the main idea of CSTP can be easily applied to other methods.

J	Ferdinand, NK; Runger, D; Frensch, PA; Mecklinger, A				Ferdinand, Nicola K.; Ruenger, Dennis; Frensch, Peter A.; Mecklinger, Axel			Event-related potential correlates of declarative and non-declarative sequence knowledge	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Incidental sequence learning; Declarative/non-declarative knowledge; Event-related potentials; Recollection; Priming	RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EXPLICIT MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN EEG; IMPLICIT; FAMILIARITY; DISSOCIATION; RECOLLECTION	The goal of the present study was to demonstrate that declarative and non-declarative knowledge acquired in an incidental sequence learning task contributes differentially to memory retrieval and leads to dissociable ERP signatures in a recognition memory task. For this purpose, participants performed a sequence learning task and were classified as verbalizers, partial verbalizers, or nonverbalizers according to their ability to verbally report the systematic response sequence. Thereafter, ERPs were recorded in a recognition memory task time-locked to sequence triplets that were either part of the previously learned sequence or not. Although all three groups executed old sequence triplets faster than new triplets in the recognition memory task, qualitatively distinct ERP patterns were found for participants with and without reportable knowledge. Verbalizers and, to a lesser extent, partial verbalizers showed an ERP correlate of recollection for parts of the incidentally learned sequence. In contrast, nonverbalizers showed a different ERP effect with a reverse polarity that might reflect priming. This indicates that an ensemble of qualitatively different processes is at work when declarative and non-declarative sequence knowledge is retrieved. By this, our findings favor a multiple-systems view postulating that explicit and implicit learning are supported by different and functionally independent systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A study on the EEG phase reset analysis by an inverse transform method	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 25, PT 4: IMAGE PROCESSING, BIOSIGNAL PROCESSING, MODELLING AND SIMULATION, BIOMECHANICS	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Congress of the IUPESM/World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	SEP 07-12, 2009	Munich, GERMANY	IUPESM, Int Org Med Phys (IOMP)		EEG phase reset; auditory attention; inverse transform	OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	We propose a signal processing tool for evaluating the electroencephalogram (EEG) phase reset due to auditory attention by utilizing an inverse analysis of the instantaneous phase for the very first time. EEGs were acquired through an auditory attention experiments with the highest entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that corresponds to auditory attention was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEG. Then the inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found a significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is needed to generate the event related potential (ERP). Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles the attention data. These results show direct connections between EEGs and ERPs and thus reinforce studies on the importance of the EEG phase reset in the ERP generation.

We combined the picture-word interference paradigm and the semantic blocking paradigm to investigate the temporal dynamics and functional loci of semantic facilitation and interference effects. Objects were named in the context of semantically homogeneous blocks consisting of related objects and heterogeneous blocks consisting of unrelated objects. In each blocking condition, semantically related and unrelated distractor words were presented. Results show that classic patterns of semantically induced facilitation and interference effects in RTs can be directly related to ERP modulations located at temporal and frontal sites, starting at about 200 msec. Results also suggest that the processes associated with semantic facilitation and interference effects (i.e., conceptual and lexical processing) are highly interactive and coincide in time. Implications for the use of event-related brain potentials in speech production research and implications for current models of speech production are discussed.

Most approaches make use of dwell times. However, in this context the so-called Midas-Touch-Problem occurs which means that the system wrongly interprets fixations due to long processing times or spontaneous dwellings of the user as command. Lately it has been shown that brain-computer interface (BCI) input bears good prospects to overcome this problem using imagined hand movements to elicit a selection. The current approach tries to develop this idea further by exploring potential signals for the use in a passive BCI, which would have the advantage that the brain signals used as input are generated automatically without conscious effort of the user. To explore event-related potentials (ERPs) giving information about the user's intention to select an object, 32-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from ten participants interacting with a dwell-time-based system. Comparing ERP signals during the dwell time with those occurring during fixations on a neutral cross hair, a sustained negative slow cortical potential at central electrode sites was revealed. This negativity might be a contingent negative variation (CNV) reflecting the participants' anticipation of the upcoming selection. Offline classification suggests that the CNV is detectable in single trial (mean accuracy 74.9 %). In future, research on the CNV should be accomplished to ensure its stable occurence in human-computer interaction and render possible its use as a potential substitue for the click operation.

Comparative study of methods for human performance prediction using electro-encephalographic data	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; KERNEL PCA; COMPONENT	The authors present here a comparative study of methods tackling the problem of predicting a person's quick or late response in an oddball experiment using their EEG data. The methods studied come from the related area of human performance monitoring (HPM) and rely on the use of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), linear principal component analysis (LPCA), or time features combined with a support vector machine (SVM) or a Gaussian classifier. The results show the consistent superiority of the kernel PCA features, whereas SVM is marginally better than the Gaussian classifier. The classification rates produced with this combination of type of feature and classifier are moderate but they are significantly better than random for all subjects. This is important because it indicates that prediction of a person's performance using their EEG data is up to a certain extent feasible. This is a strong indication that early event related potential (ERP) components are related to brain's discrimination processes and are correlated with the reaction time in an oddball experiment.

Auditory P300 and N100 components as intermediate phenotypes for psychotic disorder: Familial liability and reliability	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Psychoses; Schizophrenia; Test-retest; Relatives	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SIBLINGS DISCORDANT; GENETIC INFLUENCE; AMPLITUDE; ATTENTION; TWINS; RISK	Objective: Abnormalities of the auditory P300 are a robust finding in patients with psychosis. The purposes of this study were to determine whether patients with a psychotic disorder and their unaffected siblings show abnormalities in P300 and N100 and to establish test-retest reliabilities for these ERP components. Methods: Using an auditory oddball paradigm, P300 and N100 latency and amplitude were acquired from 19 patients with a psychotic disorder, 28 unaffected siblings, and 37 healthy controls, on two separate occasions. ERP components were compared between groups, using multilevel random regression analyses. Intraclass correlations were used to determine consistency of ERP components between the sessions. Results: A delayed target N100 latency was found in unaffected siblings. Patients showed significantly delayed P300 latency and diminished P300 amplitude compared to controls. Most ERP parameters showed good test-retest reliability. However, patients did not show sufficient reliability for N100 latency for standard stimuli. Conclusions: The present study failed to find significant P300 abnormalities in unaffected siblings. However, N100 latency is delayed in siblings and can be reliably measured in all groups for target stimuli, suggesting that this component, rather than P300, may serve as liability marker. Significance: N100 latency is a promising biomarker for psychosis liability. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Participants performed a multiplication verification task after having practiced a specific problem set. Practice was either active (retrieval of solutions to multiplication problems) or passive (reexposure to the same operands plus the correct result). Behavioral data showed retrieval-induced facilitation for practiced items and retrieval-induced forgetting for related, unpracticed items, irrespective of practice type. ERPs revealed that, for the active practice group, forgetting was reflected in a reduced N100 component time-locked to result onset. Irrespective of practice type, forgetting was also reflected in a reduced result-locked P350 component, whereas facilitation was associated with an increased amplitude of the same component. These results suggest that beneficial and detrimental effects of practice may be mediated by partially distinct processes.

Event Related Potential - ERP - is a basic and non-invasive method of electrophysiological investigation. It can be used to assess aspects of human cognitive processing by changing the rhythm of the frequency bands brain indicate that some type of processing or neuronal behavior. This paper focuses on ERP technique to help understand cognitive pathway in subjects from different areas of knowledge when they are exposed to an external visual stimulus. In the experiment we used 2D and 3D visual stimulus in the same picture. The signals were captured using 10 (ten) Electroencephalogram - EEG - channel system developed for this project and interfaced in a ADC (Analogical Digital System) board with LabVIEW system - National Instruments.

The big challenge of measuring FOS noninvasively lies in the presumably low signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, detectability of the FOS has been controversially discussed. We present reliable detection of FOS from 11 individuals concurrently with electroencephalogram (EEG) during a Go-NoGo task. Probes were placed bilaterally over prefrontal cortex. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used for artifact removal. Correlation coefficient in the best correlated FOS EEG ICA pairs was highly significant (p < 10(-8)), and event-related optical signal (EROS) was found in all subjects. Several EROS components were similar to the event-related potential (ERP) components. The most robust "optical N200" at t = 225 ms coincided with the N200 ERP; both signals showed significant difference between targets and nontargets, and their timing correlated with subject's reaction time. Correlation between FOS and EEG even in single trials provides further evidence that at least some FOS components "reflect" electrical brain processes directly. The data provide evidence for the early involvement of prefrontal cortex in rapid object recognition. EROS is highly localized and can provide cost-effective imaging tools for cortical mapping of cognitive processes.

J	Stankovic, B				Stankovic, Branimir			THE EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL METHOD IN NEUROLINGUISTICS	NASLEDE			Russian	Article								The study introduces the Event-Related Potential method in neurolinguistics, an electrophysiological method based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) data, used to assess on-line processing of cognitive activity focusing on the measurement of Event-Related Potentials (ERP). ERPs can be utilized when a comprehender's only task is to understand a word, phrase or sentence or to produce names or more elaborate utterances. Recording electrical brain activity in response to written and spoken words (as well as smaller and larger linguistic units) thus provides a means of tracking the brain's sensitivity to various linguistic inputs, revealing which factors are important to processing and the time course of their influence. Different types of neural activity are introduced: N100, P200, N200, P300, N400, P600. Then, foundings from various studies are presented; that semantic processing of a word begins even before it is uniquely identified and that there is a continuous mapping from linguistic input onto semantic representations, specifying words' semantic, phonological and syntactic properties.

In this algorithm, the shift-invariant wavelet packed decomposition is done by integrating a cost function for decimation decision in each sub-band expansion. Additionally, a shape adaptation of the wavelet is implemented to find the best adapted wavelet shape for a given class of ERPs. This scheme is used to analyze the time course of the impact of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the auditory ERPs. We show that the proposed scheme is able to extract even slightest impacts of TMS, making it a promising tool for the extraction of weak ERPs components, particularly in hybrid TMS-EEG/ERP setups.

Multivariate EEG signals were recorded while participants made preference decisions, based on approachability, between two faces presented sequentially with unrestricted viewing time; the decision being made after presentation of the second face. The paired faces were similar in their physical properties, emphasizing the role of the subjective experience of the participants in making the decisions. EEG signals were analyzed in terms of event-related-potential (ERP) components and wavelet-based time-frequency-representations (TFR). The behavioural data showed that the presentation order and the exposure duration did not influence preference formation. The EEG data showed three effects. The earliest effect, the sustained posterior ERP positivity for preferred first faces as compared to non-preferred first faces, was found following the onset of the first face, and this was interpreted as the formation of a positive first impression of the first face. The two later effects following the second faces were an increase of frontal theta band oscillations around 500 ms for preferred second faces and of posterior gamma band oscillations around 650 ms for preferred first faces: both of which were interpreted as being related to the formation of a preference. All of these effects occurred well before the moment of conscious decision, thereby suggesting the implicitness of these neurally identifiable components. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ERP effects of change localization, change identification, and change blindness	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						attention; awareness; change detection; change positivity; EEG; ERP; selection negativity; visual working memory	VISUAL AWARENESS; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; SEARCH	Change blindness is the failure to detect changes in visual scenes. Changes can elicit phenomenologically different perceptual experiences, possibly relating to different mechanisms: changes may be entirely missed, merely detected, located, or identified. We presented sequences of meaningful objects, one of which could change between the presentations. Changes had to be located and identified. Observers sometimes located the change without knowing which object had changed. However, effects of localization with and without identification were remarkably similar on a sequence of event-related potential components (including change-related positivity and N2pc). Only a late contralateral positivity was found exclusively for identified changes, indicating that change localization and change identification initially rely on a common processing sequence and differ only at later stages.

Electrophysiological correlates of remembering emotional pictures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Emotion; Memory; Recollection; Confidence; Arousal; EEG/ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; FAMILIARITY; STRESS; DISSOCIATION; INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; FLASHBULB; STRENGTH	Extensive evidence shows that emotional events tend to be remembered in greater detail and with an enhanced sense of vividness compared to neutral events. The current study investigated the neural correlates of this phenomenon during retrieval using the event-related potentials technique (ERP). Participants were asked to perform a memory recognition test of previously studied ("Old") and unstudied ("New") emotional and neutral pictures encoded a week before the test session. Next, they were asked to perform a Remember-Know task (Gardiner and Java, 1993) for each "old" decision. ERPs were created for retrieval activity corresponding to six conditions: Remember-Emotional, Remember-Neutral, Know-Emotional, Know-Neutral, New-Emotional and New-Neutral. Results showed that negative emotion enhanced three distinct subtypes of the electrophysiological old-new effect specifically for old items associated with a "Remember" Judgment. This effect was observed for ERP old-new effects conforming to an early frontal P2 old-new effect peaking at similar to 180 ms, a midfrontal old-new effect starting at similar to 300 ms (the "FN400") and a late positive complex (LPC) with parietal maxima observed at 500-700 ms. In addition, a breakdown of our data in different levels of emotional arousal revealed that the relationship between ERP correlates of retrieval and arousal conformed to a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped function for posterior late effects (500-700) and to a linear function for early effects (P2 and FN400). Taken together, these results suggest that multiple retrieval subprocesses contribute to the emotional enhancement of recollective experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Pseudoword pairs were presented to healthy adults while their EEG was recorded. Participants were either instructed to (a) indicate by a button press after each pseudoword pair whether the words rhymed or not (active paradigm) or (b) ignore the speech stimuli (passive paradigm). Results: In the active rhyme paradigm, a typical phonological N400 effect was elicited with non-rhyming targets showing more negative ERPs at posterior sites during 400-600 ms compared to rhyming targets. In the passive paradigm, an anterior positive effect was elicited for non-rhyming targets during 350750 ms compared to rhyming targets. Conclusions: Auditory rhyme processing can be studied at the group level by a passive neurophysiological measurement. In such a test, one should focus on the anterior positivity, which seems to reflect automatic rhyme detection. Future research is needed to make this task more reliable for studying rhyme detection at the individual level. Significance: A passive ERP measurement of implicit phonological processing could possibly function as an indicator of future success in learning to read in children from clinical populations.

To study the different brain activities on vision of different colored cars, the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were induced using the red and blue car pictures. The average response accuracy rate of red car is higher, and the average latency time of red car is shorter. At the same time, red/blue car pictures have different influences on different electrical potentials. It is obtained that the brain energy evoked by red car is larger than that of blue car.

These waveforms contain characteristic peaks and troughs, which can correspond to certain underlying processes. The determination of the functional significance of a particular ERP component involves simultaneous consideration of its eliciting conditions, polarity, latency and scalp distribution. The evaluation of these parameters, by medical specialists, leads to diagnostic of important psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the measurement on these parameters is usually susceptible to the subjectivity of the medical concept. This work presents a comparison between two methodologies that consider characterization and feature extraction/selection of ERPs signals, in order to distinguish normal from ADHD patients on a feature set formed by morphological, frequency and wavelet characteristics. Moreover, tests are made on the raw signals looking for informative events that could provide an increasing on classification accuracy.				pacastroc@unal.edu.co; jorgomezg@unal.edu.co; franciarestrepo@autonoma.edu.co; oscarhma@autonoma.edu.co; cgcastellanosd@unal.edu.co	Gómez-García, Jorge/J-4359-2017	Gómez-García, Jorge/0000-0002-6060-387X; Castellanos-Dominguez, German/0000-0002-0138-5489					10	0	0	0	4	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-642-21326-7	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2011	6687						445	453						9	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science	BBY24					2022-08-02	WOS:000308666100048

Eye Fixation Related Potentials in a Target Search Task	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			COUPLED COMPUTER VISION	Typically BCI (Brain Computer Interfaces) are found in rehabilitative or restorative applications, often allowing users a medium of communication that is otherwise unavailable through conventional means. Recently, however, there is growing interest in using BCI to assist users in searching for images. A class of neural signals often leveraged in common BCI paradigms are ERPs (Event Related Potentials), which are present in the EEG (Electroencephalograph) signals from users in response to various sensory events. One such ERP is the P300, and is typically elicited in an oddball experiment where a subject's attention is orientated towards a deviant stimulus among a stream of presented images. It has been shown that these types of neural responses can be used to drive an image search or labeling task, where we can rank images by examining the presence of such ERP signals in response to the display of images. To date, systems like these have been demonstrated when presenting sequences of images containing targets at up to 10Hz, however, the target images in these tasks do not necessitate any kind of eye movement for their detection because the targets in the images are quite salient. In this paper we analyse the presence of discriminating EEG signals when they are offset to the time of eye fixations in a visual search task where detection of target images does require eye fixations.

Multi-set canonical correlation analysis for the fusion of concurrent single trial ERP and functional MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI; TARGET; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and electroencephalography (EEG) data provide complementary spatio-temporal information about brain function. Methods to couple the relative strengths of these modalities usually involve two stages: first forming a feature set from each dataset based on one criterion followed by exploration of connections among the features using a second criterion. We propose a data fusion method for simultaneously acquired fMRI and EEG data that combines these steps using a single criterion for finding the cross-modality associations and performing source separation. Using multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA), we obtain a decomposition of the two modalities, into spatial maps for fMRI data and a corresponding temporal evolution for EEG data, based on trial-to-trial covariation across the two modalities. Additionally, the analysis is performed on data from a group of subjects in order to make group inferences about the covariation across modalities. Being multivariate, the proposed method facilitates the study of brain connectivity along with localization of brain function. M-CCA can be easily extended to incorporate different data types and additional modalities. We demonstrate the promise of the proposed method in finding covarying trial-to-trial amplitude modulations (AMs) in an auditory task involving implicit pattern learning. The results show approximately linear decreasing trends in AMs for both modalities and the corresponding spatial activations occur mainly in motor, frontal, temporal, inferior parietal, and orbito-frontal areas that are linked both to sensory function as well as learning and expectation all of which match activations related to the presented paradigm.

Effects of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) on interhemispheric communication	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine; Central nervous system stimulants; Interhemispheric transfer; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Humans	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; TRANSMISSION TIME; VISUOMOTOR INFORMATION; SEROTONIN INTERACTIONS; STIMULUS PROPERTIES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; CALLOSAL TRANSFER	Background 'Party Pills' containing trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and benzylpiperazine are legally available in many countries and marketed as safe alternatives to other illicit substances such as methamphetamine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (or Ecstasy). They have gained huge popularity around the world, especially amongst young adults. However, there is no information currently available describing the acute neurophysiological effects of these psychoactive drugs in humans. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of TFMPP on central information processing speed in humans. Methods A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study using electroencephalography (EEG) was carried out to investigate the effects of TFMPP on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT). Healthy, right-handed males (age: 25 +/- 5.6 years) were given placebo (n = 15) or TFMPP (0.94 mg/kg, oral, n = 15) and tested both pre- and 2 h post-drug administration. High-density EEG recordings (128 channels which were re-referenced using an average reference to make 129 electrodes) were used to record event-related potentials. The N160 component was defined as the biggest negative peak in the range between 140 and 220 ms after the event. The IHHTs were analysed by deducting the N160 latency obtained in the contralateral hemisphere from the N160 latency obtained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to stimulus signal. Results Statistical analysis using a split-plot design analysis of variance revealed that TFMPP significantly reduced the IHTT but did not affect reaction time. No statistically significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusions This study is the first to report the neurophysiological effects of TFMPP in humans and suggests that TFMPP may affect transmitter systems involved in speeding of interhemispheric communication in the male brain.

However, because most neuroimaging studies so far have studied ERP and fMRI face-selective markers separately, the relationship between them is still unknown. Here we simultaneously recorded fMRI and ERP responses to faces and chairs to examine the correlations across subjects between the magnitudes of fMRI and ERP face-selectivity measures. Findings show that the face-selective responses in the temporal lobe (i.e., fusiform gyrus-FFA) and superior temporal sulcus (fSTS), but not the face-selective response in the occipital cortex (OFA), were highly correlated with the face-selective N170 component. In contrast, the OFA was correlated with earlier ERPs at about 110 ms after stimulus-onset. Importantly, these correlations reveal a temporal dissociation between the face-selective area in the occipital lobe and face-selective areas in the temporal lobe. Despite the very different time-scale of the fMRI and EEG signals, our data show that a correlation analysis across subjects may be informative with respect to the latency in which different brain regions process information.

However, this effect is not always easily detectable. This is especially the case for patients in the pre-symptomatic phase, commonly referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), during which neuronal degeneration is occurring prior to the clinical symptoms appearance. In this paper, various synchrony measures are studied in the context of AD diagnosis, including the correlation coefficient, mean-square and phase coherence, Granger causality, phase synchrony indices, information-theoretic divergence measures, state space based measures, and the recently proposed stochastic event synchrony measures. Experiments with EEG data show that many of those measures are strongly correlated (or anti-correlated) with the correlation coefficient, and hence, provide little complementary information about EEG synchrony. Measures that are only weakly correlated with the correlation coefficient include the phase synchrony indices, Granger causality measures, and stochastic event synchrony measures. In addition, those three families of synchrony measures are mutually uncorrelated, and therefore, they each seem to capture a specific kind of interdependence. For the data set at hand, only two synchrony measures are able to convincingly distinguish MCI patients from age-matched control patients, i.e., Granger causality (in particular, full-frequency directed transfer function) and stochastic event synchrony. Those two measures are used as features to distinguish MCI patients from age-matched control subjects, yielding a leave-one-out classification rate of 83%. The classification performance may be further improved by adding complementary features from EEG; this approach may eventually lead to a reliable EEG-based diagnostic tool for MCI and AD.

J	Davidson, DJ				Davidson, D. J.			Short-Term Grammatical Plasticity in Adult Language Learners	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article							BRAIN; ACQUISITION; GERMAN	This overview describes recent work on certain electrophysiological correlates of grammar learning in adults. Electrophysiology is potentially useful for sentence processing research related to learning not only because it has the temporal resolution to observe event-related potential (ERP) responses to individual words as they appear within a sentence or a phrase but also for the behavioral classification occurring on the same trials. A classroom-based longitudinal approach, well known from earlier research, is first described, in which a magnetoelectroencephalogram (MEG) is recorded periodically while students acquire knowledge from a course outside the laboratory. A short-term learning design is also described, in which learners classify phrases while an electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded. The main observation of this work is that short-term changes in several ERP components can be seen in adult learners using conventional EEG or MEG recordings and that these short-term changes are potentially diagnostic of learning mechanisms. The results, although preliminary in many respects, suggest that a productive direction for future research might be to examine the dynamics of electrophysiological responses and behavior at multiple time scales during grammar learning.

Multisensory interactions in early evoked brain activity follow the principle of inverse effectiveness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multisensory; Crossmodal; Bisensory; Inverse effectiveness; ERP; EEG	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; REACTION-TIME; HUMANS; POTENTIALS; EVENTS	A major determinant of multisensory integration, derived from single-neuron studies in animals, is the principle of inverse effectiveness (IE), which describes the phenomenon whereby maximal multisensory response enhancements occur when the constituent unisensory stimuli are minimally effective in evoking responses. Human behavioral studies, which have shown that multisensory interactions are strongest when stimuli are low in intensity are in agreement with the IE principle, but the neurophysiologic basis for this finding is unknown. In this high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study, we examined effects of stimulus intensity on multisensory audiovisual processing in event-related potentials (ERPs) and response time (RT) facilitation in the bisensory redundant target effect (RTE). The RTE describes that RTs are faster for bisensory redundant targets than for the respective unisensory targets. Participants were presented with semantically meaningless unisensory auditory, unisensory visual and bisensory audiovisual stimuli of low, middle and high intensity, while they were instructed to make a speeded button response when a stimulus in either modality was presented. Behavioral data showed that the RTE exceeded predictions on the basis of probability summations of unisensory RTs, indicative of integrative multisensory processing, but only for low intensity stimuli. Paralleling this finding, multisensory interactions in short latency (40-60 ms) ERPs with a left posterior and right anterior topography were found particularly for stimuli with low intensity. Our findings demonstrate that the IE principle is applicable to early multisensory processing in humans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Frontal phasic and oscillatory generators of the N30 somatosensory evoked potential	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDUCED TRANSIENT POTENTIATION; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; MEDIAN NERVE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; FDG-PET	The N30 component of somatosensory evoked potentials has been recognized as a crucial index of brain sensorimotor processing and has been increasingly used clinically. Previously, we have shown that the N30 is accompanied by both an increase of the power spectrum of the ongoing beta-gamma EEG (event related synchronization. ERS) and by a reorganization (phase-locking) of the spontaneous phase of this rhythm (inter-trials coherency, ITC). In order to localize its sources taking into account both the phasic and oscillatory aspects of the phenomenon, we here apply swLORETA methods on averaged signals of the event-related potential (ERP) from a 128 scalp-electrodes array in time domain and also on raw EEG signals in frequency domain at the N30 peak latency. We demonstrate that the two different mechanisms that generate the N30 component power increase (ERS) and phase locking (ITC) across EEG trials are spatially localized in overlapping areas in the precentral cortex, namely the motor cortex (BA4) and the premotor cortex (BA6). From this common region, the generator of the N30 event-related potential expands toward the posterior part of BA4, the anterior part of BA6 and the prefrontal cortex (BA9). These latter areas also present significant ITC sources in the beta-gamma frequency range, but without significant power increase of this rhythm. This demonstrates that N30 results from network activity that depends on distinct oscillating and phasic generators localized in the frontal cortex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is especially the case in psychiatry when we usually have no direct method of measuring the pathology underlying the disorder being studied but, rather, have to rely on the subjective assessment of psychiatric symptoms. The use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) offers two potential major means of addressing this problem. First it is able to provide direct data relating to neural activity that may be abnormal in certain disorders. As such there are opportunities for utilizing the EEG in a variety of ways as an objective outcome measure. Second there is growing evidence that in certain circumstances the EEG can be used to predict which patients are likely to respond to treatment, thus potentially increasing the power of studies by decreasing non-response rates and increasing mean changes in outcome measure. Both of these uses of the EEG are illustrated in reference to the study of mood disorders and in particular depression and its treatment with antidepressants.	[Alhaj, Hamid; McAllister-Williams, R.

ERS/ERD is assumed to reflect neural processes relevant to cognitive tasks. Previous studies suggest that several sources of alpha rhythm, each of which can serve as an alpha rhythm generator, exist in the cortex. Since EEG/MEG signals represent spatially summed neural activities, ERS/ERD of the alpha rhythm may reflect the consequence of the interactions between multiple alpha rhythm generators. Two candidates modulate the magnitude of ERS/ERD: (1) coherence between the activities of the alpha rhythm generators and (2) mean amplitude of the activities of the alpha rhythm generators. M this study, we use a computational model of multiple alpha rhythm generators to determine the factor that dominantly causes ERS/ERD. Each alpha rhythm generator is modeled based on local column circuits in the primary visual cortex and made to interact with the neighboring generators through excitatory connections. We observe that the model consistently reproduces spontaneous alpha rhythms, event-related potentials, phase-locked alpha rhythms, and ERS/ERD in a specific range of connectivity coefficients. Independent analyses of the coherence and amplitude of multiple alpha rhythm generators reveal that the ERS/ERD in the simulated data is dominantly caused by stimulus-induced changes in the coherence between multiple alpha rhythm generators. Nonlinear phenomena such as phase-resetting and entrainment of the alpha rhythm are related to the neural mechanism underlying ERS/ERD. Hum Brain Mapp 31:703-715, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

One week after questionnaire administration. EEG signals were recorded while Ss (N = 102) were administrated the Emotional Go/NoGo task. They were instructed to respond to threatening, sad or friendly faces, respectively but not respond to any other facial expression. REPs presented enhanced responsivity to threatening and happy faces in several prefrontal areas, thus complementing the behavioral response data. Based on the behavioral and cortical indices the expected later attentional avoidance bias for threat in REPs and a difficulty in attention disengagement from threat in HAs were not confirmed. Moreover, REPs and HAs exhibited more bottom-up cortical regulation and more right-lateralized activation than DHAs in the processing of facial threat. In addition, there were non-significant results for DHAs on behavioral measures. However, they were cortically reactive to all facial expressions and not specifically to threat. Present results suggest that behavioral and brain levels of explanation should be carefully taken into account in further studies on anxiety. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event-related analysis was applied to combine the high temporal resolution of the EEG with the high spatial resolution of the fMRI, which may allow estimation of the temporal change in the activation of multiple cortical areas. A time scheme of stimulus presentation combined with an MRI scan was designed, taking into consideration the temporal delay between the generation of the P300 potential and the BOLD response. Three pattern oddball paradigm using standard, target and novel letter stimuli was performed, a technique in which subjects responded to rare target-letters but not to frequent standard- and rare novel-letters. Noises arising from the MRI scan and cardio-ballistic artifacts were removed from the raw data of the EEG by subtraction of the time-averaged waveforms of those artifacts. In comparing the grand average response of the EEG evoked by target events with those evoked by standard events, a significant difference was found in latency range from 280 to 450 ms (P<0.001). This enlarged response to the target was found to correspond to the late component, i.e., P3b, of P300. In the 14-subject group study of BOLD responses, significant activation appeared in the occipital, parietal and temporal regions and the prefrontal cortex, some of which showed a laterality of right-hemisphere dominance. Based on the results of EEG topography during the period of P3b response, a temporal progression of the activation from the occipital visual cortex via the temporoparietal and temporal regions to the prefrontal cortex was estimated. electronic document is a "live" template.

Recent studies described several changes of attention-related components of late frontal event-related potentials (ERPs) during Go/NoGo paradigm in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We aimed to determine whether ERP components corresponding to earlier encoding of visual incoming information are also modulated by attentional disorders. Methods. We recorded high-resolution EEG in 15 children meeting DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, comprising 15 age-matched control groups during an equiprobable Go/NoGo task in a cued continuous performance test (CPT-AX) paradigm. Both P100 and N200 ERP components were measured in response to both Go and NoGo stimuli. We analyzed both components with SwLORETA in order to localize their brain sources. Results. A low rate of Go correct response and high rate of omission errors were observed in ADHD children. When compared to controls, these displayed delayed P100 and N200 latency, and lower P100-NoGo amplitude. In addition, the P100 latency was delayed for NoGo compared to Go condition. The source of P100 was located in occipital area. A sizable decrease in early electrical activity was found in ADHD, especially in the NoGo condition. Conclusion. Our results suggest an early deficit in visual sensory integration within the occipital cortex in children with ADHD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Nazari, M.

We investigated behavioural and electrophysiological indices relevant to one domain of cognitive control; namely error processing. Methods: Adolescents aged 14 to 17 with ADHD (n = 23) and a typically developing control group (HC; n = 19) performed a visual go/no-go task. Electro-encephalography (EEG) data were collected simultaneously and response-locked error trials were averaged to derive two event-related potentials, the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). Evoked theta power and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were measured in two time windows ('early' and 'late') equivalent to those used for detection of the ERN and Pe. Results: Analysis revealed normal ERN amplitude and a statistical trend for smaller Pe amplitude at a fronto-central electrode site in the ADHD group. The group also showed significant reductions in late evoked theta power and early and late theta ITC. Relationships between behavioural measures and ITC were different between groups, particularly for post-error slowing, a measure of strategic response adjustment on trials immediately following an error. Conclusions: The results reveal abnormalities in behavioural and electrophysiological indices of error processing in adolescents with ADHD and suggest that ITC is more sensitive than traditional ERP measures to error-processing abnormalities.

Methods: We compared stimulus-and response-triggered EEG power and phase dynamics ipsilateral and contralateral to the response hand in Go trials during visual Go/NoGo reaction time tasks. Results: Two lateralised EEG power and phase dynamics were observed: transient power decreases in alpha-band EEG (corresponding to alpha-ERD) and consistent contralateral phase lags of theta-band EEG. Conclusions: alpha-ERD around the response onset is not substantially reflected in the MRP waveforms mainly because of phase inconsistency. Lateralised MRP waveforms around the response onset are mainly attributed to consistent contralateral phase lags in theta-band additive EEG deflections. Significance: Our results indicate that while both alpha-ERD and lateralised MRP are related to motor response execution, they reflect separate cortical activities. Analysis of EEG power and phase dynamics can help in elucidating the detailed underlying bases of cortical activities. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Electroencephalography in Children With and Without Sensory Processing Disorders During Auditory Perception	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY			English	Article						auditory perception; electroencephalography; evoked potentials; sensation disorders	P300; BRAIN; ERP; MODULATION; ATTENTION	OBJECTIVE. We sought to determine whether children with sensory processing disorder (SPD) differ from typically developing children on a neurophysiological measure, the P300 component of event-related potentials produced in response to brief auditory stimulation. METHOD. We used electroencephalographic measures (i.e., N200 and P300 components) to examine auditory processing in 20 children with SPD and 71 typically developing children, ages 5-10 yr. RESULTS. Children with SPD demonstrated significantly smaller P300 amplitudes and shorter N200 latencies than typically developing children. Brain activity correctly distinguished children with SPD from typically developing children with 77% accuracy. We also found a significant relationship between the neurophysiological measures and functional performance on sensory and motor tasks. CONCLUSION. This study presents empirical evidence that children with SPD display unique brain processing mechanisms compared with typical children and, therefore, provide further evidence for the neural deviations associated with SPD.

While some blood flow measures, e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, are characterized by high spatial resolutions, their time resolutions are in the range of second order. In contrast, electromagnetic recordings, e.g. electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography, directly detect neural activity that occurs in the range of milli-second order. In spite of its feasibility, analysis with traditional EEG methods has been associated with the limited ability to localize aberrant signals. However, the recent development of imaging technique, such as low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and its modified versions (e.g. sLORETA), improves the spatial resolution of EEG at rest and event-related potentials (ERPs), such as P300 and mismatch negativity by providing three-dimensional distribution pattern of these electrophysiological activities. In this chapter, the authors present recent findings from electrical neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia in relation to the neural basis of psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits of the illness, as well as treatment response. These research areas are likely to facilitate the development of practical and reliable biomarkers to predict symptom severity, improve long-term outcome, and pave a new avenue to early intervention of schizophrenia.

For this reason, spectral techniques adapted from signal processing such as event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) - and its variant event-related synchronization and event-related desynchronization - have been used over the past 20 years. They represent average spectral changes in response to a stimulus. These spectral methods do not have strong consensus for comparing pre- and post-stimulus activity. When computing ERSP pre-stimulus baseline removal is usually performed after averaging the spectral estimate of multiple trials. Correcting the baseline of each single-trial prior to averaging spectral estimates is an alternative baseline correction method. However, we show that this method leads to positively skewed post-stimulus ERSP values. We eventually present new single-trial-based ERSP baseline correction methods that perform trial normalization or centering prior to applying classical baseline correction methods. We show that single-trial correction methods minimize the contribution of artifactual data trials with high-amplitude spectral estimates and are robust to outliers when performing statistical inference testing. We then characterize these methods in terms of their time frequency responses and behavior compared to classical ERSP methods.

Based on measures of scalp field differences including all sensors, and using powerful, assumption-free randomization statistics, the program yields robust, physiologically meaningful conclusions based on the entire, untransformed, and unbiased set of measurements. Ragu accommodates up to two within-subject factors and one between-subject factor with multiple levels each. Significance is computed as function of time and can be controlled for type II errors with overall analyses. Results are displayed in an intuitive visual interface that allows further exploration of the findings. A sample analysis of an ERP experiment illustrates the different possibilities offered by Ragu. The aim of Ragu is to maximize statistical power while minimizing the need for a-priori choices of models and parameters (like inverse models or sensors of interest) that interact with and bias statistics.

Temporal dynamics reveal atypical brain response to social exclusion in autism	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; EEG; Autism spectrum disorder; Social exclusion; Social neuroscience		Despite significant social difficulties, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are vulnerable to the effects of social exclusion. We recorded EEG while children with ASD and typical peers played a computerized game involving peer rejection. Children with ASD reported ostracism-related distress comparable to typically developing children. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated a distinct pattern of temporal processing of rejection events in children with ASD. While typically developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at a late slow wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autism showed attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement of attentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize the importance of studying the time course of social information processing in ASD; they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar overt behavior and yield insights relevant to development and implementation of targeted treatment approaches and objective measures of response to treatment.

Event-related potential studies of post-traumatic stress disorder: a critical review and synthesis	BIOLOGY OF MOOD & ANXIETY DISORDERS			English	Review								Despite the sparseness of the currently available data, there is accumulating evidence of information processing impairment in post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). Studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) are the main tool in real time examination of information processing. In this paper, we sought to critically review the ERP evidence of information processing abnormalities in patients with PTSD. We also examined the evidence supporting the existence of a relationship between ERP abnormalities and symptom profiles or severity in PTSD patients. An extensive Medline search was performed. Keywords included PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder, electrophysiology or EEG, electrophysiology, P50, P100, N100, P2, P200, P3, P300, sensory gating, CNV (contingent negative variation) and MMN (mismatch negativity). We limited the review to ERP adult human studies with control groups which were reported in the English language. After applying our inclusion-exclusion review criteria, 36 studies were included. Subjects exposed to wide ranges of military and civilian traumas were studied in these reports. Presented stimuli were both auditory and visual. The most widely studied components included P300, P50 gating, N100 and P200. Most of the studies reported increased P300 response to trauma-related stimuli in PTSD patients. A smaller group of studies reported dampening of responses or no change in responses to trauma-related and/or unrelated stimuli. P50 studies were strongly suggestive of impaired gating in patients with PTSD. In conclusion, the majority of reports support evidence of information processing abnormalities in patients with PTSD diagnosis. The predominance of evidence suggests presence of mid-latency and late ERP components differences in PTSD patients in comparison to healthy controls. Heterogeneity of assessment methods used contributes to difficulties in reaching firm conclusions regarding the nature of these differences. We suggest that future ERP-PTSD studies utilize standardized assessment scales that provide detailed information regarding the symptom clusters and the degree of symptom severity. This would allow assessment of electrophysiological indices-clinical symptoms relationships. Based on the available data, we suggest that ERP abnormalities in PTSD are possibly affected by the level of illness severity. If supported by future research, ERP studies may be used for both initial assessment and treatment follow-up.

J	Wang, YJ; Jung, TP				Wang, Yijun; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			A Collaborative Brain-Computer Interface for Improving Human Performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been studied since the 1970s. Currently, the main focus of BCI research lies on the clinical use, which aims to provide a new communication channel to patients with motor disabilities to improve their quality of life. However, the BCI technology can also be used to improve human performance for normal healthy users. Although this application has been proposed for a long time, little progress has been made in real-world practices due to technical limits of EEG. To overcome the bottleneck of low single-user BCI performance, this study proposes a collaborative paradigm to improve overall BCI performance by integrating information from multiple users. To test the feasibility of a collaborative BCI, this study quantitatively compares the classification accuracies of collaborative and single-user BCI applied to the EEG data collected from 20 subjects in a movement-planning experiment. This study also explores three different methods for fusing and analyzing EEG data from multiple subjects: (1) Event-related potentials (ERP) averaging, (2) Feature concatenating, and (3) Voting. In a demonstration system using the Voting method, the classification accuracy of predicting movement directions (reaching left vs. reaching right) was enhanced substantially from 66% to 80%, 88%, 93%, and 95% as the numbers of subjects increased from 1 to 5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively. Furthermore, the decision of reaching direction could be made around 100-250 ms earlier than the subject's actual motor response by decoding the ERP activities arising mainly from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are related to the processing of visuomotor transmission. Taken together, these results suggest that a collaborative BCI can effectively fuse brain activities of a group of people to improve the overall performance of natural human behavior.

An ERP paradigm using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) with flankers	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Language; speech; EEG; ERP	BRAIN POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WORDS; FIXATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; MODELS	We describe a new procedure using event-related brain potentials to investigate parafoveal word processing during sentence reading. Sentences were presented word by word at fixation, flanked 2 degrees bilaterally by letter strings. Flanker strings were pseudowords, except for the third word in each sentence, which was flanked by either two pseudowords or a pseudoword and a word, one on each side. Flanker words were either semantically congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. P2 (175-375 ms) amplitudes were less positive for contextually incongruent than congruent flanker words but only with flanker words in the right visual field for English and in the left visual field in Hebrew. Flankered word presentation thus may be a suitable method for the electrophysiological study of parafoveal perception during sentence reading.

Given this situation, we would expect that there should be observable and perhaps major changes in electrocortical activity and responses. In this review, we discuss developmental reductions in EEG power and alterations in the dominant band of EEG oscillation frequency, moderated by developmental factors such as growth-related changes in grey and white matter, and in the developmental history of cognitive and sociocultural stressors. Similarly, we summarize alterations in event-related potential components reflecting stimulus processing, response monitoring, and response anticipation. We review the literature on such changes in EEG and event-related potentials during the adolescent period and summarize some of the new developments in the field as well as interpretative difficulties.

FASTER: Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Evoked potentials, visual; Artifact detection; Electro-oculogram; Electromyogram; Independent component analysis; Digital signal processing	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEPARATION; DYNAMICS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are typically contaminated with artifacts (e.g., by eye movements). The effect of artifacts can be attenuated by deleting data with amplitudes over a certain value, for example. Independent component analysis (ICA) separates EEG data into neural activity and artifact; once identified, artifactual components can be deleted from the data. Often, artifact rejection algorithms require supervision (e.g., training using canonical artifacts). Many artifact rejection methods are time consuming when applied to high-density EEG data. We describe FASTER (Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection). Parameters were estimated for various aspects of data (e.g., channel variance) in both the EEG time series and in the independent components of the EEG: outliers were detected and removed. FASTER was tested on both simulated EEG (n=47) and real EEG (n=47) data on 128-, 64-, and 32-scalp electrode arrays. FASTER was compared to supervised artifact detection by experts and to a variant of the Statistical Control for Dense Arrays of Sensors (SCADS) method. FASTER had >90% sensitivity and specificity for detection of contaminated channels, eye movement and EMG artifacts, linear trends and white noise. FASTER generally had >60% sensitivity and specificity for detection of contaminated epochs, vs. 0.15% for SCADS. FASTER also aggregates the ERP across subject datasets, and detects outlier datasets. The variance in the ERP baseline, a measure of noise, was significantly lower for FASTER than either the supervised or SCADS methods. ERP amplitude did not differ significantly between FASTER and the supervised approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Nolan, H.; Whelan, R.; Reilly, R.

Central components enhanced by emotional content are Early Posterior Negativity (EPN, 150-300 ms) and Late Positive Potential (LPP, >300 ms). Previous electroencephalography studies in children revealed a differentiation of the late component in response to emotional scenes, but failed to detect an EPN effect. Twenty-two children aged 8-10 years saw 200 arousing pleasant and non-arousing neutral pictures in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) design, while event-related magnetic fields were recorded with whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). Analysis of MEG data based on individual picture ratings yielded LPP-m but also EPN-m effects with topography and latency resembling that of adults. Thus, the mechanism of motivated attention at early processing stages (>150 ms) appears mature in children of this age group. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Learning From EEG Error-Related Potentials in Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; electroencephalography (EEG); error-related potentials; reinforcement learning	ERP COMPONENTS; NEGATIVITY; DYNAMICS; REWARD	We describe error-related potentials generated while a human user monitors the performance of an external agent and discuss their use for a new type of brain-computer interaction. In this approach, single trial detection of error-related electroencephalography (EEG) potentials is used to infer the optimal agent behavior by decreasing the probability of agent decisions that elicited such potentials. Contrasting with traditional approaches, the user acts as a critic of an external autonomous system instead of continuously generating control commands. This sets a cognitive monitoring loop where the human directly provides information about the overall system performance that, in turn, can be used for its improvement. We show that it is possible to recognize erroneous and correct agent decisions from EEG (average recognition rates of 75.8% and 63.2%, respectively), and that the elicited signals are stable over long periods of time (from 50 to > 600 days). Moreover, these performances allow to infer the optimal behavior of a simple agent in a brain-computer interaction paradigm after a few trials.

Whereas behavioral data inform us about the patients' performance, ERPs allow us to record discrete changes in brain activity. Further, ERPs can give us insight into the onset, duration, and interaction of independent cognitive processes associated with memory retrieval. In patient populations, these types of studies are used to examine which aspects of memory are impaired and which remain relatively intact compared to a control population. The methodology for collecting ERP data from a vulnerable patient population while these participants perform a recognition memory task is reviewed. This protocol includes participant preparation, quality assurance, data acquisition, and data analysis. In addition to basic setup and acquisition, we will also demonstrate localization techniques to obtain greater spatial resolution and source localization using high-density (128 channel) electrode arrays.

Using feedback is, hence, crucial for different cognitive capacities. The present study focused on feedback processing in hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Electroencephalographical (EEG) activity was recorded while participants performed a hypothesis-testing task in which a feedback signal allowing the evaluation of performance was delivered at each trial. To ameliorate the spatial resolution of EEG signals, the surface Laplacian was estimated. Results showed three distinct patterns of activation. At central and centro-parietal electrodes, the activity was sensitive to participants' expectancies in a binary and a gradual way, respectively. At the parieto-occipital electrode, the activity was sensitive to the evaluation of performance itself: correct versus false. In conclusion, the processing of feedback signal depends on at least three separate processes.

Less is known of the neural dynamics of top-down listening modes and affective liking judgments in relation with judgments of tonal correctness. In this study, subjects determined if tonal chord sequences sounded correct or incorrect, or if they liked them or not, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured. The last chord of the sequences could be congruous with the previous context, ambiguous (unusual but still enjoyable) or harmonically inappropriate. The cognitive vs. affective listening modes were differentiated in the event-related potential (ERP) responses already before the ending chord, indicating different preparation for the judgment tasks. Furthermore, three neural events tagged the decision process preceding the behavioral responses. First, an early negativity, peaking at about 280 ms, was elicited by chord incorrectness and by disliking judgments only over the right hemisphere. Second, at about 500 ms from the end of the sequence a positive brain response was elicited by the negative answers of both tasks. Third, at about 1200 ms, a late positive potential (LPP) was elicited by the liking judgment task whereas a large negative brain response was elicited by the correctness judgment task, indexing that only at that late latency preceding the button press subjects decided how to judge the cadences. This is the first study to reveal the dissociation between neural processes occurring during affective vs. cognitive listening modes and judgments of music. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The method is formulated in two stages. In the first stage, each of the N raw sweeps is processed by an individual "optimal" filter, where the 2nd order a priori statistical information on the background EEG and on the unknown ERP is, respectively, estimated from pre-stimulus data and obtained through the multiple integration of a white noise process model which is identifiable from post-stimulus data thanks to a smoothing criterion. Then, a mean ERP is determined as the weighted average of the filtered sweeps, where each weight is inversely proportional to the expected value of the norm of the correspondent filter error. In the second stage, single-sweep estimation is dealt with within the same framework, by using the average ERP estimated in the previous stage as a priori expected response. The method is successfully tested on simulated data and then employed on real data with the aim of investigating the variability of the P300 component during a cognitive visual task. A comparison with other literature methods is also performed. Results encourage further use of the proposed method to investigate if and how diseases, e.g., cirrhosis, are associated to differences in P300 variability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

State-of-the-art systems operate in two stages. Basic safety measures are adopted once external sensors indicate a potential upcoming crash. If further activity at the brake pedal is detected, the system automatically performs emergency braking. Here, we present the results of a driving simulator study indicating that the driver's intention to perform emergency braking can be detected based on muscle activation and cerebral activity prior to the behavioural response. Identical levels of predictive accuracy were attained using electroencephalography (EEG), which worked more quickly than electromyography (EMG), and using EMG, which worked more quickly than pedal dynamics. A simulated assistance system using EEG and EMG was found to detect emergency brakings 130 ms earlier than a system relying only on pedal responses. At 100 km h(-1) driving speed, this amounts to reducing the braking distance by 3.66 m. This result motivates a neuroergonomic approach to driving assistance. Our EEG analysis yielded a characteristic event-related potential signature that comprised components related to the sensory registration of a critical traffic situation, mental evaluation of the sensory percept and motor preparation. While all these components should occur often during normal driving, we conjecture that it is their characteristic spatio-temporal superposition in emergency braking situations that leads to the considerable prediction performance we observed.

Event-related potential (ERP) analysis has also indicated sequential information changes during the calculation process. However, little is known about the dynamic properties of oscillatory networks in this process. In the present study, we applied both ERP and event-related (de-)synchronization (ERS/ERD) analyses to EEG data recorded from normal human subjects performing tasks for sequential visual/auditory mental addition. Results in the study indicate that the late positive components (LPCs) can be decomposed into two separate parts. The earlier element LPC1 (around 360 ms) reflects the computing attribute and is more prominent in calculation tasks. The later element LPC2 (around 590 ms) indicates an effect of number size and appears larger only in a more complex 2-digit addition task. The theta ERS and alpha ERD show modality-independent frontal and parietal differential patterns between the mental addition and control groups, and discrepancies are noted in the beta ERD between the 2-digit and 1-digit mental addition groups. The 2-digit addition (both visual and auditory) results in similar beta ERD patterns to the auditory control, which may indicate a reliance on auditory-related resources in mental arithmetic, especially with increasing task difficulty. These results coincide with the theory of simple calculation relying on the visuospatial process and complex calculation depending on the phonological process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Yamanaka, K; Yamamoto, Y				Yamanaka, Kentaro; Yamamoto, Yoshiharu			Single-trial EEG Power and Phase Dynamics Associated with Voluntary Response Inhibition	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO-NOGO TASKS; GO/NOGO TASK; STIMULUS PROBABILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN DYNAMICS	Human voluntary response inhibition has frequently been investigated using go/no-go RT tasks. Recent studies have indicated that not only the traditional averaging waveforms of EEG activities (ERPs) but also the power and phase dynamics of single-trial EEG are important in studying the neural correlates of various human cognitive functions. Therefore, here, we aimed to undertake a detailed study of the time/frequency power and phase dynamics of single-trial EEG during go/no-go RT tasks, with focus particularly on the no-go-specific power and phase dynamics, which are presumed to involve the voluntary response inhibition processes. Thus, we demonstrated no-go-specific theta band EEG power increases and intertrial phase-locking in the midline-frontal areas, which are related to no-go-specific midline-frontal negative-positive ERP waveforms (no-go N2/no-go P3). In addition, we observed no-go-specific alpha band EEG intertrial phase-locking with an adjacent dephasing phenomenon, which is mainly associated with the early part of no-go N2. The estimated time point when the no-go-specific midline-frontal dephasing phenomenon occurred corresponded to the initial part of the voluntary response inhibition process (decision to withhold). Moreover, the no-go-specific phase dynamics in the midline-frontal areas just before and around the no-go N2 peak latency, unlike the power modulations, were affected by changes in the no-go stimulus probability, suggesting the dependence of only phase dynamics on no-go stimulus probability. From these results, we conclude that the complex power and phase dynamics of the theta and alpha band EEG in the midline-frontal areas are specific to no-go trials, being the underlying bases of the no-go-specific ERP waveforms, and suggest that the phase dynamics just before and around the no-go N2 peak latency may involve, at least, the initial part of the voluntary response inhibition process (decision to withhold).

Neural correlates of performance monitoring in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)	WORLD JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Error processing; Event-related potentials; ERN; PE; ADHD	REPORT SCALE ASRS; ERROR-DETECTION; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ERP COMPONENTS; CHILDREN; VALIDITY; TASKS	Introduction. In this study, the neural correlates of error processing in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are to be investigated for the first time. Recent studies in children with ADHD suggested, with some inconsistencies, deficits in error processing. Based on an analogue study with students, we hypothesized that ADHD patients show reduced amplitudes in the event-related potential (ERP) of the Pe (error positivity) but normal amplitudes of the ERN (error-related negativity) after incorrect responses. Method. In this study we investigated 34 adult ADHD patients and 34 healthy controls with a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task while recording the neural activity with 26 scalp EEG electrodes. Patients discontinued all medication at least 3 days prior to investigation. Age was included as a control variable for the statistical analyses. Results and conclusion. As hypothesized, we found reduced Pe amplitudes, but also reduced ERN values, in ADHD patients. Importantly, theses differences as well as the deficits in behavioural performance were mainly detectable in the younger subsample, but not in the elderly subsample. Our results indicate that adult ADHD patients are characterized by deficits in error processing, which vanish with age.

Many BCIs use noninvasive electroencephalography as a measurement technique and the P300 event-related potential as an input signal (P300 BCI). Since the first experiment with a P300 BCI system in 1988 by Farwell and Donchin, not only data processing has improved but also stimuli presentation has been varied and a plethora of applications was developed and refined. Nowadays, these applications are facing the challenge of being transferred from the research laboratory into real-life situations to serve motor-impaired people in their homes as assistive technology.

J	Treder, MS; Blankertz, B				Treder, Matthias S.; Blankertz, Benjamin			(C)overt attention and visual speller design in an ERP-based brain-computer interface	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 SPELLER; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; STEADY-STATE; ALS PATIENTS; BCI; SYSTEM	Background: In a visual oddball paradigm, attention to an event usually modulates the event-related potential (ERP). An ERP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) exploits this neural mechanism for communication. Hitherto, it was unclear to what extent the accuracy of such a BCI requires eye movements (overt attention) or whether it is also feasible for targets in the visual periphery (covert attention). Also unclear was how the visual design of the BCI can be improved to meet peculiarities of peripheral vision such as low spatial acuity and crowding. Method: Healthy participants (N = 13) performed a copy-spelling task wherein they had to count target intensifications. EEG and eye movements were recorded concurrently. First, (c) overt attention was investigated by way of a target fixation condition and a central fixation condition. In the latter, participants had to fixate a dot in the center of the screen and allocate their attention to a target in the visual periphery. Second, the effect of visual speller layout was investigated by comparing the symbol Matrix to an ERP-based Hex-o-Spell, a two-levels speller consisting of six discs arranged on an invisible hexagon. Results: We assessed counting errors, ERP amplitudes, and offline classification performance. There is an advantage (i.e., less errors, larger ERP amplitude modulation, better classification) of overt attention over covert attention, and there is also an advantage of the Hex-o-Spell over the Matrix. Using overt attention, P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 components are enhanced by attention. Using covert attention, only N2 and P3 are enhanced for both spellers, and N1 and P2 are modulated when using the Hex-o-Spell but not when using the Matrix. Consequently, classifiers rely mainly on early evoked potentials in overt attention and on later cognitive components in covert attention. Conclusions: Both overt and covert attention can be used to drive an ERP-based BCI, but performance is markedly lower for covert attention. The Hex-o-Spell outperforms the Matrix, especially when eye movements are not permitted, illustrating that performance can be increased if one accounts for peculiarities of peripheral vision.

We examined the locus of no-go interference on task-switching performance by comparing the event-related potential (ERP) time course of go/go and no-go/go sequences from cue onset to response execution. We also examined whether noninformative trials (i.e., delayed reconfiguration, no response inhibition) produce similar sequence effects. Participants switched using informative and noninformative cues (Experiment 2) intermixed with no-go trials (Experiment 1). Repeat RT was slower for both no-go/informative (pNG/I) and noninformative/informative (pNI/I) than informative/informative sequences. ERPs linked to anticipatory preparation showed no effect of trial sequence. ERPs indicated that pNG/I sequences reduce response readiness whereas pNI/I sequences reduce repetition benefit for repeat trials. Implications for task-switching models are discussed.

ERP/EEG is cheaper and potentially wearable but it gives more coarse-grain data. Recently the metaphor between machines and brains has been introduced in the context of mind state decoders: the "readers for machines' thoughts". This metaphor gives the possibility for comparing mind state decoder methods in a more controlled setting. In this paper, we compare the fMRI and ERP/EEG in the context of building "readers for machines' thoughts". We want assess if the cheaper ERP/EEG can be competitive with fMRI models for building decoders for mind states. Experiments show that accuracy of "readers" based on ERP/EEG-like data are considerably lower than the one of those based on fMRI-like images.

A comparative study between a simplified Kalman filter and Sliding Window Averaging for single trial dynamical estimation of event-related potential	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Single trial; Kalman filter; Sliding Window Averaging	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NETWORK; BRAIN	The classical approach for extracting event-related potentials (ERPs) from the brain is ensemble averaging. For long latency ERPs this is not optimal, partly due to the time-delay in obtaining a response and partly because the latency and amplitude for the ERP components, like the P300, are variable and depend on cognitive function. This study compares the performance of a simplified Kalman filter with Sliding Window Averaging in tracking dynamical changes in single trial P300. The comparison is performed on simulated P300 data with added background noise consisting of both simulated and real background EEG in various input signal to noise ratios. While both methods can be applied to track dynamical changes, the simplified Kalman filter has an advantage over the Sliding Window Averaging, most notable in a better noise suppression when both are optimized for faster changing latency and amplitude in the P300 component and in a considerably higher robustness towards suboptimal settings. The latter is of great importance in a clinical setting where the optimal setting cannot be determined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF OLFACTORY PROCESSING IN THE HUMAN BRAIN: AN EVENT-RELATED SOURCE IMAGING STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event related potentials; source imaging; olfaction; mesial temporal lobe	ELECTROMAGNETIC EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NONINVASIVE LOCALIZATION; ODOR; CORTEX; MEMORY; CONVERGENCE; STIMULATION; RESPONSES	Although brain structures involved in central nervous olfactory processing in humans have been well identified with functional neuroimaging, little is known about the temporal sequence of their activation. We recorded olfactory event-related potentials (ERP) to H2S stimuli presented to the left and right nostril in 12 healthy subjects. Topographic and source analysis identified four distinct processing steps between 200 and 1000 ms. Activation started ipsilateral to the stimulated nostril in the mesial and lateral temporal cortex (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula). Subsequently, the corresponding structures on the contralateral side became involved, followed by frontal structures at the end of the activation period. Thus, based on EEG-related data, current results suggest that olfactory information in humans is processed first ipsilaterally to the stimulated nostril and then activates the major relays in olfactory information processing in both hemispheres. Most importantly, the currently described techniques allow the investigation of the spatial processing of olfactory information at a high temporal resolution. (C) 2010 IBRO.

The amplitude and topography of the P1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP) are both affected; the latter of which indicates alterations in active brain networks between populations. At least two issues remain unresolved. First, the specificity of this deficit (and suitability as an endophenotype) has yet to be established, with evidence for impaired P1 responses in other clinical populations. Second, it remains unknown whether schizophrenia patients exhibit intact functional modulation of the P1 VEP component; an aspect that may assist in distinguishing effects specific to schizophrenia. We applied electrical neuroimaging analyses to VEPs from chronic schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in response to variation in the parafoveal spatial extent of stimuli. Healthy controls demonstrated robust modulation of the VEP strength and topography as a function of the spatial extent of stimuli during the P1 component. By contrast, no such modulations were evident at early latencies in the responses from patients with schizophrenia. Source estimations localized these deficits to the left precuneus and medial inferior parietal cortex. These findings provide insights on potential underlying low-level impairments in schizophrenia.

Sixty-nine male participants either high or low in Trait BIS completed a Go/No-Go task while the electroencephalogram was recorded. As expected, Trait BIS was associated with the No-Go-anteriorisation of the P300 event-related potential (i.e. all index of response inhibition presumably generated ill the dorsal anterior cingulate-an area implicated in conflict processing) and with No-Go-related changes towards left frontal alpha activity (i.e. presumably more activity in right prefrontal cortex-an area implicated in response inhibition). These findings support the role of conflict processing attributed to BIS functioning in the revised theory. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus, the reliability of measurements is as important as their validity. Here we investigated the reliability of brain electrical visual evoked responses to faces and noise textures. For the first time, we provide reliability measures for the full time course of event-related potentials (ERPs). Our analyses were also performed on a R-2(t) metric that reflects results from single-trial analyses,. therefore providing the first reliability analysis of ERP single-trial analyses. Results show that ERPs and R-2(t) are highly reliable (cross-correlation similar to 0.9, lag similar to 4/6 ms, intra-class correlation similar to 0.9) but also idiosyncratic: ERPs and R2(t) are highly reproducible within subjects, who differ reliably from each other and the grand average across subjects. Consequently, grand averages, although highly reliable, can be misleading because they might not reflect the actual brain dynamic of any subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Resonance phenomena in the human auditory cortex: individual resonance frequencies of the cerebral cortex determine electrophysiological responses	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Steady state; Resonance; Gamma oscillations	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; STEADY-STATE; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ATTENTION; BRAIN; DELTA; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	The brain can be considered a dynamical system which is able to oscillate at multiple frequencies. To study the brain's preferred oscillation frequencies, the resonance frequencies in the frequency response of the system can be assessed by stimulating the brain at various stimulation frequencies. Furthermore, the event-related potential (ERP) can be considered as the brain's impulse response. For linear dynamical systems, the frequency response should be equivalent to the frequency transform of the impulse response. The present study test whether this fundamental relation is also true for the frequency transform of the ERP and the frequency response of the brain. Results show that the spectral characteristics of both impulse and frequency response in the gamma frequency range are significantly correlated. Thus, we speculate that the resonance frequencies determine the frequency spectrum of the impulse response. This, in turn, implies that both measures are determined by the same, individually specific, neuronal generator mechanisms.	[Herrmann, C.

To this end, we compared internally and externally-caused errors in a selective attention task with respect to error-related EEG activity and error-induced adjustments of speed and attentional selectivity. Both error types evoked early negativities and later positivities in the response-locked event-related potential. However, whereas internally-caused errors caused posterror slowing, externally-caused errors were followed by reduced attentional selectivity. Moreover, the amount of reduced attentional selectivity was related to the amplitude of the early negativity on externally-caused errors. This suggests that posterror adjustments are initiated on the basis of perceived causality and, thus, causal attribution of errors.

Methods: Twelve TBI patients and 14 healthy controls underwent a single training session on a computer-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat (R)). The sensory pathways were assessed using sensory evoked potentials (SEPs). The global delta-alpha EEG power ratio (DAR) and latency of the P300 component of the event-related potentials was assessed prior to and following a training session. Results: Baseline measurements showed impaired SEPs in the majority of patients and significantly larger DAR in patients compared to healthy controls. Robotic gait training resulted in a reduction of the DAR in healthy subjects but not in patients. No changes were observed in P300 latencies after training in either patients or healthy controls. Conclusion: The study showed that robotic gait training induced measurable changes in the EEG power spectrum in healthy individuals, while no changes were observed in patients with severe TBI. The absence of the EEG changes following training might be an indicator of the severity of brain dysfunction.

Single-trial event-related potentials and the orienting reflex to monaural tones	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Habituation; Orienting reflex; Preliminary Process Theory; Single-trial event-related potentials; ERPs	LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; AUDITORY-STIMULI; HABITUATION; COMPONENTS; P300; TASK; ERP; INTENSITY; FRACTIONATION; ACTIVATION	We aimed to clarify the event-related potentials (ERPs) involved in elicitation and habituation of the orienting reflex (OR), seeking parallels with two autonomic measures reflecting different stages in OR-related processing. Participants were presented with 8 unexpected innocuous novel tones to one ear at long variable inter-stimulus intervals, and horizontal eye movement in the direction of the ear of stimulation was taken as a behavioural measure of the OR. Skin conductance, heart rate, and 19 EEG channels were also recorded. Single-trial ERPs were decomposed using principal components analysis for intervals covering the early N1 complex and the late positive complex (LPC). Eye movements at trial 1 showed significant directional differences with ear of stimulation, and this difference reduced over trials, providing behavioural evidence of OR elicitation and habituation. Electrodermal responses, Processing Negativity, and the Novelty P3 showed substantial main effects of trials, suggesting their close links to the OR. Cardiac deceleration and Component 1 of the N1 complex showed no change over trials, suggesting their association in marking the transient onset of each stimulus. Component 3 of the N1 complex, P3a, P3b, and early and late Slow Waves showed only topographic changes over trials, and their dominant continuation over the stimulus sequence rules them out as OR markers. Theory development is required to clarify the non-OR role of the LPC. These results point to the usefulness of a sequential-processing approach to the OR in accommodating the range of subcomponents in the ERP. These data also illustrate the value of single-trial ERP analysis in simple paradigms with very long inter-stimulus intervals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Event-Related Potential Correlates of Performance-Monitoring in a Lateralized Time-Estimation Task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ENHANCED COGNITIVE CONTROL; STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EXTERNAL INFORMATION	Performance-monitoring as a key function of cognitive control covers a wide range of diverse processes to enable goal directed behavior and to avoid maladjustments. Several event-related brain potentials (ERP) are associated with performance-monitoring, but their conceptual background differs. For example, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is associated with unexpected performance feedback and might serve as a teaching signal for adaptational processes, whereas the error-related negativity (ERN) is associated with error commission and subsequent behavioral adaptation. The N2 is visible in the EEG when the participant successfully inhibits a response following a cue and thereby adapts to a given stop-signal. Here, we present an innovative paradigm to concurrently study these different performance-monitoring-related ERPs. In 24 participants a tactile time-estimation task interspersed with infrequent stop-signal trials reliably elicited all three ERPs. Sensory input and motor output were completely lateralized, in order to estimate any hemispheric processing preferences for the different aspects of performance monitoring associated with these ERPs. In accordance with the literature our data suggest augmented inhibitory capabilities in the right hemisphere given that stop-trial performance was significantly better with left-as compared to right-hand stop-signals. In line with this, the N2 scalp distribution was generally shifted to the right in addition to an ipsilateral shift in relation to the response hand. Other than that, task lateralization affected neither behavior related to error and feedback processing nor ERN or FRN. Comparing the ERP topographies using the Global Map Dissimilarity index, a large topographic overlap was found between all considered components. With an evenly distributed set of trials and a split-half reliability for all ERP components >=.85 the task is well suited to efficiently study N2, ERN, and FRN concurrently which might prove useful for group comparisons, especially in clinical populations.

Resting EEG theta power correlates with cognitive performance in healthy older adults	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Aged/Demented; EEG/ERP	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE EEG; IMPAIRMENT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; DEMENTIA; PREDICTION; COHERENCE	We address the degree to which resting EEG bandpower is associated with cognitive performance in 73 healthy older adults (aged 56-70). Relative theta (4-6.5 Hz) power was significantly correlated with immediate and delayed verbal recall, attention, and executive function measures. Relative delta and alpha power and peak alpha frequency did not correlate with any cognitive measures. These data indicate that high resting theta power in healthy older adults is associated with better cognitive function and may be a marker of healthy neurocognitive aging. Comparison of these with previous findings suggests that two forms of theta-frequency oscillations may exist; one indicative of healthy neurocognitive function and the other, EEG/alpha slowing linked to (future) substantial cognitive decline. Future EEG investigations of cognitive aging or decline should analyze both relative theta power and degree of EEG/alpha slowing so as not to confound these.

The reproducible pattern of the frequency characteristics of SSVEPs shows a global amplitude maximum around 10 Hz and additional local maxima around 20 and 40 Hz, which have been argued to represent resonant behavior of damped neuronal oscillators. Simultaneous electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) measurement allows testing of the resonance hypothesis about the frequency-selective increases in SSVEP amplitudes in human subjects, because the total synaptic activity that is represented in the fMRI-Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (fMRI-BOLD) response would not increase but get synchronized at the resonance frequency. For this purpose, 40 healthy volunteers were visually stimulated with flickering light at systematically varying frequencies between 6 and 46 Hz, and the correlations between SSVEP amplitudes and the BOLD responses were computed. The SSVEP frequency characteristics of all subjects showed 3 frequency ranges with an amplitude maximum in each of them, which roughly correspond to alpha, beta and gamma bands of the EEG. The correlation maps between BOLD responses and SSVEP amplitude changes across the different stimulation frequencies within each frequency band showed no significant correlation in the alpha range, while significant correlations were obtained in the primary visual area for the beta and gamma bands. This non-linear relationship between the surface recorded SSVEP amplitudes and the BOLD responses of the visual cortex at stimulation frequencies around the alpha band supports the view that a resonance at the tuning frequency of the thalamo-cortical alpha oscillator in the visual system is responsible for the global amplitude maximum of the SSVEP around 10 Hz. Information gained from the SSVEP/fMRI analyses in the present study might be extrapolated to the EEG/fMRI analysis of the transient event-related potentials (ERPs) in terms of expecting more reliable and consistent correlations between EEG and fMRI responses, when the analyses are carried out on evoked or induced oscillations (spectral perturbations) in separate frequency bands instead of the time-domain ERP peaks.

We used an attention skills training, coupled with the training setting and demands made upon participants, as the control condition. At the behavioural level. NF was superior to the control group concerning core ADHD symptomatology as well as associated domains. For the primary outcome measure (improvement in the FBB-HKS total score), the effect size was .60. The same pattern of results was obtained at the 6-month follow-up. Thus. NE may be seen as a clinically effective module in the treatment of children with ADHD. At the neurophysiological level (EEG, ERPs), specific effects for the two NF protocols, theta/beta training; and training of slow cortical potentials were demonstrated. For example, for theta/beta training, a decrease of theta activity in the EEG was associated with a reduction of ADHD symptomatology. SCP training was accompanied inter cilia by an increase in the contingent negative variation in the attention network test; thus, children were able to allocate more resources for preparation. EEG- and ERP-based predictors were also found. The present article reviewed the findings of the original papers related to the trial and outlines future research topics.

Motivation modulates the P300 amplitude during brain-computer interface use	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Motivation; BCI; P300; Visual	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; REWARD MAGNITUDE; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; SYSTEM; BCI; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY	Objective: This study examined the effect of motivation as a possible psychological influencing variable on P300 amplitude and performance in a brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled by event-related potentials (ERP). Methods: Participants were instructed to copy spell a sentence by attending to cells of a randomly flashing 7 * 7 matrix. Motivation was manipulated by monetary reward. In two experimental groups participants received 25 (N = 11) or 50 (N = 11) Euro cent for each correctly selected character; the control group (N = 11) was not rewarded. BCI performance was defined as the overall percentage of correctly selected characters (correct response rate = CRR). Results: Participants performed at an average of 99%. At electrode location Cz the P300 amplitude was positively correlated to self-rated motivation. The P300 amplitude of the most motivated participants was significantly higher than that of the least motivated participants. Highly motivated participants were able to communicate correctly faster with the ERP-BCI than less motivated participants. Conclusions: Motivation modulates the P300 amplitude in an ERP-BCI. Significance: Motivation may contribute to variance in BCI performance and should be monitored in BCI settings. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Modeling single-trial ERP reveals modulation of bottom-up face visual processing by top-down task constraints (in some subjects)	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; GLM; single-trial analyses; bootstrap; N170; individual differences; faces; noise	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; OBJECT INFORMATION; EEG DYNAMICS; HUMAN BRAIN; CATEGORY; POTENTIALS; N170; CATEGORIZATION; RECOGNITION	We studied how task constraints modulate the relationship between single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) and image noise. Thirteen subjects performed two interleaved tasks: on different blocks, they saw the same stimuli, but they discriminated either between two faces or between two colors. Stimuli were two pictures of red or green faces that contained from 10 to 80% of phase noise, with 10% increments. Behavioral accuracy followed a noise dependent sigmoid in the identity task but was high and independent of noise level in the color task. EEG data recorded concurrently were analyzed using a single-trial ANCOVA: we assessed how changes in task constraints modulated ERP noise sensitivity while regressing out the main ERP differences due to identity, color, and task. Single-trial ERP sensitivity to image phase noise started at about 95-110 ms post-stimulus onset. Group analyses showed a significant reduction in noise sensitivity in the color task compared to the identity task from about 140 ms to 300 ms post-stimulus onset. However, statistical analyses in every subject revealed different results: significant task modulation occurred in 8/13 subjects, one showing an increase and seven showing a decrease in noise sensitivity in the color task. Onsets and durations of effects also differed between group and single-trial analyses: at any time point only a maximum of four subjects (31%) showed results consistent with group analyses. We provide detailed results for all 13 subjects, including a shift function analysis that revealed asymmetric task modulations of single-trial ERP distributions. We conclude that, during face processing, bottom-up sensitivity to phase noise can be modulated by top-down task constraints, in a broad window around the P2, at least in some subjects.

Propranolol significantly reduced this old/new difference of the mean ERP amplitudes (1500-800 ms) for unpleasant but not for neutral and pleasant memories This effect correlated with salivary alpha-amylase activity, a surrogate for central adrenergic stimulation. In conclusion, propranolol selectively blocked the neural signature of unpleasant memories by mechanisms in which the parietal cortex seems to be specifically involved (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Weymar, Mathias; Loew, Andreas; Hamm, Alfons O.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Biol & Clin Psychol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Modess, Christiane; Siegmund, Werner] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Clin Pharmacol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Engel, Georg] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Hosp Pharm, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Gruendling, Matthias] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Petersmann, Astrid] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Clin Chem, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany		Hamm, AO (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Biol & Clin Psychol, Franz Mehring Str 47, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.

EEG responses evoked by a painful laser beam (laser evoked potentials; LEPs), and the plasma nicotine concentration (PNC) were measured. There were two sessions, one after smoking (Smoking session), and the other in no smoking (Control session). Subjective ratings of pain perception were also measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). Two major components, N2 and P2 of LEPs, were recorded. The amplitude of P2 was significantly smaller in the Smoking session than in the Control session. A significant negative correlation was found between PNC and the amplitude of N2 as well as P2. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that smoking and/or nicotine have an antinociceptive effect, which supports most non-human studies and some human studies. Smoking of a single tobacco cigarette did not show a subjectively perceivable extent of reduction in the intensity of evoked pain. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods traditionally used to study ERPs measure the amplitude and duration of the waveform in order to quantify the changes, being signal morphology dependent. However, the frequency characteristics of those events remain uncovered. The aim of this work was the study of new measures to characterize, by means of time-frequency representation (TFR) techniques, the ERPs recorded while subjects conducted a choice reaction time task (Ericksen flanker task) following the administration of different alprazolam doses. Several measures defined from energy, instantaneous frequency and group delay functions were obtained by means of TFR techniques applied to the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) of EEG signals. These measures, which are signal morphology independent, were studied in four frequency bands, delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-15 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), and for certain time periods. Based on these measures, differences between ERPs were analyzed by comparing the different response types (successes or successfully corrected failures) of the subject performing the task, and comparing the applied drug doses. For each subject, the CWD of EEG signals was applied in two different ways: (a) all ERPs were averaged per channel, and then the CWD was applied; (b) the CWD was applied to each one of the ERPs. When the CWD was applied to each ERP, the energy measures in the delta, theta and beta bands, the instantaneous frequency measures in the alpha and beta bands, and the group delay measures in the delta, theta and alpha bands showed a statistically significant level p < 0.0005 in the analysis of the response type. Also, the energy measures in the theta and beta bands and the instantaneous frequency measures in the alpha band showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.0005) between placebo and low and high drug doses. In contrast, poor results were obtained when all epochs of each subject were averaged per channel. Finally, it was concluded that these results showed that the new proposed measures based on the energy offered a new and more robust way to characterize ERP signals.

These use least-square linear regression, and the relative success of these is yet to be established. Improving on previous EOG correction validation studies, we present a new validation technique (with greater face validity) and use it to compare four commonly employed EOG correction methods. Data consisted of ERP traces to auditory stimuli that were embedded in up, down, left and right eye movements (EMs), recorded from 24 subjects. A 'Peak Difference' validation measure was employed, which determined the magnitude of the difference of two auditory N100 peaks (those associated with EMs with opposing polarities). All correction methods produced data that was better than not correcting at all. EOG correction methods that accounted for vertical EM, horizontal EM and blink artifact separately using separate EOG channels, produced the best corrections, with some further advantage in methods that enhanced signal (EOG) to noise (EEG) ratios when calculating correction coefficients.

It has been proposed that simple auditory regularities are extracted at lower stations of the auditory cortex and more complex ones at other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Deviations from auditory regularities elicit a family of early negative electric potentials distributed over the frontal regions of the scalp. In this study, we wished to disentangle the brain processes associated with sequential vs. hierarchical auditory regularities in a musical context by studying the event-related potentials (ERPs), the behavioral responses to violations of these regularities, and the localization of the underlying ERP generators using two different source analysis algorithms. To this aim, participants listened to musical cadences constituted by seven chords, each containing either harmonically congruous chords, harmonically incongruous chords, or harmonically congruous but mistuned chords. EEG was recorded and multiple source analysis was performed. Incongruous chords violating the rules of harmony elicited a bilateral ERAN, whereas mistuned chords within chord sequences elicited a right-lateralized MMN. We found that the dominant cortical sources for the ERAN were localized around Broca's area and its right homolog, whereas the MMN generators were localized around the primary auditory cortex. These findings suggest a predominant role of the auditory cortices in detecting sequential scale regularities and the posterior prefrontal cortex in parsing hierarchical regularities in music.

J	Gramfort, A; Keriven, R; Clerc, M				Gramfort, Alexandre; Keriven, Renaud; Clerc, Maureen			Graph-Based Variability Estimation in Single-Trial Event-Related Neural Responses	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); evoked potentials; graph cuts optimization; graph Laplacian; latency estimation; magnetoencephalography (MEG); manifold learning; single-trial analysis	VARIABLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG; POTENTIALS; LATENCIES; ERPS	Extracting information from multitrial magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is challenging because of the very low SNR, and because of the inherent variability of brain responses. The problem of low SNR is commonly tackled by averaging multiple repetitions of the recordings, also called trials, but the variability of response across trials leads to biased results and limits interpretability. This paper proposes to decode the variability of neural responses by making use of graph representations. Our approach has several advantages compared to other existing methods that process single-trial data: first, it avoids the a priori definition of a model for the waveform of the neural response; second, it does not make use of the average data for parameter estimation; third, it does not suffer from initialization problems by providing solutions that are global optimum of cost functions; and last, it is fast. We proceed in two steps. First, a manifold learning algorithm, based on a graph Laplacian, offers an efficient way of ordering trials with respect to the response variability, under the condition that this variability itself depends on a single parameter. Second, the estimation of the variability is formulated as a combinatorial optimization that can be solved very efficiently using graph cuts. Details and validation of this second step are provided for latency estimation. Performance and robustness experiments are conducted on synthetic data, and results are presented on EEG data from a P300 oddball experiment.

However, also after correct trials, an Ne-like wave is seen, called CRN or Nc, which is much smaller than the Ne This study tested the hypothesis whether Ne and Nc reflect the same functional process, and whether this process is linked to online response control For this purpose, independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized with the EEG data of two types of reaction tasks a flanker task and a mental rotation task To control for speed-accuracy effects, speed and accuracy instructions were balanced in a between subjects design. For both tasks ICA and dipole analysis revealed one component (Ne-IC) explaining most of the variance for the difference between correct and erroneous trials The Ne-IC showed virtually the same features as the raw postresponse ERP, being larger for erroneous compared to correct trials and for the flanker than for the rotation task In addition, it peaked earlier for corrected than for uncorrected errors The results favor the hypothesis that Ne and Nc reflect the same process, which is modulated by response correctness and type of task On the basis of the literature and the present results, we assume that this process induces online response control, which is much stronger in error than correct trials and with direct rather than indirect stimulus response mapping Hum Brain Mapp 31 1305-1315, 2010.

The physiological mechanisms allowing listeners to react instantaneously to such fast and unexpected perturbations in order to maintain intelligibility of the delivered message are still partly unknown. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study aimed at investigating the cortical responses to real-time detection of a sudden acoustic/phonetic change occurring in connected speech and how these mechanisms interfere with semantic integration. Participants listened to sentences in which final words could contain signal reversals along the temporal dimension (time-reversed speech) of varying durations and could have either a low- or high-doze probability within sentence context. Results revealed that early detection of the acoustic/phonetic change elicited a fronto-central negativity shortly after the onset of the manipulation that matched the spatio-temporal features of the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) recorded in the same participants during an oddball paradigm. Time reversal also affected late event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting semantic expectancies (N400) differently when words were predictable or not from the sentence context. These findings are discussed in the context of brain signatures to transient acoustic/phonetic variations in speech. They contribute to a better understanding of natural speech comprehension as they show that acoustic/phonetic information and semantic knowledge strongly interact under adverse conditions.

Tracking cognitive changes in new-onset epilepsy: Functional imaging challenges	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						New onset epilepsy; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Electroencephalography; Event-related brain potentials; Magnetoencephalography; Memory; Cognition	TEMPORAL-LOBE; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; FMRI; EEG; MEG	Functional imaging has potential for tracking changes in cognition during the onset and evolution of epilepsy. Although the concept of imaging such changes over time is an exciting new direction, feasibility remains an open question. The current article outlines a case example in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to monitor memory changes before and after selective temporal lobe resection. From this example, three key methodologic challenges for new-onset epilepsy are identified and discussed. The first challenge relates to the interpretation of results in regions near epileptogenic tissue. We argue that this is best addressed by collecting information from multiple modalities to test for convergent evidence. The second challenge relates to optimizing the methods for sensitivity to detecting changes. In this case, enhanced imaging methods and a region-of-interest approach provide necessary focus. The third and final challenge relates to the practical difficulties of conducting research in new-onset epilepsy cases. We suggest that greater integration of imaging research within the clinical setting is needed.	[D'Arcy, Ryan C.

P300 of ERP (Event-Related Potentials) is induced by applying Odd-Ball task that is composed by the two sounds with different frequency. The Odd-Ball task was executed before and after magnetic stimulation by rTMS (100 stimuli with 1Hz). We compared the P300 latency before and after the rTMS magnetic stimulation. In the case of stimulating left and right SMG, P300 appeared earlier than in the case of no stimulating left and right SMG. In the case of stimulating left and right DLPFC, P300 appeared later than in the case of no stimulating left and right DLPFC.

AGING EFFECTS ON SELECTIVE ATTENTION-RELATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC PATTERNS DURING FACE ENCODING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual attention; face processing; aging; event-related potentials; N170; alpha activity	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; TOP-DOWN SUPPRESSION; IRRELEVANT INFORMATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN; MEMORY; ERP; PERCEPTION	Previous electrophysiological studies revealed that human faces elicit an early visual event-related potential (ERP) within the occipito-temporal cortex, the N170 component. Although face perception has been proposed to rely on automatic processing, the impact of selective attention on N170 remains controversial both in young and elderly individuals. Using early visual ERP and alpha power analysis, we assessed the influence of aging on selective attention to faces during delayed-recognition tasks for face and letter stimuli, examining 36 elderly and 20 young adults with preserved cognition. Face recognition performance worsened with age. Aging induced a latency delay of the N1 component for faces and letters, as well as of the face N170 component. Contrasting with letters, ignored faces elicited larger N1 and N170 components than attended faces in both age groups. This counterintuitive attention effect on face processing persisted when scenes replaced letters. In contrast with young, elderly subjects failed to suppress irrelevant letters when attending faces. Whereas attended stimuli induced a parietal alpha band desynchronization within 300-1000 ms post-stimulus with bilateral-to-right distribution for faces and left lateralization for letters, ignored and passively viewed stimuli elicited a central alpha synchronization larger on the right hemisphere. Aging delayed the latency of this alpha synchronization for both face and letter stimuli, and reduced its amplitude for ignored letters. These results suggest that due to their social relevance, human faces may cause paradoxical attention effects cm early visual ERP components, but they still undergo classical top down control as a function of endogenous selective attention. Aging does not affect the face bottom up alerting mechanism but reduces the top down suppression of distracting letters, possibly impinging upon face recognition, and more generally delays the top down suppression of task-irrelevant information.

The behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of the cognitive strategies behind this issue has been studied by our group. Dichotic tone listening task was given to 26 healthy subjects. The EEG was recorded during the task completion using Scan 4.3 system (Neuroscan, USA) from 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes. Analysis of response patterns revealed that in such tasks effect of cognitive strategy use for response choice could prevail over ear advantage effect, expected by dichotic listening paradigm. Neural correlates of strategy-use in response selection were assessed using classic event-related potentials (ERP) and synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) methods. The major results are the following: 1. ERP latencies in Strategy-users group (SU) are shorter in frontal cortex than in Strategy-Non-Users (SNU), while in parietal cortex reactions in SNU are faster than in SU. 2. Beta-ERD values in frontal and parietal areas demonstrate analogous reciprocal interactions related to strategy use: beta-ERD is stronger in frontal area in SU, while in parietal area it is stronger in SNU. 3. Alpha-ERD was stronger in SU than in SNU over right frontal and left temporo-parietal areas. It could correspond to more active processes of encoding and/or verbalizing of stimuli in former group.

J	Shtyrov, Y				Shtyrov, Yury			Automaticity and attentional control in spoken language processing Neurophysiological evidence	MENTAL LEXICON			English	Article						language; attention; brain; memory trace; event-related potentials and fields (ERP, ERF); mismatch negativity (MMN); lexical access; electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG)		A long-standing debate in the science of language is whether our capacity to process language draws on attentional resources, or whether some stages or types of this processing may be automatic. I review a series of experiments in which this issue was addressed by modulating the level of attention on the auditory input while recording event-related brain activity elicited by spoken linguistic stimuli. The overall results of these studies show that the language function does possess a certain degree of automaticity, which seems to apply to different types of information. It can be explained, at least in part, by robustness of strongly connected linguistic memory circuits in the brain that can activate fully even when attentional resources are low. At the same time, this automaticity is limited to the very first stages of linguistic processing (<200 ms from the point in time when the relevant information is available in the auditory input). Later processing steps are, in turn, more affected by attention modulation. These later steps, which possibly reflect a more in-depth, secondary processing or re-analysis and repair of incoming speech, therefore appear dependant on the amount of resources allocated to language. Full processing of spoken language may thus not be possible without allocating attentional resources to it; this allocation in itself may be triggered by the early automatic stages in the first place.

Spatial Representations as an Emergent Feature of Perceptual Processing Evidence from Human Electrophysiology	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						human; visual attention; biased competition; ERP; N1; N2pc	EVENT-RELATED LATERALIZATIONS; VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BIASED COMPETITION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TIME-COURSE; SEARCH; CORTEX; ALLOCATION	Spatial selection of relevant information has been proposed to reflect an emergent feature of stimulus processing within an integrated network of perceptual areas. Stimulus-based and intention-based sources of information might converge in a common stage when spatial maps are generated. This approach appears to be inconsistent with the assumption of distinct mechanisms for stimulus-driven and top-down controlled attention. In two experiments, the common ground of stimulus-driven and intention-based attention was tested by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the human EEG. In both experiments, the processing of a single transient was compared to the selection of a physically comparable stimulus among distractors. While single transients evoked a spatially sensitive N1, the extraction of relevant information out of a more complex display was reflected in an N2pc. The high similarity of the spatial portion of these two components (Experiment 1), and the replication of this finding for the vertical axis (Experiment 2) indicate that these two ERP components might both reflect the spatial representation of relevant information as derived from the organization of perceptual maps, just at different points in time.

Effect of the static magnetic field of the MR-scanner on ERPs: Evaluation of visual, cognitive and motor potentials	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG-fMRI; 3 T static magnetic field; Ballistocardiographic artifact; Artifact removal	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; EVOKED POTENTIALS; FMRI; REMOVAL; ACQUISITION; REDUCTION	Objective: This work investigates the influence of the static magnetic field of the MR-scanner on ERPs extracted from simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. The quality of the ERPs after BallistoCardioGraphic (BCG) artifact removal, as well as the reproducibility of the waveforms in different environments is investigated. Methods: We consider a Detection, a Go-Nogo and a Motor task, eliciting peaks that differ in amplitude, latency and scalp topography, repeated in two situations: outside the scanner room (0 T) and inside the MR-scanner but without gradients (3 T). The BCG artifact is removed by means of three techniques: the Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS) method, the Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method and the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) approach. Results: The performance of the three methods depends on the amount of averaged trials. Moreover, differences are found on both amplitude and latency of ERP components recorded in two environments (0 T vs 3 T). Conclusions: We showed that, while ERPs can be extracted from simultaneous EEG-fMRI data at 3 T, the static magnetic field might affect the physiological processes under investigation. Significance: The reproducibility of the ERPs in different recording environments (0 T vs 3 T) is a relevant issue that deserves further investigation to clarify the equivalence of cognitive processes in both behavioral and imaging studies.

JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Word production; Syntax; Phonology; Time course; ERP; EEG	LEXICAL ACCESS; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; GRAMMATICAL GENDER; RETRIEVAL; TIP; ACTIVATION; SPEAKING; MODEL	Neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic studies suggest that grammatical (gender) and phonological information are retrieved independently and that gender can be accessed before phonological information. This study investigated the relative time courses of gender and phonological encoding using topographic evoked potentials mapping methods. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded using a high resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system (128 channels) during gender and phoneme monitoring in silent picture naming. Behavioural results showed similar reaction times (RT) between gender and word onset (first phoneme) monitoring, and longer RT when monitoring the second syllable onset. Temporal segmentation analysis (defining dominant map topographies using cluster analysis) revealed no timing difference between gender monitoring and word onset monitoring: both effects fall within the same time window at about 270-290 ms after picture presentation. Monitoring a second syllable onset generated a later effect at about 480 ms. Direct comparison between gender and first phoneme monitoring revealed a difference of only 10 ms between tasks at approximately 200 ms. Taken together, these results suggest that lemma retrieval and phonological encoding may proceed in parallel or overlap. Word onset is retrieved simultaneously with gender, while the longer RT and the later ERP effect for second syllable onset reflect that segmental encoding continues incrementally to the following phonemes.

We examined how processing in these subsystems changes with normal aging by comparing ERP responses to homographs and unambiguous words completing congruent sentences (with both semantic and syntactic contextual information) or syntactic prose (syntactic information only). Like young adults in prior work, older adults elicited more negative N400s to homographs in congruent sentences, suggesting mismatch between the context and residual activation of the contextually irrelevant sense. However, the frontal negativity seen in young adults to homographs in syntactically well-defined but semantically neutral contexts was absent in older adults as a group, suggesting a decline in recruiting additional neural resources to aid difficult semantic selection. A subset of older adults with high verbal fluency maintained a young-like effect pattern.

However, certain amnesic drugs, exemplified by propofol or midazolam, produce dense amnesia at low drug concentrations while a person is still awake. This chapter reviews human memory systems, with a focus on episodic memory. This memory system is the one most affected by amnesic drugs. It is also the one most difficult to define and study in animal models. Potential mechanisms by which amnesia is produced in humans are defined in this chapter using propofol as an exemplar drug. Episodic memory is considered in terms of information flow from the outside world into long-term memory. Propofol has little effect on encoding, thus permitting memories to be formed in its presence. However, these memories are quickly forgotten, and electrophysiologic measures (event-related potentials, ERPs) of recognition memory reveal effects of propofol on memory within seconds of encoding. Potential targets for propofol's amnesic actions on the chain of physiologic events activated by learning, termed consolidation, are discussed.

J	Muller-Gass, A; Campbell, K				Muller-Gass, Alexandra; Campbell, Kenneth			The processing of infrequently-presented low-intensity stimuli during natural sleep: An event-related potential study	NOISE & HEALTH			English	Article						Consciousness; event-related potentials; information processing; intensity; rate of presentation; sleep	EVOKED K-COMPLEX; NOISE; EEG; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; SOUND	Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide an exquisite means to measure the extent of processing of external stimuli during the sleep period. This study examines ERPs elicited by stimuli with physical characteristics akin to environmental noise encountered during sleep. Brief duration 40, 60 or 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) tones were presented either rapidly (on average every two seconds) or slowly (on average every 10 seconds). The rates of presentation and intensity of the stimuli were similar to those observed in environmental studies of noise. ERPs were recorded from nine young adults during sleep and wakefulness. During wakefulness, the amplitude of an early negative ERP, N1, systematically increased as intensity level increased. A later positivity, the P3a, was apparent following the loudest 80 dB stimulus regardless of the rate of stimulus presentation; it was also apparent following the 60 dB stimulus, when stimuli were presented slowly. The appearance of the N1-P3a deflections suggests that operations of the central executive controlling ongoing cognitive activity was interrupted, forcing subjects to become aware of the obtrusive task-irrelevant stimuli. The auditory stimuli elicited very different ERP patterns during sleep. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the ERP was characterized by an enhanced (relative to wakefulness) early positivity, P2, followed by a very prominent negativity, the N350. Both deflections systematically varied in amplitude with stimulus intensity level; in addition, N350 was much larger when stimuli were presented at slow rates. The N350, a sleep-specific ERP, is thought to reflect the inhibition of processing of potentially sleep-disrupting stimulus input. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a small amplitude N1 was apparent in the ERP, but only for the loudest, 80 dB stimulus. A small (nonsignificant) P3a-like deflection was also visible following the 80 dB stimulus, but only when stimuli were presented slowly. The findings of the present study offer, on one hand, an explanation of the means by which consciousness is prevented during sleep but also, on the other hand, an explanation of how sleep can be disrupted and possibly reversed, leading to an awakening.

J	Groppe, DM; Urbach, TP; Kutas, M				Groppe, David M.; Urbach, Thomas P.; Kutas, Marta			Mass univariate analysis of event-related brain potentials/fields II: Simulation studies	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; MEG; False discovery rate; Permutation test; Hypothesis testing	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; TESTS; PERMUTATION; DIFFERENCE	Mass univariate analysis is a relatively new approach for the study of ERPs/ERFs. It consists of many statistical tests and one of several powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Multiple comparison corrections differ in their power and permissiveness. Moreover, some methods are not guaranteed to work or may be overly sensitive to uninteresting deviations from the null hypothesis. Here we report the results of simulations assessing the accuracy, permissiveness, and power of six popular multiple comparison corrections (permutation-based control of the familywise error rate [FWER], weak control of FWER via cluster-based permutation tests, permutation-based control of the generalized FWER, and three false discovery rate control procedures) using realistic ERP data. In addition, we look at the sensitivity of permutation tests to differences in population variance. These results will help researchers apply and interpret these procedures.

J	Li, L; Zhang, JX; Jiang, T				Li, Ling; Zhang, Jin-Xiang; Jiang, Tao			Visual Working Memory Load-Related Changes in Neural Activity and Functional Connectivity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG ALPHA; NETWORKS; OSCILLATIONS; CAPACITY; REPRESENTATIONS; RETENTION	Background: Visual working memory (VWM) helps us store visual information to prepare for subsequent behavior. The neuronal mechanisms for sustaining coherent visual information and the mechanisms for limited VWM capacity have remained uncharacterized. Although numerous studies have utilized behavioral accuracy, neural activity, and connectivity to explore the mechanism of VWM retention, little is known about the load-related changes in functional connectivity for hemi-field VWM retention. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 14 normal young adults while they performed a bilateral visual field memory task. Subjects had more rapid and accurate responses to the left visual field (LVF) memory condition. The difference in mean amplitude between the ipsilateral and contralateral event-related potential (ERP) at parietal-occipital electrodes in retention interval period was obtained with six different memory loads. Functional connectivity between 128 scalp regions was measured by EEG phase synchronization in the theta-(4-8 Hz), alpha-(8-12 Hz), beta-(12-32 Hz), and gamma-(32-40 Hz) frequency bands. The resulting matrices were converted to graphs, and mean degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path length was computed as a function of memory load. The results showed that brain networks of theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency bands were load-dependent and visual-field dependent. The networks of theta-and alpha-bands phase synchrony were most predominant in retention period for right visual field (RVF) WM than for LVF WM. Furthermore, only for RVF memory condition, brain network density of theta-band during the retention interval were linked to the delay of behavior reaction time, and the topological property of alpha-band network was negative correlation with behavior accuracy. Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that the differences in theta-and alpha-bands between LVF and RVF conditions in functional connectivity and topological properties during retention period may result in the decline of behavioral performance in RVF task.

Effects of the ADHD Syndrome on the Frequency Composition of ERPs Revealed by Independent Component Analysis	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); continuous performance test (CPT); event-related potentials (ERPs); feature extraction; frequency rhythms; independent component analysis (ICA); sustained attention	EEG	In this study, we investigated the frequency characteristics of independent components (ICs) of event-related potentials (ERPs) for persons suffering from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and normal adults while performing a continuous performance test (CPT). A group of 50 participants (10 ADHD subjects and 40 ones with no attention disorders) was examined. Independent component analysis was applied to the recorded signals. For ERP extraction, averages for each group of ICs, which were time-locked to the onset of stimuli, were calculated. Several frequency characteristics (704 items) were extracted from different ERPs in each IC. Eight features of the brain signals had a significant (P < 0.001) correlation with the participants' clinical presentation, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The revealed promising relation can be used for further evaluation of the sustained attention level.	[Ghassemi, F.; Moradi, M.

Methods: Participants performed linear hand movements to memorized target locations, which were arranged in distances between 10 and 31 cm from the starting position of the hand. EPRs were analyzed time-locked to the imperative go signal as well as to the movement onset. Results: An increase in target distance was associated with an increase in amplitude of a negative component measured over sensorimotor areas that preceded movement onset (MP). Another negative deflection arising at similar scalp locations (N4) and following the MP decline was also highly distance dependent. Conclusions: The data demonstrate distance specific brain activity accompanying accelerative and decelerative phases of motion during goal-directed hand movements. Significance: The modulation of MP may to be related to the modulation of the initial force pulse, while N4 effects may reflect distance dependent changes in the magnitude of decelerative control.

Electrophysiology of appetitive taste and appetitive taste conditioning in humans	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Taste; ERP; Appetitive conditioning; Gustatory event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GUSTATORY FUNCTION; BRAIN; JUDGMENTS; EEG; MOTIVATION; STRIATUM; REWARD; MUSIC; AREAS	The present study examines two novel aspects of appetitive processing and conditioning: the electro-physiological response to (a) the appetitive taste of a sweet fluid and (b) appetitively/taste conditioned visual stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 32 subjects while they performed a taste conditioning task, in which two symbols were paired with a sweet or a neutral fluid. The results show a clear P1/N1/P2 complex, and a late positive potential (P3) with maxima at right fronto-central electrode sites, in response to the taste stimuli. Of these components particularly the P3 showed robust differences between the sweet and neutral taste. In addition, the electrophysiological response to the taste conditioned stimuli (CS), also showed the expected differences for both P2 and P3 at frontocentral electrodes. The present data demonstrate that the employed paradigm is a useful methodology to study the electrophysiological responses to unconditioned appetitive stimuli. Since appetitive conditioning is assumed to be disturbed in many psychopathological conditions, such as substance dependence, depression and eating disorders, this paradigm could be employed to get more insight in these conditions in humans.

CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease (AD); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Electroencephalography (EEG); synchrony; slowing; complexity; differential diagnosis; cognitive decline; medication	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; QUANTIFYING STATISTICAL INTERDEPENDENCE; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; QUANTITATIVE EEG; CORTICAL SOURCES; ENTROPY ANALYSIS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	This paper reviews recent progress in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from electroencephalograms (EEG). Three major effects of AD on EEG have been observed: slowing of the EEG, reduced complexity of the EEG signals, and perturbations in EEG synchrony. In recent years, a variety of sophisticated computational approaches has been proposed to detect those subtle perturbations in the EEG of AD patients. The paper first describes methods that try to detect slowing of the EEG. Next the paper deals with several measures for EEG complexity, and explains how those measures have been used to study fluctuations in EEG complexity in AD patients. Then various measures of EEG synchrony are considered in the context of AD diagnosis. Also the issue of EEG preprocessing is briefly addressed. Before one can analyze EEG, it is necessary to remove artifacts due to for example head and eye movement or interference from electronic equipment. Pre-processing of EEG has in recent years received much attention. In this paper, several state-of-the-art pre-processing techniques are outlined, for example, based on blind source separation and other non-linear filtering paradigms. In addition, the paper outlines opportunities and limitations of computational approaches for diagnosing AD based on EEG. At last, future challenges and open problems are discussed.

Conflict processing is modulated by positive emotion: ERP data from a flanker task	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Affect; Attention; Language; EEG; ERP; N200	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; AFFECTIVE NORMS; WORDS; ATTENTION	Recent evidence shows that negative emotional stimuli speed up the resolution of conflict between opposing response tendencies. This mechanism ensures rapid reactions in potentially threatening situations. However, it is unclear whether positive emotion has a similar effect on conflict processing. We therefore presented positive emotional words in a version of the flanker conflict task, in which conflict is elicited by incongruent target and flanker stimuli. Response times to incongruent stimuli were shortened in positive words, indicating a speeding up of conflict resolution. We also observed an enlargement of the first conflict-sensitive event-related potential (ERP) of the electroencephalogram, the N200, in positive emotional trials. The data suggest that positive emotion already modulates first stages of conflict processing. The results demonstrate that positive, reward-predicting stimuli influence conflict processing in a similar manner to threat signals. Positive emotion thus reduces the time that an organism is unable to respond due to simultaneously present conflicting action tendencies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An ERP study	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						ERP; Blood-injection-injury stimuli; Attention	EMOTIONAL STIMULI; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FMRI RESPONSES; DISGUST; MUTILATION; ATTENTION; PICTURES	Brain electrical potentials are valid indicators of motivated attention in affective picture processing but differential processing of stimulus categories with specific motivational relevance has hardly been addressed in the past. In this study we aimed to investigate whether specific stimulus related processes can be determined as assessed by ERP components, independently of valence and arousal. Forty participants viewed pictures of categories Disgust, blood-injection-injury (BII), Fear, and Neutral during EEG recording. Amplitudes of event-related potentials of P200, P300 and late positive potential (LPP) were assessed. Viewing visual stimuli of affectively relevant categories elicited typical ERPs with increased amplitudes in P300 and LPP time windows at parietal sites compared to neutral stimuli. In addition P200 amplitude was the largest for BII compared to all other categories. P300 amplitude was the largest for BIl stimuli and was comparable to fear after controlling for P200 amplitude. Our data suggest that a distinction of stimulus categories by motivational relevance is important in addition to the dimensional categorization by means of valence and arousal and that motivated attention alone is not sufficient for the interpretation of our data. Moreover, our data indicate that processing of distinct stimulus categories, in particular that of BIl stimuli, evolves differentially in time. Altogether, ERPs rather reflect the motivational relevance of stimuli and not simple arousal. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the number of trials necessary for stabilization of error-related brain activity across the life span	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Children; Normal Volunteers; Aged; EEG; ERP	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; BEHAVIORAL INDEXES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; AGE; LOCALIZATION; POSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY	The minimum number of trials necessary to accurately characterize the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe) across the life span was investigated using samples of preadolescent children, college-age young adults, and older adults. Event-related potentials and task performance were subsequently measured during a modified flanker task. Response-locked averages were created using sequentially increasing errors of commission in blocks of two. Findings indicated that across all age cohorts ERN and Pe were not significantly different relative to the within-participants grand average after six trials. Further, results indicated that the ERN and Pe exhibited excellent internal reliability in preadolescent children and young adults after six trials, but older adults required eight trials to reach similar reliability. These data indicate that the ERN and Pe may be accurately quantified with as few as six to eight commission error trials across the life span.

Using a combined approach we measured spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal along with electroencephalography (EEG) in eleven healthy subjects during relaxed wakefulness (eyes closed). In contrast to other studies which used the EEG frequency information to guide the functional MRI (fMRI) analysis, we opted for transient EEG events, which identify and quantify brain electric microstates as time epochs with quasi-stable field topography. We then used this microstate information as regressors for the BOLD fluctuations. Single trial EEGs were segmented with a specific module of the LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography) software package in which microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials, i.e., the related 3-dimensional distribution of cortical current density in the brain. Using the occurrence and the duration of each microstate, we modeled the hemodynamic response function (HRF) which revealed BOLD activation in all subjects. The BOLD activation patterns resembled well known resting-state networks (RSNs) such as the default mode network. Furthermore we "cross validated" the data performing a BOLD independent component analysis (ICA) and computing the correlation between each ICs and the EEG microstates across all subjects. This study shows for the first time that the information contained within EEG microstates on a millisecond timescale is able to elicit BOLD activation patterns consistent with well known RSNs, opening new avenues for multimodal imaging data processing.

EEGIFT: Group Independent Component Analysis for Event-Related EEG Data	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BLIND SEPARATION; FMRI; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; INFERENCES; RESPONSES; MRI	Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful method for source separation and has been used for decomposition of EEG, MRI, and concurrent EEG-fMRI data. ICA is not naturally suited to draw group inferences since it is a non-trivial problem to identify and order components across individuals. One solution to this problem is to create aggregate data containing observations from all subjects, estimate a single set of components and then back-reconstruct this in the individual data. Here, we describe such a group-level temporal ICA model for event related EEG. When used for EEG time series analysis, the accuracy of component detection and back-reconstruction with a group model is dependent on the degree of intra-and interindividual time and phase-locking of event related EEG processes. We illustrate this dependency in a group analysis of hybrid data consisting of three simulated event-related sources with varying degrees of latency jitter and variable topographies. Reconstruction accuracy was tested for temporal jitter 1, 2 and 3 times the FWHM of the sources for a number of algorithms. The results indicate that group ICA is adequate for decomposition of single trials with physiological jitter, and reconstructs event related sources with high accuracy.

The patient had medically intractable epilepsy and underwent temporary placement of an intracranial ECoG grid electrode array to localize seizure foci. The patient performed one experimental session using the BCI spelling paradigm controlled by scalp-recorded EEG prior to the ECoG grid implantation, and one identical session controlled by ECoG after the grid implantation. The patient was able to achieve near perfect spelling accuracy using EEG and ECoG. An offline analysis of the average ERPs was performed to assess how accurately the average EEG ERPs could be predicted from the ECoG data. The preliminary results indicate that EEG ERPs can be accurately estimated from proximal asynchronous ECoG data using simple linear spatial models.

To this end, functional neuroimaging modalities represent an outstanding approach to better understand the mechanisms of both normal and abnormal brain functions. The ability to image brain function with ever increasing spatial and temporal resolution has made a significant leap over the past several decades. Further delineation of functional networks could lead to improved understanding of brain function in both normal and diseased states. This paper reviews recent advancements and current challenges in dynamic functional neuroimaging techniques, including electrophysiological source imaging, multimodal neuroimaging integrating fMRI with EEG/MEG, and functional connectivity imaging.

The brain activities evoked by visual stimuli have been studied intensively. However, few studies have considered a BMI that uses the brain activities evoked by auditory stimuli. This study investigated whether a person's direction of attention can be estimated using an event-related potential (ERP) generated by selective attention to an auditory stimulus. An auditory stimulus and an out-of-head sound localization system that can create an audio image outside the head that is presented through an earphone were used instead of a loudspeaker system. This system was experimentally evaluated by presenting the subject auditory cues from one of six directions while the subject directed his attention in one direction. An EEG response similar to an ERP was observed. The direction of attention was estimated using support vector machine with an accuracy of 89.2[%] on average for the three subjects. This suggests that a BMI system based on the estimated direction of attention can be developed by using out-of-head sound localization.

One component belonging to this family of ERPs is the mismatch negativity (MMN). It reflects pre-attentive detection of changes in the incoming stimulus by comparing the new stimulus with sensory memory traces. In this work, single trials of ERP taken from EEG signal recorded under thermal and electric stimulation were analyzed with time-frequency representation (TFR). The main objective of this work was to characterize responses to frequent and infrequent stimuli with TFR functions. Variables defined on instantaneous frequency and instantaneous power presented a statistical significance (p-value<0.0001) differentiating these two kind of responses. Furthermore, differences between the averaged instantaneous power and instantaneous frequency were also analyzed. It was found that instantaneous power and instantaneous frequency were able to better isolate the MMN components from EEG noise in certain frequency bands.	[Melia, Umberto S.

While most studies are based on analysis of kinematic data, investigations of neural correlates have been lacking. To fill this gap we recorded and analyzed kinematic and high-density electroencephalographic (64-channel EEG) data from three right-handed normal adults during a reaching task that required online movement corrections. Each kinematic submovement was accompanied by stereotyped scalp maps. Furthermore, the peaks of event-related potentials (ERP) recorded at electrode C1 (over contralateral motor cortex) were time-locked to kinematic submovement peaks. These results provide further evidence for the hypothesis that the CNS generates and controls continuous movement via discrete submovements. Applications include design of quantitative outcome metrics for motor disorders of neurological origin such as stroke and Parkinson's disease.	[Dipietro, L.; Krebs, H.

Local Polynomial Modeling of Time-Varying Autoregressive Models With Application to Time-Frequency Analysis of Event-Related EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; event-related potential; local polynomial modeling (LPM); time-frequency analysis (TFA); time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model	KALMAN SMOOTHER APPROACH; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; PARAMETERS; DYNAMICS; EEG/MEG; SERIES	This paper proposes a new local polynomial modeling (LPM) method for identification of time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models and applies it to time-frequency analysis (TFA) of event-related electroencephalogram (ER-EEG). The LPM method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates the polynomial coefficients using weighted least-squares with a window having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to determine the optimal bandwidth that minimizes the mean squared error. The resultant time-varying power spectral density estimation of the signal is capable of achieving both high time resolution and high frequency resolution in the time-frequency domain, making it a powerful TFA technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like ER-EEG. Experimental results on synthesized signals and real EEG data show that the LPM method can achieve a more accurate and complete time-frequency representation of the signal.	[Zhang, Z. G.; Hung, Y.

In humans, however, LC-NE functional dynamics remain largely unknown. We evaluated the utility of two candidate psychophysiological markers of LC-NE activity: the P3 event-related potential and pupil diameter. Electroencephalogram and pupillometry data were collected from 24 participants who performed a 37-min auditory oddball task. As predicted by the adaptive gain theory, prestimulus pupil diameter exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship to P3 and task performance such that largest P3 amplitudes and optimal performance occurred at the same intermediate level of pupil diameter. Large phasic pupil dilations, by contrast, were elicited during periods of poor performance and were followed by reengagement in the task and increased P3 amplitudes. These results support recent proposals that pupil diameter and the P3 are sensitive to LC-NE mode.

Event related potential (ERP) evidence for selective impairment of verbal recollection in abstinent recreational methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("Ecstasy")/polydrug users	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						MDMA; Ecstasy; Memory; Event-related potentials; Serotonin	RECOGNITION MEMORY; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; ECSTASY USERS; MDMA USE; EEG; WORDS; FACES	Ecstasy is a recreational drug whose active ingredient, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), acts predominantly on the serotonergic system. Although MDMA is known to be neurotoxic in animals, the long-term effects of recreational Ecstasy use in humans remain controversial but one commonly reported consequence is mild cognitive impairment particularly affecting verbal episodic memory. Although event-related potentials (ERPs) have made significant contributions to our understanding of human memory processes, until now they have not been applied to study the long-term effects of Ecstasy. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of past Ecstasy use on recognition memory for both verbal and non-verbal stimuli using ERPs. We compared the ERPs of 15 Ecstasy/polydrug users with those of 14 cannabis users and 13 non-illicit drug users as controls. Despite equivalent memory performance, Ecstasy/polydrug users showed an attenuated late positivity over left parietal scalp sites, a component associated with the specific memory process of recollection. This effect was only found in the word recognition task which is consistent with evidence that left hemisphere cognitive functions are disproportionately affected by Ecstasy, probably because the serotonergic system is laterally asymmetrical. Experimentally, decreasing central serotonergic activity through acute tryptophan depletion also selectively impairs recollection, and this too suggests the importance of the serotonergic system. Overall, our results suggest that Ecstasy users, who also use a wide range of other drugs, show a durable abnormality in a specific ERP component thought to be associated with recollection.

Here we tested this prediction for movement preparation, a key characteristic of motor cognition. Methodology/Principal Findings: High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during covert and overt actions. Movement preparation was studied with a motor priming paradigm, which varied task complexity and amount of advance information. Participants performed simple or complex sequential finger movements either overtly or covertly. Advance information was either fully predictive or partially predictive. Stimulus-locked event-related potential (ERP) data showed the typical pattern of foreperiod activation for overt and covert movements. The foreperiod contingent negative variation (CNV) differed between simple and complex movements only in the execution task. ERP topographies differed between execution and imagination only when advance information was fully predictive. Conclusions/Significance: Results suggest a differential contribution of the movement preparation network to action imagination and execution. Overt and covert actions seem to involve similar though not identical mechanisms, where overt actions engage a more fine-grained modulation of covert preparatory states.

Abnormal processing of emotional prosody in Williams syndrome: An event-related potentials study	RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						Williams syndrome; Event-related potentials; Emotional prosody; Semantics; Neurodevelopment	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PERSONALITY-CHARACTERISTICS; BEHAVIORAL-CHARACTERISTICS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SOCIAL DEFICITS; CHILDREN; INDIVIDUALS; SEMANTICS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ABILITIES	Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder due to a microdeletion in chromosome 7, is described as displaying an intriguing socio-cognitive phenotype. Deficits in prosody production and comprehension have been consistently reported in behavioral studies. It remains, however, to be clarified the neurobiological processes underlying prosody processing in WS. This study aimed at characterizing the electrophysiological response to neutral, happy, and angry prosody in WS, and examining if this response was dependent on the semantic content of the utterance. A group of 12 participants (5 female and 7 male), diagnosed with WS, with age range between 9 and 31 years, was compared with a group of typically developing participants, individually matched for chronological age, gender and laterality. After inspection of EEG artifacts, data from 9 participants with WS and 10 controls were included in ERP analyses. Participants were presented with neutral, positive and negative sentences, in two conditions: (1) with intelligible semantic and syntactic information; (2) with unintelligible semantic and syntactic information ('pure prosody' condition). They were asked to decide which emotion was underlying the auditory sentence. Atypical event-related potentials (ERP) components were related with prosodic processing (N100, P200, N300) in WS. In particular, reduced N100 was observed for prosody sentences with semantic content; more positive P200 for sentences with semantic content, in particular for happy and angry intonations; and reduced N300 for both types of sentence conditions. These findings suggest abnormalities in early auditory processing, indicating a bottom-up contribution to the impairment in emotional prosody processing and comprehension. Also, at least for N100 and P200, they suggest the top-down contributions of semantic processes in the sensory processing of speech. This study showed, for the first time, that abnormalities in ERP measures of early auditory processing in WS are also present during the processing of emotional vocal information. This may represent a physiological signature of underlying impaired on-line language and socio-emotional processing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This process has been labeled as perceptual learning, and implies that adult nervous systems can adaptively modify the way in which they process sensory stimulation. However, the mechanisms by which the brain modifies this capacity have not been sufficiently analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the neural mechanisms of human perceptual learning by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity and the assessment of psychophysical performance during training in a visual search task. All participants improved their perceptual performance as reflected by an increase in sensitivity (d') and a decrease in reaction time. The EEG signal was acquired throughout the entire experiment revealing amplitude increments, specific and unspecific to the trained stimulus, in event-related potential (ERP) components N2pc and P3 respectively. P3 unspecific modification can be related to context or task-based learning, while N2pc may be reflecting a more specific attentional-related boosting of target detection. Moreover, bell and U-shaped profiles of oscillatory brain activity in gamma (30-60 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) frequency bands may suggest the existence of two phases for learning acquisition, which can be understood as distinctive optimization mechanisms in stimulus processing. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that there are reorganizations in several neural processes that contribute differently to perceptual learning in a visual search task. We propose an integrative model of neural activity reorganization, whereby perceptual learning takes place as a two-stage phenomenon including perceptual, attentional and contextual processes.

The neural system that underlies the monitoring of performance and the adjustment, of behavior has been subject to multiple neuroimaging investigations that uniformly implicate the anterior cingulate cortex and other prefrontal structures as crucial to these executive functions. The present article describes a series of experiments that employed event-related potentials to study a variety of processes associated with internal or external feedback. Three medial-frontal negativities (error-related negativity, correct-response negativity, feedback-related negativity) are highlighted, each of which plays an important role in the monitoring and dynamic adjustment of behavior.

This study was designed to examine whether functional connectivity strengths of resting EEG could be potential biomarkers in predicting treatment response at 8 weeks of treatment. Resting state 3-mM eyes-closed EEG activity was recorded at baseline and compared in 108 depressed patients. All patients were being treated with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. Baseline coherence and power series correlation were compared between responders and non-responders evaluated at the 8th week by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to evaluate the performance of connectivity strengths in predicting/classifying treatment responses. The connectivity strengths of right fronto-temporal network at delta/theta frequencies differentiated responders and non-responders at the 8th week of treatment, such that the stronger the connectivity strengths, the poorer the treatment response. ROC analyses supported the value of these measures in classifying responders/non-responders. Our results suggest that fronto-temporal connectivity strengths could be potential biomarkers to differentiate responders and slow responders or non-responders in MDD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We selected discriminant cortical sources for comparing classification performance with respect to surface EEG. We found that the data from estimated cortical sources achieves higher classification accuracy for most of the subjects. In addition, the inverse method exhibits consistently discriminant activity for the sources located over the anterior cingulate cortex region for different time points. This level of neurophysiological interpretation in terms of localisation of selected cortical sources is enabled with the use of inverse solution.

Wascher and Beste (2010) [32] showed that the detection of relevant information depends on its relative saliency compared to irrelevant conflicting stimuli. Furthermore the N1pc, N2pc and N2 of the EEG varied with the strength of the conflict. However, this system could also be modulated by rather global mechanisms like attentional effort. The present study investigates such modulations by testing the influence of extrinsic motivation on the selection of competing stimuli. Participants had to detect a luminance change in various conditions among others against an irrelevant orientation change. Half of the participants were motivated to maximize their performance by the announcement of a monetary reward for correct responses. Participants who were motivated had lower error rates than participants who were not motivated. The event-related lateralizations of the EEG showed no motivation-related effect on the N1pc, which reflects the initial saliency driven orientation of attention towards the more salient stimulus. The subsequent N2pc was enhanced in the motivation condition. Extrinsic motivation was also accompanied by enhanced fronto-central negativities. Thus, the data provide evidence that the improvement of selection performance when participants were extrinsically motivated by announcing a reward was not due to changes in the initial saliency based processing of information but was foremost mediated by improved higher-level mechanisms.

To this end, 19 healthy adults performed a speeded Go/NoGo task with compound targets, involving two concurrent stimulus attributes, which were either pre-familiarised or not, while high-density EEG was recorded. During the speeded Go/NoGo task, response errors clearly elicited an error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe), but these error-related components were not modulated by familiarisation. By comparison, post-error adaptive processes were found to depend on familiarisation, as distinct topographic ERP effects were evidenced for familiarised vs. non-familiarised stimuli. Moreover, post-error slowing was abolished in the condition comprising familiarised attributes. These results suggest that pre-familiarisation with a stimulus property leaves unaffected error detection mechanisms, while altering subsequent adaptive processes. Whereas error detection mechanisms may be generic, the automatic adaptive processes consecutive to error detection may be malleable, and influenced by pre-familiarisation of stimulus features.

To test whether this holds for stimuli with strong emotional significance, pictures of spiders as well as mushrooms were presented at fixation to spider-fearful and non-fearful participants. Concurrently, perceptual load was manipulated in two levels with a peripheral letter discrimination task. Results of event-related potentials showed that, compared with non-fearful participants, spider-fearful participants showed greater late positive potentials (LPP) to spiders than mushrooms, which provides a manipulation check that spiders were emotionally meaningful to spider-fearful participants. Critically, this effect was not affected by level of perceptual load. These findings suggest that strong emotional stimuli at fixation may resist manipulations of perceptual load.

Twenty European-Canadian and 17 Chinese-Canadian 5-year-olds participated in a go/no-go task, during which high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. No cultural group differences were observed in children's behavioral performance on the task, but marked differences were revealed by ERP analyses, which focused on the amplitude and latency of the N2 waveform. Chinese-Canadian children showed larger (i.e., more negative) N2 amplitudes than European-Canadian children on the right side of the scalp on no-go trials, as well as on the left side of the scalp on go trials, and for all children, larger N2 amplitudes were associated with faster median reaction times. Source analyses of the N2 were consistent with the hypothesis that compared to European-Canadian children, Chinese-Canadian children showed more activation in dorsomedial, ventromedial, and (bilateral) ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings reveal that EEG can provide a measure of cultural differences in neurocognitive function that is more sensitive than behavioral data alone; that Chinese-Canadian children show a pattern of hemispheric differentiation in the context of this task than that is more pronounced than that of age-matched European-Canadian children; that the asymmetrically lateralized N2 may be a reliable marker of both effortful inhibition (on the right) and effortful approach (on the left); and that the neural correlates of EF may vary across samples of healthy participants, even in children.

Neural responses to faces reflect social personality traits	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Personality; Extraversion; Social motivation; N170; Event-related potential (ERP; EEG); Face perception	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP EVIDENCE; RECOGNITION; N170; MECHANISMS; PERCEPTION; EXPERTISE; COMPONENT; SPECIALIZATION	Faces are a developmentally primary and critically important source of social information, and they are processed differently from most other visual percepts. Studies of brain electrophysiology reveal a face-sensitive component, the N170, which is typically enhanced to faces relative to other stimuli. Research in social disabilities suggests that an atypical N170 response in this population may stem from decreased developmental exposure to faces secondary to reduced social interest. Here we examined the relationship between neural responses to faces and social personality characteristics in a normative sample. Participants were pre-screened to identify individuals scoring high on extraversion or introversion. Both groups were presented with upright and inverted face stimuli. An inversion effect, a marker of expertise for faces, was observed in people with high extraversion but not in those with high introversion. These findings suggest that, within typically developing populations, social attitudes are reflected in the neural correlates of face perception.	[Cheung, Celeste H. M.; Rutherford, Helena J.

Integration through EEG-fMRI trial-by-trial coupling has been proposed as a method to combine the different data sets and achieve temporal expansion of the fMRI data (Eichele et al., 2005). To fully benefit of this type of analysis simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions are necessary (Debener et al., 2006). Here we address the issue of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. We use multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression to "learn" the relation between fMRI activation patterns and simultaneously acquired EEG responses in the context of a complex cognitive task entailing an auditory cue, visual mental imagery and a control visual target. We show that multivariate regression is a valuable approach for predicting evoked and induced oscillatory EEG responses from fMRI time series. Prediction of EEG from fMRI is largely influenced by the overall filtering effects of the hemodynamic response function. However, a detailed analysis of the auditory evoked responses shows that there is a small but significant contribution of single trial modulations that can be exploited for linking spatially-distributed patterns of fMRI activation to specific components of the simultaneously-recorded EEG signal.

We believe that one way to do this is to optimise assessment from the early stages, in order to reduce discontinuity between the hospital and rehabilitation phases. While clinical observation remains the "gold standard" for the diagnostic assessment of patients with DOC, neurophysiological investigations (electroencephalography, short latency evoked potentials and event-related potentials) could help to further understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the state of unresponsiveness, differentiate coma from other apparently similar conditions (i.e., locked-in and locked-in-like syndromes), and potentially integrate prognostic evaluation with monitoring of the evolution of the clinical state. Moreover, these techniques have the considerable advantage of being available at the bedside. Discontinuity between the hospital and rehabilitation phases is rightly considered to be one of the critical points in the assessment of patients with DOC. In our view, a continuum of expert neurological assessment that begins with monitoring of the acute phase (focusing on evolution of primary brain damage and secondary complications) and follows through to the patient's discharge from the intensive care unit (focusing on the pathophysiology of brain damage and prognostication based on clinical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological tests) could help to: i) optimise the rehabilitation programme according to the expectations of recovery; ii) provide a basis for comparison with subsequent periodic re-evaluations; iii) ensure uniformity of assessment regardless of the heterogeneity of care facilities; and iv) characterise a subset of patients who, showing discrepancies between neurophysiological tests and clinical status, are more likely to undergo unexpected recovery.

There is great interest in processing ERPs in single-trial level to get more exact information. In this work, a single-trial ERPs representation scheme based on local tangent space analysis is proposed. By analyzing a number of time-lagged versions of single- trial ERPs data points sampled with noise (i. e., stochastic ongoing EEG) from the embedded one-dimensional manifold, the local tangent space based data-driven approach performs a local geometrical approximation for waveforms, which fits ERPs structure very well and is persistent in all trials. The variation of the ERPs component can also be reflected in one-dimensional representation, which explicitly illustrates the distortion of the simple averaging technique for late ERPs component.

Not only do we employ vocal and facial expressions: body language provides valuable information as well. Here we focused on multimodal perception of emotion expressions, monitoring the temporal unfolding of the interaction of different modalities in the electroencephalogram (EEG). In the auditory condition, participants listened to emotional interjections such as "ah", while they saw mute video clips containing emotional body language in the visual condition. In the audiovisual condition participants saw video clips with matching interjections. In all three conditions, the emotions "anger" and "fear", as well as non-emotional stimuli were used. The N100 amplitude was strongly reduced in the audiovisual compared to the auditory condition, suggesting a significant impact of visual information on early auditory processing. Furthermore, anger and fear expressions were distinct in the auditory but not the audiovisual condition. Complementing these event-related potential (ERP) findings, we report strong similarities in the alpha- and beta-band in the visual and the audiovisual conditions, suggesting a strong visual processing component in the perception of audiovisual stimuli. Overall, our results show an early interaction of modalities in emotional face-to-face communication using complex and highly natural stimuli. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With ERPs as markers of attention, we investigated how allocation of attention varied with tracking load, that is, with the number of objects that were tracked. Flashes on Target discs elicited stronger ERPs than did flashes on Distractor discs; ERP amplitude (0-250 ms) decreased monotonically as load increased from two to three to four (of ten) discs. Amplitude decreased more rapidly for Target discs than Distractor discs. As a result, with increasing tracking loads, the difference between ERPs to Targets and Distractors diminished. This change in ERP amplitudes with load accords well with behavioral performance, suggesting that successful tracking depends upon the relationship between the neural signals associated with attended and non-attended objects.

This paper aims towards identifying and analyzing distinct responses in an auditory working memory paradigm, as independent components with variable latency, frequency and phase characteristics. The event-related nature of components (either phase or non-phase-locked) over multiple trials is thoroughly examined through intertrial coherence measures. Furthermore, the functional coupling of independent components is investigated through the concept of partial directed coherence depicted as a directed graph. Using these tools, the paper compares issues of activation, connectivity and directionality in the synchronization maps of two populations, of control and Alzheimer's subjects. The results on real data from an oddball experiment verify and further enhance the findings of previous studies and illustrate the potential of the proposed analysis framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

[6]). Here, we tested the hypothesis that such interference also affects motor performance during sequential movements. Visual warning stimuli were followed by imperative stimuli associated to electrical painful stimulation at left or right middle finger; imperative stimuli triggered motor sequences with right index finger. Electroencephalographic data (N = 10, 128 electrodes) were spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian transformation. Cortical activity as revealed by the alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) was compared in "Pain + ipsilateral movement" condition (movements and painful stimuli performed at the tight hand) vs. "Pain + contralateral movement" condition (painful stimuli at left hand and movements performed at the right hand). Results showed that compared with the "Pain + contralateral movement" condition, the "Pain + ipsilateral movement" condition induced lower anticipatory alpha ERD (about 10-12 Hz) in left sensorimotor area, lower subjective pain rate, and delayed movement initiation at the group level. These findings suggest that anticipatory alpha rhythms may underlie cortical preparatory sensorimotor processes preceding somatosensory painful and the initiation of sequential motor events occurring at unilateral or bilateral hand.

This paper reviews studies on electrophysiological correlates of visual awareness operationalized as the difference between event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to stimuli that enter awareness and stimuli that do not. There are three candidates for such a correlate: enhancement of P1 around 100 ms, enhancement of early posterior negativity around 200 ms (visual awareness negativity, VAN), and enhancement of late positivity (LP) in the P3 time window around 400 ms. Review of studies using different manipulations of awareness suggests that VAN is the correlate of visual awareness that most consistently emerges across different manipulations of visual awareness. VAN emerges also relatively independent of manipulations of nonspatial attention, but seems to be dependent on spatial attention. The results suggest that visual awareness emerges about 200 ms after the onset of visual stimulation as a consequence of the activation of posterior occipito-temporal and parietal networks.

In order to characterise this cognitive decline and study the effects of improved glycemic control we have studied patients with T2DM (N = 28) and healthy control subjects (N = 21). One group of patients with diabetes (N = 15) were given a 2-month treatment of intensified glycemic control, whereas the other group (N = 13) maintained their regular treatment. Cognitive function in four different domains, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and resting EEG power spectrum were studied in the two groups of patients and in healthy control subjects before and after the 2-month trial period. There were significant differences at baseline (p < 0.02) between patients with T2DM and controls. Patients had lower scores in two cognitive domains: verbal fluency (p < 0.01) and visuospatial ability (p < 0.03). T2DM also affected ERP with a decrease in N100 amplitude ( p < 0.04) and an increase in P300 latency (p < 0.03). Furthermore, resting EEG activity in the beta band (13-30 Hz) was reduced ( p < 0.04). The change between 1st and 2nd investigation was significantly different in the three groups of patients/subjects (p < 0.03). Patients receiving intensified treatment for glycemic control had an improvement of cognitive ability in visuospatial ability (p < 0.02) and semantic memory performance (p < 0.04) together with increased resting EEG activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz, p < 0.02) and connectivity in the theta (4-8 Hz, p < 0.03) and alpha bands (p < 0.03) over central and lateral regions. Furthermore, there was an increase in the connectivity in the beta band (p < 0.04) over the central regions of the scalp. In conclusion, subjects with T2DM had a similar type of cognitive function impairment and EEG/ERP abnormality as previously demonstrated for subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Intensified therapy showed cognitive improvement not shown for regular treatment, suggesting that the negative effect of T2DM on cognition is reversible by means of improved glycemic control. Furthermore, there was an improvement in electro-physiological measures, suggesting increased availability of compensatory mechanisms in subjects with intensified treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting waveform included three segments: (1) a left-lateralized negative early-interval wave, which was frontally maximal but not sensitive to difficulty, (2) a right-lateralized frontally maximal mid-interval wave, which was more positive for more difficult problems, and (3) a left lateralized centrally maximal negative-ramping contingent negative variation (CNV) late wave, which was more negative for more difficult problems. The current study adds to the current literature in that it finds that the frontal and central neural utilization with difficulty changes across plan generation. This suggests that plan generation should be considered in terms of when component processes of planning are differentially utilized as plan generation unfolds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Reports are scarce about the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We report the case G.H. who developed the syndrome after infarction of the left arteria pericallosa. It has been suggested that the syndrome arises out of lacking inhibition from the dominant left hemisphere on the right hemisphere. Yet, in tests of spatial intelligence G.H. performed much better with his "anarchic" left hand than with his dominant right hand, similar to observations commonly reported in split-brain patients. Left-right manual choice responses and event-related EEG potentials to laterally presented stimuli were measured. Asymmetries were evident in G.H.'s behavior and EEG potentials, different from age-matched healthy participants (n = 11). His right-hand responses were fast and unaffected by incompatibility with stimulus location, whereas his left-hand responses were variable and accompanied by a large negative central-midline EEG potential, probably reflecting efforts in initiating the response. G.H.'s visual N1 component peaked earlier and was larger at the right than the left side of the scalp, and the P3 component was distinctly reduced at the right side. Both features occurred independent of side of stimulus presentation and side of responding hand. The effort indicated by the midline negativity and the asymmetrically reduced P3 might directly reflect G.H.'s lack of control on his right hemisphere's processing. The faster visual processing of the right hemisphere suggested by the N1 asymmetry might contribute to "anarchic" processing, making the right hemisphere process stimuli before control impulses exert their effect. These neurophysiological results tend to support the split-brain account which assumes that the syndrome arises by the lack of communication between hemispheres that act according to their respective competences.

IOR is a mechanism to protect the organism from redirecting attention to a previously scanned irrelevant location and is assumed to be generated slower but to a comparable amount with increasing age. We investigated this putative deficit by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). As expected, IOR developed later in older subjects. In the cue-related ERPs. young subjects showed a large frontocentral N2 (reflecting control or inhibition) which was virtually absent in the old subjects. Instead, the older subjects showed a P3b, reflecting controlled processing of information. Thus, older adults process irrelevant stimuli more like relevant ones, thereby overloading their information processing system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: ERPs and theta frequency band oscillation (ERD) were recorded from 15 subjects when they were receiving mismatching/matching feedback information. In addition, subjective sensitivity to the external cues was monitored by BIS (Behavioral Inibition System) and BAS (Behavioral Activation System) measures. Results: One negative ERP deflection of higher amplitude was revealed in response to false feedback, peaking at 210 ms post-stimulus, central-posteriorly localized. A specific cortical network, more central-posteriorly distributed, seems to be implicated. Moreover, theta synchronization was observed in response to false feedback within the posterior cortical site. Conclusions: A direct relationship between ERP/theta band oscillation was supposed, as a marker of salient and unattended cues that produce an alerting response. Moreover, BIS showed an enhanced response to external feedback, and specifically to false feedback, with an increased negative deflection and theta frequency band effect. Significance: ERP negativity may represent a monitoring system, comparable with erroneous feedback effect. Moreover, specific motivation towards negative context was related to higher BIS, since they were more sensitive to negative, false outcome.

Here, we investigated the cortical processing of angry faces during anticipated public speaking. To elicit anxiety, a group of participants was told that they would have to perform a public speech. As a control condition, another group was told that they would have to write a short essay. During anticipation of these tasks, participants saw facial expressions (angry, happy, and neutral) while electroencephalogram was recorded. Event-related potential analysis revealed larger N170 amplitudes for angry compared to happy and neutral faces in the anxiety group. The early posterior negativity as an index of motivated attention was also enhanced for angry compared to happy and neutral faces in participants anticipating public speaking. These results indicate that fear of public speaking influences early perceptual processing of faces such that especially the processing of angry faces is facilitated.

We examine various standard EEG paradigms, such as capturing occipital alpha rhythms, testing for event-related potentials in an auditory oddball paradigm and performing a sensory motor rhythm-based event-related (de-)synchronization paradigm to validate the performance of the novel electrodes in terms of signal quality. Our findings suggest that the dry electrodes that we developed result in high-quality EEG recordings and are thus suitable for a wide range of EEG studies and BCI applications. Furthermore, due to the flexibility of the novel electrodes, greater comfort is achieved in some subjects, this being essential for long-term use.

In EEG recordings, faces elicit a distinct electrophysiological signature, the N170, which has a larger amplitude and shorter latency in response to faces compared to other objects. However, determining the face specificity of any neural marker for face perception hinges on finding an appropriate control stimulus. We used a novel stimulus set consisting of 300 images that spanned a continuum between random patches of natural scenes and genuine faces, in order to explore the selectivity of face-sensitive ERP responses with a model-based parametric stimulus set. Critically, our database contained "false alarm" images that were misclassified as face by computational face-detection system and varied in their image-level similarity to real faces. High-density (128-channel) event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 23 adult subjects viewed all 300 images in random order, and determined whether each image was a face or non-face. The goal of our analyses was to determine the extent to which a gradient of sensitivity to face-like structure was evident in the ERP signal. Traditional waveform analyses revealed that the N170 component over occipitotemporal electrodes was larger in amplitude for faces compared to all non-faces, even those that were high in image similarity to faces, suggesting strict selectivity for veridical face stimuli. By contrast, single-trial classification of the entire waveform measured at the same sensors revealed that misclassifications of non-face patterns as faces increased with image-level similarity to faces. These results suggest that individual components may exhibit steep selectivity, but integration of multiple waveform features may afford graded information regarding stimulus appearance.

A comparison of methods for assessing alpha phase resetting in electrophysiology, with application to intracerebral EEG in visual areas	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; GENERATION; AMPLITUDE; MEMORY; DESYNCHRONIZATION	There are two competing views on the mechanisms underlying the generation of visual evoked potentials/fields in EEG/MEG. The classical hypothesis assumes an additive wave on top of background noise. Another hypothesis states that the evoked activity can totally or partially arise from a phase resetting of the ongoing alpha rhythm. There is no consensus however, on the best tools for distinguishing between these two hypotheses. In this study, we have tested different measures on a large series of simulations under a variety of scenarios, involving in particular trial-to-trial variability and different dynamics of ongoing alpha rhythm. No single measure or set of measures was found to be necessary or sufficient for defining phase resetting in the context of our simulations. Still, simulations permitted to define criteria that were the most reliable in practice for distinguishing additive and phase resetting hypotheses. We have then applied these criteria on intracerebral EEG data recordings in the visual areas during a visual discrimination task. We investigated the intracerebral channels that presented both ERP and ongoing alpha oscillations (n = 37). Within these channels, a total of 30% fulfilled phase resetting criteria during the generation of the visual evoked potential, based on criteria derived from simulations. Moreover, 19% of the 37 channels presented dependence of the ERP on the level of pre-stimulus alpha. Only 5% of channels fulfilled both the simulation-related criteria and dependence on baseline alpha level. Our simulation study points out to the difficulty of clearly assessing phase resetting based on observed macroscopic electrophysiological signals. Still, some channels presented an indication of phase resetting in the context of our simulations. This needs to be confirmed by further work, in particular at a smaller recording scale.

Data recorded during memory retrieval in four scalp region was used. Tow most important ERP's components corresponding to memory retrieval, FN400 and LPC, were detected in recurrence plots computed for single-trial EEGs. In addition, the RQA was used to quantify changes in signal dynamic structure during memory retrieval, and measures of complexity as RQA variables were computed. Given the stimulus, amplitude of the RQA variables increases around 400ms, corresponding to dimension reduction of system. Furthermore, after 800ms these amplitudes decreased which can be as a consequence of an increase in system dimension and back to its basic state. The mean amplitude of Old items was more than New one. Using this method, we found its ability to detect memory components of EEG signals and do a distinction between Old/New items. In contrast with linear techniques recurrence plots and RQA do not need large number of recorded trials, and they can indicate changes in even single-trial EEGs. RQA can also show differences between old and new events in a memory process.

The acquisition of fast predictive mechanisms might be possible due to the extensive training characterizing expertise performance. Recent EEG studies on piano performance reported a negative event-related potential (ERP) triggered in the ACC 70 ms before performance errors (pitch errors due to incorrect keypress). This ERP component, termed pre-error related negativity (pre-ERN), was assumed to reflect processes of error detection in advance. However, some questions remained to be addressed: (i) Does the electrophysiological marker prior to errors reflect an error signal itself or is it related instead to the implementation of control mechanisms? (ii) Does the posterior frontomedial cortex (pFMC, including ACC) interact with other brain regions to implement control adjustments following motor prediction of an upcoming error? (iii) Can we gain insight into the electrophysiological correlates of error prediction and control by assessing the local neuronal synchronization and phase interaction among neuronal populations? (iv) Finally, are error detection and control mechanisms defective in pianists with musician's dystonia (MD), a focal task-specific dystonia resulting from dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamic-frontal circuits? Consequently, we investigated the EEG oscillatory and phase synchronization correlates of error detection and control during piano performances in healthy pianists and in a group of pianists with MD. In healthy pianists, the main outcomes were increased pre-error theta and beta band oscillations over the pFMC and 1315 Hz phase synchronization, between the pFMC and the right lateral prefrontal cortex, which predicted corrective mechanisms. In MD patients, the pattern of phase synchronization appeared in a different frequency band (6-8 Hz) and correlated with the severity of the disorder. The present findings shed new light on the neural mechanisms, which might implement motor prediction by means of forward control processes, as they function in healthy pianists and in their altered form in patients with MD.

We investigated different modes of visual search (serial vs. parallel) and demonstrated that the attentional set induced by the type of search greatly influences these attentional effects. IOR was linked to serial search while facilitation followed parallel search. Event related potentials and LORETA source localization data demonstrated that facilitation was associated with a single component, localized in the cuneus and precuneus, while IOR was related to three different components, involving the superior parietal lobe (at around 200 ms), the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral medial frontal gyrus (similar to 240 ms), and the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyms and inferior parietal gyrus (similar to 280 ms). Our results are consistent with the notion that attentional set determines spatial orienting and with previous studies proposing that IOR is not observed in all previously attended locations.

Nine women with severe PMS and eight controls (aged 18-40 years) completed a laboratory-based daytime protocol including the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), quantitative waking electroencephalogram (EEG), auditory and visual event-related potentials (ERPs), and sleepiness and mood scales during the mid-follicular and late-luteal (premenstrual) phases of the menstrual cycle. In association with increased perceived sleepiness, fatigue and other premenstrual symptoms in the late-luteal phase, women with PMS performed more poorly on the PVT, with increased lapses and slower reaction times (P < 0.05), compared with the follicular phase and controls. However, there were no significant group or menstrual phase differences in latency to sleep on the MWT. Waking spectral EEG power and ERP measures also did not differentiate PMS women when symptomatic. Both groups of women displayed increased spectral power in the delta/theta frequencies (2-6 Hz) and fast alpha frequency (11-12 Hz) in the late-luteal phase relative to the follicular phase. Trait-like differences were apparent in that women with PMS had increased beta1 (12-16 Hz) power and smaller P300 amplitude than controls in both menstrual cycle phases. Our findings indicate that women with severe PMS are subjectively sleepy and fatigued, and show psychomotor slowing when symptomatic compared with when they are symptom-free and compared with controls. However, the ability to maintain wakefulness under soporific conditions, spectral properties of waking EEG and cognitive processing do not vary in synchrony with premenstrual symptoms.

Profiling brain function: Spatiotemporal characterization of normal and abnormal visual activation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs); Event-related brain potentials (ERPs); Source localization; Individual analysis; Vision impairment; Clinical assessment	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES; STIMULUS; CORTEX; MRI	Objective: In clinical neuroscience, the utility of evoked and event-related potentials (EPs and ERPs) resides in the temporal information they provide. However, it is largely unknown whether valuable diagnostic information resides within the corresponding spatial patterns. To determine this, the first step involves testing whether "normal" versus "abnormal" EPs/ERPs can be differentiated based on spatial patterns. In the current study, we present a method that characterizes similarities across individual source maps, called the profile algorithm. The profile algorithm was evaluated in terms of its ability to detect spatial activation differences in myopic individuals with corrected and uncorrected vision. This experiment represents a critical test of the method before applying it to the assessment of perceptual/cognitive functions. Methods: Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded from healthy subjects using checkerboard stimulation. The N75 and P100 were examined in individuals with corrected (20/20) and uncorrected vision (20/40 or worse). Results and conclusion: N75 and P100 amplitudes and latencies were modulated by vision condition. The profile algorithm differentiated successfully between corrected and uncorrected vision. Its discriminatory power outperformed a more traditional method based on ERP peak amplitude. Subsequent correlations revealed significant relationships between visual impairment and both the components and the spatial activation. Overall, the findings suggested that VEP spatial patterns were sensitive to manipulations of visual acuity. Significance: The findings demonstrate that EP/ERP spatial activation can be evaluated at the individual level and compared against normative data. Ultimately, the method may provide a valuable tool for assessing individual spatial activation changes in perceptual/cognitive functions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Ruhnau, P; Herrmann, B; Maess, B; Schroger, E				Ruhnau, Philipp; Herrmann, Bjoern; Maess, Burkhard; Schroeger, Erich			Maturation of obligatory auditory responses and their neural sources: Evidence from EEG and MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory processing; Event-related potentials/fields; School-aged children; P1; N1; N2	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; OSCILLATORY BRAIN RESPONSES; EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; COORDINATE SYSTEM; CORTICAL SURFACE; CHILDREN; N1	Neural auditory responses are known to change from childhood to adulthood. The most prominent components of the event-related potentials (ERPs) found in children are the P1 and N2, while the PI and N1 are strongest in adults. Previous dipole localizations showed regions of the auditory cortex (AC) underlying these responses. An NI in children, however, has only been observed in older age or under certain experimental conditions different than commonly applied in adults. The current study aimed to further elucidate on auditory processing and related components in school-aged children. To do this. MEG and EEG was recorded in adults and 9 to 10 year old children, while presenting pure tones either repetitively or randomly among tones of different pitch. Furthermore, the current paradigm was explicitly designed to not only investigate the PI and N2 in children, but moreover to examine NI modulations based on different refractory states caused by the two conditions. Our results are clear cut. In adults, P1(m) and N1 ( m) components were localized in AC regions, with the N1(m) largely attenuated for repetitive tones. The P1( m) and N2(m) components observed in children were also localized in AC regions. Most importantly, ERP modulations in the NI time window (i.e., larger responses for random than repetitive tones) were remarkably similar for adults and children, both in amplitude and latency. This effect indicates that the NI sub-component reflecting frequency-specific refractoriness is fully developed in 9 to 10 year old children. Thus, previous interpretations on the function and maturation of the NI need reconsideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, differences between the groups were observed in the processing of the mild violation experts and laypersons differed in their early brain responses to the beginning of the chord sequence. Furthermore, ERP data indicated distinctions between experts and laypersons in aesthetic evaluation at three different stages Firstly, during the interval of task-cue presentation, a stronger contingent negative variation (CNV) to the beauty judgment task was observed for experts, indicating that experts invest more effort into preparation for aesthetic processes than into correctness judgments Secondly, during the first four chords, preparation for the correctness judgment required more exertion on the laypersons' side. Thirdly, during the last chord, laypersons showed a larger late and widespread positivity for the beauty compared to the correctness judgment, indicating a stronger reliance on internal affective states while forming a judgment (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved	[Mueller, Mira; Hoefel, Lea; Jacobsen, Thomas] Univ Leipzig, Inst Psychol 1, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Brattico, Elvira] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychol, Cognit Brain Res Unit, SF-00100 Helsinki, Finland; [Brattico, Elvira] Univ Jyvaskyla, Ctr Excellence Interdisciplinary Mus Res, Jyvaskyla, Finland		Muller, M (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Psychol 1, Cognit Including Biol Psychol Seeburgstr 14-20, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.

We report a data-driven approach to image spatio-temporal features of neural oscillatory activity and event-related activity from continuously recorded EEG and fMRI signals. Methods: This approach starts with using the independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose the spatio-temporal EEG data into a linear combination of scalp potential maps and time courses. The time course of each independent component (IC) is used to construct a regressor to fit the fMRI time series. The resultant fMRI map then feeds back as a spatial constraint to the estimation of the source distribution underlying the corresponding IC's scalp map. The estimated source distributions multiplied by the corresponding IC time courses are summed across all ICs, giving rise to the reconstructed spatio-temporal brain activity. Functional connectivity between cortical areas can be further revealed from the imaged source signals using phase synchrony measures. We tested the method using both simulated oscillatory activity and event-related neural activity at various cortical regions. We also used this method to study the alpha-band EEG modulations in an eyes-open-eyes-closed human experiment. Results: In the simulation study, reliable reconstruction of the localization, time-frequency feature and cortical functional connection were achieved for the simulated oscillatory and event-related activities. In the experimental study, the alpha rhythmic modulation was localized mainly in the occipital visual area and the parieto-occipital sulcus. Within these regions, time-frequency analysis and phase-synchronization analysis indicated increased alpha power and alpha-band phase-synchronization in eyes-closed condition versus eyes-open condition. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the proposed approach is well suited to image continuously oscillatory activities and their functional connectivity. Significance: Such ability promises to facilitate the investigation of the long-term neural behaviors and large-scale cortical interactions involved in spontaneous brain activity and cognitive tasks.

ERPs can be classified by their time/frequency characteristics and spatial location on the scalp. Traditionally, ERPs are manually located by temporally and spatially averaged EEG signals. This process is error prone and sensitive to a priori assumptions. Our proposed algorithm is a general neuroscience-focused data mining algorithm that performs time and frequency analysis on ERPs and automatically extracts templates corresponding to Spectral Spatio-Temporal (SST) regions exhibiting significant differences between experimental outcomes. The method uses time-aligned templates, which preserve the characteristics of the signal important to cognitive researchers. The ability of the selected signal templates to differentiate between stimulus responses has been verified using a pattern recognition procedure. SST template extraction is tested on data taken from a Go/NoGo task and shown to both find relationships consistent with published neuroscience literature as well as novel relationships.

The present study was designed to determine whether words and melodies in song are processed interactively or independently, and to examine the influence of attention on the processing of words and melodies in song. Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) and behavioral data were recorded while non-musicians listened to pairs of sung words (prime and target) presented in four experimental conditions: same word, same melody; same word, different melody; different word, same melody; different word, different melody. Participants were asked to attend to either the words or the melody, and to perform a same/different task. In both attentional tasks, different word targets elicited an N400 component, as predicted based on previous results. Most interestingly, different melodies (sung with the same word) elicited an N400 component followed by a late positive component. Finally, ERP and behavioral data converged in showing interactions between the linguistic and melodic dimensions of sung words. The finding that the N400 effect, a well-established marker of semantic processing, was modulated by musical melody in song suggests that variations in musical features affect word processing in sung language. Implications of the interactions between words and melody are discussed in light of evidence for shared neural processing resources between the phonological/semantic aspects of language and the melodic/harmonic aspects of music.

Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while children performed a forced-choice matching task on semantically matching and mismatching visual-auditory, picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Behavioral accuracy and reaction time measures were similar for both groups of children, with environmental sounds eliciting more accurate responses than words. In picture-environmental sound trials, behavioral performance and the brain's response to semantic incongruency (i.e., the N400 effect) of the children with language impairment were comparable to those of their typically developing peers. However, in picture-word trials, children with LI tended to be less accurate than their controls and their N400 effect was significantly delayed in latency. Thus, the children with LI demonstrated a semantic integration deficit that was somewhat specific to the verbal domain. The particular finding of a delayed N400 effect is consistent with the storage deficit hypothesis of language impairment (Kail & Leonard, 1986) suggesting weakened and/or less efficient connections within the language networks of children with LI.

CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						affect; EEG; executive control; fMRI; speech	BRAIN; FMRI; ERP; AMYGDALA; ATTENTION; INTERFERENCE; RECOGNITION; INTEGRATION; MECHANISMS; COGNITION	It has been hypothesized that processing of conflict is facilitated by emotion. Emotional stimuli signal significance in a situation. Thus, when an emotional stimulus is task relevant, more resources may be devoted to conflict processing to reduce the time that an organism is unable to act. In the present electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we employed a conflict task and manipulated the emotional content and prosody of auditory target stimuli. In line with our hypothesis, reaction times revealed faster conflict resolution for emotional stimuli. Early stages of event-related potential conflict processing were modulated by emotion as indexed in an enhanced frontocentral negativity at 420 ms. FMRI yielded conflict activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a crucial part of the executive control network. The right ventral ACC (vACC) was activated for conflict processing in emotional stimuli, suggesting that it is additionally activated for conflict processing in emotional stimuli. The amygdala was also activated by emotion. Furthermore, emotion increased functional connectivity between the vACC and activity in the amygdala and the dACC. The results support the hypothesis that emotion speeds up conflict processing and suggest a new role for the vACC in processing conflict in particularly significant situations signaled by emotion.

Participants with high and low video game experience performed the Stroop task while event-related brain potentials were recorded. The behavioral data revealed no difference between high and low gamers for the Stroop interference effect and a reduction in the conflict adaptation effect in high gamers. The amplitude of the medial frontal negativity and a frontal slow wave was,a attenuated in high gamers, and there was no effect of gaining status on the conflict slow potential. These data lead to the suggestion that video game experience has a negative influence on proactive, but not reactive, cognitive control.

J	Dulas, MR; Newsome, RN; Duarte, A				Dulas, Michael R.; Newsome, Rachel N.; Duarte, Audrey			The effects of aging on ERP correlates of source memory retrieval for self-referential information	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Aging; Source memory; EEG; Self-referential processing; Retrieval	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; RECOLLECTION; BRAIN; FAMILIARITY; CONTEXT	Numerous behavioral studies have suggested that normal aging negatively affects source memory accuracy for various kinds of associations. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that less efficient retrieval processing (temporally delayed and attenuated) may contribute to these impairments. Previous aging studies have not compared source memory accuracy and corresponding neural activity for different kinds of source details; namely, those that have been encoded via a more or less effective strategy. Thus, it is not yet known whether encoding source details in a self-referential manner, a strategy suggested to promote successful memory in the young and old, may enhance source memory accuracy and reduce the commonly observed age-related changes in neural activity associated with source memory retrieval. Here, we investigated these issues by using event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure the effects of aging on the neural correlates of successful source memory retrieval ("old-new effects") for objects encoded either self-referentially or self-externally. Behavioral results showed that both young and older adults demonstrated better source memory accuracy for objects encoded self-referentially. ERP results showed that old-new effects onsetted earlier for self-referentially encoded items in both groups and that age-related differences in the onset latency of these effects were reduced for self-referentially, compared to self-externally, encoded items. These results suggest that the implementation of an effective encoding strategy, like self-referential processing, may lead to more efficient retrieval, which in turn may improve source memory accuracy in both young and older adults.

In the current study, we investigated the impact of the interstimulus interval (ISI) on the response decrement. Healthy subjects were stimulated with trains of five tones, with an ISI of 600, 1,200, or 1,800 ms within the trains. Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were recorded from the vertex, as well as neuromagnetic auditory evoked fields (AEF) from the left temporal region. Stimulus repetition led to a response decrement for the studied AEP components (N100 and P200) and AEF components (N100m and P200m). However, for all used ISIs, there was no further response decrement after the 2nd stimulus. The ISI affected only the magnitude but not the kind of the response decrement. No evidence for a gradual response decrement was revealed at any used ISI. This finding indicates that the response decrement is probably due to the refractoriness of cell assemblies involved in the generation of AEP and AEF components, rather than the result of a genuine habituation process. The finding questions habituation as the mechanism behind short-term decrements of AEP/AEF components.

The hypothesis was that anticipatory modulations of visual cortex activity would differentiate trials on which subjects knew an anti- versus a pro-saccade response was required. Trials consisted of flickering checkerboards in both peripheral visual fields, followed by brightening of one checkerboard (target) while both kept flickering. Neural activation related to checkerboards before target onset (bias signal) was assessed using electroencephalography. Pretarget visual cortex responses to checkerboards were strongly modulated by task demands (significantly lower on antisaccade trials), an effect that may reduce the predisposition to saccade generation instigated by visual capture. The results illustrate how top-down sensory regulation can complement motor preparation to facilitate adaptive voluntary behavioral control.

This finding is termed retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) and is assumed to be the consequence of an inhibitory mechanism resolving retrieval competition. In the present study, we examined brain oscillatory processes related to RIF, as induced by competitive memory retrieval. Contrasting a competitive with a noncompetitive retrieval condition, we found a stronger increase in early evoked theta (4-7 Hz) activity, which specifically predicted RIF, but not retrieval-induced enhancement. Within the cognitive framework of RIF, these findings suggest that theta oscillations reflect arising interference and its resolution during competitive retrieval in episodic memory.

Cognitive Control in Late-Life Depression: Response Inhibition Deficits and Dysfunction of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Aging; geriatric; elderly; depression; N2 component; ERP; executive control; anterior cingulate cortex; ACC; EEG; response inhibition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GERIATRIC DEPRESSION; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; GO/NOGO TASK; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CHANGING PLANS; REMISSION; HUMANS; ACTIVATION; ERPS	Objectives: Geriatric depression is associated with frontolimbic functional deficits, and this frontal dysfunction may underlie the marked executive control deficits often seen in this population. The authors' goal was to assess the integrity of frontal cortical functioning in geriatric depression, while these individuals performed a standard cognitive control task. The N2 component of the event-related potential (ERP), an evoked response generated within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is significantly enhanced when nondepressed individuals successfully inhibit a response, providing an excellent metric of frontal inhibitory function. Design: The authors used a variant of a demanding Go/NoGo task-switching paradigm that required participants to inhibit response execution during NoGo trials by overcoming a potent response tendency established by frequent Go trials. Participants: The authors compared a cohort of depressed geriatric outpatients (N = 11) with a similarly aged group of nondepressed participants (N = 11). Measurements: Reaction times, accuracy, and high-density event-related potential recordings from a 64-channel electrode montage were obtained. Results: A significantly enhanced N2 to NoGo trials was observed in nondepressed elderly participants, with generators localized to the ACC. In contrast, this enhancement was strongly reduced in the depressed sample. Source analysis and topographic mapping pointed to a displacement of N2 generators toward more posterior areas of the middle frontal gyrus in depressed subjects. Conclusions: Findings confirm previous reports of an inhibitory control deficit in depressed elderly who show significantly increased rates of commission errors (i.e., failures to inhibit responses on NoGo trials). Electrophysiologic data suggest underlying dysfunction in ACC as the basis for this deficit.

Previous behavioral studies have shown that it is possible to segment a language or musical stream based only on probabilities of occurrence between adjacent syllables/tones. Here we used a sung language and tested participants' learning of both linguistic and musical structures while recording electroencephalography. Although behavioral results showed learning of the linguistic structure only, event-related potential results for both dimensions showed a negative component sensitive to the degree of familiarity of items. We discuss this component as an index of lexical search, also pointing to the greater sensitivity of the event-related potentials compared to the behavioral responses.

In this article, we review the neural underpinnings of sensory processing in autism by reviewing the literature on neurophysiological responses to auditory, tactile, and visual stimuli in autistic individuals. We review studies of unimodal sensory processing and multisensory integration that use a variety of neuroimaging techniques, including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional MRI. We then explore the impact of covert and overt attention on sensory processing. With additional characterization, neurophysiologic profiles of sensory processing in ASD may serve as valuable biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic interventions for autism and reveal potential strategies and target brain regions for therapeutic interventions.

FN400 potentials are functionally identical to N400 potentials and reflect semantic processing during recognition testing	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Learning; memory; Language; speech; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EXPLICIT MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE; ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION; REMEMBER/KNOW JUDGMENTS; SCALP DISTRIBUTIONS; PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY; IMPLICIT MEMORY	The "F" in FN400 denotes a more frontal scalp distribution relative to the morphologically similar N400 component-a distinction consistent with the hypothesized distinct roles of FN400 in familiarity memory versus N400 in language. However, no direct comparisons have substantiated these assumed dissimilarities. To this end, we manipulated short-term semantic priming during a recognition test. Semantic priming effects on N400 were indistinguishable from memory effects at the same latency, and semantic priming strongly modulated the "FN400," despite having no influence on familiarity memory. Thus, no evidence suggested either electrophysiological or functional differences between the N400 and FN400, and findings were contrary to the linking of the "FN400" to familiarity. Instead, it appears that semantic/conceptual priming (reflected in the N400) occurs during recognition tests and is frequently (mis)labeled as FN400 and attributed to familiarity.

J	Hsu, WY				Hsu, Wei-Yen			EEG-based motor imagery classification using enhanced active segment selection and adaptive classifier	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Motor imagery (MI); Wavelet transform; Fractal dimension; Active segment selection; Adaptive classifier	EXTRACTION	In this study, an adaptive electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system is proposed for a two-session, single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the adaptive linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for classification of left- and right-hand MI data and for simultaneous and continuous update of its parameters. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection of active segments. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. The classification in session 2 is performed by adaptive LDA, which is trial-by-trial updated using the Kalman filter after the trial is classified. Compared with original active segment selection and non-adaptive LDA on six subjects from two data sets, the results indicate that the proposed method is helpful to realize adaptive BCI systems.

EEG data (56 channels; Eb-Neuro(C)) were recorded in 18 elite karate athletes and 28 non-athletes during resting state eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. The EEG data were spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian estimation. Cortical activity was indexed by task-related power decrease (TRPD), namely the alpha power during the eyes-open referenced to the eyes-closed resting condition. Low-frequency alpha TRPD (about 8-10 Hz) was lower in the elite karate athletes than in the non-athletes in frontal (p<0.00002), central (p<0.008) and right occipital (p<0.02) areas. Similarly, high-frequency alpha TRPD (about 10-12 Hz) was lower in the elite karate athletes than in the non-athletes in frontal (p<0.00009) and central (p<0.01) areas. These results suggest that athletes' brain is characterized by reduced cortical reactivity to eyes opening in the condition of resting state, in line with the "neural efficiency" hypothesis. The present study motivates future research evaluating the extent to which this general functional brain feature is related to heritable trait or intensive visuo-motor training of elite athletes.

However, the impact of delays in neural processing during stimulus encoding on working memory (WM) performance is not well understood. In the current study. we assessed the influence of aging on the relationship between neural measures of processing speed and WM performance during a selective delayed-recognition task for color and motion stimuli, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in young and older adults. A latency delay was observed for the selection negativity (SN) and alpha band activity (measures of attentional allocation) in older adults during WM encoding of both motion and color stimuli, with the latency and magnitude of the SN predicting subsequent recognition performance. Furthermore, an age-related delay in the NI latency occurred specifically during the encoding of color stimuli. These results suggest that the presence of both generalized feature-based and feature-specific deficits in the speed of selective encoding of information contributes to WM performance deficits in older adults.

J	Aarts, K; Pourtois, G				Aarts, Kristien; Pourtois, Gilles			Anxiety not only increases, but also alters early error-monitoring functions	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; TIME-COURSE; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS	Anxiety has profound influences on a wide range of cognitive processes, including action monitoring. Event-related brain potential (ERP) studies have shown that anxiety can boost early error detection mechanisms, as reflected by an enhanced error-related negativity (ERN) following errors in high-anxious, as compared with low-anxious, participants. This observation is consistent with the assumption of a gain control mechanism exerted by anxiety onto error-related brain responses within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, whether anxiety simply enhances or, rather, alters early error detection mechanisms remains unsolved. In this study, we compared the performance of low- versus high-trait-anxious participants during a go/no-go task while high-density EEG was recorded. The two groups showed comparable behavioral performance, although levels of state anxiety increased following the task for high-anxious participants only. ERP results confirmed that the ERN/Ne to errors was enhanced for high-anxious, relative to low-anxious, participants. However, complementary topographic analyses revealed that the scalp map of the ERN/Ne was not identical between the two groups, suggesting that anxiety did not merely increase early error detection mechanisms, but also led to a qualitative change in the early appraisal of errors. Inverse solution results confirmed a shift within the ACC for the localization of neural generators underlying the ERN/Ne scalp map in high-anxious participants, corroborating the assumption of an early effect of anxiety on early error-monitoring functions. These results shed new light on the dynamic interplay between anxiety and error-monitoring functions in the human brain.

Research to date has predominantly investigated the impact of negative emotional stimuli. However, rapid reactions to positive emotional stimuli are similarly adaptive. Here, we tested the influence of positive emotional stimuli on attentional control, which enables reacting to conflicting stimulation. We therefore presented positive emotional and neutral words in an auditory Simon task. Reaction times revealed faster resolution of conflict when target stimuli were positive compared to neutral words. Also, emotion modulated the first conflict-sensitive event-related brain potential, a negativity at 420 ms, indicating an influence on early stages of conflict processing. These results complement recent data on negative stimuli and suggest that positive stimuli are equally salient. The rapid impact on attentional control is evolutionary highly adaptive as it reduces the time that conflict yields an organism incapable of responding to reward-signalling stimuli.

Using TMS with EEG necessitates a sophisticated artifact-resistant EEG system that can acquire reliable signals in the crucial several tens of milliseconds immediately following the TMS pulse. Here, we demonstrate the use of a novel artifact removal algorithm together with a 24-bit EEG system to achieve similar recordings as those obtained with the dedicated TMS-compatible EEG system. Methods: This setup was used to compare TMS-evoked responses between a group of healthy controls and a group of patients with schizophrenia, a condition in which effective neural connectivity is thought to be compromised. Results: We observe differences in TMS-evoked responses between the two groups, similar to those recently reported in a study that used a dedicated TMS-compatible EEG system. Conclusions: The standard 24-bit EEG system combined with an artifact removal algorithm produces results similar to the dedicated TMS-compatible system. Significance: This paves the way for more researchers and clinicians to use TMS-evoked responses for research and diagnosis of a wide spectrum of disorders.

However, more sophisticated analysis methods such as single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI are often handicapped by the limited quality of EEGs acquired in the MRI scanner. In particular, the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact is still a relevant problem. Methods that are currently available typically remove the BCG artifact either in post-recording or real-time signal processing. Here, we would like to suggest a new strategy to avoid BCG artifacts during data acquisition. In our proposal, stimuli are presented pulse-triggered (PT), thus avoiding interference of BCG artifacts with the evoked potentials investigated during EEG recording. This method is based on the observation that the main influence of the BCG artifact is generally limited to the time interval of 150-500 ms post-QRS complex. Based on real measurements, we simulated different signal presentation methods relative to the onset of the BCG artifact for 14 subjects. Stimuli were either presented independently of the BCG artifact or pulse-triggered at fixed time-points (280 ms, 480 ms and 680 ms post-QRS complex) and with a jitter (short: 120 ms or long: 240 ms). In combination with an averaged artifact subtraction method signal distortion was reduced at best by 47%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Four healthy volunteers were instructed to perform an intended motor imagery task following an external sync signal in order to turn on a virtual switch provided on a computer screen. No specific mental task was required during the 'No Control' state. The beta band event-related frequency power (event-related desynchronization or ERD) from a single EEG Laplacian channel was monitored online in real-time. The computer continuously monitored the relative ERD power level until it exceeded a pre-set threshold and turned on the virtual switch. Results: Subject 1 achieved lowest average false positive rate of 0.4 +/- 0.9% in a five-session online study during the entire 'No Control' state, whereby the subject required 6.8 +/- 0.6 s of active urging time or total response time of 20.5 +/- 1.9 s to perform repeated attempts in order to turn on the switch in the online interactive switch operation. The average false positive rate among four subjects was 0.8 +/- 0.4% with average active urging time of 12.3 +/- 4.4 s or average response time of 36.9 +/- 13.0 s. Offline analysis from subject 2 shows that the overall performance from 10-fold cross-validation was 96.2% with 3 consecutive epoch averaging, which was further improved to 99.0% by computationally intensive methods. Conclusions: The novel design of the brain-controlled switch using the ERD feature associated with motor imagery achieved minimal false positive rate with a reasonable active urging time or response time to activate the switch. Significance: The reliability and convenience of the developed brain-controlled switch may extend current brain-computer interface capacities in practical communication and control applications.

Performance is usually diminished with increasing age in such tasks. This decline is relevant for activities in real life like driving. In the present study we aim to examine if there are age-related differences in stimulus processing in a dual-task and if these differences have an impact on performance of a driving-like tracking task. Young and older participants performed a dual-task consisting of a tracking task and a visual attention task. Alongside, the EEG was recorded for calculating the P300 (P3) of the event-related potential as a reflection of controlled stimulus processing. In the visual attention task older vs. young participants showed more misses and false alarms. For young participants the P3 shows an expected pattern of higher amplitudes for relevant compared to irrelevant stimuli. This was not found for the older participants. A general age-related decline in tracking performance was relatively more pronounced if a secondary motor response was required in the visual attention task and also after irrelevant stimuli. The results suggest that older compared to young participants had greater difficulties to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant stimuli in a dual-task situation as they probably apply comparable attentional resources to all stimuli. This may also explain the higher error rates. These results have important implications for the understanding of age-related stimulus processing in dual and multi task situations in real life as for instance driving. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the extent to which trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociation influenced attention to basic auditory stimuli in a sample of military cadets. After filling out a series of psychometric questionnaires. 27 male military cadets varying in their trauma history participated in the "novelty" oddball task in which participants were asked to count high-pitched tones while ignoring other auditory stimuli. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was continually recorded in order to assess P300 responses, an event-related potential (ERP) associated with attention and memory processes. Trauma history only, and not dissociation or PTSD scores, predicted smaller P300 amplitudes to target tones. To distracting novel sounds, only trauma history and dissociation predicted unique variance in P300 amplitudes. The findings suggest that PTSD may not be central to the attentional disturbances found in traumatized samples, while trauma history and dissociation may play a more important role. Future studies investigating attentional processes post trauma should utilize dissociation scales and a non-trauma sample. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predicting variations of perceptual performance across individuals from neural activity using pattern classifiers	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural correlates of human behavior; ERP analysis; Pattern classifiers	HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; DECISION-MAKING; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION	Within the past decade computational approaches adopted from the field of machine learning have provided neuroscientists with powerful new tools for analyzing neural data. For instance, previous studies have applied pattern classification algorithms to electroencephalography data to predict the category of presented visual stimuli, human observer decision choices and task difficulty. Here, we quantitatively compare the ability of pattern classifiers and three ERP metrics (peak amplitude, mean amplitude, and onset latency of the face-selective N170) to predict variations across individuals' behavioral performance in a difficult perceptual task identifying images of faces and cars embedded in noise. We investigate three different pattern classifiers (Classwise Principal Component Analysis, CPCA: Linear Discriminant Analysis, LDA: and Support Vector Machine, SVM), five training methods differing in the selection of training data sets and three analyses procedures for the ERP measures. We show that all three pattern classifier algorithms surpass traditional ERP measurements in their ability to predict individual differences in performance. Although the differences across pattern classifiers were not large, the CPCA method with training data sets restricted to EEG activity for trials in which observers expressed high confidence about their decisions performed the highest at predicting perceptual performance of observers. We also show that the neural activity predicting the performance across individuals was distributed through time starting at 120 ms, and unlike the face-selective ERP response, sustained for more than 400 ms after stimulus presentation, indicating that both early and late components contain information correlated with observers' behavioral performance. Together, our results further demonstrate the potential of pattern classifiers compared to more traditional ERP techniques as an analysis tool for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain and relating neural activity to behavior.

The manuscript focuses primarily on advances in understanding related to social information processing and interconnectivity among brain systems in ASD. Recent findings Recent research indicates anomalous function of social brain regions in ASD and highlights the specificity of processing problems to these systems. Atypical activity in this circuitry may reflect genetic susceptibility for ASD, with increased activity in compensatory areas marking the distinction between developing and not developing the disorder. Advances in understanding connectivity in ASD are highlighted by novel work providing initial evidence of atypical interconnectivity in infancy. Summary Emerging understanding of neural dysfunction in ASD indicates consistent but heterogeneous dysfunction across brain systems in ASD. Key objectives for the immediate future include the use of multimethod approaches that encompass temporal and spatial imaging; behavioral phenotyping carried out in developmental context to reveal subgroups defined uniquely by trajectories; and individual-specific profiles of behavioral performance and brain function.

Algorithmic reconstruction of brain activity from MEG and EEG data is referred to as electromagnetic brain imaging (EBI). Reconstructing the actual brain response to external events and distinguishing unrelated brain activity has been a challenge for many existing algorithms in this field. Furthermore, even under conditions where there is very little interference, accurately determining the spatial locations and timing of brain sources from MEG and EEG data is challenging problem because it involves solving for unknown brain activity across thousands of voxels from just a few sensors (similar to 300). In recent years, my research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for EBI that we have shown to be considerably superior to existing benchmark algorithms. Specifically, these algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources. Our algorithms efficiently model interference contributions to sensors, accurately estimate sparse brain source activity using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we review some of these algorithms and illustrate their performance in simulations and real MEG/EEG data.

Single-trial detection of somatosensory evoked potentials by probabilistic independent component analysis and wavelet filtering	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs); Event-related potentials (ERPs); Single-trial analysis; Probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA); Wavelet filtering	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; ALGORITHMS; AMPLITUDE; NUMBER; ERPS; FMRI	Objective: To develop an effective approach for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and identifying single-trial short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: 128-channel SEPs elicited by electrical stimuli of the left posterior tibial nerve were recorded from 11 healthy subjects. Probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) was used as a spatial filter to isolate SEP-related independent components (ICs), and wavelet filtering was used as a time-frequency filter to further enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs. Results: SEP-related ICs, identified using PICA, showed typical patterns of cortical SEP complex (P39-N50-P60) and scalp topography (centrally distributed with the spatial peak located near vertex). In addition, wavelet filtering significantly enhanced the SNR of single-trial SEPs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Combining PICA and wavelet filtering offers a space-time-frequency filter that can be used to enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs greatly, thus providing a reliable estimation of single-trial SEPs. Significance: This method can be used to detect single-trial SEPs and other types of evoked potentials (EPs) in various sensory modalities, thus facilitating the exploration of single-trial dynamics between EPs, behavioural variables (e. g., intensity of perception), as well as abnormalities in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring.

This paper presents a multivariate statistical model of ERPs by exploiting the existing knowledge about their spatio-temporal properties. In particular, a computationally efficient algorithm is derived for fast model estimation. The algorithm, termed SIM, can be intuitively interpreted as maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in the source space. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we show that the algorithm achieves excellent estimation performance and substantially outperforms a state-of-the-arts algorithm in classification accuracies in a P300 target detection task. The results demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework offers a powerful tool for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of ERPs as well as learning spatial filters for decoding brain states.

Differential effects of perturbation direction and magnitude on the neural processing of voice pitch feedback	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory feedback; N1-P2 complex; Event-related potential (ERP); Pitch feedback perturbation; Vocalization	SHIFTED AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; SPEECH PRODUCTION; F-0 RESPONSES; SYLLABLES; CORTEX; REFLEX	Objective: The present study examined the differential effects of voice auditory feedback perturbation direction and magnitude on voice fundamental frequency (F-0) responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from EEG electrodes on the scalp. Methods: The voice F-0 responses and N1 and P2 components of ERPs were examined from 12 right-handed speakers when they sustained a vowel phonation and their mid-utterance voice pitch feedback was shifted +/-100, +/-200, and +/-500 cents with 200 ms duration. Results: Downward voice pitch feedback perturbations led to larger voice F-0 responses than upward perturbations. The amplitudes of N1 and P2 components were larger for downward compared with upward pitch-shifts for 200 and 500 cents stimulus magnitudes. Shorter N1 and P2 latencies were also associated with larger magnitudes of pitch feedback perturbations. Conclusions: Corresponding changes in vocal and neural responses to upward and downward voice pitch feedback perturbations suggest that the N1 and P2 components of ERPs reflect neural concomitants of the vocal responses. Significance: The findings of interactive effects between the magnitude and direction of voice feedback pitch perturbation on N1 and P2 ERP components indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying error detection and correction in voice pitch auditory feedback are differentially sensitive to both the magnitude and direction of pitch perturbations.

A half an hour later, the same pictures were presented, without preceding frames; EEG was recorded and participants rated each picture on arousal and valence. In line with previous work, unpleasant compared to neutral pictures elicited more positive early- (359 ms), mid- (1074 ms) and late-latency (2436 ms) centrally-distributed ERP components. Pictures previously preceded by negative compared to neutral reappraisal frames were rated as more unpleasant and more emotionally arousing; these pictures elicited a larger mid-latency (1074 ms) occipital positivity. Together, the data suggest that reappraisal exerts an enduring effect on both subjective and neural responses to stimuli.

Event-related Potential Study of the Effects of Emotional Facial Expressions on Task Performance in Euthymic Bipolar Patients	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						Euthymia; Bipolar disorder; Event-related potential; Face processing; Affect	WEEKLY SYMPTOMATIC STATUS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; AFFECT RECOGNITION; DECISION-MAKING; NATURAL-HISTORY; FACE PERCEPTION; P300 AMPLITUDE; AUDITORY P300	There appears to be a significant disconnect between symptomatic and functional recovery in bipolar disorder (BD). Some evidence points to interepisode cognitive dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that some of this dysfunction was related to emotional reactivity in euthymic bipolar subjects may effect cognitive processing. A modification of emotional gender categorization oddball task was used. The target was gender (probability 25%) of faces with negative, positive, and neutral emotional expression. The experiment had 720 trials (3 blocks x 240 trials each). Each stimulus was presented for 150 ms, and the EEG/ERP responses were recorded for 1,000 ms. The inter-trial interval was varied in 1,100-1,500 ms range to avoid expectancy effects. Task took about 35 min to complete. There were 9 BD and 9 control subjects matched for age and gender. Reaction time (RT) was globally slower in BD subjects. The centro-parietal amplitudes at N170 and N200, and P200 and P300 were generally smaller in the BD group compared to controls. Latency was shorter to neutral and negative targets in BD. Frontal P200 amplitude was higher to emotional negative facial non-targets in BD subjects. The frontal N200 in response to positive facial emotion was less negative in BD subjects. The frontal P300 of BD subjects was lower to emotionally neutral targets. ERP responses to facial emotion in BD subjects varied significantly from normal controls. These variations are consistent with the common depressive symptomology seen in long term studies of bipolar subjects.

In the current study, we investigated the time course and neural sources of spoken inflected and derived words using simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses. Ten participants (native speakers) listened to inflected, derived, and monomorphemic Finnish words and judged their acceptability. EEG and MEG responses were time-locked to both the stimulus onset and the critical point (suffix onset for complex words, uniqueness point for monomorphemic words). The ERP results showed that inflected words elicited a larger left-lateralized negativity than derived and monomorphemic words approximately 200 ms after the critical point. Source modeling of MEG responses showed one bilateral source in the superior temporal area similar to 100 ms after the critical point, with derived words eliciting stronger source amplitudes than inflected and monomorphemic words in the right hemisphere. Source modeling also showed two sources in the temporal cortex approximately 200 ms after the critical point. There, inflected words showed a more systematic pattern in source locations and elicited temporally distinct source activity in comparison to the derived word condition. The current results provide electrophysiological evidence for at least partially distinct cortical processing of spoken inflected and derived words. In general, the results support models of morphological processing stating that during the recognition of inflected words, the constituent morphemes are accessed separately. With regard to derived words, stem and suffix morphemes might be at least initially activated along with the whole word representation.

In the present study, we investigated effects of word predictability on eye movements (EM) and fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) during natural sentence reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and EM (via video-based eye tracking) were recorded simultaneously while subjects read heterogeneous German sentences, moving their eyes freely over the text. FRPs were time-locked to first-pass reading fixations and analyzed according to the cloze probability of the currently fixated word. We replicated robust effects of word predictability on EMs and the N400 component in FRPs. The data were then used to model the relation among fixation duration, gaze duration, and N400 amplitude, and to trace the time course of EEG effects relative to effects in EM behavior. In an extended Methodological Discussion section, we review 4 technical and data-analytical problems that need to be addressed when FRPs are recorded in free-viewing situations (such as reading, visual search, or scene perception) and propose solutions. Results suggest that EEG recordings during normal vision are feasible and useful to consolidate findings from EEG and eye-tracking studies.

Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies have suggested that electrophysiological differences occur early in time (<200 ms) in response to backward-masked emotional faces. These findings have been taken as evidence of a rapid non-conscious pathway, which would allow threatening stimuli to be processed rapidly and subsequently allow appropriate avoidance action to be taken. However, for this to be the case, subliminal processing should arise even if the threatening stimulus is not attended. This point has in fact not yet been clearly established. In this ERP study, we investigated whether subliminal processing of fearful faces occurs outside the focus of attention. Fourteen healthy participants performed a line judgment task while fearful and non-fearful (happy or neutral) faces were presented both subliminally and supraliminally. ERPs were compared across the four experimental conditions (i.e., subliminal and supraliminal; fearful and non-fearful). The earliest differences between fearful and non-fearful faces appeared as an enhanced posterior negativity for the former at 170 ms (the N170 component) over right temporo-occipital electrodes. This difference was observed for both subliminal (p < 0.05) and supraliminal presentations (p < 0.01). Our results confirm that subliminal processing of fearful faces occurs early in the course of visual processing, and more importantly, that this arises even when the subject's attention is engaged in an incidental task.

A central issue in the interpretation of these results is whether the processes involved in those tasks are comparable to those involved in overt speech production. In the present study we addressed a methodological issue about the integration of stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs in immediate overt picture naming in comparison to delayed production, coupled with a theoretical point on the effect of word Age of Acquisition (AoA). High density EEG recordings were used and waveform analyses and spatio-temporal segmentation were combined on stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs. The same sequence and duration of topographic maps appeared in the immediate and delayed production until around 350 ms after picture onset, revealing similar encoding processes until the beginning of phonological encoding, but modulations linked to word AoA were only observed in the immediate production. Considering stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs together allowed to identify that a stable topography starting around 350 ms lasts 30 ms longer for late-acquired than for early-acquired words. This difference falls within the time-window of phonological encoding and its modulation can be linked to the longer production latencies for late-acquired words.

It has been proposed that whether this intertrial priming effect is perceptual in nature or not, and how strong it is, depends on the perceptual ambiguity of the display. Using the event-related potential (ERP) method, Experiment 1 assessed whether perceptual ambiguity indeed resulted in increased priming, by comparing target repetitions and changes in a condition with a target-resembling distractor to a condition without such a distractor. Priming effects on response times were indeed greater in the presence of a distractor. Moreover, EEG analyses revealed latency shifts and amplitude differences in the P1 and N2pc components for the same condition, consistent with a perceptual locus of intertrial priming. Experiment 2 confirmed this by varying the perceptual similarity of the distractor to the target. Priming benefits increased with increasing similarity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Early clinical detection of neuropsychological disorder lacks the unification standards. The aim of this study was to describe the neural mechanism of audiovisual interaction in healthy subjects by combining behavior-based methods (neuropsychological testing) and event-related potentials (ERP), and to provide a neural mechanism for early clinical detection. We designed the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between sound and visual (-400 ms, -150 ms, 0 ms, 150 ms, 400 ms, visual only and sound only, each with equal probability, randomly in each trial), so that the subject could not find the cognitive rules connecting the two stimuli. The behavioral results showed that the responses to temporal congruency audiovisual (AV) stimuli were faster than those to unimodal visual(V) stimuli. The ERPs results showed audiovisual interaction elicited by irrelevant auditory(A) stimuli in a visual attention task. This interaction occurred at late stage around 220 similar to 240ms and 340 similar to 380ms.

Modulation of neural activity by motivational and spatial biases	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Motivational bias; Reward stakes; Spatial attention; ERP	HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; DECISION-MAKING; REWARD EXPECTATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; AROUSAL; BRAIN; TIME; EEG	Motivational biases and spatial attention both modulate neural activity and influence behavioural performance. The time course of motivational bias effects, as well as the relationship between motivation and attention across the time course of information processing, however, are relatively unknown. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded whilst individuals performed a modified Posner task, in which cue stimuli indicated the reward stakes of a given trial and the probable spatial location of a subsequent target stimulus. Reaction times (RTs) were sensitive to motivation and to attention, with faster responses produced on valid and on rewarded trials. In addition, motivation modulated neural activity from the visual analysis of stimuli, with an earlier N1 peak for rewarded compared with non-rewarded stimuli. Effects of motivation were relatively independent from those of attention until late cognitive processing and response production, where motivation and attention interacted to enhance P300-like potentials and the lateralised readiness potential (LRP). The results suggest that multiple sources of modulatory influences may exist, with motivation and attention exerting independent influences over early stimulus and cognitive processing, followed by a late interaction allowing the construction of a comprehensive stimulus representation that contains information pertaining to both motivational and spatial expectations.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 18 successful dieters (5 females) and 24 non dieting subjects (9 females). The subjects were given frequent (70%) and rare (30%) stimuli depicting faces (FACE), food (FOOD), and landscapes (CONTROL). The task was to click the mouse after the rare stimuli. The rare stimuli depicted the frequent stimuli graphically dilated by 25% along the horizontal axis. Cortical responses accompanying attention processes were probed by the difference between positive event-related potentials peaking around 400-500 ms post-stimulus for the rare minus frequent stimuli (P300). The popular freeware LORETA estimated P300 cortical sources. The results showed that in the FACE condition, the amplitude of left frontal (BA 6) and medial parietal (BA 5) P300 sources was higher in the successful dieters (karate athletes) than non dieting subjects. These results disclose that frontal-parietal responses to "oddball" stimuli depicting enlarged faces (i.e. representing face fattening) are enhanced in successful dieters (karate athletes). Future studies should evaluate this effect in other populations of successful dieters (i.e. boxers, top models etc.). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, using such stimuli in the experimental setting is disadvantageous as they are too brief to faithfully simulate clinical pain. We aimed at utilizing continuous EEG to investigate the properties of peak alpha frequency (PAF) as an objective cortical measure associated with subjective perception of tonic pain. Five minute long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with peak frequencies of alpha power-curves derived from central, temporal and frontal electrodes. NPSs and PAFs remained stable throughout the recording conditions (RM-ANOVAs; Ps>0.51). In the noxious condition, PAFs obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs (Ps<0.001). Moreover, resting-state PAPs recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps<0.01). These psychophysical-neurophysiological relations attest to the properties of PAF as a novel cortical objective measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Moreover, resting-state PAFs might hold inherent pain modulation attributes, possibly enabling the prediction of individual responsiveness to prolonged pain. The relevance of PAF to the neural processing of tonic pain may indicate its potential to advance pain research as well as clinical pain characterization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that chronic pain patients will show abnormal EEG activity under negative mood conditions compared to healthy controls. Nineteen patients with chronic pain and 21 healthy subjects participated in the experiment. Multiscale entropy, fractal dimension, event-related potentials, and fast Fourier transform were used to analyze EEG data. A significant enhancement of entropy was found in pain patients at P4 compared to P3. Analysis of fractal dimension also revealed significantly higher values at P4 than P3 when pain patients were viewing unpleasant pictures. By contrast, no significant differences due to hemisphere or affective condition were found on nonlinear measures for healthy controls. Analyses of somatosensory ERPs showed that P50 amplitudes elicited by pleasant pictures were more reduced in chronic pain patients than in healthy controls. Finally, we observed that EEG band power was lower in pain patients than in healthy controls, in particular for theta and beta bands over sensorimotor cortices and temporal regions when viewing pleasant images. These findings suggest that sustained pain seems to be accompanied by an abnormal activation and dynamic of brain networks related to emotional processing of somatosensory information in chronic pain. Furthermore, our findings suggest that both linear and nonlinear measures of EEG time series may contribute to the understanding of brain dysfunction in chronic pain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When applied in sessions of repeated stimulation, TMS can lead to changes in neuronal activity/excitability that outlast the stimulation itself. Such aftereffects are at the heart of the offline TMS protocols in cognitive neuroscience and neurotherapeutics. However, whether these aftereffects are of applied interest critically depends on their magnitude and duration, which should fall within an experimentally or clinically useful range without increasing risks and adverse effects. In this short review, we survey combined TMS-EEG studies to characterize the TMS-aftereffects as revealed by EEG to contribute to the characterization of the most effective and promising repetitive TMS-parameters. With one session of conventional repetitive TMS (of fixed pulse frequency), aftereffects were consistently comparable in magnitude to EEG-changes reported after learning or with fatigue, and were short-lived (< 70 min). The few studies using recently developed protocols (such as theta burst stimulation) suggest comparable effect-size but longer effect-durations. Based on the reviewed data, it is expected that TMS-efficacy can be further promoted by repeating TMS-sessions, by using EEG-gated TMS to tailor TMS to current neuronal state, or by other, non-conventional TMS-protocols. Newly emerging developments in offline TMS research for cognitive neuroscience and neurotherapeutics are outlined.

Event-related potentials reveal an early advantage for luminance contours in the processing of objects	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						visual object representation; line drawings; luminance; color; EEG; ERP	FIGURE-GROUND ORGANIZATION; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; COLOR; ORIENTATION; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY	Detection and identification of objects are the most crucial goals of visual perception. We studied the role of luminance and chromatic information for object processing by comparing performance of familiar, meaningful object contours with those of novel, non-object contours. Comparisons were made between full-color and reduced-color object (or non-object) contours. Full-color stimuli contained both chromatic and luminance information, whereas luminance information was absent in the reduced-color stimuli. All stimuli were made equally salient by fixing them at multiples of discrimination threshold contrast. In a subsequent electroencephalographic experiment observers were asked to classify contours as objects or non-objects. An advantage in accuracy was found for full-color stimuli over the reduced-color stimuli but only if the contours depicted objects as opposed to non-objects. Event-related potentials revealed the neural correlate of this object-specific luminance advantage. The amplitude of the centro-occipital N1 component was modulated by stimulus class with the effect being driven by the presence of luminance information. We conclude that high-level discrimination processes in the cortex start relatively early and exhibit object-selective effects only in the presence of luminance information. This is consistent with the superiority of luminance in subserving object identification processes.

J	de Geus, EJC				de Geus, Eco J. C.			From genotype to EEG endophenotype: a route for post-genomic understanding of complex psychiatric disease?	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Article								Twin and family studies have shown the importance of biological variation in psychiatric disorders. Heritability estimates vary from 50% to 80% for cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, and from 40% to 65% for affective disorders, such as major depression, anxiety disorders and substance abuse. Pinpointing the actual genetic variants responsible for this heritability has proven difficult, even in the recent wave of genome-wide association studies. Brain endophenotypes derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have been proposed as a way to support gene-finding efforts. A variety of EEG and event-related-potential endophenotypes are linked to psychiatric disorders, and twin studies have shown a striking genetic contribution to these endophenotypes. However, the clear need for very large sample sizes strongly limits the usefulness of EEG endophenotypes in gene-finding studies. They require extended laboratory recordings with sophisticated and expensive equipment that are not amenable to epidemiology-scaled samples. Instead, EEG endophenotypes are far more promising as tools to make sense of candidate genetic variants that derive from association studies; existing clinical data from patients or questionnaire-based assessment of psychiatric symptoms in the population at large are better suited for the association studies themselves. EEG endophenotypes can help us understand where in the brain, in which stage and during what type of information processing these genetic variants have a role. Such testing can be done in the more modest samples that are feasible for EEG research. With increased understanding of how genes affect the brain, combinations of genetic risk scores and brain endophenotypes may become part of the future classification of psychiatric disorders.

An ERP study of conflict monitoring in 4-8-year old children: Associations with temperament	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; N2; Conflict monitoring; Temperament; Development	ANTERIOR CINGULATE FUNCTION; EMOTION REGULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; AVERAGE REFERENCE; ATTENTION; ANXIETY; INHIBITION; THREAT; CHILDHOOD	Although there is great interest in identifying the neural correlates of cognitive processes that create risk for psychopathology, there is a paucity of research in young children. One event-related potential (ERP), the N2, is thought to index conflict monitoring and has been linked cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. Most of this research, however, has been conducted with adults, adolescents, and older children, but not with younger children. To address this gap, the current study examined 26 4-8-year-olds, who completed a cued flanker task while EEG was continuously recorded. We assessed whether the N2 was detectable in this group of young children and examined associations between the N2 and factors reflecting affective risk (e.g., reduced executive attention, temperamental effortful control, and temperamental surgency). We documented an N2 effect (greater N2 amplitude to incongruent versus congruent flankers), but only in children older than 6 years of age. Increases in the N2 effect were associated with less efficient executive attention and lower temperamental effortful control. We discuss the implications of these findings and consider how they may inform future studies on biomarkers for cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In unimodal conditions, sensory processing demands were altered with subjects performing movement to a small or large visual target, or with a small or large weight to modify proprioception. In bimodal conditions, both weight and targets needed to be met. We assessed activity over primary sensorimotor, premotor and parietal areas before and during knee movements. In unimodal conditions, the primary sensorimotor area showed the least sensitivity to the maximally increased sensory demand in both vision and proprioception, while the premotor region was most sensitive to proprioceptive demands, and the parietal region showed greatest sensitivity to visual demands. In bimodal conditions, intermediate levels of sensory processing demand maximally increased activation at premotor and parietal regions. However, when visual and proprioceptive demands were both maximal, activation decreased and was similar to that seen with the lowest level of sensory processing demand. As behavior was consistent across conditions while activation at these regions decreased, we suggest that additional brain areas, possibly high order cognitive and attentional regions, may be required to augment the function of the traditional sensorimotor network in lower extremity movements with increasingly difficult sensory processing demands.

Event-related potential responses to metric violations: rules versus meaning	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory processing; event-related potentials; meter; N400; negativity; speech rhythm	SPEECH; SEGMENTATION; SEQUENCES; ACCENTS; STRESS; FRENCH; RHYTHM; WORDS; MUSIC; METER	In stress-timed languages, the alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables (or 'meter') is an important formal and temporal cue to guide speech processing. Previous electroencephalography studies have shown that metric violations result in an early negative event-related potential. It is unclear whether this 'metric' negativity is an N400 elicited by misplaced stress or whether it responds to error detection. The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of the 'metric' negativity as a function of rule-based, predictive sequencing. Our results show that the negativity occurs independent of the lexical-semantic content. We therefore suggest that the metric negativity reflects a rule-based sequencing mechanism.

Error processing is a specific cognitive function crucial for behavioral adaptation. Neurophysiologically, these processes are reflected by an event-related potential (ERP), the error negativity (Ne/ERN). Even though synchronization processes are important in information processing, its role and neurobiological foundation in behavioral adaptation are not understood. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) strongly modulates the establishment of neural connectivity that determines neural network dynamics and synchronization properties. Therefore altered synchronization processes may constitute a mechanism via which BDNF affects processes of error-induced behavioral adaptation. We investigate how variants of the BDNF gene regulate EEG-synchronization processes underlying error processing. Subjects (n = 65) were genotyped for the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265). We show that Val/Val genotype is associated with stronger error-specific phase-locking, compared with Met allele carriers. Posterror behavioral adaptation seems to be strongly dependent on these phase-locking processes and efficacy of EEG-phase-locking-behavioral coupling was genotype dependent. After correct responses, neurophysiological processes were not modulated by the polymorphism, underlining that BDNF becomes especially necessary in situations requiring behavioral adaptation. The results suggest that alterations in neural synchronization processes modulated by the genetic variants of BDNF Val66Met may be the mechanism by which cognitive functions are affected.

The specificity of deficits in neural specialization remains unclear, and alternative theories suggest generalized processing difficulties. The current study contrasted neural specialization for social information versus nonsocial information in 36 individuals with autism and 18 typically developing individuals matched for age, race, sex, handedness, and cognitive ability. Event-related potentials elicited by faces, inverted faces, houses, letters, and pseudoletters were recorded. Groups were compared on an electrophysiological marker of neural specialization (N170), as well as behavioral performance on standardized measures of face recognition and word reading/decoding. Consistent with prior results, individuals with autism displayed slowed face processing and decreased sensitivity to face inversion; however, they showed comparable brain responses to letters, which were associated with behavioral performance in both groups. Results suggest that individuals with autism display atypical neural specialization for social information but intact specialization for nonsocial information. Findings concord with the notion of specific dysfunction in social brain systems rather than nonspecific information-processing difficulties in autism.

Sensor measurements are often highly correlated and signal-to-noise ratio is not homogeneously spread across sensors. Thus, collected data are highly variable and discrimination tasks are challenging. In this work, we focus on sensor weighting as an efficient tool to improve the classification procedure. We present an approach integrating sensor weighting in the classification framework. Sensor weights are considered as hyper-parameters to be learned by a support vector machine (SVM). The resulting sensor weighting SVM (sw-SVM) is designed to satisfy a margin criterion, that is, the generalization error. Experimental studies on two data sets are presented, a P300 data set and an error-related potential (ErrP) data set. For the P300 data set (BCI competition III), for which a large number of trials is available, the sw-SVM proves to perform equivalently with respect to the ensemble SVM strategy that won the competition. For the ErrP data set, for which a small number of trials are available, the sw-SVM shows superior performances as compared to three state-of-the art approaches. Results suggest that the sw-SVM promises to be useful in event-related potentials classification, even with a small number of training trials.

Forty participants were assigned to either a TSD or a control group (no sleep deprivation; NSD group) and both groups were tested at 2:00am on day 3 (after 43 hours of sleep deprivation for the TSD group). Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken using 32 electrodes while a Go/No go task was administered. The amplitude of the N2 was significantly larger on the No-go trials as compared to the Go trials. In the No-go trials, the amplitudes of the No go-N2 and the No go-P3 were smaller in the TSD group than in the control group in terms of prolonged latencies. The mean correct reaction time, number of misses, and the false-alarm rate were also significantly longer and increased in the NSD group. Results indicated that executive control functions were noticeable impaired after 43 hours of sleep deprivation.

The effects of electrode impedance on data quality and statistical significance in ERP recordings	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electrode impedance; Signal-to-noise ratio; Skin potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GEODESIC SENSOR NET; SKIN	To determine whether data quality is meaningfully reduced by high electrode impedance, EEG was recorded simultaneously from low- and high-impedance electrode sites during an oddball task. Low-frequency noise was found to be increased at high-impedance sites relative to low-impedance sites, especially when the recording environment was warm and humid. The increased noise at the high-impedance sites caused an increase in the number of trials needed to obtain statistical significance in analyses of P3 amplitude, but this could be partially mitigated by high-pass filtering and artifact rejection. High electrode impedance did not reduce statistical power for the N1 wave unless the recording environment was warm and humid. Thus, high electrode impedance may increase noise and decrease statistical power under some conditions, but these effects can be reduced by using a cool and dry recording environment and appropriate signal processing methods.

Masked targets trigger event-related potentials indexing shifts of attention but not error detection	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Unconscious processes; EEG; ERP; Normal volunteers	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VISUAL-SEARCH; ANTISACCADE TASK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; AWARENESS; NEGATIVITY; PERCEPTION	To carry out tasks with the highest possible efficiency we have developed executive mechanisms that monitor task performance and optimize cognitive processing. It has been hypothesized that these executive mechanisms operate even without conscious awareness to maximize their sensitivity to task-relevant outcomes. To test this hypothesis the present study examined the error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index of the performance-monitoring neural circuitry, during masked visual search. The findings show that representations of target objects that are processed perceptually, but not to the level of awareness, fail to elicit an ERN despite the ability of these targets to elicit a shift of attention. These findings indicate that the performance-monitoring mechanism indexed by the ERN requires target information to be processed to the level of awareness for a mismatch between stimulus and response to be detected.

We examined the context-sensitive N400 component evoked by the second of two target words embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation under conditions that involved either a task-set switch or no switching. Whereas the N400 was unaffected by the lag separating the targets in the absence of switching, it was delayed and attenuated in the switch condition when the targets were adjacent in the sequence. These findings indicate that task-set reconfiguration temporarily prevents semantic activation and provide evidence for the nonautomaticity of semantic processing of words.

Conversion rates to dementia are greater in multi-than in single-domain aMCI, but it remains unclear whether md-aMCI is a mere progression of sd-aMCI or represents a distinct clinical entity. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an easily accessible modality particularly powerful to investigate the functional activation of neocortical circuits. Sensitive attention-and working memory-related EEG indices have been identified in MCI, providing valuable insight on the underlying cerebral alterations. The present study examined the patterns of EEG activity during the encoding and retrieval phases of working memory in md-and sd-aMCI, with the purpose to identify early differences in neural activation between the two subtypes. Continuous EEG was recorded in 43 aMCI patients, whose 16 sd-aMCI and 27 md-aMCI, and 36 age-matched controls (EC) during delayed match-to-sample tasks for face and letter stimuli. At encoding, attended stimuli elicited parietal alpha (8-12 Hz) power decrease (desynchronization), whereas distracting stimuli were associated with alpha power increase (synchronization) over right central sites. No difference was observed in parietal alpha desynchronization among the three groups, suggesting similar attention-related activation of cortical circuits. For attended faces, the alpha synchronization underlying suppression of distracting letters was reduced in both aMCI subgroups, but more severely in md-aMCI cases that differed significantly from EC. At retrieval, the early N250r recognition effect was significantly reduced for faces in md-aMCI as compared to both sd-aMCI and EC. The results suggest the differential alteration of working memory cerebral processes for faces in the two aMCI subtypes. Whereas a progressive impairment of the cerebral activity related to distracter suppression at encoding is already present in sd-aMCI, md-aMCI is characterized by a specific deterioration of face covert recognition process at retrieval.

Integration of EEG source imaging and fMRI during continuous viewing of natural movies	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Source localization; Natural scenes	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN VISUAL AREAS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TARGET DETECTION; SPIKING ACTIVITY; BRAIN; CORTEX; ARTIFACTS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are noninvasive neuroimaging tools which can be used to measure brain activity with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. By combining the neural and hemodynamic recordings from these modalities, we can gain better insight into how and where the brain processes complex stimuli, which may be especially useful in patients with different neural diseases. However, due to their vastly different spatial and temporal resolutions, the integration of EEG and fMRI recordings is not always straightforward. One fundamental obstacle has been that paradigms used for EEG experiments usually rely on event-related paradigms, while fMRI is not limited in this regard. Therefore, here we ask whether one can reliably localize stimulus-driven EEG activity using the continuously varying feature intensities occurring in natural movie stimuli presented over relatively long periods of time. Specifically, we asked whether stimulus-driven aspects in the EEG signal would be co-localized with the corresponding stimulus-driven BOLD signal during free viewing of a movie. Secondly, we wanted to integrate the EEG signal directly with the BOLD signal, by estimating the underlying impulse response function (IRF) that relates the BOLD signal to the underlying current density in the primary visual area (V1). We made sequential fMRI and 64-channel EEG recordings in seven subjects who passively watched 2-min-long segments of a James Bond movie. To analyze EEG data in this natural setting, we developed a method based on independent component analysis (ICA) to reject EEG artifacts due to blinks, subject movement, etc., in a way unbiased by human judgment. We then calculated the EEG source strength of this artifact-free data at each time point of the movie within the entire brain volume using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). This provided for every voxel in the brain (i.e., in 3D space) an estimate of the current density at every time point. We then carried out a correlation between the time series of visual contrast changes in the movie with that of EEG voxels. We found the most significant correlations in visual area V1, just as seen in previous fMRI studies (Bartels A, Zeki, S, Logothetis NK. Natural vision reveals regional specialization to local motion and to contrast-invariant, global flow in the human brain. Cereb Cortex 2008;18(3):705-717), but on the time scale of milliseconds rather than of seconds. To obtain an estimate of how the EEG signal relates to the BOLD signal, we calculated the IRF between the BOLD signal and the estimated current density in area VI. We found that this IRF was very similar to that observed using combined intracortical recordings and fMRI experiments in nonhuman primates. Taken together, these findings open a new approach to noninvasive mapping of the brain. It allows, firstly, the localization of feature-selective brain areas during natural viewing conditions with the temporal resolution of EEG. Secondly, it provides a tool to assess EEG/BOLD transfer functions during processing of more natural stimuli. This is especially useful in combined EEG/fMRI experiments, where one can now potentially study neural-hemodynamic relationships across the whole brain volume in a noninvasive manner.

Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses reported age-related deficits in the amplitude of an early positive-negative working memory (PNwm) component as well as changes in working memory (WM)-load related brain oscillations during the successful performance of the n-back task. To explore the age-related differences of EEG activation in the face of increasing WM demands, we assessed the PNwm component area, parietal alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) as well as frontal theta ERS in 32 young and 32 elderly healthy individuals who successfully performed a highly WM demanding 3-back task. PNwm area increased with higher memory loads (3- and 2-back > 0-back tasks) in younger subjects. Older subjects reached the maximal values for this EEG parameter during the less WM demanding 0-back task. They showed a rapid development of an alpha ERS that reached its maximal amplitude at around 800 ms after stimulus onset. In younger subjects, the late alpha ERS occurred between 1,200 and 2,000 ms and its amplitude was significantly higher compared with elders. Frontal theta ERS culmination peak decreased in a task-independent manner in older compared with younger cases. Only in younger individuals, there was a significant decrease in the phasic frontal theta ERS amplitude in the 2- and 3-back tasks compared with the detection and 0-back tasks. These observations suggest that older adults display a rapid mobilization of their neural generators within the parietal cortex to manage very low demanding WM tasks. Moreover, they are less able to activate frontal theta generators during attentional tasks compared with younger persons.

The event-related evoked potential provides a measure of neuronal electrical activity as it relates to a specific stimulus. Air-puff stimulation to the posterior pharyngeal wall produces a sensory-evoked potential (PSEP) waveform. The goal of this study was to characterize the scalp topography and morphology for the component peaks of the PSEP waveform. Twenty-five healthy men and women served as research participants. PSEPs were measured via a 32-electrode cap (10-20 system) connected to SynAmps2 Neuroscan EEG System. Air puffs were delivered directly to the oropharynx using a thin polyethylene tube connected to a flexible laryngoscope. The PSEP waveform is characterized by four early- and mid-latency component peaks: an early positivity (P1) and negativity (N1), followed by a mid-latency positivity (P2) and negativity (N2). The early positive peak P1 is localized bilaterally to the lateral parietal scalp, the N1 medially in the frontoparietal region, and the P2 and N2 with diffuse scalp locations. Somatosensory and premotor regions are possible anatomical correlates of peak locations. Based on the latencies of the peaks, they are likely analogous to somatosensory- and respiratory-related evoked potential peaks.

Planning and performing a complex movement (e.g., reaching and grasping) requires the coordination of muscles by electrical activity that can be recorded with scalp EEG from relevant regions of the cortex. Prior studies, utilizing motion capture and kinematic measures, have shown that an augmented reality feedback system for rehabilitation of stroke patients can help patients develop new motor plans and perform reaching tasks more accurately. Historically, traditional signal analysis techniques have been utilized to quantify changes in EEG when subjects perform common, simple movements. These techniques have included measures of event-related potentials in the time and frequency domains (e.g., energy and coherence measures). In this study, a more advanced, nonlinear, analysis technique, mutual information (MI), is applied to the EEG to capture the dynamics of functional connections between brain sites. In particular, the cortical activity that results from the planning and execution of novel reach trajectories by normal subjects in an augmented reality system was quantified by using statistically significant MI interactions between brain sites over time. The results show that, during the preparation for as well as the execution of a reach, the functional connectivity of the brain changes in a consistent manner over time, in terms of both the number and strength of cortical connections. A similar analysis of EEG from stroke patients may provide new insights into the functional deficiencies developed in the brain after stroke, and contribute to evaluation, and possibly the design, of novel therapeutic schemes within the framework of rehabilitation and BMI (brain machine interface).

To date, experienced utility is typically measured with subjective ratings. This study intended to quantify experienced utility by global levels of neuronal activity. Neuronal activity was measured by means of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to gain and omission of graded monetary rewards at the level of the EEG topography in human subjects. A novel analysis approach allowed approximating psychophysiological value functions for the experienced utility of monetary rewards. In addition, we identified the time windows of the event-related potentials (ERP) and the respective intracortical sources, in which variations in neuronal activity were significantly related to the value or valence of outcomes. Results indicate that value functions of experienced utility and regret disproportionally increase with monetary value, and thus contradict the compressing value functions of decision utility. The temporal pattern of outcome evaluation suggests an initial (similar to 250 ms) coarse evaluation regarding the valence, concurrent with a finer-grained evaluation of the value of gained rewards, whereas the evaluation of the value of omitted rewards emerges later. We hypothesize that this temporal double dissociation is explained by reward prediction errors. Finally, a late, yet unreported, reward-sensitive ERP topography (similar to 500 ms) was identified. The sources of these topographical covariations are estimated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal gyrus, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus/amygdala. The results provide important new evidence regarding "how," "when," and "where" the brain evaluates outcomes with different hedonic impact.

EEG provides non-invasive approaches for monitoring brain electrical activity to emotional stimuli. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, based on power shifts in specific frequency bands, has some potential as a method for differentiating responses to basic emotions as measured during brief presentations of affective stimuli. Although there appears to be fairly consistent theta ERS in frontal regions of the brain during the earliest phases of processing affective auditory stimuli, the patterns do not readily distinguish between specific emotions. To date it has not been possible to consistently differentiate brain responses to emotion-specific affective states or stimuli, and some evidence to suggests the theta ERS more likely measures general arousal processes rather than yielding veridical indices of specific emotional states. Perhaps cortical EEG patterns will never be able to be used to distinguish discrete emotional states from the surface of the brain. The implications and limitations of such approaches for understanding human emotions are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bekkedal, Marni Y.

Learning the correspondences between them is a crucial step in sight reading acquisition. This study was designed to investigate whether task-related processing of audio and visual features was independent or task-related processing in one modality might influence the processing of the other. The present study employed simultaneous audio-visual stimulus in the oddball paradigm to re-examine the effects of attention on audio, visual and audio-visual perception in the non-musician brain. Electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded from 28 normal participants. Participants were presented with pitch (auditory: A), picture (visual: V), and simultaneous pitch and picture (audio-visual: AV). The result showed that the Korean participants showed larger mean interaction amplitude and longer in time than the Chinese participants. This reveals that experience influences the early cortical automatic processing of pitch contour. These results suggest that efficient processing of associations between pictures and sounds relies on neural mechanisms similar to those naturally evolved for integrating audiovisual perception.

Auditory MMN is generated by the comparison process between sensory memory trace of a frequent auditory event and a deviant event. It is well known that frequent sounds are encoded in memory trace and processed as a single unit within 160-170 ms. This study examined whether deviant sound would be similarly processed as a temporal unit. Twelve healthy men were presented with relatively short standard sounds and relatively long deviant sounds that contained an omitted (i.e. silent) part. Three types of deviant sounds were designed to vary in duration. The MMN amplitude was gradually enhanced from the short to long duration deviant events that contained an omitted part. In contrast, MMN latency showed no significant differences among the deviants. These findings show that deviant sounds are also processed as a unitary event.

Frontal theta links prediction errors to behavioral adaptation in reinforcement learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						FRN; Reinforcement learning; Prediction error; Theta; Anterior cingulate	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING	Investigations into action monitoring have consistently detailed a frontocentral voltage deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) following the presentation of negatively valenced feedback, sometimes termed the feed back-related negativity (FRN). The FRN has been proposed to reflect a neural response to prediction errors during reinforcement learning, yet the single-trial relationship between neural activity and the quanta of expectation violation remains untested. Although ERP methods are not well suited to single-trial analyses, the FRN has been associated with theta band oscillatory perturbations in the medial prefrontal cortex. Mediofrontal theta oscillations have been previously associated with expectation violation and behavioral adaptation and are well suited to single-trial analysis. Here, we recorded EEG activity during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task and fit the performance data to an abstract computational model (Q-learning) for calculation of single-trial reward prediction errors. Single-trial theta oscillatory activities following feedback were investigated within the context of expectation (prediction error) and adaptation (subsequent reaction time change). Results indicate that interactive medial and lateral frontal theta activities reflect the degree of negative and positive reward prediction error in the service of behavioral adaptation. These different brain areas use prediction error calculations for different behavioral adaptations, with medial frontal theta reflecting the utilization of prediction errors for reaction time slowing (specifically following errors), but lateral frontal theta reflecting prediction errors leading to working memory-related reaction time speeding for the correct choice.

Moreover, the differential diagnosis with depression and chronic fatigue syndrome is difficult. EEG-related variables in 13 patients diagnosed with burnout syndrome were compared with 13 healthy comparison subjects in order to explore the existence of neurobiological markers for burnout. Burnout patients showed reduced P300 amplitude, a lower alpha peak frequency and reduced beta power. These EEG-related differences in burnout patients differ from those described in the literature in depression and chronic fatigue patients. Our preliminary findings suggest that burnout might be considered as a separate clinical syndrome.

TMS of the right angular gyrus modulates priming of pop-out in visual search: combined TMS-ERP evidence. J Neurophysiol 106: 3001-3009, 2011. First published August 31, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00121.2011.-During priming of pop-out, performance at discriminating a pop-out feature target in visual search is affected by whether the target on the previous trial was defined by the same feature as on the upcoming trial. Recent studies suggest that priming of pop-out relies on attentional processes. With the use of simultaneous, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and event-related potential recording (TMS-ERP), we tested for any critical role of the right angular gyrus (rANG) and left and right frontal eye fields (FEFs)-key attentional sites-in modulating both performance and the ERPs evoked by such visual events. Intertrial TMS trains were applied while participants discriminated the orientation of a color pop-out element in a visual search array. rANG TMS disrupted priming of pop-out, reducing reaction time costs on switch trials and speeding responses when the color of the pop-out target switched. rANG TMS caused a negativity in the ERP elicited in response to the visual stimulus array, starting 210 ms after stimulus onset. Both behavioral and ERP effects were apparent only after rANG TMS, on switch trials, and when the target in the visual search array was presented in the left visual field, with no effects after left or right FEF TMS. These results provide evidence for an attentional reorienting mechanism, which originates in the rANG and is modulated by the implicit memory of the previous trial. The rANG plays a causal role on switch trials during priming of pop-out by interacting with visual processing, particularly in the ipsilateral hemisphere representing the contralateral hemifield.

Neurophysiological distinction between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						schizophrenia; schizoaffective disorder; event-related potential; P300; EEG	CYCLOID PSYCHOSES; P300 AMPLITUDE; DUAL-TASK; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; TOPOGRAPHY; REDUCTION; DIAGNOSIS; VALIDITY; FEATURES	Schizoaffective disorder (SA) is distinguished from schizophrenia (SZ) based on the presence of prominent mood symptoms over the illness course. Despite this clinical distinction, SA and SZ patients are often combined in research studies, in part because data supporting a distinct pathophysiological boundary between the disorders are lacking. Indeed, few studies have addressed whether neurobiological abnormalities associated with SZ, such as the widely replicated reduction and delay of the P300 event-related potential (ERP), are also present in SA. Scalp EEG was acquired from patients with DSM-IV SA (n = 15) or SZ (n = 22), as well as healthy controls (HC; n = 22) to assess the P300 elicited by infrequent target (15%) and task-irrelevant distractor (15%) stimuli in separate auditory and visual "oddball" tasks. P300 amplitude was reduced and delayed in SZ, relative to HC, consistent with prior studies. These SZ abnormalities did not interact with stimulus type (target vs. task-irrelevant distractor) or modality (auditory vs. visual). Across sensory modality and stimulus type, SA patients exhibited normal P300 amplitudes (significantly larger than SZ patients and indistinguishable from HC). However, P300 latency and reaction time were both equivalently delayed in SZ and SA patients, relative to HC. P300 differences between SA and SZ patients could not be accounted for by variation in symptom severity, socio-economic status, education, or illness duration. Although both groups show similar deficits in processing speed, SA patients do not exhibit the P300 amplitude deficits evident in SZ, consistent with an underlying pathophysiological boundary between these disorders.

Subject's own name as a deviant produces a P3. With equiprobable stimuli, non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are smaller in response to subject's own name compared to other names or subject's own name backwards. However, little is known about replicability on a single-subject level. Seventeen healthy subjects were assessed in an own-name paradigm with equiprobable stimuli of subject's own name, another name, and subject's own name backwards. Event-related potentials and non-phase locked oscillations were analyzed with single-subject, non-parametric statistics. No consistent results were found either for ERPs or for the non-phase locked changes of oscillatory activities. Only 4 subjects showed a robust effect as expected, that is, a lower activity in the alpha-beta range to subject's own name compared to other conditions. Four subjects elicited a higher activity for subject's own name. Thus, analyzing the EEG reactivity in the own-name paradigm with equiprobable stimuli on a single-subject level yields a high variance between subjects. In future research, single-subject statistics should be applied for examining the validity of physiologic measurements in other paradigms and for examining the pattern of reactivity in patients.

However, little is known about brain processing of pain expressions in comparison with other affective facial expressions. The present experiment aimed to examine the effects of pain expression intensity on affective ratings and brain dynamics by recording electroencephalography (EEG) from 20 female healthy volunteers 18-24 years of age. Participants were asked to rate the affective characteristics of 144 stimuli depicting facial expressions of pain and anger with 3 level of intensities (high, mild, and low), as well as neutral faces. Results indicated that pain faces were judged as more unpleasant and arousing than anger and neutral faces for all intensity levels. EEG results further showed that facial expressions of pain elicited more enhanced amplitudes of the visual evoked potentials than anger and neutral faces in the latency between 350 and 550 milliseconds after stimulus onset; whereas anger faces elicited greater P200 amplitudes than pain and neutral faces. In addition, more increased theta activity in the latency of 200 to 400 milliseconds after stimulus onset was observed to high-intense as compared with low-intense facial expressions. These findings indicate that brain activity elicited by affective faces is modulated by the intensity of facial expressions and suggest the involvement of different brain mechanisms during the processing and recognition of facial expressions of pain and anger in healthy volunteers.

The basic assumption is that oscillatory phase synchronization plays an important role for process binding - the transient linking of different cognitive processes - which may be considered a special type of large scale communication. We investigate this question for memory processes on the basis of different types of oscillatory synchronization mechanisms. The reviewed findings suggest that theta and alpha phase coupling (and phase reorganization) reflect control processes in two large memory systems, a working memory and a complex knowledge system that comprises semantic long-term memory. It is suggested that alpha phase synchronization may be interpreted in terms of processes that coordinate top-down control (a process guided by expectancy to focus on relevant search areas) and access to memory traces (a process leading to the activation of a memory trace). An analogous interpretation is suggested for theta oscillations and the controlled access to episodic memories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the electrophysiological bases of how subjects respond to uncertain cues, and how such cues affect subsequent outcome evaluations have rarely been explored. In the present study, participants completed a gambling task while their neural activities were recorded through electroencephalography. The results indicated that subjects were sensitive to the uncertain cue as represented by feedback-related negativity (FRN). This uncertain cue further enhanced the neural response to outcome evaluation represented by P200, FRN, and P300 temporally. The enhanced P200 outcome may reflect the negative bias of the emotional reaction, which is a reflection of uncertain deviation at an early stage. The discrepancies of differentiated feedback-related negativity between uncertain and certain condition indicated increased motivation or prediction error toward the outcome. Finally, the increased P300 amplitude under uncertain outcome compared with certain one, as well as its sensitivity to the valence of the outcome under uncertain condition, embodies the increased arousal of the affective response. Therefore, uncertain cue effects observed in the current study suggest that uncertainty induces a larger motivational/affective and expectation response toward outcome revelation.

Anaphoric reference to quantified antecedents: An event-related brain potential study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Language comprehension; N400; Pronoun resolution; Quantifiers; Optimality theory; Supposition-denial theory	NEURAL MECHANISMS; LANGUAGE; INTEGRATION; DISCOURSE; PRONOUN; EXPRESSIONS; PERSPECTIVE; OPTIMALITY; SENTENCES; FOCUS	We report an event-related brain potential (ERP) study examining how readers process sentences containing anaphoric reference to quantified antecedents. Previous studies indicate that positive (e.g. many) and negative (e.g. not many) quantifiers cause readers to focus on different sets of entities. For example in Many of the fans attended the game, focus is on the fans who attended (the reference set), and subsequent pronominal reference to this set, as in, Their presence was a boost to the team, is facilitated. In contrast, if many is replaced by not many, focus shifts to the fans who did not attend (the complement set), and reference to this set, as in. Their absence was disappointing, is preferred. In the current studies, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants read positive or negative quantified statements followed by anaphoric reference to the reference set or complement set. Results showed that the pronoun their elicited a larger N400 following negative than positive quantifiers. There was also a larger N400 on the disambiguating word (presence/absence) for complement set reference following a positive quantifier, and for reference set reference following a negative quantifier. Findings are discussed in relation to theoretical accounts of complement anaphora. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such single trial detection requires a robust response that can be detected in a variety task conditions. Here, we investigated the influence of target probability, a key factor known to influence the amplitude of the evoked response, on single trial target classification in a difficult rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Our classification approach for detecting target vs. non target responses, considers spatial filters obtained through the maximization of the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, and then uses the resulting information as inputs to a Bayesian discriminant analysis. The method is evaluated across eight healthy subjects, on four probability conditions (P=0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50). We show that the target probability has a statistically significant effect on both the behavioral performance and the target detection. The best mean area under the ROC curve is achieved with P=0.10, AUC=0.82. These results suggest that optimal performance of ERP detection in RSVP tasks is critically dependent on target probability.

Patients typically are fully conscious. Here we tested the hypothesis that electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms are abnormal in LIS patients, possibly due to an impaired neural synchronization between brainstem and cerebral cortex. Methods: Resting state eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 13 LIS subjects and 15 cognitively normal control subjects. With reference to the individual alpha frequency (IAF), the bands of interest were delta (IAF-8 to IAF-6 Hz), theta (IAF-6 to IAF-4 Hz), alpha 1 (IAF-4 to IAF-2 Hz), alpha 2 (IAF-2 to IAF Hz), and alpha 3 (IAF to IAF + 2 Hz). Furthermore, beta 1 (13-20 Hz) and beta 2 (20-30 Hz) bands were also considered. Cortical EEG sources were estimated by low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: The power of alpha 2 and alpha 3 sources in all regions was lower in patients with LIS compared to controls. The power of delta sources in central, parietal, occipital and temporal regions was higher in patients with LIS compared to controls. Conclusions: These results suggest that cortical sources of resting state eyes-closed alpha and delta rhythms are abnormal in LIS patients. Significance: LIS is accompanied by a functional impairment of cortical neuronal synchronization mechanisms in the resting state condition.

In this line, here we tested the hypothesis of reduced attention cortical responses in underweight subjects. Methods: EEG data were recorded in 16 normal-weight and 16 underweight subjects during an "oddball" paradigm. The subjects were given frequent (70%) and rare (30%) stimuli depicting faces (FACE), food (FOOD), and landscapes (CONTROL), and clicked the mouse after the rare stimuli. These stimuli depicted the same frequent stimuli graphically dilated by 25% along the horizontal axis. Cortical attention responses were probed by the difference between positive event-related potentials peaking around 400-500 ms post-stimulus for the rare minus frequent stimuli (P300). Low resolution electromagnetic source tomography (LORETA) estimated P300 sources. Results: In the FACE condition, the amplitude of prefrontal (Brodmann area: BA10 and BA11) and tempoparietal (BA19, BA20, BA21, BA22, BA36, BA37, BA39, BA40) sources was lower in the underweight than normal-weight subjects. Conclusions: These results suggest that anterior-posterior cortical attention processes to face images declined in underweight subjects. Significance: The present study motivates future research evaluating if this mechanism is related to a poor judgment about body shape. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

On the basis of their spatiotemporal characteristics, delta BROs have been proposed as being involved in an automatic mechanism of maintaining awareness in a visuo-spatial context. The aim of the present study was: a) to investigate whether spontaneous blinking was also able to modulate alpha oscillations and, if so, b) whether this modulation was consistent with delta BROs, in order c) to acquire additional information for a better understanding of the cognitive phenomena underlying blinking. Using a broadband (0.5-100 Hz) continuous wavelet transform (CWT), we analysed a total of 189 three-second EEG epochs time-locked to the blinks of seven healthy volunteers. The EEG signals were submitted both to band-pass filtered cross-trial averaging (to obtain frequency-specific BROs) and to alpha event-related synchronization/desynchronization (i.e., blink-related synchronization/desynchronization, BRS/BRD). The alpha oscillations showed: a) an early BRS; b) a BRD in the same temporal window of the delta BROs and, c) a late BRS. We postulate that: a) the early BRS represents the short-term memory maintenance of the last visually perceived trace of the surroundings; b) the alpha BRD is associated with the comparison between the newly perceived image of the environment and its mnestic representation, and, lastly, c) the late BRS is connected with neuronal recovery phenomena.

EEG was recorded from 64 electrodes and 9 closely spaced electrodes overlaying the left and right sensorimotor area were analyzed. The subjects performed 40 fast and 40 slow (paced by metronome) movement and motor imagery of six tasks that involved three limbs (left and right index fingers and right toes) at first-person perspective. In addition, the subjects also performed motor imagery involved left and right arms and feet at third-person perspective. Based on brain processing mainly involved with the slow potentials during periodic movement and motor imagery, event-related potentials were low-pass filtered with 2 Hz cut-off frequency (24dB/oct). At C1, Cz, and C2, fast movement-related potentials had a larger positive slow potentials tendency than slow movement-related potentials 1.5 s after movement onset. In contrast to movement, slow motor imagery-related potentials had a larger positive slow potentials tendency than fast motor imagery-related potentials 1.75 s after motor imagery onset at these electrodes. Time delays reaching positive peak and rebound rate after peak were also explored. These results may be very important for further exploring relationship between speed and EEG activity during periodic movement and motor imagery. The study may provide a strategy to realize fine control of robots by brain-controlled robot interface. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies investigating the effects of top-down factors on stimulus encoding revealed similar modulation of late ERPs and alpha-band desynchronization (alpha-ERD) by relevant target stimuli. Focusing on the bottom-up effects of emotional content and picture size, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship of the late positive potential (LPP) and alpha-ERD during the viewing of emotional pictures. Results showed similar affective modulation by picture arousal of the LPP and alpha-ERD. Moreover, picture size reduction diminished overall magnitude of both responses, but did not dampen affective modulation of either response. These results suggest that, during affective picture viewing, these two brain responses similarly reflect the engagement of motivational systems in order to facilitate perception.

In Experiment 1, we measured startle response modulation while study participants ate ice cream, yoghurt, and chocolate. Statistical analysis revealed that ice cream intake resulted in the most robust startle inhibition compared to no food. Contrasting females and males, we found significant differences related to the conditions yoghurt and chocolate. In females, chocolate elicited the lowest response amplitude followed by yoghurt and ice cream. In males, chocolate produced the highest startle response amplitude even higher than eating nothing, whereas ice cream produced the lowest. Assuming that high response amplitudes reflect aversive motivation while low response amplitudes reflect appetitive motivational states, it is interpreted that eating ice cream is associated with the most appetitive state given the alternatives of chocolate and yoghurt across gender. However, in females alone eating chocolate, and in males alone eating ice cream, led to the most appetitive state. Experiment 2 was conducted to describe food intake-related brain activity by means of source localization analysis applied to electroencephalography data (EEG). Ice cream, yoghurt, a soft drink, and water were compared. Brain activity in rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus was found in all conditions. No localization differences between conditions occurred. While EEG was found to be insensitive, startle response modulation seems to be a reliable method to objectively quantify motivational states related to the intake of different foods.

Second-Order Bilinear Discriminant Analysis	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						regularization; classification; bilinear decomposition; neural signals; brain computer interface	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; TASK-DIFFICULTY; CLASSIFICATION	Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classification of electro-encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase-locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classification, that is, event related potentials; and second-order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, that is, event related (de)synchronization. The process of deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is driven by assumptions regarding the underlying neural generators. Here we propose a method that provides an unified framework for the analysis of EEG, combining first and second-order spatial and temporal features based on a bilinear model. Evaluation of the proposed method on simulated data shows that the technique outperforms state-of-the art techniques for single-trial classification for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. Evaluations on human EEG-including one benchmark data set from the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition-show statistically significant gains in classification accuracy, with a reduction in overall classification error from 26%-28% to 19%.

Methods: We recorded EEGs from 19 scalp electrodes in 11 adolescent boys with ADHD and 12 age-matched healthy boys while the subjects were at rest and during a continuous performance test (CPT). The approximate entropy (ApEn), a non-linear information-theoretic measure, was calculated to quantify the complexity of the EEGs. Results: The mean ApEn of the ADHD patients was significantly lower than the healthy subjects over the right frontal regions (Fp2 and F8) during the performance of the cognitive task, but not at rest. The spectral analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in the P3 and T4 regions at rest and the Fp2 and F8 regions during task performance. Conclusions: The differences in EEG complexity between the two groups suggest that cortical information processing is altered in ADHD adolescents, and thus their levels of cortical activation may be insufficient to meet the cognitive requirements of attention-demanding tasks. Significance: This study suggests that a non-linear measure such as ApEn is useful for investigating neural dysfunctions in adolescents with ADHD.

J	Praamstra, P; Kourtis, D				Praamstra, Peter; Kourtis, Dimitrios			An early parietal ERP component of the frontoparietal system: EDAN not equal N2pc	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Motor cortex; Parietal cortex; Movement preparation; Spatial attention	SPATIAL ATTENTION; RESPONSE PREPARATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREPARATORY STATES; VISUAL-SEARCH; MOTOR; SHIFTS; MECHANISMS; MOVEMENTS; EEG	Directing spatial attention or manual response selection by means of arrow cues elicits a characteristic sequence of lateralized ERP components. Van Velzen and Eimer (2003) proposed that one of these components, the EDAN (early directing-attention negativity) is not related to the control of spatial attention but is instead an N2pc in disguise, related to the visual processing of arrow cues. While this proposal seems widely accepted, it has never been evaluated whether the hitherto not well-determined scalp distribution of the EDAN matches the well-established scalp distribution of the N2pc. This paper reviews evidence from earlier published work supporting a parietal distribution of the EDAN. This strongly argues against the proposed identification with the N2pc. The EDAN may instead reflect early parietal activity within the frontoparietal network, preceding the frontal activation represented in the anterior directing-attention negativity (ADAN).

It has been argued lithe frontal, N1a, is the early part of the occipito-temporal, N1b, or there are two different waves. It is also not clear whether the N1 of distractor is equivalent to the target N1, neither to distinguish these four waves has some functional value. Patients and methods. We performed a principal component analysis of latencies and amplitudes of N1 derived from an oddball visual paradigm in a sample of 82 persons with intellectual disability, and factor scores were correlated with measures of intellectual performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition. Results and conclusions. There is not significant dependency between N1a and N1b waves. The N1 from the target stimulus is functionally different to the N1 from the distractor. The N1a 'target' is related to the perceptual reasoning while the N1a 'distractor' is related to the working memory. The correlation between latencies and amplitudes of the target stimuli in posterior locations suggests that, similar to as observed in auditory areas, there is a visual synchronization with the prefrontal cortex; its dysfunction may explain some of the perceptual problems of people with intellectual disabilities.

This monitoring process is thought to be reflected by the P600 component in the EEG. The present study further investigated this monitoring process by comparing syntactic and spelling violations in an EEG and an fMRI experiment. To assess the effect of conflict strength, misspellings were embedded in sentences that were weakly or strongly predictive of a critical word. In support of the monitoring theory, syntactic and spelling violations elicited similarly distributed P600 effects. Furthermore, the P600 effect was larger to misspellings in the strongly compared to the weakly predictive sentences. The fMRI results showed that both syntactic and spelling violations increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyms (IIFG), while only the misspellings activated additional areas. Conflict strength did not affect the hemodynamic response to spelling violations. These results extend the idea that the IIFG is involved in implementing cognitive control in the presence of representational conflicts in general to the processing of errors in language perception.

Voluntary selection processes are associated with increased neural activity, especially in medial and lateral frontal brain regions as well as the inferior parietal gyrus. However, the precise function of each brain region as well as the spatiotemporal characteristic of the brain regions involved is not yet clear. The aim of the present study was to disentangle distinct aspects of voluntary selection and their underlying neural processes. Hence, event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional MRI data were acquired simultaneously. Brain regions modulated by the task-induced amplitude variation of ERPs (N2, P3) were identified. The results showed N2-related hemodynamic responses, especially in medial and lateral frontal brain regions. Among other things, medial frontal brain regions are related to conflict monitoring, control of voluntary action and decision making. By contrast, the P3-amplitude proved to be predominantly related to increased BOLD responses in the temporo-parietal junction and lateral frontal brain regions. These brain regions are thought to play a decisive role in an attentional network involved in detecting auditory and visual stimuli. Overall, the results of the study indicated a whole network of brain regions to be associated with voluntary selection processes. In addition, at least some frontal brain regions seemed to be involved at an earlier stage than temporo-parietal regions, probably indicating a top-down process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hattori, M; Onoda, K; Sakata, S				Hattori, Minoru; Onoda, Keiichi; Sakata, Shogo			Identification of rat P3-like processes in the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Rat; Event-related potential; P3-like; Anterior cingulate cortex; Hippocampus; Attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULUS PARAMETERS; TASK; ATTENTION; P300; P3A; EEG	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the rat P3-like potential reflects "attention processes" rather than "arousal level". After controlling for arousal levels, event-related potentials (ERPs) of the rat were recorded at the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal CA1 during active and passive oddball paradigms. The arousal level of the passive group was equivalent to that of the active group, while the amplitude of the P3-like potential during the active paradigm was greater than that during the passive paradigm for both sites. These results provide evidence that the rat P3-like component reflects "attention processes", which is also the case for the human P3 component. Rats can provide a useful model for investigation of the neural mechanisms of the P3 in humans. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Individualized EEG source reconstruction of Stroop interference with masked color words	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stroop; Backward masking; Cingulate cortex; ACC	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; VISUAL AWARENESS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; FRONTAL-CORTEX; TASK; MASKING; VISIBILITY; ATTENTION	A masked version of the classic color Stroop task was used to study interference effects with stimuli of variable visibility. Pattern masks with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) reduced the visibility in three steps. We took EEG recordings to measure neural correlates of Stroop interference and their relation to stimulus visibility. The analysis of event-related potentials indicated that N400 differences between congruent and incongruent trials varied with the degree of visibility, leaving no differences with stimuli near identification threshold. An equivalent current dipole model (ECD) was used to map source activity onto regions known to reflect interference-related activity. As expected, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) signaled the biggest differences between congruent and incongruent trials. As with event-related potentials, these differences disappeared with reduced stimulus visibility. In addition to equivalent current dipole modeling, Stroop-related neural sources were confirmed by means of current density reconstruction (SWARM) based on individualized boundary element models (BEMs) and a cortical constraint.

In the experiment, the subject started the reaching movement of the index finger with the go-signal of a green LED and stopped the ongoing movement with the stop-signal of a red LED. The stop-signal delay (SSD) was set at 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 ms. The movement trajectory was measured during the task. The index finger was able to stop prior to the target point when SSD was less than 400 ms, whereas not when SSD was 400 ms. We also measured electroencephalogram ( EEG) during the task. A negative peak around the stop-signal response time (SSRT) and a positive peak around 400-600 ms of the event-related potentials (ERPs) were observed at Fz and Cz. These results indicate that these components of the ERPs were associated with the stop-signal task in the human reaching movement.

Under certain conditions, impairment can be ameliorated by invoking compensatory processes. To identify electrophysiological mechanisms of such compensation that would be required to resolve response conflict. 14 abstinent alcoholic men and 14 similarly aged control men performed a variation of the Eriksen flanker task during an electroencephalography (EEG) recording to examine whether alcoholics could achieve and maintain control-level performance and whether EEG markers could identify evidence for the action of compensatory processes in the alcoholics. Monitoring processes engaged following a response were indexed by the correct related negativity (CRN) and error related negativity (ERN), two medial-frontal negative event-related potentials. The alcoholics were able to perform at control levels on accuracy and reaction time (RT). Alcoholics generated larger ERN amplitudes following incorrect responses and larger CRNs following correct responses than controls. Both groups showed evidence of post-error slowing. Larger CRN amplitudes in the alcoholics were related to longer RTs. Also observed in the alcoholics was an association between smaller CRN amplitudes and length of sobriety, suggesting a normalization of monitoring activity with extended abstinence. To the extent that greater amplitude of these electrophysiological markers of performance monitoring indexes greater resource allocation and performance compensation, the larger amplitudes observed in the alcoholic than control group support the view that elevated performance monitoring enables abstinent alcoholics to overcome response conflict, as was evident in their control-level performance.

J	Winkler, I; Haufe, S; Tangermann, M				Winkler, Irene; Haufe, Stefan; Tangermann, Michael			Automatic Classification of Artifactual ICA-Components for Artifact Removal in EEG Signals	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							OCULAR ARTIFACT; BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION; SLEEP; EMG	Background: Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both, the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis (e. g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) or for Mental State Monitoring). While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. Methods: We propose an automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel setups and from new subjects. Results: Based on six features only, the optimized linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement (<10% Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15% MSE. On data of the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60% of the most artifactual source components. Conclusions: We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye-and muscle artifacts. Its performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG studies.

J	Balconi, M; Amenta, S				Balconi, Michela; Amenta, Simona			"A fighter is a lion". Neuropsychological indexes in comprehending frozen metaphors	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Metaphor; Figurative language; Event-related potentials; Response time	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; IDIOM COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; ERP; CONTEXT	This paper considers the cognitive and linguistic processes underlying the comprehension of frozen metaphors, by analyzing both neuropsychological and behavioral data. In order to explore the dichotomy between the pragmatic models (i.e. the metaphor as a semantic anomaly) and the direct comprehension view (the metaphor as a "standard" meaning) on the one hand, and between an iconic (more imagery-based) vs. not iconic (linguistic) representational modality on the other hand, the paper analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) and the behavioral data (response time) of subjects submitted to verbal stimuli. 36 participants were required to comprehend metaphoric and literal sentences, half congruous (semantically not anomalous) and half uncongruous (semantically anomalous). The morphological analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) profile allowed to observe two negative deflections (the N3-N4 complex), differently distributed on the scalp surface. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to peak amplitude and latency variables underlined the different role of these deflections in metaphoric decoding. That is, the N4 effect appears to detect the presence of a semantic anomaly of the utterance (uncongruous condition) more localized on the posterior (Pz) area, but not sensitive to the metaphoric/literal content of the stimulus. On the contrary, N3 effect shows an ampler negativity for the metaphoric decoding, increased on the occipital area, likely a marker of a specific iconic representational format. Thus, though not equivalent, the two comprehension processes are not differentiated as a function of the way of the meaning access (direct or indirect), nor for their cognitive complexity (no response time variation) but for the typology of the representational format, more imagery-based for metaphoric stimuli, as it was showed by an increased N3 on the occipital visual area.

The electrophysiological time course of the interaction of stimulus conflict and the multisensory spread of attention	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; EEG; ERP; visual	AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; RESPONSE CONFLICT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTERFERENCE; TASK; NEGATIVITY; MODULATION; OBJECT; CORTEX	Previously, we have shown that spatial attention to a visual stimulus can spread across both space and modality to a synchronously presented but task-irrelevant sound arising from a different location, reflected by a late-onsetting, sustained, negative-polarity event-related potential (ERP) wave over frontal-central scalp sites, probably originating in part from the auditory cortices. Here we explore the influence of cross-modal conflict on the amplitude and temporal dynamics of this multisensory spreading-of-attention activity. Subjects attended selectively to one of two concurrently presented lateral visually-presented letter streams to perform a sequential comparison task, while ignoring task-irrelevant, centrally presented spoken letters that could occur synchronously with either the attended or unattended lateral visual letters and could be either congruent or incongruent with them. Extracted auditory ERPs revealed that, collapsed across congruency conditions, attentional spreading across modalities started at approximately 220 ms, replicating our earlier findings. The interaction between attentional spreading and conflict occurred beginning at approximately 300 ms, with attentional-spreading activity being larger for incongruent trials. Thus, the increased processing of an incongruent, task-irrelevant sound in a multisensory stimulation appeared to occur some time after attention has spread from the attended visual part to the ignored auditory part, presumably reflecting the conflict detection and associated attentional capture requiring accrual of some multisensory interaction processes at a higher-level semantic processing stage.

Combining Discriminant and Topographic Information in BCI: Preliminary Results on Stroke Patients	2011 5TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS) Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 27-MAY 01, 2011	Cancun, MEXICO	Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), IEEE				Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) convey a great potential in the field of stroke rehabilitation, where the continuous monitoring of mental tasks execution could support the positive effects of standard therapies. In this paper we combine time-frequency analysis of EEG with the topographic analysis to identify and track task-related patterns of brain activity emerging during a single BCI session. 6 Stroke patients executed Motor Imagery of the affected and unaffected hands: EEG sites were ranked depending on their discriminant power (DP) at different time instants and the resulting discriminant periods were used as a prior to extract EEG Microstates. Results show that the combination of these two techniques can provide insights about specific motor-related processes happening at a fine grain temporal resolution. Such events, represented by EEG microstates, can be tracked and used both to quantify changes of underlying neural structures and to provide feedback to patients and therapists.

Towards Brain First-Aid: A Diagnostic Device for Conscious Awareness	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Health monitoring; neuroscience; point-of-care diagnostics; sensor technologies utilization; wireless reporting and assessment	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OWN NAME; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COMA	When the brain is damaged, evaluating an individual's level of awareness can be a major diagnostic challenge (Is he or she in there?). Existing tests typically rely on behavioral indicators, which are incorrect in as many as one out of every two cases. The current paper presents a diagnostic device that addresses this problem. The technology circumvents behavioral limitations through noninvasive brain wave measurements (electroencephalography, or EEG). Unlike traditional EEG, the device is designed for point-of-care use by incorporating a portable, user-friendly, and stable design. It uses a novel software algorithm that automates subject stimulation, data acquisition/analysis, and the reporting of results. The test provides indicators for five identifiable levels of neural processing: sensation, perception, attention, memory, and language. The results are provided as rapidly obtained diagnostic, reliability, validity, and prognostic scores. The device can be applied to a wide variety of patients across a host of different environments. The technology is designed to be wireless-enabled for remote monitoring and assessment capabilities. In essence, the device is developed to scan for conscious awareness in order to optimize subsequent patient care.	[D'Arcy, Ryan C.

J	Salvaris, M; Sepulveda, F				Salvaris, Mathew; Sepulveda, Francisco			Classification effects of real and imaginary movement selective attention tasks on a P300-based brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; P300 AMPLITUDE; RESPONSE-MODE; GO/NOGO TASK; PROBABILITY; INHIBITION; BCI; ALGORITHMS; STIMULI	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely on various electroencephalography methodologies that allow the user to convey their desired control to the machine. Common approaches include the use of event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P300 and modulation of the beta and mu rhythms. All of these methods have their benefits and drawbacks. In this paper, three different selective attention tasks were tested in conjunction with a P300-based protocol (i.e. the standard counting of target stimuli as well as the conduction of real and imaginary movements in sync with the target stimuli). The three tasks were performed by a total of 10 participants, with the majority (7 out of 10) of the participants having never before participated in imaginary movement BCI experiments. Channels and methods used were optimized for the P300 ERP and no sensory-motor rhythms were explicitly used. The classifier used was a simple Fisher's linear discriminant. Results were encouraging, showing that on average the imaginary movement achieved a P300 versus No-P300 classification accuracy of 84.53%. In comparison, mental counting, the standard selective attention task used in previous studies, achieved 78.9% and real movement 90.3%. Furthermore, multiple trial classification results were recorded and compared, with real movement reaching 99.5% accuracy after four trials (12.8 s), imaginary movement reaching 99.5% accuracy after five trials (16 s) and counting reaching 98.2% accuracy after ten trials (32 s).

After about 30 years of BCI research, the success of control that is achieved by means of a BCI system still greatly varies between subjects. For about 20% of potential users the obtained accuracy does not reach the level criterion, meaning that BCI control is not accurate enough to control an application. The determination of factors that may serve to predict BCI performance, and the development of methods to quantify a predictor value from psychological and/or physiological data serve two purposes: a better understanding of the 'BCI-illiteracy phenomenon', and avoidance of a costly and eventually frustrating training procedure for participants who might not obtain BCI control. Furthermore, such predictors may lead to approaches to antagonize BCI illiteracy. Here, we propose a neurophysiological predictor of BC! performance which can be determined from a two minute recording of a 'relax with eyes open' condition using two Laplacian EEG channels. A correlation of r = 0.53 between the proposed predictor and BCI feedback performance was obtained on a large data base with N = 80 BCI-naive participants in their first session with the Berlin brain-computer interface (BBCI) system which operates on modulations of sensory motor rhythms (SMRs).

These models provided the theoretical hypotheses that were tested against the electroencephalography (EEG) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data recorded from human subjects during prolonged periods of repeated visual stimuli with a variable setting of the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and visual contrast. Our results suggest that (I) neural response is nonlinear only when ISI <0.2 s, (2) BOLD response is nonlinear with an exclusively vascular origin when 0.25<ISI<4.2 s, (3) vascular response nonlinearity reflects a refractory effect, rather than a ceiling effect, and (4) there is a strong linear relationship between the BOLD effect size and the integrated power of event-related synaptic current activity, after modeling and taking into account the vascular refractory effect. These conclusions offer important insights into the origins of BOLD nonlinearity and the nature of neurovascular coupling, and suggest an effective means to quantitatively interpret the BOLD signal in terms of neural activity. The validated cross-modal relationship between fMRI and EEG may provide a theoretical basis for the integration of these two modalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Subjects were 26 individuals with PIU and 26 controls. Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) was used for measures of impulsivity. A go/no-go task involved eight different two-digit numerical stimuli. The response window was 1000 ms and the inter-trial-interval (ITI) was 1500 ms. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when participants performed the task. Brain electrical source analysis (BESA) 5.2.0 was used to perform data analysis and the no-go N2 amplitude was analysed for investigation of inhibitory control. Results: BIS-11 total scores, attentional key and motor key scores in PIU group were higher than that of the control group. In the go/no-go task, false alarm rate of PIU group was higher, and hit rate was lower than that of the control group. A repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant group, frontal electrode sites and group x frontal electrode sites main effect for N2 amplitudes of no-go conditions (for group: F = 3953, df = 1, p = 0.000; for frontal electrode sites: F = 541, df = 9, p = 0.000; for group x frontal electrode sites: F = 306, df = 9, p = 0.000), and a significant group, central electrode sites and group x central electrode sites main effect for N2 amplitudes of no-go conditions (for group: F = 9074, df = 1, p = 0.000; for central electrode sites: F = 163, df = 2, p = 0.000; for group x central electrode sites: F = 73, df = 2, p = 0.000). N2 amplitudes of no-go conditions were lower than those at control group. Conclusions: Individuals with PIU were more impulsive than controls and shared neuropsychological and ERPs characteristics of compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder, which supports that PIU is an impulse disorder or at least related to impulse control disorder.

In the present experiment we analyzed in rats, from early to mature life (2 to 11 months old), the response to unattended auditory evoked stimulation (Auditory evoked potential, AEP) and the power spectrum of spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), with the aim of unraveling the onset and target functional effects of aging. Somatosensory and cingulate cortex, mediodorsal thalamus and CA3 hippocampus were chosen for examination based on their involvement in sensory processing and age-related deficits.

EFFECTS OF COLOR INFORMATION ON FACE PROCESSING USING EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS AND GAMMA OSCILLATIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						face processing; face color; electroencephalogram; N170; gamma oscillations	REPETITION PRIMING TASK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; SURFACE REFLECTANCE; INVERTED FACES; FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL MECHANISMS	In humans, face configuration, contour and color may affect face perception, which is important for social interactions. This study aimed to determine the effect of color information on face perception by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) during the presentation of natural- and bluish-colored faces. Our results demonstrated that the amplitude of the N170 event-related potential, which correlates strongly with face processing, was higher in response to a bluish-colored face than to a natural-colored face. However, gamma-band activity was insensitive to the deviation from a natural face color. These results indicated that color information affects the N170 associated with a face detection mechanism, which suggests that face color is important for face detection. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Volunteers underwent a continuous BOLD fMRI scan and/or a continuous perfusion-sensitive (gradient and spin echo readout) ASL scan, during which 30 second blocks of contrast reversing visual stimuli (at 4 Hz) were interleaved with 30 second blocks of rest (visual fixation). Electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI were simultaneously recorded and following EEG artefact cleaning, VEPs were averaged across the whole stimulation block (120 reversals, VEP120) and at a finer timescale (15 reversals, VEP15). Both BOLD and ASL time-series were linearly modelled to establish: (1) the mean response to visual stimulation, (2) transient responses at the start and end of each stimulation block, (3) the linear decrease between blocks, (4) the nonlinear between-block variation (covariation with VEP120), (5) the linear decrease within block and (6) the nonlinear variation within block (covariation with VEP15). VEPs demonstrated a significant linear time-dependent reduction in amplitude, both within and between blocks of stimulation. Consistent with the VEPs finding, both BOLD and perfusion measures showed significant linear time-dependent reductions in response amplitude between blocks. In addition, there were significant linear time-dependent within-block reductions in BOLD response as well as between-block variations positively correlating with VEP120 (medial occipital and frontal) and within-block variations positively correlating with VEP15 (occipital and thalamus). Both electrophysiological and haemodynamic (BOLD and ASL) measures of visual activity showed steady habituation through the experiment. Beyond this, the VEP measures were predictive of shorter timescale (3-30 second) localised variations in BOLD response engaging both occipital cortex and other regions such as anterior cingulate and parietal regions, implicating attentional processes in the modulation of the VEP signal.

The resulting multitaper spectrogram will approximately fulfill the concentration of the distribution but will additionally suppress the cross-terms outside a predetermined Doppler-lag bandwidth. The specific region as well as the amount of cross-term suppression is determined by parameters of the penalty function. The proposed method uses a limited number of multitapers which results in computationally efficient calculations. The time-frequency concentration and resolution of the proposed method and the original distribution are compared and the performance for signals disturbed by white noise is also evaluated. Estimation of event related potentials disturbed by EEG exemplify the use of the method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Enhancement in performance on declarative memory tasks has been associated with early NonREM sleep, consisting of the highest percentage of slow-wave sleep. Twenty-four subjects (eight short sleepers <= 7 h, nine average >7 but <9 h, seven long >= 9 h)were tested. Subjects were presented with unfamiliar face stimuli and asked to memorize them for a subsequent test. Following sleep, the subjects were presented with the 40 "old/studied" items intermixed with 40 new and asked to indicate the previously presented stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed to verify the existence of the "Old/New" effect, i.e. amplitude difference [in ERPs] between the old and new stimuli. ANOVA on the scores revealed a significant interaction between the stimuli and group. Post-hoc test on the studied items revealed more accurate responses in the short sleepers compared to the average and long sleepers. Strikingly, the long sleepers failed to show significant retention of the old/studied items, with their recognition of old faces not different from chance. Reaction time (RT) responses were faster for the old vs. the new items. Pearson correlation revealed a significant negative correlation between accuracy and sleep duration in the short sleepers. However, long and average sleepers showed a positive correlation between the two variables. ANOVA performed on the ERPs revealed main effects of stimuli and site, and no interactions involving the group factor. In conclusion, our data show that individual differences in recognition memory performance may be associated with differences in habitual sleep duration.

While each of these individual measures has shown promise as an endophenotype for one or more aspects of EXT, we proposed that the power to identify EXT-related genes may be enhanced by using these measures collectively. Thus, we sought to explore a multivariate approach to identifying electrophysiological endophenotypes related to EXT, using measures identified in the literature as promising individual endophenotypes for EXT. Using data from our large twin sample (634 MZ and 335 DZ, male and female same-sex pairs), and fitting multivariate biometric Cholesky models, we found that these measures (1) were heritable, (2) showed significant phenotypic and genetic correlation with a general vulnerability to EXT (which is itself highly heritable), (3) showed modest phenotypic and genetic correlation with each other, and (4) were sensitive to genetic effects that differed as a function of gender. These relationships suggest that these endophenotypes are likely tapping into neurophysiological processes and genes that are both common across them and unique to each-all of which are relevant to a biological vulnerability to EXT psychopathology.

Furthermore, the exploration of brain function in severely brain-damaged patients represents a unique lesional approach to the scientific study of consciousness. Electroencephalography is one means of identifying covert behaviour in the absence of motor activity in these critically ill patients. Here we focus on a language processing task which assesses whether vegetative (n=10) and minimally conscious state patients (n=4) (vs control subjects, n=14) understand semantic information on a sentence level ("The opposite of black is ... white/yellow/nice"). Results indicate that only MCS but not VS patients show differential processing of unrelated ("nice") and antonym ("white") words in the form of parietal alpha (10-12Hz) event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD), respectively. Controls show a more typical pattern, characterized by alpha ERD in response to unrelated words and alpha ERS in response to antonyms.

Cortical mechanisms of auditory spatial attention in a target detection task	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potential; P3a; Oddball; P300; Orienting response	SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SOUND LOCALIZATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; P300 LATENCY; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; STIMULI; NOVELTY	The benefits of spatial attention on stimulus processing are thought to diminish with increased distance from the attended location, indicating an attention gradient. Evidence for attention gradients is provided by spatial attention effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) under conditions of rapid stimulus presentation from closely spaced locations. This study was motivated by ecological considerations which suggest that auditory attention is particularly useful for panoramic orienting to intermittent sounds. Auditory ERPs were recorded from a wide range of horizontal locations (180 degrees) while subjects pressed a button to occasional targets at one attended location. Results showed that an ERP component associated with automatic orienting, the P3a, had linear amplitude increases to non-targets as a function of distance from the attended location. A component prior to the P3a with a latency of similar to 200 ms, the P200, showed a similar pattern but only when subjects attended to the left hemifield. When attending to lateral targets frontal slow waves contralateral to the attended location followed the P3a and were attenuated at greater distances from the target location for at least 1 s. Results suggest that auditory spatial attention under low cognitive loads modulates orienting responses as a function of distance from the attended location. The slow wave findings show that information about the relation between a stimulus and the attended location persists well beyond the time of initial sensory processing and may involve frontal regions important for maintaining online representations of task set.

Human and animal studies have found associations between basal and acute levels of the stress hormone cortisol and (abnormal) aggression. Irrespective of the direction of these changes - i.e., increased or decreased aggressive behavior - the results of these studies suggest dramatic alterations in the processing of threat-related social information. Therefore, the effects of cortisol and provocation on social information processing were addressed by the present study. After a placebo-controlled pharmacological manipulation of acute cortisol levels, we exposed healthy individuals to high or low levels of provocation in a competitive aggression paradigm. Influences of cortisol and provocation on emotional face processing were then investigated with reaction times and event-related potentials (ERPs) in an emotional Stroop task. In line with previous results, enhanced early and later positive, posterior ERP components indicated a provocation-induced enhanced relevance for all kinds of social information. Cortisol, however, reduced an early frontocentral bias for angry faces and - despite the provocation-enhancing relevance - led to faster reactions for all facial expressions in highly provoked participants. The results thus support the moderating role of social information processing in the 'vicious circle of stress and aggression'. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neural activity before and after conscious perception in dichotic listening	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Multistable perception; Auditory event-related potentials; EEG; Dichotic listening; P50	AUDITORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EAR ADVANTAGE; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; LATERAL ASYMMETRIES; LATENCY; ATTENTION; SPEECH; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPRESSION; LOCALIZATION	The neural basis of conscious perception can be studied using stimuli that elicit different percepts on different occasions (multistable perception). Multistable perception allows direct comparisons between brain activity and conscious perception that control for sensory input, and also serves as a model for attentional competition, with the winning perceptual outcome varying across trials. Dichotic listening tasks present multistable stimuli consisting of two different consonant-vowels (CVs, one/ear). For each trial one ear usually conveys the dominant percept. We used EEG to measure neural activity before and after dichotic stimulus presentation to compare activity among left vs. right ear percepts and a control task. Consonant-vowels were perceived more often to the right vs. left ear. Pre-stimulus EEG power in the beta band (16-20 Hz) increased for left compared to right ear percepts and control trials. Event-related potentials after stimulus onset showed smaller P50 amplitudes (similar to 50 ms latency) for left ear compared to right ear and control trials. Results indicate that neural activity for right ear percepts is comparable to control conditions, while activity for the atypical left ear percept differs before and after stimulus onset. Pre-stimulus EEG changes for left ear percepts may indicate a mechanism of spontaneous fluctuations in cortical networks that bias attentional competition during subsequent sensory processing. The P50 amplitude differences among perceived ears suggests that rapid sensory and/or arousal-related activities contribute to the content of conscious perception, possibly by biasing attentional competition away from the dominant right ear channel.

Children with ADHD have functional impairment occurring at multiple levels. In the present study, cognitive status was assessed using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty ADHD children and 20 controls were recruited for the study and ERPs were recorded on a computerized evoked potential recorder, using the international 10-20 system of electrode placement. The ADHD children showed a statistically significant N200 latency prolongation and amplitude decrease compared with the controls; the latencies of the other waves, i.e. N100, P200, P300, were prolonged in the ADHD children but the difference versus the controls was statistically insignificant. Reaction time was significantly longer in the ADHD subjects as compared with the controls. The above findings are suggestive of dysfunctions in the discrimination of task-relevant stimuli and a slower motor response in ADHD children.

BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Contextual cueing; Attention; Event-related potentials; N2pc	EVENT-RELATED LATERALIZATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEARCH; TARGET; EEG; STRATEGIES; DEPLOYMENT; LOCATIONS; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	When search displays are repeatedly presented, participants become faster in finding the target (contextual cueing, CC). It has been debated whether a more liberal response criterion might contribute to CC. In the current experiment, participants had to search through target-absent and target-present trials to compute d-prime as the measurement of sensitivity and beta as the measurement of response bias. Results showed that participants' sensitivity was not affected by the repetition of search displays. Although repeated displays led to both faster RTs and a more liberal response criterion, these effects were uncorrelated. In the event-related potential, RT effects were reflected by a late positive activity, which reflects response-related processes, but not by differences in the N2pc as electrophysiological correlate of focused attention. These results indicate that a more liberal response criterion is not the cause for CC effects in RTs but that other response-related processes might still contribute to the effect.

The EEG activity was recorded in a double-blind placebo experiment, and prestimulus spectral power and inter-and intrahemispheric temporal coupling were assessed during visual sustained attention task performance. A single DZ dose (5 mg) was enough to increase reaction times during visual sustained attention task responses. DZ decreased prestimulus EEG power in the 1- to 6-, 8- to 12-, and 19- to 35-Hz bands and disrupted right intrahemispheric temporal coupling in the a-frequency range (8-12 Hz). The combined reduction in power and temporal coupling suggests both local and interregional DZ-induced disruption of neuronal synchronicity especially in the right hemisphere in agreement with the prominent attention-related networks in this hemisphere. These data support the notion that the influence of DZ on behavior goes beyond sedative effects and can potentially compromise higher cognitive functions with negative consequences to daily life situations.

Frontal EEGs were recorded from dementia patients and normal controls during music and photo-image stimulations, and frequency analysis was performed. In the controls, profiles of rhythm pattern during music stimulation seemed to be markedly different from those during photo-image stimulation. In contrast, in dementia patients, it was difficult to find those differences. Interestingly, as HDS-R decreases, the variability of rhythm patterns also decreases. These results suggest that a decrease in cognitive function might be related to a decrease in the ability to generate various cortical rhythm patterns.

Especially, differences in within-person variability in behavior and neural activity between young and older adults and changes in topography of slow event-related oscillations (EROs) were of interest. Within-person variability in behavior was assessed by reaction time (RT) variability. Event-related delta and theta oscillations were analyzed using time-frequency transformation, which can give information on the time-course of single trial event-related EEG spectral power enhancement and intertrial phase-locking (ITC). In contrast to our previous visual Go/NoGo study, no under-recruitment of task-relevant brain regions was found for the auditory theta and delta ER0s. Young did not differ from older adults in RI variability or in single trial delta/theta ITC. Altered recruitment of brain activity at advanced age was indicated, first, by stronger early theta phase-locking in older compared to young adults and, second, by a Go-specific lateralization of delta/theta activity. We conclude that within-person variability may increase with age, but the degree depends on performance level and the modality investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper highlights the role of the secondary and late cortico-cortical transmission in neurovascular coupling. Simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and diffuse optical imaging (DOI) measurements were obtained during multiple conditions of event-related electrical forepaw stimulation in 33 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 6 groups depending on the maintaining anesthetic - alpha-chloralose, pentobarbital, ketamine-xylazine, fentanyl-droperidol, isoflurane, or propofol. The somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were decomposed into four components and the question of which best predicts the hemodynamic responses was investigated. Results of the linear regression analysis show that the hemodynamic response is best correlated with the secondary and late cortico-cortical transmissions and not with the initial thalamic input activity in layer IV. Baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) interacts with neural activity and influences the evoked hemodynamic responses. Finally, neurovascular coupling appears to be the same across all anesthetics used.

Inconsistent findings with parietal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry, however, suggest issues such as anxiety comorbidity and sex differences have yet to be resolved. Resting parietal EEG asymmetry was assessed in 306 individuals (31% male) with (n = 143) and without (n = 163) a DSM-IV diagnosis of lifetime MDD and no comorbid anxiety disorders. Past MDD+ women displayed relatively less right parietal activity than current MDD+ and MDD- women, replicating prior work. Recent caffeine intake, an index of arousal, moderated the relationship between depression and EEG asymmetry for women and men. Findings suggest that sex differences and arousal should be examined in studies of depression and regional brain activity.	[Stewart, Jennifer L.; Allen, John J.

Deterioration of this function may result in serious accidents. This function is reflected in two event-related potential (ERP) components that occur after erroneous responses, specifically the error-related negativity/error negativity (ERN/Ne) and error positivity (Pe). The ERN/Ne is thought to be associated with error detection, while the Pe is thought to reflect motivational significance or recognition of errors. Using these ERP components, some studies have shown that sleepiness resulting from extended wakefulness may cause a decline in error-monitoring function. However, the effects of sleep inertia have not yet been explored. In this study, we examined the effects of sleep inertia immediately after a 1-h daytime nap on error-monitoring function as expressed through the ERN/Ne and Pe. Nine healthy young adults participated in two different experimental conditions (nap and rest). Participants performed the arrow-orientation task before and immediately after a 1-h nap or rest period. Immediately after the nap, participants reported an increased effort to perform the task and tended to estimate their performance as better, despite no objective difference in actual performance between the two conditions. ERN/Ne amplitude showed no difference between the conditions; however, the amplitude of the Pe was reduced following the nap. These results suggest that individuals can detect their own error responses, but the motivational significance ascribed to these errors might be diminished during the sleep inertia experienced after a 1-h nap. This decline might lead to overestimation of their performance.

The relationship between self-reported animal fear and ERP modulation: Evidence for enhanced processing and fear of harmless invertebrates in snake- and spider-fearful individuals	MOTIVATION AND EMOTION			English	Article						Fear; Fear relevance; Event-related brain potentials; Generalization	SKIN-CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES; CONDITIONED-STIMULI; ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RELEVANT ANIMALS; PICTURES; EXTINCTION; PHOBIAS; DANGER; PREPAREDNESS	The present study used ERPs to compare processing of fear-relevant (FR) animals (snakes and spiders) and non-fear-relevant (NFR) animals similar in appearance (worms and beetles). EEG was recorded from 18 undergraduate participants (10 females) as they completed two animal-viewing tasks that required simple categorization decisions. Participants were divided on a post hoc basis into low snake/spider fear and high snake/spider fear groups. Overall, FR animals were rated higher on fear and elicited a larger LPC. However, individual differences qualified these effects. Participants in the low fear group showed clear differentiation between FR and NFR animals on subjective ratings of fear and LPC modulation. In contrast, participants in the high fear group did not show such differentiation between FR and NFR animals. These findings suggest that the salience of feared-FR animals may generalize on both a behavioural and electro-cortical level to other animals of similar appearance but of a non-harmful nature.

The proposed method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates those using least-squares estimation with a kernel having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to obtain the optimal bandwidth, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Simulation results show that the LPM-based TVAR identification method outperforms conventional methods for different scenarios. The advantages of the LPM method make it a useful high-resolution time-frequency analysis (TFA) technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like EEG. Experimental results show that the LPM method can reveal more meaningful time-frequency characteristics than wavelet transform.	[Zhang, Z. G.; Chan, S. C.; Hung, Y.

The advantage of mentally rotating clockwise	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Mental rotation; Event-related brain potentials; Rotation-related negativity; Strategies; Slow waves; Parity-judgment task; Speed of rotation; Clockwise vs. counterclockwise; Rotational asymmetry	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; RIGHT HANDS; PATTERNS; IMAGES; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; ANALOG; FAMILIARITY	The time taken to decide whether a character is shown in its mirror or normal version has been shown to increase approximately linearly with the angular departure from an up-right position. Additionally, in some studies, decisions took longer for clockwise tilted characters than for counterclockwise tilted ones. Other studies do not report the latter effect. We argue that inconsistencies across studies are caused by variance in participants' strategies. The task employed here was specifically designed to bring these strategies and thereby the direction of rotation under experimental control. From the EEG recorded during the rotation period, we extracted an event-related slow potential whose amplitude is sensitive to the amount of mental rotation. In both strategy conditions, the slow potential's amplitude was lower for clockwise than for counterclockwise rotations. We take this as evidence that mental rotation of alphanumeric characters is easier in a clockwise than in a counterclockwise direction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Twenty-five phobic female patients and 20 non-phobic controls were confronted with phobia-relevant, generally fear-inducing, disgust-inducing and affectively neutral pictures while an electroencephalogram was recorded. Mean amplitudes of ERPs were extracted in the time windows 340-500 ms (P300) and 550-770 ms (late positive potential, LPP). Phobics showed enhanced P300 and LPP amplitudes in response to spider pictures relative to controls. Sources were mainly located in areas engaged in visuo-attentional processing (occipital and parietal regions, ventral visual pathway). Moreover, there were sources in areas which are crucial for emotional processing and the representations of aversive bodily states (cingulate cortex, insula). Further sources were located in premotor areas reflecting the priming of flight behaviour. Our findings are in good accordance with existing brain imaging studies and underline that source localization is a useful alternative for identifying phobia-relevant cortical regions.

Stage 1 was a behavioral study, in which basic reading skill, reading comprehension, linguistic and cognitive tasks were administered to 661 learning-disabled university students (n = 382) and their non-learning-disabled peers (n = 279). Based on a word reading measure, accuracy-disabled and rate-disabled subgroups were identified, as was a subgroup with deficits in both rate and accuracy. The results support the persistence of a rate versus accuracy dissociation into adulthood. Accuracy disability was related to a broad range of deficits affecting phonological, orthographic, and morphological processing, verbal memory, attention, and reading comprehension. Rate disability appeared to be associated with slower processing of printed material, alongside largely intact functioning resembling those of skilled readers. In stage 2, electroencephalogram (EEG)-ERP measurements were obtained from 140 participants recruited from the larger sample. Activation in visual association cortex, indicated by the N170 amplitude, was found to be lower for accuracy-disabled than skilled readers, and comparable between rate-disabled and skilled readers. The lowest amplitude was found in the double-deficit subgroup. The findings support the existence of distinctive reading disability profiles, based on selective deficits in reading rate versus accuracy and associated with different basic reading, linguistic, and cognitive skills as well as electrophysiological responses.

We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by auditory stimuli that are applicable to BCI systems. In recent studies, sound localization systems have been intensively studied in order to enhance BCI system development in a way that reproduces a virtual 3D auditory environment, applicable to human-machine communications. We conducted experiment using a sound localization system in which subjects were instructed to listen to a sound cue and answering the relative direction (i.e. the direction to which the sound cue is emitted from an observer) of the sound source. For each trial, a target direction was indicated by the experimenter, although the direction of the sound cue emitted during the trials was not necessarily the target direction. Changes in brain activity were measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Experimental results showed that prominent excitations in EEG signals were observed during a. trial where the target direction corresponded to the sound source direction, by subtracting the mean EEG signal of the non-target trials from that of the target trials.

It has now become possible to directly evaluate rTMS impact by means of concurrent EEG recording. The aim of this study was to examine the modulation induced by high frequency rTMS (20 Hz) over left primary motor cortex on the ongoing oscillatory activity. Thirteen subjects underwent two sham and a real rTMS session while acquiring EEG. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization was calculated for the a and beta bands. rTMS induced a dose-dependent increase in synchronization in both bands over central and parietal sites. The strongest effect found for the a band outlasted the end of the stimulation. Considering previous studies, our data suggest that a generation may represent an intrinsic induced response and a basic response signature to TMS targeting the human resting motor cortex.

The ability to efficiently process rapid changes in auditory information is important for decoding speech and thereby crucial during language acquisition. Investigating functional networks of speech perception in infancy might elucidate neuronal ensembles supporting perceptual abilities that gate language acquisition. Interhemispheric specializations for language have been demonstrated in infants. How these asymmetries are shaped by basic temporal acoustic properties is under debate. We recently provided evidence that newborns process non-linguistic sounds sharing temporal features with language in a differential and lateralized fashion. The present study used the same material while measuring brain responses of 6 and 3 month old infants using simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS reveals that the lateralization observed in newborns remains constant over the first months of life. While fast acoustic modulations elicit bilateral neuronal activations, slow modulations lead to right-lateralized responses. Additionally, auditory-evoked potentials and oscillatory EEG responses show differential responses for fast and slow modulations indicating a sensitivity for temporal acoustic variations. Oscillatory responses reveal an effect of development, that is, 6 but not 3 month old infants show stronger theta-band desynchronization for slowly modulated sounds. Whether this developmental effect is due to increasing fine-grained perception for spectrotemporal sounds in general remains speculative. Our findings support the notion that a more general specialization for acoustic properties can be considered the basis for lateralization of speech perception. The results show that concurrent assessment of vascular based imaging and electrophysiological responses have great potential in the research on language acquisition.

The method involves instantiating an approximate model of the electrical properties of the brain as a conductor medium and then studying the free vibrational modes of the model. These form a set of basis functions, which we call eigenbrains, that can be used to meaningfully re-represent the brain's electrical activity. Eigenbrains are compared to principal component analysis and independent component analysis to highlight differences and similarities.

We therefore must rely upon a stimulus-response-outcome (S-R-O) rule learned from previous experiences of gains and losses. Here we report a study that used event-related potentials (ERP) to examine the neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in decision making when S-R-O rules are changing in a volatile manner. Thirty-one participants engaged in a reward-based decision-making task in which two contextual determinants of decision uncertainty were independently manipulated: Volatility (i.e. the frequency of changes in the S-R-O rules) and Feedback validity (i.e. the extent to which an S-R-O rule accurately predicts outcomes). Results of stimulus-locked ERPs showed that volatility of S-R-O rules was associated with two well-known neural signatures of cognitive control processes. First, increased S-R-O volatility in a high FV context was associated with frontally-based N2 (200-350 ms) and N400 (350-500 ms) components. Second, in a low FV context, volatility was associated with an enhanced late positive complex (LPC, 500-800 ms) largest on frontal sites. Feedback-locked ERPs showed an enhanced Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and P300 for losses compared to wins as well as a volatility driven FRN. These results suggest that, in a high FV context, coping with volatility might involve conflict monitoring processes. However, in a low FV context, coping with frequent changes in the S-R-O rule might require greater attentional and working memory (WM) resources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These may be related with three post-receptoral detection mechanisms defined psychophysically in humans. Accordingly, the parvocellular pathway is very sensitive to L-M-cone contrast, processes mainly foveal information and underlies fine discrimination of visual features The magnocellular pathway is most sensitive to luminance contrast and is important for visuo-spatial and motion processing The less understood koniocellular pathway responds to S-cone modulation outside the foveola. As such, the three pathways process visual information in a different manner, with the L-M-cone psychophysical channel being more devoted to central vision and the two other channels responding significantly to peripheral information We measured size response functions of these three processing channels using event related potential (ERP/EEG) recordings and stimuli with various sizes and contrasts with the aim of studying coding of stimulus properties within each of these channels The effect of stimulus size was significantly smaller for the L-M-cone channel consistent with its dominance in the central visual field. Furthermore, for this pathway, the effect of size was not modulated by stimulus contrast In contrast, both the S-cone and achromatic channels showed a strong effect of size that was significantly modulated by contrast. Interestingly, both the S-cone and achromatic channels responded proportionally to the area of cortex activated, suggesting that the S-cone channel represents space in a similar manner to the achromatic channel In conclusion, a fundamental relation exists between previously identified psychophysical mechanisms and population responses in the visual cortex (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

We represent multi-channel EEG data using a third-order tensor with modes: space (channels), time samples, and number of segments. Then, a multi-way technique, in particular, generalized version of PARAFAC2 method, is developed to blindly separate and localize mutually/temporally correlated P3a and P3b sources as subcomponents of P300 signal. In this paper the non-orthogonality of the ERP subcomponents is defined within the tensor model. In order to obtain essentially unique estimation of the signal components one parametric and one structural constraint are defined and imposed. The method is applied to both simulated and real data and has been shown to perform very well even in low signal to noise ratio situations. In addition, the method is compared with spatial principal component analysis (sPCA) and its superiority is demonstrated by using simulated signals.

Hyperbaric oxygen ameliorates delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome of carbon monoxide poisoning	UNDERSEA AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE			English	Article							BRAIN LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ENCEPHALOPATHY; INTOXICATION; THERAPY; SPECT	Objectives: Delayed neuropsychatric syndrome (DNS) is characterized by mental impairment. Motor dysfunction, dementia, or psychosis that develops between a few clays and weeks alter acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. One possible mechanism responsible for CO-mediated encephalopathy involves oxidative stress. such as lipid peroxidation, Caused by the Cellular uptake of CO and which leads to all inflammatory cascade. There IS 170 current effective treatment for DNS We applied 8-40 Sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) to patients with DNS and evaluated its effectiveness Methods: After admission, all patients were administered piracetam or bromocriptine, or both, and received HBO2. Neuropsychiatric tests included EEG, mini-mental status examination (MMSE), brain MRI, event-related potential (ERP), and brain perfusion scan (brain SPECT) Results Of these tests were compared before and after HBO2 and the clinical features were monitored during this period Results: The symptoms Of DNS for all patients Improved significantly after HBOT Although white. matter changes remained evident ill the brain MRI scales, other examinations such as EEG, MMSE, ERR and Tc-99m-ECD brain SPECT were clearly normal after HBOT. Conclusion: Our results suggest that HBO2, decreases the severity of impairment in patients with DNS Although a large randomized trial is required to address the efficacy of this therapy, therapeutic application of HBO2 may be recommended in patients with DNS after CO poisoning	[Chang, D.

However, source localization by using EEG has limitations. The advantage of magnetoencephalography (MEG) is that It enables localization of cortical activities and has excellent temporal resolution. In this study, we used MEG to measure the neural responses underlying the perception of the human body Our results suggest that cortical activation induced by body images was observed in the bilateral EBA region with a latency of 190 ms and right-hemispheric dominance. Our study revealed the regions involved and the latency differences between these regions in body perception. Further, our results show the usefulness of MEG for body perception studies and suggest that like the face, the body plays a unique role in the human recognition process.

Among the genetic variants, polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and variable-number-of-tandem-repeat in the second intron (5-HTTVNTR) have functional consequences. However, their genetic impact on cortical oscillation remains unclear. This study examined the modulatory effects of 5-HTTLPR (L-allele carriers vs. non-carriers) and 5-HTTVNTR (10-repeat allele carriers vs. non-carriers) polymorphism on regional neural activity in a young female population. Methods: Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected from 195 healthy women and stratified into 2 sets of comparisons of 2 groups each: L-allele carriers (N = 91) vs. non-carriers for 5-HTTLPR and 10-repeat allele carriers (N = 25) vs. non-carriers for 5-HTTVNTR. The mean power of 18 electrodes across theta, alpha, beta, gamma, gamma1, and gamma2 frequencies was analyzed. Between-group statistics were performed by an independent t-test, and global trends of regional power were quantified by non-parametric analyses. Results: Among 5-HTTVNTR genotypes, 10-repeat allele carriers showed significantly low regional power at gamma frequencies across the brain. We noticed a consistent global trend that carriers with low transcription efficiency of 5-HTT possessed low regional powers, regardless of frequency bands. The non-parametric analyses confirmed this observation, with P values of 3.071 x 10(-8) and 1.459 x 10(-12) for 5-HTTLPR and 5-HTTVNTR, respectively. Conclusions and Limitations: Our analyses showed that genotypes with low 5-HTT activity are associated with less local neural synchronization during relaxation. The implication with respect to genetic vulnerability of 5-HTT across a broad range of psychiatric disorders is discussed. Given the low frequency of 10-repeat allele of 5-HTTVNTR in our research sample, the possibility of false positive findings should also be considered.

Cortical Evoked Responses Associated with Arousal from Sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						Evoked response potential (ERP); auditory intensity; EEG; rat	WAKE CYCLE; POTENTIALS; WAKING; RAT; MECHANISMS; STIMULI; HUMANS; CORTEX; EEG	Study Objective: To determine if low-level intermittent auditory stimuli have the potential to disrupt sleep during 24-h recordings, we assessed arousal occurrence to varying stimulus intensities. Additionally, if stimulus-generated evoked response potential (ERP) components provide a metric of underlying cortical state, then a particular ERP structure may precede an arousal. Design: Physiological electrodes measuring EEG, EKG, and EMG were implanted into 5 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. We delivered auditory stimuli of varying intensities (50-75 dBa sound pressure level SPL) at random intervals of 6-12 s over a 24-hour period. Recordings were divided into 2-s epochs and scored for sleep/wake state. Following each stimulus, we identified whether the animal stayed asleep or woke. We then sorted the stimuli depending on prior and post-stimulus state, and measured ERP components. Results: Auditory stimuli did not produce a significant increase in the number of arousals compared to silent control periods. Overall, arousal from REM sleep occurred more often compared to quiet sleep. ERPs preceding an arousal had decreased mean area and shorter N1 latency. Conclusion: Low level auditory stimuli did not fragment animal sleep since we observed no significant change in arousal occurrence. Arousals that occurred within 4 s of a stimulus exhibited an ERP mean area and latency had features similar to ERPs generated during wake, indicating that the underlying cortical tissue state may contribute to physiological conditions required for arousal.

Indexing the graded allocation of visuospatial attention using anticipatory alpha oscillations. J Neurophysiol 105: 1318-1326, 2011. First published January 12, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00653.2010.-Lateralization in the desynchronization of anticipatory occipitoparietal alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations has been implicated in the allocation of selective visuospatial attention. Previous studies have demonstrated that small changes in the lateralization of alpha-band activity are predictive of behavioral performance but have not directly investigated how flexibly alpha lateralization is linked to top-down attentional goals. To address this question, we presented participants with cues providing varying degrees of spatial certainty about the location at which a target would appear. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data demonstrated that manipulating spatial certainty led to graded changes in the extent to which alpha oscillations were lateralized over the occipitoparietal cortex during the cue-target interval. We found that individual differences in alpha desynchronization contralateral to attention predicted reaction times, event-related potential measures of perceptual processing of targets, and beta-band (15-25 Hz) activity typically associated with response preparation. These results support the hypothesis that anticipatory alpha modulation is a plausible neural mechanism underlying the allocation of visuospatial attention and is under flexible top-down control.

The present study aims to clarify the stage at which the auditory AB occurs by means of scalp-recorded event-related potentials. On each trial, participants indicated whether predefined target sounds were presented in a rapid series of distractor sounds. The results showed a large AB when the presentation rate was fast. This auditory AB was paralleled by a suppression of the P3b wave to the second target. During the AB, the second target generated N1 and P2 waves, suggesting that some aspects of perceptual processing were preserved. The magnitude of the AB decreased with decreasing presentation rate. The improvement in detecting the second target was accompanied by an increased and delayed P3b. These results suggest that the auditory AB reflects a limitation of short-term consolidation and provides evidence for a common underlying processing limitation during the AB in both visual and auditory modalities.

LIMO EEG: A Toolbox for Hierarchical LInear MOdeling of ElectroEncephaloGraphic Data	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Magnetic- and electric-evoked brain responses have traditionally been analyzed by comparing the peaks or mean amplitudes of signals from selected channels and averaged across trials. More recently, tools have been developed to investigate single trial response variability (e.g., EEGLAB) and to test differences between averaged evoked responses over the entire scalp and time dimensions (e.g., SPM, Fieldtrip). LIMO EEG is a Matlab toolbox (EEGLAB compatible) to analyse evoked responses over all space and time dimensions, while accounting for single trial variability using a simple hierarchical linear modelling of the data. In addition, LIMO EEG provides robust parametric tests, therefore providing a new and complementary tool in the analysis of neural evoked responses.

Beneficial Effects of Electrostimulation Contingencies on Sustained Attention and Electrocortical Activity	CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						Acustimulation; Attention; Controlled trial; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Frequency modulation; Independent component analysis (ICA); sLORETA; Topographic EEG	ELECTRICAL NERVE-STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIGNAL-DETECTION; HUMAN BRAIN; MANUAL ACUPUNCTURE; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; WORKING-MEMORY; DORSAL-HORN; ELECTROACUPUNCTURE; PAIN	Introduction: Chinese acupuncture therapy has been practiced for more than 3000 years. According to neuroimaging studies, electroacupuncture has been demonstrated to be effective via control of the frequency parameter of stimulation, based on the theory of frequency modulation of brain function. Aims: To investigate the following: (1) possible sustained effects of acustimulation in improving perceptual sensitivity in attention by comparing before, during, and 5 min following stimulation; (2) relations between commission errors and the motor inhibition event-related potential (ERP) component measured with independent component analysis (ICA); (3) whether habituation would be demonstrated in the sham control group and would be militated by acustimulation in the experimental groups. Results: Twenty-seven subjects were divided into three groups (n = 9). d-Prime (d') derived from signal detection theory was used as an index of perceptual sensitivity in the visual continuous performance attention test. Increased d' was found during both alternating frequency (AE) and low frequency (LE) stimulation, but with no change in the sham control group (SE). However, only following AE was there a sustained poststimulation effect. Spatial filtration-based independent components (ICs) in the AE group revealed significantly decreased amplitudes of the motor inhibition ICs both during and poststimulation. There was a significant habituation effect from task repetition in the sham group with decreased amplitudes of ICs as follows: the visual comparison component difference between go (correct response) and nogo cues (correct withheld response), the P400 action monitoring and the working memory component in the nogo condition, and the passive auditory component on control trials. Conclusion: The results showed associations between acustimulation and improved perceptual sensitivity with sustained improvements following AE, but not LE stimulation. Improvements in commission errors in the AE group were related to the motor inhibition IC. The activational effects of acustimulation apparently attenuated the across-task habituation that characterized the control group.

Neurocognitive Changes Following Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment in Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE THERAPY			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; PREDICTS TREATMENT RESPONSE; BASAL GANGLIA VOLUMES; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; FDG-PET; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; FIXED FOREPERIOD; HABIT-REVERSAL	Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple fluctuating motor tics and one or more phonic tics. Various treatments have been administered with limited success to patients with GTS. For more than 40 years, the medication of choice has generally been neuroleptic medication. However, unwanted side effects often occur. For those patients, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies (CBT) have shown some success. CBT is considered an effective adjunct to medication, but the cognitive and cerebral effect of CBT has not so far been explored within a GTS population. The current research focuses on the hypothesis that significant symptom improvements in GTS, following CBT, will relate to cerebral activity changes. The aim of our research program was to compare motor Event-Related Potentials (ERP) recorded pre- and post-CBT in a population of GTS. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) and derived the ERPs of 10 GTS patients, matched with 14 controls on the basis of laterality, age and intelligence. A traffic light task was administered to extract ERPs related to response processing. Results revealed that GTS had reduced cortical activation related to the inhibition of responses, which normalized following CBT. The treatment may induce cerebral changes that significantly improve both motor performances and brain activity.

Identifying robust and sensitive frequency bands for interrogating neural oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 7.5-9.5 HZ CHANGES; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; EEG-ALPHA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE; AFFECTIVE RESPONSES	Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in using neural oscillations to characterize the mechanisms supporting cognition and emotion. Oftentimes, oscillatory activity is indexed by mean power density in predefined frequency bands. Some investigators use broad bands originally defined by prominent surface features of the spectrum. Others rely on narrower bands originally defined by spectral factor analysis (SPA). Presently, the robustness and sensitivity of these competing band definitions remains unclear. Here, a Monte Carlo-based SPA strategy was used to decompose the tonic ("resting" or "spontaneous") electroencephalogram (EEG) into five bands: delta (1-5 Hz), alpha-low (6-9 Hz), alpha-high ( 10-11 Hz), beta (12-19 Hz), and gamma (>21 Hz). This pattern was consistent across SPA methods, artifact correction/rejection procedures, scalp regions, and samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that SFA failed to deliver enhanced sensitivity: narrow alpha sub-bands proved no more sensitive than the classical broadband to individual differences in temperament or mean differences in task-induced activation. Other analyses suggested that residual ocular and muscular artifact was the dominant source of activity during quiescence in the delta and gamma bands. This was observed following threshold-based artifact rejection or independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction, indicating that such procedures do not necessarily confer adequate protection. Collectively, these findings highlight the limitations of several commonly used EEG procedures and underscore the necessity of routinely performing exploratory data analyses, particularly data visualization, prior to hypothesis testing. They also suggest the potential benefits of using techniques other than SFA for interrogating high-dimensional EEG datasets in the frequency or time-frequency (event-related spectral perturbation, event-related synchronization/desynchronization) domains.

In many of these methods, one of the major challenges is the exploitation of a priori knowledge. In this paper, we present a new method where the 2nd order statistical information on the background EEG and on the unknown ERP, necessary for the optimal filtering of each sweep in a Bayesian estimation framework, is, respectively, estimated from pre-stimulus data and obtained through a multiple integration of a white noise process model. The latter model is flexible and simple enough to be easily identifiable from the post-stimulus data thanks to a smoothing criterion. A mean ERP is determined as the weighted average of the filtered sweeps, where each weight is inversely proportional to the expected value of the norm of the correspondent filter error, a quantity determinable thanks to the employment of the Bayesian approach. Then, single-sweep estimation is dealt with within the same framework. The method is tested on simulated data and compared with a recently proposed estimation method based on radial-basis function (RBF) neural networks. Then, the method is also employed on real data with the aim of investigating the variability of the P300 component in cirrhotic vs normal subjects undertaken to a cognitive visual task.

Similarly attention can be oriented to a semantic category such as "animals" or "tools". Words from the attended category will also be recognized faster than words from an unattended category. Here, we asked whether it is possible to orient attention to an emotional category, for example, "negative emotional stimuli". Furthermore, we investigated which mechanisms facilitate processing of attended stimuli. In an attentional orienting paradigm in which cues are informative with regard to the spatial location, semantic category, or emotional category of subsequent target words, we found attention effects in all three cue conditions. Words at attended locations or of the attended semantic or emotional category were responded to faster than unattended categories. While spatial attention acted upon early visual processing and amplified occipital N1-P2 potentials, semantic cues modulated the N400 amplitude indexing semantic processing. Emotional cues also yielded an N400 modulation; however, in addition, a left anterior P2 effect was observed. The data clearly show that attention can be oriented to emotional categories. Emotional orienting yields facilitated processing of an attended emotional category through the modulation of early and late word processing stages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a previous study, we found positive brain potential (P200r) time-locked to the onset of REMs. This potential was not observed during saccades of wakefulness. In this study, we estimated the electrical generation of this potential to investigate the phasic brain activity related to REMs. Data were collected in a sleep laboratory from nine healthy university students. REMs during REM sleep were recorded during natural nocturnal sleep. Event-related potential time-locked to the onset of REMs were averaged. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to identify the current sources of P200r. The results showed that P200r have neuronal generators in the left premotor area, left primary motor and sensory cortices, left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral occipital areas (precuneus, cuneus and lingual gyrus). All these areas are known to contribute to visuomotor processing. These phasic brain activities might play a key role in explaining the function of REMs during REM sleep.

Neither clinical manifestations, neurological, EEG nor neuropsychological evaluations provide strong information about the area of onset, and fast spread of paroxysms often produces mixed features of occipital, temporal and parietal symptoms. We investigated the usefulness of the N170 event-related potential to map epileptic activity in these patients. Methods: A group of seven patients with symptomatic posterior cortex epilepsy were submitted to a high-resolution EEG (78 electrodes), with recordings of interictal spikes and face-evoked N170. Generators of spikes and N170 were localized by source analysis. Range of normal N170 asymmetry was determined in 30 healthy volunteers. Results: In 3 out of 7 patients the N170 inter-hemispheric asymmetry was outside control values. Those were the patients whose spike sources were nearest (within 3 cm) to the fusiform gyrus, while foci further away did not affect the N170 ratio. Conclusions: N170 event-related potential provides useful information about focal cortical dysfunction produced by epileptic foci located in the close neighborhood of the fusiform gyrus, but are unaffected by foci further away. Significance: The N170 evoked by faces can improve the epileptic foci localization in posterior brain epilepsy. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Five naive subjects were asked to localize a sound stimulus reproduced over one of 8 loudspeakers placed in a circular array, equally spaced by 45 degrees. The subject was seating in the center of the circular array. Due to the complexity of an eight classes classification, our approach consisted on feeding our classifier with two classes, or spatial directions, at the time. The seven chosen pairs were 0, which was the loudspeaker directly in front of the subject, with all the other seven directions. The discrete wavelet transform was used to extract features in the time-frequency domain and a support vector machine performed the classification procedure. The average accuracy over all subjects and all pair of spatial directions was 76.5%,sigma = 3.6. The results of this study provide evidence that the direction of a sound is encoded in single-trial auditory event-related potentials.

EEG correlated functional MRI and postoperative outcome in focal epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DISCHARGES; RESPONSES; ARTIFACT; SURGERY	Background The main challenge in assessing patients with epilepsy for resective surgery is localising seizure onset. Frequently, identification of the irritative and seizure onset zones requires invasive EEG. EEG correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a novel imaging technique which may provide localising information with regard to these regions. In patients with focal epilepsy, interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) correlated blood oxygen dependent level (BOLD) signal changes were observed in approximately 50% of patients in whom IEDs are recorded. In 70%, these are concordant with expected seizure onset defined by non-invasive electroclinical information. Assessment of clinical validity requires post-surgical outcome studies which have, to date, been limited to case reports of correlation with intracranial EEG. The value of EEG-fMRI was assessed in patients with focal epilepsy who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery, and IED correlated fMRI signal changes were related to the resection area and clinical outcome. Methods Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was recorded in 76 patients undergoing presurgical evaluation and the locations of IED correlated preoperative BOLD signal change were compared with the resected area and postoperative outcome. Results 21 patients had activations with epileptic activity on EEG-fMRI and 10 underwent surgical resection. Seven of 10 patients were seizure free following surgery and the area of maximal BOLD signal change was concordant with resection in six of seven patients. In the remaining three patients, with reduced seizure frequency post-surgically, areas of significant IED correlated BOLD signal change lay outside the resection. 42 of 55 patients who had no IED related activation underwent resection. Conclusion These results show the potential value of EEG-fMRI in presurgical evaluation.

A set of faces was presented in a familiarity judgment (explicit) task and another in an expression judgment (implicit familiarity) task. After recording, these tasks were repeated exchanging the stimuli, and post-recording behavioral data from the familiarity task were used for re-averaging EEG segments from the expression task. Both explicit and implicit processing of famous faces resulted in an enhanced N250. Explicit processing of famous faces was specifically associated with eadier N400 and P600, with increased activity within brain areas involved in identity processing around 250 and 450 ms. These findings suggest different brain dynamics for explicit and implicit face processing, and that implicit processing of the identity in the context of an expression task is mainly associated with the transient activation of face representations in memory.

Feature selection in the human brain: Electrophysiological correlates of sensory enhancement and feature integration	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Feature selection; Attention; Electroencephalography; Oscillatory activity; Gamma band	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; LATENCY DIFFERENCES; HUMAN EEG; FREQUENCY; COLOR; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES	This study examined the latency and amplitude of cortical processes associated with feature-based visual selective attention, using frequency-domain and time-domain measures derived from dense-array electroencephalography. Participants were asked to identify targets based on conjunctions of three types of object features (color, size, and completeness). This procedure aimed to examine (1) the modulation of sensory responses to one or more stimulus features characterizing an object and (2) the facilitation and reduction effects associated with competing features, attended and unattended, in the same object. The selection negativity, an event-related potential measure of sensory amplification for attended features, showed a parametric increase of amplitude as a function of the number of attended features. Late oscillations in the gamma band range were also smaller for stimuli with one or more non-attended visual features but were enhanced for stimuli sharing the overall gestalt with the target. The latency of this late gamma modulation was delayed when two target features were combined, compared to one single discriminative feature. Latency analyses also showed that late bursts of induced high-frequency oscillatory activity peaked around 60 ms later than the selection negativity. Oscillatory activity reflected both selective amplification and competition between object features. These results suggest that sensory amplification of selected features is followed by integrative processing in more widespread networks. Oscillatory activity in these networks is reduced by distraction and is enhanced when attended features can be mapped to specific action. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The observer observed: Frontal EEG asymmetry and autonomic responses differentiate between another person's direct and averted gaze when the face is seen live	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motivation; Gaze direction; Face perception; Electroencephalography; Social cognition	EYE CONTACT; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; PERCEPTION; EMOTION; SEX; ERP; NEUROSCIENCE; EXPRESSIONS; DOMINANCE; COGNITION	Recently, we showed that another person's gaze direction influenced the perceiver's frontal EEG asymmetry and autonomic arousal in response to freely viewed real faces, but not in response to face pictures. However, the lack of a task during the viewing may have resulted in less attention allocation to face pictures vs. live faces. In the present study, the participants performed two online tasks while viewing the faces presented live through an electronic shutter and as pictures on a computer screen. The results replicated those from our previous experiment showing that direct gaze elicited greater relative left-sided frontal EEG asymmetry and autonomic arousal than averted gaze but, again, only in the live condition. However, the results also showed that two live stimulus faces (male and female) elicited differential EEG asymmetry responses in our participants (all females), and the effects of gaze direction were observed only for the (live) female faces. The results suggest that the discriminative responses to live faces vs. pictures are likely to reflect the participants' enhanced mental-state attributions and self-awareness when looking at and being looked by live faces. Thus, the motivation- and affect-related psychophysiological responses to gaze direction are most discriminative in the presence of another person, regardless of whether the face/gaze is actively monitored or not.

J	Wessel, JR; Danielmeier, C; Ullsperger, M				Wessel, Jan R.; Danielmeier, Claudia; Ullsperger, Markus			Error Awareness Revisited: Accumulation of Multimodal Evidence from Central and Autonomic Nervous Systems	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE RESPONSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ANTISACCADE TASK; ADAPTIVE GAIN; NEURAL SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE	The differences between erroneous actions that are consciously perceived as errors and those that go unnoticed have recently become an issue in the field of performance monitoring. In EEG studies, error awareness has been suggested to influence the error positivity (Pe) of the response-locked event-related brain potential, a positive voltage deflection prominent approximately 300 msec after error commission, whereas the preceding error-related negativity (ERN) seemed to be unaffected by error awareness. Erroneous actions, in general, have been shown to promote several changes in ongoing autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, yet such investigations have only rarely taken into account the question of subjective error awareness. In the first part of this study, heart rate, pupillometry, and EEG were recorded during an antisaccade task to measure autonomic arousal and activity of the CNS separately for perceived and unperceived errors. Contrary to our expectations, we observed differences in both Pe and ERN with respect to subjective error awareness. This was replicated in a second experiment, using a modified version of the same task. In line with our predictions, only perceived errors provoke the previously established post-error heart rate deceleration. Also, pupil size yields a more prominent dilatory effect after an erroneous saccade, which is also significantly larger for perceived than unperceived errors. On the basis of the ERP and ANS results as well as brain-behavior correlations, we suggest a novel interpretation of the implementation and emergence of error awareness in the brain. In our framework, several systems generate input signals (e. g., ERN, sensory input, proprioception) that influence the emergence of error awareness, which is then accumulated and presumably reflected in later potentials, such as the Pe.

Largely unknown, however, is the degree to which different neuronal events (i.e., excitation and inhibition) maintain or disrupt the neural-hemodynamic relationship, especially in humans. In the present study, we compared local electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations and the positive/negative BOLD responses of simultaneously recorded data from healthy human volunteers performing unilateral finger tapping at graded rates. By quantifying the single-trial modulations of EEG using source imaging, we tested for their correlation with positive BOLD response (PBR) and negative BOLD response (NBR) after coregistering their spatial locations. PBR was found to be overlapped with and correlated to the decrease of alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) band EEG in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Regional EEG modulations at the sensorimotor cortex further predicted a spatially distributed and interconnected network of motor-related cortical areas. Alternatively, no significant correlation was found at the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex between the NBR and EEG despite their spatial overlapping. This differential electrophysiological coupling of the positive and negative BOLD responses suggests that the underlying neuronal events may not only influence the direction of the signal change but also the neural-hemodynamic relationship.

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the EFRPs vary during consecutive eye fixations while subjects were performing an object identification task. Eye fixations evoked P1 and N1 components at the occipital and parietal recording sites. The latency of P1 component increased during consecutive fixations. The amplitude of P1 increased and the amplitude of N1 decreased during consecutive fixations. The results indicate that EFRPs are modulated during consecutive fixations, suggesting that the current technique may provide a useful tool to study temporal dynamics of visual perception and processes underlying object identification.

The impact of emotion on respiratory-related evoked potentials	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dyspnea; EEG; Emotion; Perception; Respiration; Respiratory-related evoked potential	INSPIRATORY RESISTIVE LOADS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SYMPTOM PERCEPTION; PSYCHOLOGICAL-ASPECTS; AIRWAY OCCLUSION; DYSPNEA; ASTHMA; ATTENTION; PAIN; ANXIETY	Emotion influences the perception of respiratory sensations, although the specific mechanism underlying this modulation is not yet clear. We examined the impact of viewing pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant affective pictures on the respiratory-related evoked potential (RREP) elicited by a short inspiratory occlusion in healthy volunteers. Reduced P3 amplitude of the RREP was found for respiratory probes presented when viewing pleasant or unpleasant series, when compared to those presented during the neutral series. Earlier RREP components, such as Nf, P1, N1, and P2, showed no modulation by emotion. The results suggest that emotion impacts the perception of respiratory sensations by reducing the attentional resources available for processing afferent respiratory sensory signals.

In this study, we investigate whether and how the processing of prosodic constraints can be distinguished from the processing of semantic constraints by measuring changes in event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power. We visually presented Chinese sentences containing verb noun combinations that were semantically congruent or incongruent and that had normal or abnormal rhythmic patterns and asked participants to judge whether the sentences were semantically and rhythmically acceptable. In Chinese, the rhythmic pattern refers to the combination of words with different syllable lengths. While the [1+1] pattern is normal for a verb noun combination, the [2+1] pattern is abnormal. With the critical nouns, we found that the violation of semantic constraints was associated with the low beta (16-20 Hz) decrease in the early window (0-200 ms post onset) and the alpha (10-15 Hz) and low beta decrease in the later window (400-657 ms) while the processing of the abnormal rhythmic pattern was associated with the theta (4-6 Hz) and the alpha increase in the early window and the alpha and upper beta (20-24 Hz) decrease in the later window. These findings suggest that although the processing of semantic constraints and the processing of rhythmic pattern may partially share neuro-cognitive processes, as reflected by the similar decreases in alpha band power, they can nevertheless be differentiated in EEG responses during sentence reading.

We recorded event-related potential (ERPs) in 30 individuals with dental phobia (15 women, 15 men with comparable disorder severity) and 30 nonphobic controls (15 women, 15 men) while they passively viewed pictures depicting dental treatment, generally fear-eliciting, disgust-eliciting and neutral contents. Male and female individuals with dental phobia as compared with controls displayed an enlarged centro-parietal late positivity (300-1500 ms). Gender difference concerned prefrontal ERPs. Only men with dentophobia showed an enhanced positivity towards the phobic relative to the neutral pictures in the time window between 300 and 1500 ms. Such a differentiation was absent in the other groups (male controls, female phobics, female controls). This finding indicates a gender-dependent recruitment of frontal attention networks in dental phobia and might reflect that male and female sufferers of dentophobia differ with regard to controlled attention focusing and cognitive avoidance during exposure.

However, the exact electrophysiological correlates and time-course of this complex process remain unclear. In addition, the potential influence of emotion on this process has not been investigated yet. We recorded high density EEG in healthy adult participants performing a novel perceptual recognition task For each trial, an initial blurred visual scene was first shown, before the actual content of the stimulus was gradually revealed by progressively adding diagnostic high spatial frequency information. Participants were asked to stop this stimulus sequence as soon as they could correctly perform an animacy judgment task. Behavioral results showed that participants reliably gathered perceptual evidence before recognition. Furthermore, prolonged exploration times were observed for pleasant, relative to either neutral or unpleasant scenes. ERP results showed distinct effects starting at 280 ms post-stimulus onset in distant brain regions during stimulus processing, mainly characterized by: (i) a monotonic accumulation of evidence, involving regions of the posterior cingulate cortex/parahippocampal gyrus, and (ii) true categorical recognition effects in medial frontal regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide evidence for the early involvement, following stimulus onset, of non-overlapping brain networks during proactive processes eventually leading to visual object recognition.

Data were collected from 17 participants while neurogenic and myogenic activity was independently varied Several protocols for classifying and discarding components classified as myogenic and non-myogenic artifact (e.g.. Ocular) were systematically assessed, leading to the exclusion of one-third to as much as three-quarters of the variance in the EEG Some, but not all, of these protocols showed adequate performance on the scalp. Indeed. performance was superior to previously validated regression-based techniques. Nevertheless. ICA-based EMG correction exhibited low validity in the intracerebral source-space, likely owing to incomplete separation of neurogenic from myogenic sources. Taken with prior work, this indicates that EMG artifact can Substantially distort estimates of intracerebral spectral activity. Neither regression- nor ICA-based EMG correction techniques provide complete safeguards against such distortions In light of these results, several practical suggestions and recommendations are made for intelligently using ICA to minimize EMG and other common artifacts.

J	Turnip, A; Hong, KS; Jeong, MY				Turnip, Arjon; Hong, Keum-Shik; Jeong, Myung-Yung			Real-time feature extraction of P300 component using adaptive nonlinear principal component analysis	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SEPARATION; PEAK	Background: The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are known to involve the firings of neurons in the brain. The P300 wave is a high potential caused by an event-related stimulus. The detection of P300s included in the measured EEG signals is widely investigated. The difficulties in detecting them are that they are mixed with other signals generated over a large brain area and their amplitudes are very small due to the distance and resistivity differences in their transmittance. Methods: A novel real-time feature extraction method for detecting P300 waves by combining an adaptive nonlinear principal component analysis (ANPCA) and a multilayer neural network is proposed. The measured EEG signals are first filtered using a sixth-order band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 1 Hz and 12 Hz. The proposed ANPCA scheme consists of four steps: pre-separation, whitening, separation, and estimation. In the experiment, four different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) are utilized: 325 ms, 350 ms, 375 ms, and 400 ms. Results: The developed multi-stage principal component analysis method applied at the pre-separation step has reduced the external noises and artifacts significantly. The introduced adaptive law in the whitening step has made the subsequent algorithm in the separation step to converge fast. The separation performance index has varied from -20 dB to -33 dB due to randomness of source signals. The robustness of the ANPCA against background noises has been evaluated by comparing the separation performance indices of the ANPCA with four algorithms (NPCA, NSS-JD, JADE, and SOBI), in which the ANPCA algorithm demonstrated the shortest iteration time with performance index about 0.03. Upon this, it is asserted that the ANPCA algorithm successfully separates mixed source signals. Conclusions: The independent components produced from the observed data using the proposed method illustrated that the extracted signals were clearly the P300 components elicited by task-related stimuli. The experiment using 350 ms ISI showed the best performance. Since the proposed method does not use down-sampling and averaging, it can be used as a viable tool for real-time clinical applications.

During NREM sleep, cortical neurons oscillate approximately once every second between a depolarized upstate, when cortical neurons are actively firing, and a hyperpolarized downstate, when cortical neurons are virtually silent (Destexhe et al., 1999; Steriade et al., 1993a, 2001). Intracellular recordings indicate that the origins of the slow oscillation are cortical and that corticocortical connections are necessary for their synchronization (Amzica and Steriade, 1995; Steriade et al., 1993b; Timofeev and Steriade, 1996; Timofeev et al., 2000). The currents produced by the near-synchronous slow oscillation of large populations of neurons appear on the scalp as electroencephalogram (EEG) slow waves (Amzica and Steriade, 1997). Despite this cellular understanding, questions remain about the role of specific cortical structures in individual slow waves. Early EEG studies of slow waves in humans were limited by the small number of derivations employed and by the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to underlying brain activity (Brazier, 1949; Roth et al., 1956). Functional neuroimaging methods offer exceptional spatial resolution, but lack the temporal resolution to track individual slow waves (Dang-Vu et al., 2008; Maquet, 2000). Intracranial recordings in patient populations are limited by the availability of medically necessary electrode placements and can be confounded by pathology and medications (Cash et al., 2009; Nir et al., 2011; Wenneberg 2010). Source modeling of high-density EEG recordings offers a unique opportunity for neuroimaging sleep slow waves. So far, the results have challenged several of the influential topographic observations about slow waves that had persisted since the original EEG recordings of sleep. These recent analyses revealed that individual slow waves are idiosyncratic cortical events and that the negative peak of the EEG slow wave often involves cortical structures not necessarily apparent from the scalp, like the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus (Murphy et al., 2009). In addition, not only do slow waves travel (Massimini et al., 2004), but they often do so preferentially through the areas comprising the major connectional backbone of the human cortex (Hagmann et al., 2008). In this chapter, we will review the cellular, intracranial recording, and neuroimaging results concerning EEG slow waves. We will also confront a long held belief about peripherally evoked slow waves, also known as K-complexes, namely that they are modality independent and do not involve cortical sensory pathways. The analysis included here is the first to directly compare K-complexes evoked with three different stimulation modalities within the same subject on the same night using high-density EEG.

Learning how brain learns would be the milestone to guide the researchers of artificial intelligence, neurology and psychology. With the advent of "Integrate and Fire" model of neuron proposed about a hundred years ago, the brain research has picked up its pace in the study of different aspects of brain functionality. Many cognitive architectures have been proposed with an aim of simulating and understanding human cognition. On the other hand, many technologies have emerged that can measure the parameters of the brain activity. Among them, Electroencephalogram (EEG) stands as a reliable tool in the study of brain functioning. Simplified wireless EEGs are readily available now which can send data recorded by its electrodes to a computer for further processing. We have chosen this tool to detect different aspects of cognition and to predict the brain functioning behind it. A lot of studies from the past two decades have already revealed varying EEG patterns related to cognition. In this paper, we have proposed to extract different features from visual, tactile, auditory and psychomotor stimuli to work on different cognitive aspects such as memory, emotion, arousal, fatigue and distraction and to investigate its affect on the EEG. A methodology to model cognitive functions by relating the varying event related potential, brain waves, spectral density and latency in EEG outcomes are then related with the stimuli features to predict the cognitive state of mind.

Neurodegeneration weakens neural inter-connectivity, which compromises the precision of neural synchronization processes. Yet, it is widely unknown how far changes in the precision of neural synchronization processes are induced by only slight dysfunctions of striatal neural inter-connectivity and in how far such slight changes may affect action selection processes. We investigated these processes in a sample of 25 pre-HDs and case-matched controls in a modified Go/Nogo task, while assessing neural synchronization processes by means of phase-locking factors (PLFs) as derived from event-related potentials (ERPs). The results show that pre-HDs only encounter problems in response inhibition, when discordant contextual information and sensory input have to be integrated. No deficits were evident, when response inhibition can be based on more habitual stimulus-response mappings, i.e., when contextual and sensory information were congruent. While 'habitual' action selection is unaffected by changes in striatal structures influencing reliability of neural synchronization processes, efficient 'controlled' processes of action seem to be closely dependent upon highly reliable neural synchronization processes. The neurophysiological analysis suggests that especially pre-motor inhibition processes (Nogo-N2) are affected. This was most strongly reflected in a decline in the degree of phase-locking in the Nogo-N2 range. Deficits in pre-HDs seem to emerge as a consequence of phase-locking-behavioural decoupling. Of clinical interest, declines in the precision of phase-locking depended on the amount of the individual's mutant huntingtin exposure and predicted the probability of disease manifestation in the next five years. This suggests that phase-locking parameters may prove useful in future studies evaluating a possible function as a biomarker in Huntington's disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prefrontal direct current stimulation modulates resting EEG and event-related potentials in healthy subjects: A standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA) study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); sLORETA; Major depression; Therapy; Cognition; Prefrontal	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL DC-STIMULATION; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM	Prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode placed on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been reported to enhance working memory in healthy subjects and to improve mood in major depression. However, its putative antidepressant cognitive and behavior action is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the distribution of neuronal electrical activity changes after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and cathodal tDCS of the right supraorbital region using spectral power analysis and standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA). Ten healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS on separate days in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA intensity over the left DLPFC, while the cathode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region. After tDCS, EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting state followed by a working memory (n-back) task. Statistical non-parametric mapping showed reduced left frontal delta activity in the real tDCS condition. Specifically, a significant reduction of mean current densities (sLORETA) for the delta band was detected in the left subgenual PFC, the anterior cingulate and in the left medial frontal gyrus. Moreover, the effect was strongest for the first 5 min (p<0.01). The following n-back task revealed a positive impact of prefrontal tDCS on error rate, accuracy and reaction time. This was accompanied by increased P2- and P3- event-related potentials (ERP) component-amplitudes for the 2-back condition at the electrode Fz. A source localization using sLORETA for the time window 250-450 ms showed enhanced activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus for the 2-back condition. These results suggest that anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and/or cathodal tDCS of the contralateral supraorbital region may modulate regional electrical activity in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to improving working memory performance.

Event-Related Potentials Dissociate Effects of Salience and Space in Biased Competition for Visual Representation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ATTENTION; MECHANISMS; CAPTURE; SUPPRESSION; CORTEX; TARGET	Background: Selective visual attention is the process by which the visual system enhances behaviorally relevant stimuli and filters out others. Visual attention is thought to operate through a cortical mechanism known as biased competition. Representations of stimuli within cortical visual areas compete such that they mutually suppress each others' neural response. Competition increases with stimulus proximity and can be biased in favor of one stimulus (over another) as a function of stimulus significance, salience, or expectancy. Though there is considerable evidence of biased competition within the human visual system, the dynamics of the process remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) to examine neural correlates of biased competition in the human visual system. In two experiments, subjects performed a task requiring them to either simultaneously identify two targets (Experiment 1) or discriminate one target while ignoring a decoy (Experiment 2). Competition was manipulated by altering the spatial separation between target(s) and/or decoy. Both experimental tasks should induce competition between stimuli. However, only the task of Experiment 2 should invoke a strong bias in favor of the target (over the decoy). The amplitude of two lateralized components of the event-related potential, the N2pc and Ptc, mirrored these predictions. N2pc amplitude increased with increasing stimulus separation in Experiments 1 and 2. However, Ptc amplitude varied only in Experiment 2, becoming more positive with decreased spatial separation. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that N2pc and Ptc components may index distinct processes of biased competition-N2pc reflecting visual competitive interactions and Ptc reflecting a bias in processing necessary to individuate task-relevant stimuli.

Deficits in fronto-posterior interactions point to inefficient resource allocation in schizophrenia	ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						schizophrenia; electroencephalography; prefrontal cortex; cortical synchronization	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY TASKS; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-ATTENTION; GLOBAL FUNCTION	Objective: Fronto-posterior networks have been implicated in various cognitive processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. This is the first study on time and frequency resolved fronto-posterior coherence during cognitive control in schizophrenia. Method: We examined 16 schizophrenic/schizoaffective patients and 20 age-matched controls performing a choice-reaction task. Fronto-posterior coherence was analyzed for event-related increases with respect to the inter-trial interval. Furthermore, we compared the two groups for event-related coherence during the task-related time intervals which showed a significant coherence increase with respect to the inter-trial interval, as well as for absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. Results: Event-related coherence was significantly reduced in patients during time intervals (0-250 ms poststimulus) when controls showed significant event-related coherence increases. However, patients showed significantly higher absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. These results pointed to differential deficits in fronto-posterior connectivity during the inter-trial interval and task-related conditions in schizophrenia. Conclusion: Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia might be driven by abnormal fronto-posterior communication. Task-related hypo-connectivity and inter-trial interval hyper-connectivity point to resource allocation deficits. The timing of cortico-cortical interactions during crucial task-related intervals may be impaired, while frontal and posterior areas may exhibit increased interactions between the trials.

The validity of these verbal strategy reports, however, has been repeatedly questioned. In the present electroencephalography study, we compared the association of both approaches with the oscillatory brain responses during arithmetic problem solving. Nineteen adults solved small and large addition and subtraction problems and indicated the applied strategy (fact retrieval vs. procedure use) on a trial-by-trial basis by means of verbal strategy reports. Analysis of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERS/ERD) in theta and alpha frequencies revealed a general convergence of verbal strategy reports and the problem size approach, with fact retrieval being accompanied by higher left-hemispheric theta ERS, and procedural strategies being reflected in higher widespread ERD in the lower alpha band and bilateral parietooccipital ERD in the upper alpha band. A direct comparison of the neurophysiological data from both approaches suggests a higher sensitivity of verbal strategy reports to problem solving strategies applied in mental arithmetic, particularly for large problems. Taken together, the current data provide the first neurophysiological evidence for the validity of verbal strategy reports. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specific styles of emotion regulation have been associated with particular patterns of prefrontal activation. We investigated whether anxious aggressive children would reveal a different pattern of cortical activation than non-anxious aggressive children and normally-developing children. We examined the magnitude and timing of source activation underlying the N2-an ERP associated with inhibitory control-during a goinogo task with a negative emotion induction component (loss of earned points). We estimated cortical activation for two regions of interest-a ventral prefrontal and a dorsomedial prefrontal region-for three 100-ms windows over the range of the N2 (200-500 ms). Anxious aggressive children showed high ventral prefrontal activation in the early window; non-anxious aggressive children showed high ventral prefrontal activation in the late window, but only for the duration of the emotion induction; and normally-developing children showed low ventral prefrontal activation throughout. There were no group differences in dorsomedial prefrontal activation. These results suggest that anxious aggressive children recruit ventral prefrontal activation quickly and indiscriminately, possibly giving rise to their rigid, threat-oriented approach to conflict. The late ventral prefrontal activation seen for non-anxious aggressive children may underlie a more delayed, situation-specific, but ineffective response to frustration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hoffmann, S; Falkenstein, M				Hoffmann, Sven; Falkenstein, Michael			Aging and Error Processing: Age Related Increase in the Variability of the Error-Negativity Is Not Accompanied by Increase in Response Variability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; WORD RECOGNITION; NEURAL SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; OLDER; YOUNGER; LOCALIZATION; DOPAMINE; DYNAMICS; REFLECT	Background: Several studies report an amplitude reduction of the error negativity (Ne or ERN), an event-related potential occurring after erroneous responses, in older participants. In earlier studies it was shown that the Ne can be explained by a single independent component. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether the Ne reduction usually found in older subjects is due to an altered component structure, i.e., a true alteration in response monitoring in older subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two age groups conducted two tasks with different stimulus response mappings and task difficulty. Both groups received fully balanced speed or accuracy instructions and an individually adapted deadline in both tasks. Event-related potentials, Independent Component analysis of EEG-data and between trial variability of the Ne were combined with analysis of error rates, coefficients of variation of RT-data and ex-Gaussian fittings to reaction times. The Ne was examined by means of ICA and PCA, yielding a prominent independent component on error trials, the Ne-IC. The Ne-IC was smaller in the older than the younger subjects for both speed and accuracy instructions. Also, the Ne-IC contributed to a much lesser extent to the Ne in older than in younger subjects. RT distribution parameters were not related to Ne/ERP-variability. Conclusions/Significance: The results show a genuine reduction as well as a different component structure of the Ne in older compared to young subjects. This reduction is not reflected in behaviour, apart from a general slowing of older participants. Also, the Ne decline in the elderly is not due to speed accuracy trade-off. Hence, the results indicate that older subjects can compensate the reduction in control reflected in the reduced Ne, at least in simple tasks that induce reaction slips.

Fourteen patients and 14 controls were presented with phobia-relevant, generally fear-inducing, disgust-inducing and affectively neutral pictures in an EEG/EMG session. ERPs were extracted in the time-windows 340-500 ms (P300) and 550-770 ms (late positive potential, LPP). Relative to controls, phobics showed enhanced amplitudes of P300 and LPP in response to spider pictures. This result is interpreted to reflect motivated attention to emotionally salient stimuli. Moreover, phobics showed enhanced average facial EMG activity of the levator labii and the corrugator supercilii in response to spider pictures, reflecting the negative valence and disgust relevance of spiders. Additionally, spider phobic girls relative to controls showed higher overall disgust proneness and heightened average facial EMG activity in both muscle regions in response to disgust stimuli, possibly revealing a disgust-based origin of spider phobia in children. These aspects should be considered in psychotherapeutic treatment of childhood spider phobia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To explore the modality-specific nature of affective responses, we studied neurophysiological responses (i.e., EEG) of 24 participants during visual, auditory, and audiovisual affect stimulation. The affect induction protocols were validated by participants' subjective ratings and physiological responses (i.e., ECG). Coherent with literature, we found modality-specific responses in the EEG: posterior alpha power decreases during visual stimulation and increases during auditory stimulation, anterior alpha power tends to decrease during auditory stimulation and to increase during visual stimulation. We discuss the implications of these results for multi-modal aBCI.

It is widely used not only in psychological research and clinical diagnosis but also in the brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To elicit the P3 component the odd-ball stimulation protocol is often used. In this paper, design of simple visual odd-ball protocol stimulator, which generates stimuli with predefined parameters, is described. The stimulator also generates additional signals for synchronization with EEG recording computer. Application of the stimulator in experimental work is also presented here.

However, the direct relationship between early activity modulation in sensory cortices during selective encoding and subsequent WM performance has not been established. To explore the influence of selective attention on WM recognition, we used electroencephalography to study the temporal dynamics of top-down modulation in a selective, delayed-recognition paradigm. Participants were presented with overlapped, "double-exposed" images of faces and natural scenes, and were instructed to either remember the face or the scene while simultaneously ignoring the other stimulus. Here, we present evidence that the degree to which participants modulate the early P100 (97-129 msec) event-related potential during selective stimulus encoding significantly correlates with their subsequent WM recognition. These results contribute to our evolving understanding of the mechanistic overlap between attention and memory.

Using major depressive disorder as an example, this paper seeks to review neuroimaging studies and techniques which clinicians will have to master in the future and provides a review of the literature on neuroimaging and quantitative EEG in major depressive disorder.

Pulses were presented at individual taste threshold to excite gustatory fibers selectively without concomitant excitation of trigeminal fibers and at high intensity evoking a prickling and, thus, activating trigeminal fibers. Sour, salty and metallic tastes were reported at both intensities while clear prickling was reported at high intensity only. ERPs exhibited augmented amplitudes and shorter latencies for high intensity. First activations of gustatory areas (bilateral anterior insula, medial orbitofrontal cortex) were observed at 70-80 ms. Common somatosensory regions were more strongly, but not exclusively, activated at high intensity. Our data provide a comprehensive view on the dynamics of cortical processing of the gustatory and trigeminal portions of electric taste and suggest that gustatory and trigeminal afferents project to overlapping cortical areas.

This is nowhere more apparent than in the volume of imagery and video that we can access on a daily basis-for the general public, availability of YouTube video and Google Images, or for the image analysis professional tasked with searching security video or satellite reconnaissance. Which images to look at and how to ensure we see the images that are of most interest to us, begs the question of whether there are smart ways to triage this volume of imagery. Over the past decade, computer vision research has focused on the issue of ranking and indexing imagery. However, computer vision is limited in its ability to identify interesting imagery, particularly as "interesting" might be defined by an individual. In this paper we describe our efforts in developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) which synergistically integrate computer vision and human vision so as to construct a system for image triage. Our approach exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals which are recorded non-invasively via electroencephalography (EEG). The signals we decode are specific for events related to imagery attracting a user's attention. We describe two architectures we have developed for this type of cortically coupled computer vision and discuss potential applications and challenges for the future.

The purpose of the present study was to analyse the sources of poststimulus increases of 1530 Hz oscillations during noxious laser stimulation of four different body regions and to compare the sources of the poststimulus synchronisation with the sources of the N2 component of laser-evoked potential (LEP). In 10 healthy subjects, moderately painful laser stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the right hand, dorsum of the right foot, right groin, and right side of the face. EEG data, recorded from ill scalp sites, were analysed using event-related desynchronisation method and source dipole analysis. A profound amplitude increase of 15-30 Hz oscillations peaking 1-2 s after noxious laser stimulation was found during stimulation of each body part. The sources of these oscillations were located in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex and showed no somatotopic arrangement. The sources of the N2-LEP component were located in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex 25-30 mm rostral to the sources of 15-30 Hz oscillations. The amplitude of the poststimulus synchronisation of 15-30 Hz oscillations correlated (P<0.05) with the amplitude of N2-LEP component. Results show that noxious laser stimuli induce bursts of 15-30 Hz oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex. The poststimulus increases of 15-30 Hz oscillations may stand for transient cortical inhibition possibly aiding temporary suppression of motor programs that have been primed by noxious stimulation.

The theoretical view shared among the investigators is that expressed emotions are founded on motivational circuits in the brain that developed early in evolutionary history to ensure the survival of individuals and their progeny. These circuits react to appetitive and aversive environmental and memorial cues, mediating appetitive and defensive reflexes that tune sensory systems and mobilize the organism for action and underly negative and positive affects. The research reviewed here assesses the reflex physiology of emotion, both autonomic and somatic, studying affects evoked in picture perception, memory imagery, and in the context of tangible reward and punishment, and using the electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), explores the brain's motivational circuits that determine human emotion.

In the current study, electroencephalography was used to test the hypothesis that women would have higher amplitude potentials over frontal and parietal regions ipsilateral to arm movements, relative to men. Event-related slow cortical potentials (SCPs) were collected from 30 participants (15 men and 15 women) during the performance of two visually guided reaching conditions (eyes and arm moved to the same spatial location or moved in opposite directions). The results of the study demonstrate that the amplitudes of SCPs were significantly higher overlying frontal regions of the right hemisphere of women relative to men. These differences were present both during an instructed-delay period prior to receiving a go-signal to initiate movement and during the period just prior to movement initiation. The study also revealed an interaction of Sex and Condition in the parietal region during the pre-movement period. These results suggest that motor preparatory activity in men mainly occurs in the hemisphere contralateral to reaching but that preparatory activity in women is distributed relatively more bilaterally. However, the nature of these differences changes over the time course of the preparatory period and is partially dependent on the type of visuomotor mapping being performed.

To understand what determines this response habituation, we (i) examined the effect of introducing a change in the modality of the repeated stimulus, and (ii) dissected the relative contribution of bottom-up, stimulus-driven changes in modality and top-down, cognitive expectations of such a change, on both laser-evoked and auditory-evoked EEG responses. Multichannel EEG was recorded while participants received trains of three stimuli (S1-S2-S3, a triplet) delivered to the hand dorsum at 1-sec ISI. S3 belonged either to the same modality as S1 and S2 or to the other modality. In addition, participants were either explicitly informed or not informed of the modality of S3. We found that introducing a change in stimulus modality produced a significant dishabituation of the laser-evoked N1, N2, and P2 waves; the auditory N1 and P2 waves; and the laser-and auditory-induced event-related synchronization and desynchronization. In contrast, the lack of explicit knowledge of a possible change in the sensory modality of the stimulus (i. e., uncertainty) only increased the ascending portion of the laser-evoked and auditory-evoked P2 wave. Altogether, these results indicate that bottom-up novelty resulting from the change of stimulus modality, and not top-down cognitive expectations, plays a major role in determining the habituation of these brain responses.

Thalamocortical changes in major depression probed by deconvolution and physiology-based modeling	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Major depression; Melancholic subtype; Auditory event-related potential; Thalamocortical; Mean-field modeling; Deconvolution	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DYNAMICS; EEG; GENERATORS; PARAMETERS; INTERVIEW; RECEPTOR; HEALTHY	Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have been extensively studied in patients with depression, but most studies have focused on purely phenomenological analysis methods, such as component scoring. In contrast, this study applies two recently developed physiology-based methods-fitting using a thalamocortical model of neuronal activity and waveform deconvolution - to data from a selective-attention task in four subject groups (49 patients with melancholic depression, 34 patients with non-melancholic depression, 111 participants with subclinical depressed mood, and 98 healthy controls), to yield insight into physiological differences in attentional processing between participants with major depression and controls. This approach found evidence that: participants with depressed mood, regardless of clinical status, shift from excitation in the thalamocortical system towards inhibition: that clinically depressed participants have decreased relative response amplitude between target and standard waveforms; and that patients with melancholic depression also have increased thalamocortical delays. These findings suggest possible physiological mechanisms underlying different depression subtypes, and may eventually prove useful in motivating new physiology-based diagnostic methods.

J	De Pascalis, V; Varriale, V; D'Antuono, L				De Pascalis, Vilfredo; Varriale, Vincenzo; D'Antuono, Laura			Event-related components of the punishment and reward sensitivity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Monetary Loss/Gain; Event-related brain potentials; Feedback-related negativity; P3 wave; Reinforcement learning; LORETA source localization	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; ACTIVATION-SYSTEM SCALES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; SOURCE-LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION SYSTEMS; BRAIN POTENTIALS	Objective: The present study investigated the properties of feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 component of the event-related potentials (ERPs) and their neural sources localization as neurocognitive correlates of the behavioural inhibition and behavioural activation systems (BIS/BAS). The association between BIS/BAS function and anterior cortical asymmetry was tested. Methods: Fifty right-handed women were investigated with 30-channel recordings during an instrumental Go/No-Go learning task. ERPs were elicited to feedback signals indicating monetary losses and monetary gains. Learning performance, FRN, and P3 amplitude and latency measures were calculated and related to BIS and BAS measures by means of ANOVA and correlation analysis. The neural sources of FRN and P3 components of the ERPs were estimated using LORETA software. A resting EEG-alpha-power (8-13 Hz) asymmetry measure was obtained. Results: High levels of Reward Responsiveness (RR), a first order factor of the BAS, were associated with shorter RTs and enhanced positive feelings. The FRN was larger to signals indicating monetary Loss as compared to monetary Gain and enhanced with higher BIS and individual learning ability. Higher RR scores were related to greater left-sided resting frontal cortical asymmetry associated with approach orientation. High-RR subjects, as compared to Low-RR ones, had a smaller P3 amplitude for Go/Loss signals. The P3 latency to No-Go/Gain signals was the best positive predictor of RR. LORETA source localization for the FRN component displayed significantly higher brain electrical activity in left-fusiform gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus to monetary Loss in comparison to monetary Gain after incorrect No-Go responses. For the P3 wave, the monetary Loss produced significantly higher activations in the left superior parietal lobule, right postcentral gyrus, and in the ACC. Conclusion: The FRN was sensitive to cues of punishment and higher BIS was uniquely related to a larger FRN amplitude on No-Go/Loss trials, linking BIS with conflict monitoring and sensitivity to No-Go cues. Furthermore, the significant interaction found between BIS and RR on FRN amplitude together with the findings linking High-RR levels with shorter RTs, smaller P3 amplitudes and enhanced positive feelings are in line with the hypothesis that both BIS and BAS have the potential to influence punishment-mediated and reward-mediated behaviour. Significance: Results open up new perspectives for future investigations on the relationship between BIS/BAS measures and ERP components to monetary reward during learning.

In addition to standardM/EEG preprocessing, we presently offer three main analysis tools: (i) statistical analysis of scalp-maps, time-frequency images, and volumetric 3D source reconstruction images based on the general linear model, with correction for multiple comparisons using random field theory; (ii) Bayesian M/EEG source reconstruction, including support for group studies, simultaneous EEG and MEG, and fMRI priors; (iii) dynamic causal modelling (DCM), an approach combining neural modelling with data analysis for which there are several variants dealing with evoked responses, steady state responses (power spectra and cross-spectra), induced responses, and phase coupling. SPM8 is integrated with the FieldTrip toolbox, making it possible for users to combine a variety of standard analysis methods with new schemes implemented in SPM and build custom analysis tools using powerful graphical user interface (GUI) and batching tools.

J	Schwartzman, DJ; Kranczioch, C				Schwartzman, David J.; Kranczioch, Cornelia			In the blink of an eye: The contribution of microsaccadic activity to the induced gamma band response	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Microsaccade; Saccadic spike potential; Induced gamma band response; EEG; ICA	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OFF-LINE REMOVAL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL RESPONSES; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; MODULATION	In 2008 an article by Yuval-Greenberg and colleagues initiated a lively debate within the field of induced gamma band research. Their article suggested that scalp-recorded induced gamma band responses (iGBRs) to visual stimuli could be obscured by minute movements of extraocular muscles, called microsaccades, which are associated with the saccadic spike potentials (SPs). Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2008) proposed that the temporal and spectral characteristics of SPs could mask and have been previously mistaken for cortical induced gamma band activity. This review summarises the main findings of the report by Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2008) and the research that has emerged since its publication. Microsaccades and the associated SP waveforms are described in detail and their contribution to the iGBR discussed. Different lines of argument are considered that suggest that the scalp-recorded iGBR exists separate from ocular contributions. The article then considers techniques that are widely used to remove electroencephalogram (EEG) artefacts and their potential adaptation for the removal of SPs. The review closes by pointing to future directions that researchers may explore in order to disentangle neural iGBRs and artefactual, SP-related iGBRs, and to several routes which researchers may consider in order to increase the informative value of their scalp-recorded iGBR data. We conclude that further investigation and testing is necessary to develop signal processing tools that successfully identify and correct SPs in EEG data without distorting the neural iGBR.

J	Tian, Y; Klein, RM; Satel, J; Xu, P; Yao, DZ				Tian, Yin; Klein, Raymond M.; Satel, Jason; Xu, Peng; Yao, Dezhong			Electrophysiological Explorations of the Cause and Effect of Inhibition of Return in a Cue-Target Paradigm	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Facilitation; Inhibition of return (IOR); Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA); Spatially uninformative peripheral cue (SUPC)	REFLEXIVE ATTENTION; EEG; POTENTIALS; LOCATIONS; CAPTURE; FIELD	Facilitation and inhibition of return (IOR) are, respectively, faster and slower responses to a peripherally cued target. In a spatially uninformative peripheral cueing task, facilitation is normally observed when the interval between the cue and target stimulus, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), is shorter than 250 ms, while IOR is normally observed when an SOA greater than 250 ms is used. Since Posner and Cohen's (Attention and performance X, 1984) seminal study, IOR has become an actively investigated component of orienting. In this study, using ERPs and the source localization algorithm, LORETA, we seek to examine the brain mechanisms involved in IOR by localizing the different stages of processing after the appearance of a cue that captures attention exogenously. Unlike previous ERP investigations of IOR, this study analyzes the neural activity (via EEG) produced in response to the cue, prior to the appearance of the target. Neural activations were approximately divided into three stages. In the early stage (110-240 ms), involved activations are in the prefrontal cortex, the bilateral intraparietal cortex, and the contralateral occipito-temporal cortex. In the middle stage (240-350 ms), activations are primarily found in the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In the late stage (350-650 ms), the main activations are in the occipito-parietal cortex, but unlike in the early stage, the activation areas have shifted to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued location. These findings indicate that IOR is related to both attentional and motor response processes and suggest that the time course of initial facilitation and IOR is concurrent and mediated by two neural networks. Building upon our results, electrophysiological, electroencephalographic, and behavioral results in the literature and extending previous spatial theories of IOR, we propose here a spatio-temporal theory of IOR based upon post-cue dynamics.

J	Green, JJ; McDonald, JJ				Green, Jessica J.; McDonald, John J.			Brief Reports: The role of temporal predictability in the anticipatory biasing of sensory cortex during visuospatial shifts of attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; EEG; ERP; Normal volunteers	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; TIME; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATIONS; INCREASES	The presentation of an attention-directing cue elicits a lateralized ERP deflection called the late directing attention positivity (LDAP) and lateralized changes in alpha-band elelctroencephalogram oscillations. Both of these electrophysiological responses have been independently linked to biasing of visual cortex in anticipation of an impending target. However, the LDAP is not always observed, and the link between the ERP and alpha-band modulations remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of advance knowledge of the time of target onset on the ERP and alpha-band responses to cues. The LDAP was present only when the attention-directing cues accurately indicated the time of target appearance, whereas two sequential attention-related alpha-band modulations were observed regardless of the temporal information provided by the cues. Thus, alpha-band activity may be a more reliable index of pretarget biasing of visual cortical activity than lateralized ERP effects.

We sought to identify the pattern of brain activity for actions with and without decision-making, while subjects engaged in an instrumental reward based learning task Event related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed for reference trials (no choice required) and decision trials. To detect brain activity during decision making, classification was applied to classify reference and decision trials. Support vector machine (SVM) with a nonlinear kernel function was used as a classifier. Classification performance was analyzed across subjects and channels to identify brain regions underlying decision-making. For most subjects, we found that reference and decision trials could be classified with greater than 85% accuracy. ERPs from frontocentral areas of the scalp provided, in general, best classification rates. Thus ERPs and SVM classifiers can be used to non-invasively detect decision making in humans.

Indeed, growing evidence suggests serotonin to be an important factor in learning and memory; however, its precise role in executive processes particularly in voluntary attention is less clear. Event-related EEG studies showed the N1 potential to predict top-down attention allocation and implicated the auditory N1 in central serotonergic activity. Dipole analyses and single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI revealed N1 sources in the primary auditory cortex and in the anterior cingulate. In the present study, amplitude variation of the event-related N1 potential was investigated on 72 healthy subjects while performing an auditory novelty oddball paradigm to tap top-down and bottom-up attention allocation. Possible serotonergic effects on voluntary attention were analyzed using allele variants of a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) of the gene encoding the serotonin transporter, a key regulator of serotonergic neurotransmission. Because mental effort has been related to top-down attention and N1 modulation, a measure of stable individual differences in cognitive effort was included. The main result was a strong interaction of 5-HTTLPR and cognitive effort on target N1 amplitude. Greater target-related attention allocation was evident in those carriers of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele who described themselves as being more engaged in effortful processing. We suggest that the observed interaction mirrors the interplay between effort-mediated top-down attention by the ACC and serotonergic adjustment on attentional systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rossion, B; Caharel, S				Rossion, Bruno; Caharel, Stephanie			ERP evidence for the speed of face categorization in the human brain: Disentangling the contribution of low-level visual cues from face perception	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						ERP; N170; P1; Face perception; Object processing; Low and high vision; Amplitude spectrum; Low-level visual cues	HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; SENSITIVE N170; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; SCENE CATEGORIZATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; IMAGE STATISTICS; INVERTED FACES; TIME-COURSE; OBJECT	How fast are visual stimuli categorized as faces by the human brain? Because of their high temporal resolution and the possibility to record simultaneously from the whole brain, electromagnetic scalp measurements should be the ideal method to clarify this issue. However, this question remains debated, with studies reporting face-sensitive responses varying from 50 ms to 200 ms following stimulus onset. Here we disentangle the contribution of the information associated with the phenomenological experience of a face (phase) from low-level visual cues (amplitude spectrum, color) in accounting for early face-sensitivity in the human brain. Pictures of faces and of a category of familiar objects (cars), as well as their phase-scrambled versions, were presented to fifteen human participants tested with high-density (128 channels) EEG. We replicated an early face-sensitivity - larger response to pictures of faces than cars - at the level of the occipital event-related potential (ERP) P1 (80-100 ms). However, a similar larger P1 to phase-scrambled faces than phase-scrambled cars was also found. In contrast, the occipito-temporal N170 was much larger in amplitude for pictures of intact faces than cars, especially in the right hemisphere, while the small N170 elicited by phase-scrambled stimuli did not differ for faces and cars. These findings show that sensitivity to faces on the visual evoked potentials P1 and N1 (N170) is functionally dissociated: the P1 face-sensitivity is driven by low-level visual cues while the N1 (or N170) face-sensitivity reflects the perception of a face. Altogether, these observations indicate that the earliest access to a high-level face representation, that is, a face percept, does not precede the N170 onset in the human brain. Furthermore, they allow resolving apparent discrepancies between the timing of rapid human saccades towards faces and the early activation of high-level facial representations as shown by electrophysiological studies in the primate brain. More generally, they put strong constraints on the interpretation of early (before 100 ms) face-sensitive effects in the human brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When the brain remembers, but the patient doesn't: Converging fMRI and EEG evidence for covert recognition in a case of prosopagnosia	CORTEX			English	Article						FFA; Functional imaging; Event-related potentials; Faces; Awareness	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; FACIAL RECOGNITION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATIONS; ACTIVATION	The role of the occipito-temporal cortex in visual awareness remains an open question and with respect to faces in particular, it is unclear to what extent the fusiform face area (FFA) may be involved in conscious identification. An answer may be gleaned from prosopagnosia, a disorder in which familiar faces are no longer recognized. This impairment has sometimes been reported to be associated with implicit processing of facial identity, although the neural substrates responsible for unconscious processing remain unknown. In this study, we addressed these issues by investigating the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) responses to familiar and unfamiliar faces in a well-known prosopagnosic patient (P.S.). Our fMRI results show that faces known prior to the onset of prosopagnosia produce an increase in activation in the lateral fusiform gyrus encompassing the FFA, as well as the right middle frontal gyrus, when compared to unknown faces. This effect is not observed with photographs of celebrities dating after the onset of prosopagnosia. Furthermore, electrophysiological responses show that previously familiar faces differ from unfamiliar ones at around 550 msec. Since covert processing of familiarity is associated with activation in FFA, this structure does not appear to be sufficient to produce awareness of identity. Furthermore, the results support the view that FFA participates in face individuation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.

Attention selection may be guided by low-level stimulus properties, by the emotional value of the stimulus, or more voluntarily by the goals and plans of the observer. Whether these three systems operate independently during attention selection or not remains a debated question. We report results from two studies investigating the extent to which these different attention mechanisms may interact with one another. Using a standard dot probe paradigm wherein effects of exogenous, emotional, and endogenous attention were orthogonally manipulated, we found attentional facilitation effects for each component, indicated by faster decision times for validly, as opposed to invalidly cued targets. Moreover, results confirmed that these three attentional effects added up in a linear fashion. Complementing ERP results allowed us to disentangle the respective contributions of the two reflexive, bottom-up attention processes (exogenous vs. emotional) by showing non-overlapping temporal loci for attentional effects related either to low-level physical properties or the emotional content of the stimulus. These findings suggest that multiple separate attention mechanisms can operate simultaneously to yield a rapid and efficient visual processing of various classes of potentially relevant stimuli.

Motor imagery tasks included brief and continuous imagined hand movements. During an imagery task, participants imagined an indicated movement for 1 s (i.e., brief movement imagery) or 5 s (i.e., continuous movement imagery). The results of the study support (1) that mu and beta ERD/ERS patterns are elicited during imagined hand movements and (2) that movement duration affects ERS and does not affect ERD patterns, during motor movement imagery. Additionally, brief movement imagery had a greater impact on mu and beta ERD; continuous movement imagery had a greater impact on mu and beta ERS. This research will be useful for designing future brain computer interfaces as it provides valuable insight into the dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory changes during motor imagery tasks with varying movement duration. Relevance to industry: : Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have gained considerable interests by both research and industry communities who want to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from severe motor disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and cerebral palsy (CP). The results of this study should be applied to EEG-based BCI system design in order to enhance accuracy and classification performance for BCI system control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the sub-second amplitude dynamics of a direct neuronal measure, i.e., event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG oscillations during finger movements, in patients with acute cortical and subcortical stroke. Acute cortical strokes were found to decrease the ERD of alpha oscillations for the affected pericentral sensorimotor areas compared to a control group. Within the cortical stroke group, the affected hemisphere showed a smaller alpha-ERD compared to the unaffected hemisphere when each was contralateral to the acting hand. Furthermore, when cortical stroke patients moved their paretic hand, the ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) alpha-ERD was stronger than the contralateral (ipsilesional) ERD. Interestingly, the alpha-ERD amplitude in a hemisphere with a cortical stroke was relatively well preserved for non-paretic hand movements compared to alpha-ERD amplitude for paretic hand movements. This finding provides a new perspective for assessing the rehabilitative potential, which could be utilized through training of the still responsive cortical network, e.g., via enforced use of the paretic hand.

In our study we make a comparison of the effects between multisensory interactions (auditory and visual stimulus). There is no doubt that the interaction between audio-visual stimuli is a very important function in human life. Here, the principle is analyzed and explained that auditory and visual stimuli are effectively integrated by human's primates under most naturalistic conditions. We use the ERP images to analysis the interaction between the visual and auditory stimulus.

Our cognition is thus inextricably linked to our own and others' motor behavior. To model brain activity associated with natural cognition, we propose recording the concurrent brain dynamics and body movements of human subjects performing normal actions. Here we tested the feasibility of such a mobile brain/body (MoBI) imaging approach by recording high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and body movements of subjects standing or walking on a treadmill while performing a visual oddball response task. Independent component analysis of the EEG data revealed visual event-related potentials that during standing, slow walking, and fast walking did not differ across movement conditions, demonstrating the viability of recording brain activity accompanying cognitive processes during whole body movement. Non-invasive and relatively low-cost MoBI studies of normal, motivated actions might improve understanding of interactions between brain and body dynamics leading to more complete biological models of cognition.

Genetic influence demonstrated for MEG-recorded somatosensory evoked responses	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Somatosensory evoked response; Magnetoencephalogram; MEG; Similarities; Monozygotic twins; Dizygotic twins	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN STRUCTURE; POWER; TWINS; HERITABILITY; AMPLITUDE; ALPHA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SKULL	We tested for a genetic influence on magnetoencephalogram (MEG)-recorded somatosensory evoked fields (SEFs) in 20 monozygotic (MZ) and 14 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies that demonstrated a genetic contribution to evoked responses generally focused on characteristics of representative brain potentials. Here we demonstrate significantly smaller amplitude differences within MZ compared to DZ twin pairs for the complete SEF time series (across left and right hand SEFs: 0.37 vs. 0.60 pT(2) and 0.28 vs. 0.39 pT(2) for primary [SI] and secondary [SII] sensory cortex activation) and higher MZ than DZ wave shape correlations (.71 vs. .44 and .52 vs. .35 for SI and SII activation). Our findings indicate a genetic influence on MEG-recorded evoked brain activity and also confirm our recent conclusion (van 't Ent, van Soelen, Stam, De Geus, & Boomsma, 2009) that higher MZ resemblance for EEG amplitudes is not trivially reflecting greater MZ concordance in intervening biological tissues.

A performance study of the wavelet-phase stability (WPS) in auditory selective attention	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Wavelet phase-stability; Auditory selective attention; Wavelet coherence; Correlation coefficient	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LABILE BRAIN; EVOKED POTENTIALS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; TRANSIENTS; COHERENCE; SIGNAL; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION	Large-scale neural correlates of auditory selective attention reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been identified by using the complex wavelet-phase stability measure (WPS). In this paper, we study the feasibility of using this amplitude independent measure, the WPS in extracting the correlates of attention by comparing its performance to the widely used linear interdependency measures, i.e., the wavelet coherence and the correlation coefficient. The outcome reveals that the WPS outperforms the other two measures in discriminating both the attended and unattended single sweep auditory late responses (ALRs). It is concluded that the proposed WPS provides a faster (in terms of less sweeps which are required) and robust objective quantification of selective attention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, the precise nature of the task-induced alpha modulation remains elusive. It was not clear whether alpha/beta rhythm Suppressions may co-vary with BOLD when conducting tasks involving varying activations of the cortex Here, we quantified the task-evoked responses of BOLD and alpha/beta-band power of EEG directly in the cortical source domain, by using Source imaging technology, and examined their covariation across task conditions in a mixed block and event-related design. In this study, 13 subjects performed tasks of right-hand, right-foot or left-hand movement and motor imagery when EEG and fMRI data were separately collected Task-induced increase of BOLD signal and decrease of EEG amplitudes in alpha and beta bands were shown to be co-localized at the somatotopic sensorimotor cortex At the corresponding regions. the reciprocal changes of the two signals co-varied in the magnitudes across imagination and movement conditions The spatial correspondence and negative covariation between the two measurements were further shown to exist at somatotopic brain regions associated with different body parts These results Suggest an inverse functional coupling relationship between task-induced changes of BOLD and low-frequency EEG signals (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Control of a Visual Keyboard Using an Electrocorticographic Brain-Computer Interface	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electrocorticography; event-related potentials; P300 speller	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BCI OPERATION; HUMANS; SIGNAL; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; PEOPLE; SYSTEM; NOISE; EEG	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that enable severely disabled people to communicate and interact with their environments using their brain waves. Most studies investigating BCI in humans have used scalp EEG as the source of electrical signals and focused on motor control of prostheses or computer cursors on a screen. The authors hypothesize that the use of brain signals obtained directly from the cortical surface will more effectively control a communication/ spelling task compared to scalp EEG. Methods. A total of 6 patients with medically intractable epilepsy were tested for the ability to control a visual keyboard using electrocorticographic (ECOG) signals. ECOG data collected during a P300 visual task paradigm were preprocessed and used to train a linear classifier to subsequently predict the intended target letters. Results. The classifier was able to predict the intended target character at or near 100% accuracy using fewer than 15 stimulation sequences in 5 of the 6 people tested. ECOG data from electrodes outside the language cortex contributed to the classifier and enabled participants to write words on a visual keyboard. Conclusions. This is a novel finding because previous invasive BCI research in humans used signals exclusively from the motor cortex to control a computer cursor or prosthetic device. These results demonstrate that ECOG signals from electrodes both overlying and outside the language cortex can reliably control a visual keyboard to generate language output without voice or limb movements.

Event-related delta and theta brain oscillations reflect age-related changes in both a general and a specific neuronal inhibitory mechanism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; ERP; Intraindividual variability; Time-frequency analysis; Response inhibition; Go/NoGo	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; LIFE-SPAN CHANGES; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; GO NOGO TASKS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP COMPONENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	Objective: ERPs may be limited in validity when investigating inhibitory functions in later adulthood, as age-related increases in intraindividual variability and changes in EEG-oscillations are not considered. The present study compared averaged ERP peak and single trial time-frequency (TF) data analysis. Methods: Go/NoGo ERP waves amplitude/latency measures were compared with a TF analysis estimating single trial event-related EEG spectral power enhancement and intertrial phase-locking (ITC) in delta and theta band. Results: Age-related larger ITC was found for theta oscillations in the N2-P3 time range during NoGo, only. Discrepancies between N1/N2 ERP and TF results were obtained. Go/NoGo-P3 amplitude reductions in elderly were not related to an increased delta latency jitter. Conclusions: Discrepancies between ERPs and TF results challenge conclusions made about age-related changes in Go/NoGo-N2. Earlier reports of age-related changes in P3 are supported by the present results. The study implies age-related impairments in a general neuronal inhibition mechanism and a specific response inhibition mechanism. Significance: The study indicates long-range communication impairments in the aged brain and the results are discussed considering hypotheses on increases in neural noise.

This increased responsiveness may either indicate a lack of executive control or reflect compensatory efforts to cope with the reduced internal motor drive. Of interest in this context is whether responsiveness is already enhanced in the presymptomatic stage of PD. To address these questions, we studied a group of non-manifesting carriers of heterozygous Parkin and PINK1 mutations while they performed a choice-response task with response-compatible or incompatible flankers. These mutation carriers may be considered a model for pre-clinical PD because the mutant allele leads to a latent nigrostriatal dysfunction and may increase the risk for PD. For comparison, we studied groups of medicated patients with idiopathic PD and of healthy persons age-matched to the mutation carriers and to the patients. Measurements of reaction time, error rate, and the lateralized readiness potential of the EEG provided converging evidence that the mutation carriers were less responsive to distracting flankers than their healthy control group. In contrast, PD patients were more distractible by flankers than their control group, which replicated previous results. Mutation carriers also showed a smaller N2 component of the event-related EEG potential in trials with incompatible flankers relative to their control group, which might indicate reduced inhibitory control. We hypothesize that faulty executive control is the primary deficit, reflected by the reduced N2 component in the mutation carriers. To compensate for this deficit, mutation carriers change their strategy of speed-accuracy trade-off, in order to dampen the excitability of their lateral motor system. Disease progression might prevent symptomatic PD patients from using this compensatory mechanism, leading to increased disinhibition of their lateral motor system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Continuous EEG was recorded in 43 aMCI patients, whose 16 sd-aMCI and 27 md-aMCI, and 36 age-matched controls (EC) during delayed match-to-sample tasks for face and letter stimuli. At encoding, attended stimuli elicited parietal alpha (8-12 Hz) power decrease (desynchronization), whereas distracting stimuli were associated with alpha power increase (synchronization) over right central sites. No difference was observed in parietal alpha desynchronization among the three groups. For attended faces, the alpha synchronization underlying suppression of distracting letters was reduced in both aMCI subgroups, but more severely in md-aMCI cases that differed significantly from EC. At retrieval, the early N250r recognition effect was significantly reduced for faces in md-aMCI as compared to both sd-aMCI and EC. The results suggest a differential alteration of working memory cerebral processes for faces in the two aMCI subtypes, face covert recognition processes being specifically altered in md-aMCI.

This phase is necessary due to the high non-stationarity of the EEG, since it changes between sessions and users. The calibration process limits the BCI systems to scenarios where the outputs are very controlled, and makes these systems non-friendly and exhausting for the users. Although it has been studied how to reduce calibration time for asynchronous signals, it is still an open issue for event-related potentials. Here, we propose the minimization of the calibration time on single-trial error potentials by using classifiers based on inter-subject information. The results show that it is possible to have a classifier with a high performance from the beginning of the experiment, and which is able to adapt itself making the calibration phase shorter and transparent to the user.

DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX STIMULATION MODULATES ELECTROCORTICAL MEASURES OF VISUAL ATTENTION: EVIDENCE FROM DIRECT BILATERAL EPIDURAL CORTICAL STIMULATION IN TREATMENT-RESISTANT MOOD DISORDER	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain stimulation; attention; IAPS; late positive potential	EMOTIONAL PICTURES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ASSOCIATION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; AMYGDALA; ORGANIZATION; REAPPRAISAL; ACTIVATION; CIRCUITRY	Electrocortical activity is increasingly being used to study emotion regulation and the impact of cognitive control on neural response to visual stimuli. In the current study, we used direct epidural cortical stimulation (EpCS) to examine regional specificity of PFC stimulation on the parietally-maximal late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) biomarker of visual attention to salient stimuli. Five patients with treatment-resistant mood disorders were stereotactically implanted with stimulating paddles over frontopolar (FP) and dorsolateral (DL) prefrontal cortex bilaterally. On their first day of activation, patients underwent sham-controlled EpCS coupled with 64-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings and passive viewing of aversive and neutral images. In addition to sham, patients had either FP or DL prefrontal cortex stimulated at 2 or 4 V while they viewed neutral and aversive pictures. As expected during the sham condition, LPP was larger for aversive compared to neutral stimuli (F(1,4)=232.07, P<.001). Stimulation of DL compared to FP prefrontal cortex resulted in a reduction of the LPP (F(1,4)=8.15, P=.048). These data provide additional and unique support to the role of the DL prefrontal cortex in regulating measures of neural activity that have been linked to emotional arousal and attention. Future studies with EpCS can help directly map out various prefrontal functions in treatment-resistant mood disorder. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, Still a considerable discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed More parameter tuning, thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.

When this correlation is done using the conventional univariate approach, for example with the general linear model, there is the usual problem of correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons. Cluster thresholding is often used as the correction of choice, though in many cases it is utilized in an ad hoc way, for example by employing the same cluster thresholds for both traditional regressors (stimulus or behaviorally derived) and EEG-derived regressors. In this paper we describe a resampling procedure that takes into account the a priori statistics of the trial-to-trial variability of the EEG-derived regressors in a way that trades off cluster size and maximum voxel z-score to properly correct for multiple comparisons. We show that this data adaptive procedure improves sensitivity for smaller clusters of activation, without sacrificing the specificity of the results. Our results suggest that extra care is needed in correcting statistics when the regressor model is derived from noisy and/or uncertain measurements, as is the case for regressors constructed from single-trial variations in the EEG.

A novel approach for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and detecting automatically event-related potentials (ERPs) in single trials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); N1 wave; Single-trial analysis; independent component analysis (ICA); Wavelet filtering; Multiple linear regression; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; HAIRY SKIN; HUMANS; STIMULI; CO2-LASER; DYNAMICS; FMRI	Brief radiant laser pulses can be used to activate cutaneous A delta and C nociceptors selectively and elicit a number of transient brain responses in the ongoing EEG (N1, N2 and P2 waves of laser-evoked brain potentials, LEPs). Despite its physiological and clinical relevance, the early-latency N1 wave of LEPs is often difficult to measure reliably, because of its small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus producing unavoidable biases in the interpretation of the results. Here, we aimed to develop a method to enhance the SNR of the N1 wave and measure its peak latency and amplitude in both average and single-trial waveforms. We obtained four main findings. First, we suggest that the N1 wave can be better detected using a central-frontal montage (Cc-Fz), as compared to the recommended temporal-frontal montage (Tc-Fz). Second, we show that the N1 wave is optimally detected when the neural activities underlying the N2 wave, which interfere with the scalp expression of the NI wave, are preliminary isolated and removed using independent component analysis (ICA). Third, we show that after these N2-related activities are removed, the SNR of the N1 wave can be further enhanced using a novel approach based on wavelet filtering.

A Coronary-Prone Type of Personality: Peculiarities of Event-Related EEG Potentials	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						type-A behavior; coronary-prone type of personality; Jenkins questionnaire; readiness potential; contingent negative variation; P300 potential; time of reaction; estimation of the time interval	A-BEHAVIOR PATTERN; STIMULUS ANTICIPATION; MOTOR PREPARATION; TIME	In a group of 70 adults of both sexes, we examined interrelations between the estimates of expression of a coronary-prone type (type A) of the personality (measured using the Jenkins questionnaire) and the parameters of event-related EEG potentials (ERPs). The latter potentials were recorded in the course of performance of two behavioral test tasks including motor components. Within the framework of the "A" task, the subject is had to maximally rapidly push the button after a signal with warning (with measurement of the latency of the sensorimotor reaction); under these conditions, we recorded the contingent negative variation (CNV) and P300 potential. In the case of the "B" task, a definite time interval was to be measured and limited by two pressings of the button. In this task, the readiness potential (RP) was recorded in addition to the CNV and P300. The C3 and C4 EEG leads (according to the 10-20 system) were used. Within the framework of the "A" task, subjects belonging to the coronary-prone type were characterized by the lowest amplitudes of the CNV and its separate components and also by greater amplitudes and relatively long latencies of the P300 wave. Persons of type B were distinguished by the highest CNV amplitudes in both hemispheres, while values of the P300 amplitude in this group were usually medium. In the "B" task, representatives of type A demonstrated the lowest RP and P300 amplitudes, especially clearly pronounced negative CNVs in the left hemisphere, and relatively long P300 latencies; individuals belonging to type B showed the highest RP and CNV amplitudes in the right hemisphere and medium values of the P300 amplitude. The correlations found are probably due, to a considerable extent, to the fact that both characteristics of the behavioral types A and B and amplitude parameters of ERPs depend significantly on genetically determined neurochemical factors, namely specificities of organization and functioning of a few neurotransmitter (in particular, aminergic) and neurohumoral systems.

Although many studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of item maintenance, little is known about the neural mechanisms of temporal order maintenance in WM. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare neural oscillations during WM tasks that required maintenance of item or temporal order information. Behavioral results revealed that accuracy and reaction times were comparable between the two conditions, suggesting that task difficulty was matched between the item and temporal order WM tasks. EEG analyses indicated that theta (5-7 Hz) oscillations over prefrontal sites were increased during temporal order maintenance, whereas alpha oscillations (9-12 Hz) over posterior parietal and lateral occipital sites were increased during item maintenance. The frontal theta enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the order WM task, whereas the posterior alpha enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the item WM task. These results support the idea that frontal theta and posterior alpha oscillations are differentially related to maintenance of item and temporal order information.

However, corresponding functional neuroimaging models are difficult to reconcile with functional imaging and electrophysiological findings in schizophrenia. Resolving the discrepancies between different observational levels is critical to understand the complex pharmacological ketamine action and its usefulness for modeling schizophrenia pathophysiology. Methods: We conducted a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacoimaging study in twenty-four male volunteers. Subjects were given low-dose S-ketamine (bolus prior to functional imaging: 0.1 mg/kg during 5 min, thereafter continuous infusion: 0.015625 mg/kg/min reduced by 10% every ten minutes) or placebo while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with continuous recording of event-related potentials (P300) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Before and after intervention, psychopathological status was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale. Results: P300 amplitude and corresponding BOLD responses were diminished in the ketamine condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory processing/selective attention. In both measurement modalities separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.8-0.9. Ketamine effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral physiological domains (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, reaction hit and false alarm rate, electrodermal activity and heart rate) which were in part related to the P300/fMRI measures. Conclusion: The findings from our ketamine experiment are consistent across modalities and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the validity of the model. Our investigation provides the first prototypic example of a pharmacoimaging study using simultaneously acquired fMRI/EEG. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

So far, we have insufficient knowledge concerning the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying this kind of non-substance-related addiction. The objective of the study was to investigate emotional processing of gambling-relevant and -irrelevant stimuli in pathological gamblers and non-gambling controls using an EEG cue-reactivity paradigm. Whereas gambling-irrelevant stimuli were processed similarly in non-gambling controls (HC) and pathological gamblers (PG), PG showed significantly stronger gambling-relevant stimulus-induced psychophysiological cue-reactivity (larger gambling stimulus-induced late positive potential. LPP, higher arousal and more positively toned valence ratings as well as higher stimulus-induced craving for gambling cues compared to HC - but not the expectable increase of general craving over time and after stimulus presentation). Our findings suggest enhanced cue-reactivity in pathological gamblers indicative of learned motivated attention that may induce subjective craving and relapse. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Referential recordings to linked ears were obtained in 21 leads in 48 right-handed healthy male volunteers. Increase of delta power (1.75-3.91 Hz) was observed, related to the detection of distortion in faces at bifrontal and left temporoparietal cortex. The other bands had no contribution, when normal and modified faces were compared. These results support our hypothesis that a change in EEG power spectral may be related to discrimination between normal and thatcherized faces.

Indeed, such articulation artifacts are typically much larger than the brain signal of interest. Recently, a Blind Source Separation technique based on Canonical Correlation Analysis was proposed to separate tonic muscle artifacts from continuous EEG recordings in epilepsy. In this paper, we show how the same algorithm can be adapted to remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation on every trial. Several analyses indicate that this method accurately attenuates the muscle contamination on the EEG recordings, providing to the neurolinguistic community a powerful tool to investigate the brain processes at play during overt language production.

EEG signatures of auditory activity correlate with simultaneously recorded fMRI responses in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Single-trial; Event-related potential; Time-frequency analysis; Auditory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ACOUSTIC NOISE; TIME-COURSE; 3-T FMRI; CORTEX; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION	We recorded auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) during simultaneous, continuous fMRI and identified trial-to-trial correlations between the amplitude of electrophysiological responses, characterised in the time domain and the time-frequency domain, and the hemodynamic BOLD response. Cortical AEPs were recorded from 30 EEG channels within the 3 T MRI scanner with and without the collection of simultaneous BOLD fMRI. Focussing on the Cz (vertex) EEG response, single-trial AEP responses were measured from time-domain waveforms. Furthermore, a novel method was used to characterise the single-trial AEP response within three regions of interest in the time-frequency domain (TF-ROIs). The latency and amplitude values of the N1 and P2 AEP peaks during fMRI scanning were not significantly different from the Control session (p>0.16). BOLD fMRI responses to the auditory Stimulation were observed in bilateral secondary auditory cortices as well as in the right precentral and postcentral gyri, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor cortex (SMC). Significant single-trial correlations were observed with a voxel-wise analysis, between (I) the magnitude of the EEG TF-ROI1 (70-800 MS post-stimulus, 1-5 Hz) and the BOLD response in right primary (Heschl's gyrus) and secondary (STG, planum temporale) auditory cortex; and (2) the amplitude of the P2 peak and the BOLD response in left pre- and postcentral gyri, the ACC and SMC. No correlation was observed with single-trial NI amplitude on a voxel-wise basis. An fMRI-ROI analysis of functionally-identified auditory responsive regions identified further single-trial correlations of BOLD and EEG responses. The TF amplitudes in TF-ROI1 and TF-RO12 (20-400 ms post-stimulus, 5-15 Hz) were significantly correlated with the BOLD response in all bilateral auditory areas investigated (planum temporale, superior temporal gyrus and Heschl's gyrus). However the N1 and P2 peak amplitudes, occurring at similar latencies did not show a correlation in these regions. N1 and P2 peak amplitude did correlate with the BOLD response in bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri and the SMC. Additionally P2 and TF-ROI1 both correlated with the ACC. TF-ROI3 (400-900 ms post-stimulus. 4-10 Hz) correlations were only observed in the ACC and SMC. Across the group, the subject-mean N1 peak amplitude correlated with the BOLD response amplitude in the primary and secondary auditory cortices bilaterally, as well as the right precentral gyrus and SMC. We confirm that auditory-evoked EEG responses can be recorded during continuous and simultaneous fMRI. We have presented further evidence of an empirical single-trial coupling between the EEG and BOLD fMRI responses, and show that a time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals can yield additional BOLD fMRI correlates, predominantly in auditory cortices, beyond those found using the, evoked response amplitude alone.

In this paper, we present a new method that utilizes multiresolution autoregression of multichannel time series (MAMTS) for feature extraction of P300 wave. First, it adopts multiresolution autoregression on dyadic tree to depict the characteristic of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Then the corresponding autoregression noise of multichannel time series is extracted as the feature. The experiment results verified the effectiveness of this new feature for P300 speller brain compute interface (BCI).

SINGLE-TRIAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM PREDICTS CARDIAC ACCELERATION: A TIME-LAGGED P-CORRELATION APPROACH FOR STUDYING NEUROVISCERAL CONNECTIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; feedback related negativity; P300; P2a; heart period; P-correlation	BLOOD-PRESSURE RESPONSES; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VAGAL TONE; PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK; AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CINGULATE CORTEX; MODEL	Cortical efferences to the heart are important for cardiovascular health, psychopathology, emotion regulation and other dimensions of human functioning. Although researchers have already begun to outline the underlying neuroanatomy, the timing of neurovisceral communication in humans is difficult to study non-invasively. A possible coupling between the brain and the heart can be observed following feedback stimuli, which have been shown to evoke both, early (i.e. <500 ms) signatures in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and changes in the chronotropy of subsequent heart beats. Because standard approaches may be insufficient to study how these responses are related, we suggest a method termed "Cardio-Electroencephalographic Covariance Tracing" (CECT), which is based on time-lagged P-correlations (i.e., correlations within individuals) between single-trial EEG magnitudes and heart period changes. When CECT was applied to data from n=31 individuals who performed a gambling task, central midline EEG magnitudes from 280 to 340 ms after feedback reliably P-correlated with cardiac acceleration 2 to 5 s thereafter. In addition positive vs. negative feedback lead to enhanced event related potential amplitudes from 200 to 280 ms and to relative cardiac acceleration from 1 to 3.5 s after feedback presentation. The results imply that neurogenic cardiac modulations begin to be affected 200 to 400 ms after stimulus presentation and demonstrate the utility of CECTs for future investigations. (C) 2010 IBRO.

J	Rajagovindan, R; Ding, MZ				Rajagovindan, Rajasimhan; Ding, Mingzhou			From Prestimulus Alpha Oscillation to Visual-evoked Response: An Inverted-U Function and Its Attentional Modulation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SENSORY RESPONSES; PHASE-RESET; EEG; CORTEX; BAND; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; SUMMATION	Understanding the relation between prestimulus neural activity and subsequent stimulus processing has become an area of active investigation. Computational modeling, as well as in vitro and in vivo single-unit recordings in animal preparations, have explored mechanisms by which background synaptic activity can influence the responsiveness of cortical neurons to afferent input. How these mechanisms manifest in humans is not well understood. Although numerous EEG/MEG studies have considered the role of prestimulus alpha oscillations in the genesis of visual-evoked potentials, no consensus has emerged, and divergent reports continue to appear. The present work addresses this problem in three stages. First, a theoretical model was developed in which the background synaptic activity and the firing rate of a neural ensemble are related through a sigmoidal function. The derivative of this function, referred to as local gain, has an inverted-U shape and is postulated to be proportional to the trial-by-trial response evoked by a transient stimulus. Second, the theoretical model was extended to noninvasive studies of human visual processing, where the model variables are reinterpreted in terms of ongoing EEG oscillations and event-related potentials. Predictions were derived from the model and tested by recording high-density scalp EEG from healthy volunteers performing a trial-by-trial cued spatial visual attention task. Finally, enhanced stimulus processing by attention was linked to an increase in the overall slope of the sigmoidal function. The commonly observed reduction of alpha magnitude with attention was interpreted as signaling a shift of the underlying neural ensemble toward an optimal excitability state that enables the increase in global gain.

Altered emotional information processing in borderline personality disorder: An electrophysiological study	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Borderline personality disorder; Emotional processing; Late positive potentials	STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW; AFFECTIVE INSTABILITY; UNPLEASANT PICTURES; EEG ABNORMALITIES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SLEEP-EEG; AMYGDALA; ANTIPSYCHOTICS; HYPERVIGILANCE; IMPULSIVITY	Emotional dysregulation is one of the key symptoms of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the present study it is hypothesized that borderline patients display a cortical hyper-responsivity to emotional stimuli compared with a healthy control group. Further, we aimed to examine whether BPD patients were able to suppress stimuli with negative emotional valence as well as healthy control participants could. This is the first study addressing the electrophysiological processing of emotional stimuli in BPD. The electrophysiological response to emotional information was studied among 30 BPD patients and compared with the response in 30 normal controls using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants were shown pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System with neutral, positive, and negative valence. After performing an attentional task, the participants were asked to perform a reappraisal task. The assignment was to consciously suppress emotions that might occur after viewing pictures with an unpleasant content. Borderline patients displayed larger late positive potentials (LPP) to pictures with an unpleasant valence as compared with the control group, indicating an enhanced elaborative processing of unpleasant stimuli. However, they did not differ on the reappraisal task. Borderline patients show an enhanced emotional cortical reactivity to unpleasant stimuli as compared with a control group. This suggests an emotional dysfunctioning in BPD patients. This feature might be an important focus in the treatment of BPD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Marissen, Marlies A.

Methods: Fifty-four unmedicated adolescent males (12-18 years) with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and matched controls performed an auditory oddball task. Theta activity was sub-averaged, and Fourier Integrals with simultaneous measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA) was used to index response to stimulus novelty and routinization. Results: ADHD participants showed an overall increase in theta activity to both novel and routine stimuli relative to controls. While controls showed increased theta activity in response to novel compared to routine targets across the brain, ADHD participants did not show this novelty-related increase in theta activity in the right anterior/frontal brain. Conclusions: The findings of this study are consistent with disturbances in theta activity and the brain substrates of novelty relative to routinization-related processing in ADHD. Significance: These findings show that there are distinct alterations in theta activity related to stimulus novelty and routinization during an auditory oddball task in ADHD, and they highlight the value of using an event-related approach to elucidate the neural substrates of stimulus processing in ADHD.

Adolescence is the time that most individuals first experience ethanol exposure, and binge drinking is not uncommon during adolescence. If alcohol exposure is neurotoxic to the developing brain during adolescence, not unlike it is during fetal development, then understanding how ethanol affects the developing adolescent brain becomes a major public health issue. Adolescence is a critical time period when cognitive, emotional, and social maturation occurs and it is likely that ethanol exposure may affect these complex processes. To study the effects of ethanol on adolescent brain, animal models where the dose and time of exposure can be carefully controlled that closely mimic the human condition are needed. The studies reviewed provide evidence that demonstrates that relatively brief exposure to high levels of ethanol, via ethanol vapors, during a period corresponding to parts of adolescence in the rat is sufficient to cause long-lasting changes in functional brain activity. Disturbances in waking electroencephalogram and a reduction in the P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) have been demonstrated in adult rats that were exposed to ethanol vapor during adolescence. Adolescent ethanol exposure was also found to produce long-lasting reductions in the mean duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) episodes and the total amount of time spent in SWS, a finding consistent with a premature aging of sleep. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings, in a range of strains, and to link those findings to the neuroanatomical and neurochemical mechanisms potentially underlying the lasting effects of adolescent ethanol exposure.

If the cardinal symptoms of ADHD - hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention - are combined with a learning disability (70 >= IQ < 85), the question arises whether a child shows hyperkinetic behaviour because of intellectual overload in a challenging situation, for example at school. Perhaps, this behaviour is not a primary attention deficit disorder but an impulse control disorder, determined by the primarily intelligence level. It raised the question whether attention deficit and impulse control regarded as behavioural inhibition deficit may depend on intelligence and therefore should be separated into distinct clinical entities. Methods. A total of 45 children (15 with ADHD, 15 with learning disabilities (LD), 15 with ADHD and learning disabilities) were compared in a matched-pair design with 42 control children using a go/no go paradigm (visual continuous performance test, CPT). The dependent variable was the target P3 amplitude, averaged from a 10 - 20 EEG measurements under distinct trigger conditions. For statistical analysis, a three-factor analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measurements was used. In a subsequent regression analysis with residuals, the influence of intelligence (IQ) was calculated and a "parallel analysis of variance" was conducted. Results. No differences in the P3 amplitudes in the comparison ADHD-control group were found. Reduced P3 amplitudes as main effects in the LD group compared with controls were found and a significant group-dependent interaction on reduced P3 amplitudes comparing ADHD + LD versus control group. Using residuals (IQ), this interaction was not longer verifiable. Conclusion. Impulsivity and attention deficit as the cardinal symptoms of ADHD, regarded as behavioural inhibition deficit, are essentially moderated by the primary intelligence, rather than by an attention deficit. The lower the IQ, the more ADHD surfaces as a disturbed impulsivity and lesser as an attention deficit.

MMN here was elicited by the uninterrupted sound under an oddball paradigm including repeated stimuli and deviant stimuli. In theory, larger magnitude of deviance of a deviant stimulus may elicit MMN with larger peak amplitude and shorter latency. We showed that wICA extracted such well-defined MMN from ordinary averages over the first 20 single trials of EEG recordings in the experiment although MMN was not well structured in such ordinary averages and did not possess theoretical properties measured from difference wave. Regarding about 11 minutes cost to collect 700 single trials for one child, with wICA it may just take less than one minute to obtain a well-defined child's MMN elicited by an uninterrupted sound.

Self-Paced Operation of an SSVEP-Based Orthosis With and Without an Imagery-Based "Brain Switch:" A Feasibility Study Towards a Hybrid BCI	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); brain switch; event-related desynchronization (ERD)-based BCI; hand orthosis control; hybrid BCI; motor imagery; steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI	COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG	This work introduces a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) composed of an imagery-based brain switch and a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI. The brain switch (event related synchronization (ERS)-based BCI) was used to activate the four-step SSVEP-based orthosis (via gazing at a 8 Hz LED to open and gazing at a 13 Hz LED to close) only when needed for control, and to deactivate the LEDs during resting periods. Only two EEG channels were required, one over the motor cortex and one over the visual cortex. As a basis for comparison, the orthosis was also operated without using the brain switch. Six subjects participated in this study. This combination of two BCIs operated with different mental strategies is one example of a "hybrid" BCI and revealed a much lower rate of FPs per minute during resting periods or breaks compared to the SSVEP BCI alone (FP = 1.46 +/- 1.18 versus 5.40 +/- 0.90). Four out of the six subjects succeeded in operating the self-paced hybrid BCI with a good performance (positive prediction value PPVb >0.70).

The Neural and Cognitive Time Course of Theory of Mind	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION; SELF-PERSPECTIVE; BRAIN; REGISTRATION; TASKS; THINKING; REGIONS; PEOPLE; ATLAS; EEG	Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies implicate both frontal and temporoparietal cortices when humans reason about the mental states of others. Here, we report an event-related potentials study of the time course of one such "theory of mind" ability: visual perspective taking. The findings suggest that posterior cortex, perhaps the temporoparietal cortex, calculates and represents the perspective of self versus other, and then, later, the right frontal cortex resolves conflict between perspectives during response selection.

To enhance the performance of a BCI, it is necessary to improve the feature extraction techniques being applied to decode the users' intentions. Objective comparison methods are needed to analyze different feature extraction techniques. One possibility is to use the classifier performance as a comparative measure. In this paper, we study the behavior of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when used to distinguish between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with and without the presence of event related potentials (ERPs).

Extracting feature from ERPs is very important due to high dimension of ERPs which includes much information having nothing to do with classification. The principle and weakness of CSP were analyzed and the method to extract spatio-temporal feature by combining AR model and Whiten transformation was proposed. Cognitive experiments were designed to verify our method. Two kind of features were extracted from the data collected from the cognitive experiments separately by spatio-temporal method and CSP, the classifiers were trained both by SVM, and compared the two on effectiveness of classification were compared. The result demonstrates the spatio-temporal feature method is clearly superior to CSP in the classification of ERPs and the precision rate of classification based on spatio-temporal feature method may be over 90% if the parameters are reasonably determined.

In general, are all gamma responses the same, or should they be divided into different classes according to criteria such as their spectral characteristics (frequency range and/or shape), their spatial-temporal patterns of occurrence, and/or their responsiveness under different task conditions? In particular, are the responses observed in intracranial EEG at a broad range of "high gamma" frequencies (similar to 60-200 Hz) different from gamma responses observed at lower frequencies (similar to 30-80 Hz), typically in narrower bands? And if they are different, how should they be interpreted? Does the broad spectral shape of high gamma responses arise from the summation of many different narrow-band oscillations, or does it reflect something completely different? If we are not sure, should we refer to high gamma activity as oscillations? A variety of theories have posited a mechanistic role for gamma activity in cortical function, often assuming narrow-band oscillations. These theories continue to influence the design of experiments and the interpretation of their results. Do these theories apply to all electrophysiological responses at gamma frequencies? Although no definitive answers to these questions are immediately anticipated, this paper will attempt to review the rationale for why they are worth asking and to point to some of the possible answers that have been proposed.

The criterion to judge performance of NMF and NTF is based on psychology knowledge of MMN and P3a. MMN is elicited by an oddball paradigm and may be proportionally modulated by the attention. So, participants are usually instructed to ignore the stimuli. However the deviant stimulus inevitably attracts some attention of the participant towards the stimuli. Thus, P3a often follows MMN. As a result, if P3a was larger, it could mean that more attention would be attracted by the deviant stimulus, and then MMN could be enlarged. The MMN and P3a extracted by the row-wise unfolding NIT revealed this coupling feature. However, through the standard NW. or the raw data, such characteristic was not evidently observed.

Auditory steady state response in bipolar disorder: relation to clinical state, cognitive performance, medication status, and substance disorders	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						audition; bipolar disorder; electroencephalography; steady state potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPRESSION; STIMULATION; MODULATION; DEPRESSION; EEG; ABNORMALITIES; ORGANIZATION	Objectives: Abnormalities in auditory steady state response (ASSR) at gamma range frequencies have been found in bipolar disorder, but the relationship of these neurophysiological disturbances to clinical factors has not been well characterized. We therefore evaluated the ASSR in bipolar disorder and examined its sensitivity to clinical symptoms, cognitive function, and pharmacological treatment. Methods: A total of 68 patients with bipolar disorder and 77 control participants were evaluated. Click trains presented at 20, 30, 40, and 50 Hz evoked ASSRs. Mean trial power (MTP) and phase locking factor (PLF) measured response magnitude and phase synchronization of the ASSR at each stimulation frequency. Clinical state, pharmacological treatment, and neuropsychological performance were assessed, and their respective relationships with ASSR measures were evaluated. Results: Patients with bipolar disorder showed reduced MTP and PLF compared to control participants. Bipolar disorder patients taking psychotropic medications had decreased PLF relative to patients withdrawn from medications. Control participants performed better on neuropsychological tests than bipolar disorder patients; however, test scores did not correlate with ASSR measures. Conclusions: Deficits in the generation and maintenance of ASSR are present in bipolar disorder, implicating disturbances in auditory pathways. ASSR may be sensitive to medication status. Other clinical features, including mood state, psychotic features, cognitive performance, smoking, or history of substance use disorder, were unrelated to MTP or PLF.

The present study tested the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use is associated with deficient MMN generation. MMN was investigated in age- and gender-matched chronic cannabis users (n = 30) and nonuser controls (n = 30). The cannabis users were divided into two groups according to duration and quantity of cannabis consumption. The MMNs resulting from a pseudorandomized sequence of 2 x 900 auditory stimuli were recorded by 32-channel EEG. The standard stimuli were 1,000 Hz, 80 dB SPL and 90 ms duration. The deviant stimuli differed in duration (50 ms) or frequency (1,200 Hz). There were no significant differences in MMN values between cannabis users and nonuser controls in both deviance conditions. With regard to subgroups, reduced amplitudes of frequency MMN at frontal electrodes were found in long-term (a parts per thousand yen8 years of use) and heavy (a parts per thousand yen15 joints/week) users compared to short-term and light users. The results indicate that chronic cannabis use may cause a specific impairment of auditory information processing. In particular, duration and quantity of cannabis use could be identified as important factors of deficient MMN generation.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Improved Neurophysiologic Performance in Brain Tumor Patients After Neurosurgery and Radiotherapy A Preliminary Report	CANCER			English	Article						radiation damage; cognition; hyperbaric oxygen treatment; electroencephalography; evoked potential mapping	GRADE-I MENINGIOMA; FOLLOW-UP; THERAPY; NEUROGENESIS; IRRADIATION; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; CHILDREN; SEQUELAE; MOTION	BACKGROUND: Cognitive performance often is impaired permanently in long-term brain tumor survivors after neurosurgery and radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) stimulates neovascularization of hypoperfused tissue and may result in improved functionality of damaged tissue. In this pilot study, clinical neurophysiologic tests were used to assess the effect of HBOT on brain performance. METHODS: Ten long-term brain tumor survivors received HBOT for severe cognitive deficits after neurosurgery and radiosurgery. Patients were tested before HBOT and at 6 weeks and 4 months after HBOT. The tests comprised a quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) for memory performance, and 2 cognitive tests, the number connection test (NCT) and the continuous reaction time test (CRTT). Late event-related components (LERCs) of averaged evoked EEG responses to a visual odd-ball stimulus were analyzed from whole-head activity maps. For comparison, a control group of healthy individuals (no HBOT) also were investigated. RESULTS: After HBOT, the amplitude of the LERC with the longest latency, P3b (involved in object interpretation) was improved significantly (P = .02). The amplitudes of the N200 (occipital, negative) and the intermediate P3a (centroparietal, positive), LERCs with shorter latencies, and of a small, positive, occipital visual component did not change. Neither latencies nor reaction times changed after HBOT. However, P3a and P3b (parietal, positive) latencies were longer in survivors than in healthy individuals. The NCT produced inconclusive results, but the IQCODE revealed an improvement. When outcomes of the NCT, CRTT, IQCODE, and P3b amplitudes were evaluated in common tests, HBOT appeared to provide substantial improvement (P<.006). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the current results, the authors concluded tentatively that HBOT improves neurophysiologic performance in long-term brain tumor survivors. Cancer 2011;117:3434-44.

J	Koenig, T; Melie-Garcia, L				Koenig, Thomas; Melie-Garcia, Lester			A Method to Determine the Presence of Averaged Event-Related Fields Using Randomization Tests	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Evoked potentials; Randomization; Global Field Power; Averaging; Signal-to-noise ratio		We present a simple and effective method to test whether an event consistently activates a set of brain electric sources across repeated measurements of event-related scalp field data. These repeated measurements can be single trials, single subject ERPs, or ERPs from different studies. The method considers all sensors simultaneously, but can be applied separately to each time frame or frequency band of the data. This allows limiting the analysis to time periods and frequency bands where there is positive evidence of a consistent relation between the event and some brain electric sources. The test may therefore avoid false conclusions about the data resulting from an inadequate selection of the analysis window and bandpass filter, and permit the exploration of alternate hypotheses when group/condition differences are observed in evoked field data. The test will be called topographic consistency test (TCT). The statistical inference is based on simple randomization techniques. Apart form the methodological introduction, the paper contains a series of simulations testing the statistical power of the method as function of number of sensors and observations, a sample analysis of EEG potentials related to self-initiated finger movements, and Matlab source code to facilitate the implementation. Furthermore a series of measures to control for multiple testing are introduced and applied to the sample data.

In this case, the experimenter has to study the intention to decide (vote) as close as possible in time to the moment of the real decision (election day). Here, we investigated the brain activity associated with the voting intention declared 1 week before the election day of the Brazilian Firearms Control Referendum about prohibiting the commerce of firearms. Two alliances arose in the Congress to run the campaigns for YES (for the prohibition of firearm commerce) and NO (against the prohibition of firearm commerce) voting. Time constraints imposed by the necessity of studying a reasonable number (here, 32) of voters during a very short time (5 days) made the EEG the tool of choice for recording the brain activity associated with voting decision. Recent fMRI and EEG studies have shown decision-making as a process due to the enrollment of defined neuronal networks. In this work, a special EEG technique is applied to study the topology of the voting decision-making networks and is compared to the results of standard ERP procedures. The results show that voting decision-making enrolled networks in charge of calculating the benefits and risks of the decision of prohibiting or allowing firearm commerce and that the topology of such networks was vote-(i.e., YES/NO-) sensitive.

Our previous fMRI study suggested that this bias is mediated by faster conduction from the right to left parietal cortices, than the reverse (siman-Tov et al., 2007). However, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI and evidence on the critical involvement of sub-cortical regions in orienting of spatial attention suggested further investigation of the leftward bias using multi-scale measurement. In this simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, healthy participants were presented with face pictures in either the right or left visual fields while performing a central fixation task. Temporo-occipital event related potentials, time-locked to the stimulus onset, showed an association between faster conduction from the right to the left hemisphere and higher fMRI activation in the left pulvinar nucleus following left visual field stimulation. This combined-modal finding provides original evidence of the involvement of sub-cortical central attention-related regions in the leftward bias. This assertion was further strengthened by a DCM analysis designated at cortical (i.e., inferior parietal sulcus: IPS) and sub-cortical (pulvinar nucleus) attention-related nodes that revealed: 1. Stronger inter-hemispheric connections from the right to left than vice versa, already at the pulvinar level. 2. Stronger connections within the right than the left hemisphere, from the pulvinar to the IPS. This multi-level neural superiority can guide future efforts in alleviating attention deficits by focusing on improving network connectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition. gamma-band oscillations have attracted much interest during the last few years since they are thought to play a Crucial role in many aspects of brain function related to perception and cognition. It was the aim of the present simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study to identify brain regions specifically involved in the generation of the auditory gamma-band response (GBR) using single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI. Ten healthy Subjects participated in this study Three different runs of an auditory choice reaction task with increasing difficulty were performed Brain activity was recorded simultaneously with high density FEG (61 channels) and fMRI (1.5 T). BOLD correlates of the GBR have been predicted using the sing-le-trial amplitude of the GBR Reaction times (p<0.001). error rates (p<005) and self-ratings of task difficulty and effort demands (p<0.001) were related to the level of difficulty in the task In addition,we found a significant influence of task difficulty oil the amplitude of the GBR at Cz (p<0.05). Using single-trial Coupling of EEG and fMRI GBR-specific activations were found only in the auditory cortex, the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the most difficult run. Single-trial coupling might be a useful method in order to increase our knowledge about the functional neuroanatomy of "neural ensembles" coupled by 40 Hz oscillations (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Acar			Continuous time wavelet entropy of auditory evoked potentials	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Wavelet transform; Continuous wavelet entropy; Shannon entropy; Tsallis entropy; Relative wavelet energy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS	In this paper, the continuous time wavelet entropy (CTWE) of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) has been characterized by evaluating the relative wavelet energies (RWE) in specified EEG frequency bands. Thus, the rapid variations of OWE due to the auditory stimulation could be detected in post-stimulus time interval. This approach removes the probability of missing the information hidden in short time intervals. The discrete time and continuous time wavelet based wavelet entropy variations were compared on non-target and target AEP data. It was observed that CTWE can also be an alternative method to analyze entropy as a function of time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Cek, M. Emre; Savaci, F.

Healthy aging delays scalp EEG sensitivity to noise in a face discrimination task	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						healthy aging; face processing; vision; noise; single-trials; EEG; ERP	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; VISUAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PATTERN ELECTRORETINOGRAMS; DECISION-MAKING; PUPIL SIZE; BRAIN; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; PERCEPTION; LUMINANCE	We used a single-trial ERP approach to quantify age-related changes in the time-course of noise sensitivity. A total of 62 healthy adults, aged between 19 and 98, performed a non-speeded discrimination task between two faces. Stimulus information was controlled by parametrically manipulating the phase spectrum of these faces. Behavioral 75% correct thresholds increased with age. This result may be explained by lower signal-to-noise ratios in older brains. ERP from each subject were entered into a single-trial general linear regression model to identify variations in neural activity statistically associated with changes in image structure. The fit of the model, indexed by R-2, was computed at multiple post-stimulus time points. The time-course of the R-2 function showed significantly delayed noise sensitivity in older observers. This age effect is reliable, as demonstrated by test-retest in 24 subjects, and started about 120 ms after stimulus onset. Our analyses suggest also a qualitative change from a young to an older pattern of brain activity at around 47 +/- 4 years old.

It is very important to the clinician and the patient's family that how to distinguish vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) for a disorders of consciousness(DOC) patient. If a patient is diagnosed with VS, this means that the hope of recovery is greatly reduced, thus leading to the family to abandon the treatment. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is aiming to help those people by analyzing patients' electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper focus on analyzing the corresponding activated regions of the brain when a subject responses "yes" or "no" to an auditory stimuli question. When the brain concentrates, the phase of the related area will become orderly from desultorily. So in this paper we analyzed EEG from the angle of phase. Seven healthy subjects volunteered to participate in the experiment. A total of 84 groups of repeatability stimulation test were done. Firstly, the frequency is fragmented by using wavelet method. Secondly, the phase of EEG is extracted by Hilbert. At last, we obtained approximate entropy and information entropy of each frequency band of EEG. The results show that brain areas are activated of the central area when people say "yes", and the areas are activated of the central area and temporal when people say "no". This conclusion is corresponding to magnetic resonance imaging technology. This study provides the theory basis and the algorithm design basis for designing BCI equipment for people with neuromuscular disorders.

In this paper, an EEG-based neural network was proposed to assess neuroplasticity induced by musical training. A musical interval perception experiment was designed to acquire and compare the behavioral and neural responses of musicians and non-musicians. The auditory event related potentials (AEP) elicited by the consonant and dissonant intervals were combined and the PCA was used to extract discriminable features to classify the EEG recordings. Various linear and nonlinear classifiers were utilized for EEG classification and the results were also compared. The average accuracies of LDA, RBFSVM and BPNN are 94.6 %(PCs = 8), 95.9 %( PCs = 6), and 97.2 %( PCs = 20). ANOVA analysis of the classification results shows that the performance of BPNN is significantly better than the results of LDA (p<0.05). But there is no significantly difference with RBFSVM. The RBFSVM performs better stability if redundant principle components were included in the feature vector. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of assessing effects of musical training by AEP signals elicited by musical chord perception.

High-amplitude SSEPs were elicited at the wrist in association with highly focal BOLD activation of the contralateral sensorimotor areas. By contrast, no diffuse activation of either the frontal or the posterior parietal cortical areas was observed, as seen in previously recorded data on SSEPs from a healthy control group. The highly focal BOLD activation in this patient suggests that cortex hyperexcitability might be limited to the sensorimotor cortex in PME. The combined EEG-fMRI findings highlight a dissociation between BOLD activation and neurophysiological findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The broad availability of electroencephalography (EEG) provides an auspicious base for the development of a fast and reliable tool for the objective diagnosis of pathological cognitive limitations. In the development of the paradigm and follow-up data analysis, we focussed on the objective assessment of the most common cognitive deficits in psychopathological disorders, i.e., limitations in working-memory span and the corresponding loss of attentional resources as well as deficits in facial recognition, contributing to severe social cuts. In a passive face recognition task, we monitored the N170 component of late visual evoked potentials (VEP) in healthy subjects for establishing a methodological base for the diagnostics of cognitive deficits in patients. In line with our preliminary work, we were able to demonstrate a loss of phasic coherence in the single-trial analysis of subsequent visual stimuli during the repetitive face presentation. The novelty event however involuntarily captures attentional resources, resulting in an afresh increase in intertrial phase coherence. These results provide a new viable methodology for accessing the novelty-effect in cognitive deficit patients using a passive visual ERP paradigm of involuntary attentional guidance and habituation.

A comparison of three brain-computer interfaces based on event-related desynchronization, steady state visual evoked potentials, or a hybrid approach using both signals	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2010	Monterey, CA				EEG; BCI	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems rely on the direct measurement of brain signals, such as event-related desynchronization (ERD), steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), P300s, or slow cortical potentials. Unfortunately, none of these BCI approaches work for all users. This study compares two conventional BCI approaches (ERD and SSVEP) within subjects, and also evaluates a novel hybrid BCI based on a combination of these signals. We recorded EEG data from 12 subjects across three conditions. In the first condition, subjects imagined moving both hands or both feet (ERD). In the second condition, subjects focused on one of the two oscillating visual stimuli (SSVEP). In the third condition, subjects simultaneously performed both tasks. We used logarithmic band power features at sites and frequencies consistent with ERD and SSVEP activity, and subjects received real-time feedback based on their performance. Subjects also completed brief questionnaires. All subjects could simultaneously perform the movement and visual task in the hybrid condition even though most subjects had little or no training. All subjects showed both SSVEP and ERD activity during the hybrid task, consistent with the activity in both single tasks. Subjects generally considered the hybrid condition moderately more difficult, but all of them were able to complete the hybrid task. Results support the hypothesis that subjects who do not have strong ERD activity might be more effective with an SSVEP BCI, and suggest that SSVEP BCIs work for more subjects. A simultaneous hybrid BCI is feasible, although the current hybrid approach, which involves combining ERD and SSVEP in a two-choice task to improve accuracy, is not significantly better than a comparable SSVEP BCI. Switching to an SSVEP BCI could increase reliability in subjects who have trouble producing the EEG activity necessary to use an ERD BCI. Subjects who are proficient in both BCI approaches might be able to combine these approaches in different ways and for different goals.	[Brunner, C.; Allison, B.

At the same time. closed eyes and open eyes conditions differed from each other by the percent distribution of different types of SPs The probabilities for the occurrence of particular SP types were typical for each of the examined conditions with domination of alpha-rhythmical SPs during closed eyes condition and domination of delta-theta-rhythmical SPs during open eyes condition The findings suggest that the diversity of SPs varies as a function of functional state of the brain during resting conditions Understanding of the diversity of short-term EEG SP types is important theoretically and practically, and is significant for advancing the interpretation of the EEG signal (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

The brain switch is operated through foot motor imagery (MI) and is based on the classification of event-related desynchronization (ERD) during a motor task or event-related synchronization (ERS) after the termination of the task (also known as the beta rebound). The methods described in this work are suitable for operating a brain-computer interface (BCI) as an attractive control alternative for healthy users. A general description of ERD/ERS is obtained with several band power features and a rigid paradigm timing. Two support vector machines (SVMs) are trained in a novel fashion by using the patterns from motor execution (ME) and a priori information about the significance of ERD/ERS patterns. A maximum true positive rate (TPR) of 0.92 and a minimum of 0.43 was achieved (in 8 out of 9 subjects) during training of the classifiers; with a mean false positive rate (FPR) of 0.09 +/- 0.05. A simulation of an asynchronous BCI using MI data and the classifiers trained with ME data achieved a maximum TPR of 0.88, a minimum of 0.50 (in 6 out of 9 subjects) and an average FPR of 0.09 +/- 0.04. This work presents a step forward towards an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use asynchronous BCI system for healthy users. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG alpha power was quantified as an inverse index of cerebral activity during the period between each response and the next stimulus in a Stroop task. Alpha power was significantly reduced following error responses compared to correct responses, indicating greater cerebral activity following errors. Reduced alpha power was also observed following Stroop conflict trials compared to no-conflict trials, suggesting that conflict engages processes of mental adjustment. Finally, hemispheric differences in alpha power during the intertrial interval supported the complementary roles of the left and right hemispheres in behavioral activation and inhibition.

J	Koelsch, S; Jentschke, S				Koelsch, Stefan; Jentschke, Sebastian			Differences in Electric Brain Responses to Melodies and Chords	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WESTERN TONAL MUSIC; INFANTS PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; EXPECTANCY; SYNTAX; HARMONY; ERP; MMN; ATTENTION	The music we usually listen to in everyday life consists of either single melodies or harmonized melodies (i.e., of melodies "accompanied" by chords). However, differences in the neural mechanisms underlying melodic and harmonic processing have remained largely unknown. Using EEG, this study compared effects of music-syntactic processing between chords and melodies. Inmelody blocks, sequences consisted of five tones, the final tone being either regular or irregular (p = .5). Analogously, in chord blocks, sequences consisted of five chords, the final chord function being either regular or irregular. Melodies were derived from the top voice of chord sequences, allowing a proper comparison between melodic and harmonic processing. Music-syntactic incongruities elicited an early anterior negativity with a latency of approximately 125 msec in both the melody and the chord conditions. This effect was followed in the chord condition, but not in the melody condition, by an additional negative effect that was maximal at approximately 180 msec. Both effects were maximal at frontal electrodes, but the later effect was more broadly distributed over the scalp than the earlier effect. These findings indicate that melodic information (which is also contained in the top voice of chords) is processed earlier and with partly different neural mechanisms than harmonic information of chords.

The time course of emotion effects in first and second language processing: a cross cultural ERP study with German-Spanish bilinguals	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						emotion; visual word recognition; bilinguals; second language processing; ERPs	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; COGNITION	To investigate whether second language processing is characterized by the same sensitivity to the emotional content of language - as compared to native language processing - we conducted an EEG study manipulating word emotional valence in a visual lexical decision task. Two groups of late bilinguals - native speakers of German and Spanish with sufficient proficiency in their respective second language - performed each a German and a Spanish version of the task containing identical semantic material: translations of words in the two languages. In contrast to theoretical proposals assuming attenuated emotionality of second language processing, a highly similar pattern of results was obtained across L1 and L2 processing: event related potential waves generally reflected an early posterior negativity plus a late positive complex for words with positive or negative valence compared to neutral words regardless of the respective test language and its L1 or L2 status. These results suggest that the coupling between cognition and emotion does not qualitatively differ between L1 and L2 although latencies of respective effects differed about 50-100 ms. Only Spanish native speakers currently living in the L2 country showed no effects for negative as compared to neutral words presented in L2 potentially reflecting a predominant positivity bias in second language processing when currently being exposed to a new culture.

Due to these temporal demands, an olfactometer is often needed. However, an olfactometer is a piece of equipment that either comes with a high price tag or requires a high degree of technical expertise to build and/or to run. Here, we detail the construction of an olfactometer that is constructed almost exclusively with "off-the-shelf" parts, requires little technical knowledge to build, has relatively low price tags, and is controlled by E-Prime, a turnkey-ready and easily-programmable software commonly used in psychological experiments. The olfactometer can present either solid or liquid odor sources, and it exhibits a fast stimulus-rise time and a fast and stable stimulus-onset time. We provide a detailed description of the olfactometer construction, a list of its individual parts and prices, as well as potential modifications to the design. In addition, we present odor onset and concentration curves as measured with a photo-ionization detector, together with corresponding GC/MS analyses of signal-intensity drop (5.9%) over a longer period of use. Finally, we present data from behavioral and psychophysiological recordings demonstrating that the olfactometer is suitable for use during event-related EEG experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated electrophysiological activity preceding prosaccades and antisaccades in schizophrenia patients, first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients, and control subjects. Prior to antisaccades, patients had reduced potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex. Smaller potentials were associated with worse antisaccade performance. Relatives also exhibited reduced pre-saccadic potentials over lateral frontal cortex but additionally had reduced potentials over parietal cortex. Both patients and relatives tended toward increased activity over orbital frontal cortex prior to saccades. Results are consistent with lateral prefrontal dysfunction marking genetic liability for schizophrenia and underlying deficient saccadic control.

Individuals become aware of their breathing at the cognitive level when breathing pattern is manipulated. Airway obstruction activates lung and muscle mechanoreceptors that project to the somatosensory cortex. Cortical neuronal activation in the somatosensory cortex by inspiratory occlusions can be measured by scalp surface electrodes in humans. The averaged signal was defined as the respiratory related evoked potential (RREP). Six RREP peaks, Nf, P1, N1, P2, N2 and P300 have been studied in the averaged EEG trace. Voluntary attention, background loads, and disease state were found to modulate the RREP. Respiratory sensory gating was demonstrated with the RREP using different levels of intensities and frequencies of respiratory stimuli. Future studies are needed to investigate the effects of psychological states, such as attention and emotion, as well as non-respiratory modalities, such as visual, auditory, and tactile sensations, on the RREP.

Electrophysiological auditory responses and language development in infants with periventricular leukomalacia	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Event-induced EEG responses; Periventricular leukomalacia; Language development; CDI McArthur; Infants	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRETERM INFANTS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; BRAIN-INJURY; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; DISCRIMINATION; HABITUATION	This study presents evidence suggesting that electrophysiological responses to language-related auditory stimuli recorded at 46 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) are associated with language development, particularly in infants with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). In order to investigate this hypothesis, electrophysiological responses to a set of auditory stimuli consisting of series of syllables and tones were recorded from a population of infants with PVL at 46 weeks PCA. A communicative development inventory (i.e., parent report) was applied to this population during a follow-up study performed at 14 months of age. The results of this later test were analyzed with a statistical clustering procedure, which resulted in two well-defined groups identified as the high-score (HS) and low-score (LS) groups. The event-induced power of the EEG data recorded at 46 weeks PCA was analyzed using a dimensionality reduction approach, resulting in a new set of descriptive variables. The LS and HS groups formed well-separated clusters in the space spanned by these descriptive variables, which can therefore be used to predict whether a new subject will belong to either of these groups. A predictive classification rate of 80% was obtained by using a linear classifier that was trained with a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A robust sensor-selection method for P300 brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; CHANNEL SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; PEOPLE	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a specific type of human-computer interface that enables direct communication between human and computer through decoding of brain activity. As such, event-related potentials like the P300 can be obtained with an oddball paradigm whose targets are selected by the user. This paper deals with methods to reduce the needed set of EEG sensors in the P300 speller application. A reduced number of sensors yields more comfort for the user, decreases installation time duration, may substantially reduce the financial cost of the BCI setup and may reduce the power consumption for wireless EEG caps. Our new approach to select relevant sensors is based on backward elimination using a cost function based on the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, after some spatial filtering. We show that this cost function selects sensors' subsets that provide a better accuracy in the speller recognition rate during the test sessions than selected subsets based on classification accuracy. We validate our selection strategy on data from 20 healthy subjects.

Neural Signatures of Stimulus Features in Visual Working Memory-A Spatiotemporal Approach	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; source analysis; visual; working memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; BRAIN; MAINTENANCE; COLOR; P300; MANIPULATION; INFORMATION; OBJECTS	We examined the neural signatures of stimulus features in visual working memory (WM) by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential data recorded during mental manipulation of colors, rotation angles, and color-angle conjunctions. The N200, negative slow wave, and P3b were modulated by the information content of WM, and an fMRI-constrained source model revealed a progression in neural activity from posterior visual areas to higher order areas in the ventral and dorsal processing streams. Color processing was associated with activity in inferior frontal gyrus during encoding and retrieval, whereas angle processing involved right parietal regions during the delay interval. WM for color-angle conjunctions did not involve any additional neural processes. The finding that different patterns of brain activity underlie WM for color and spatial information is consistent with ideas that the ventral/dorsal "what/where" segregation of perceptual processing influences WM organization. The absence of characteristic signatures of conjunction-related brain activity, which was generally intermediate between the 2 single conditions, suggests that conjunction judgments are based on the coordinated activity of these 2 streams.

The algorithm transforming the input signal into the output commands and the method used to extract the signal features for the algorithm are the key components for an optimum behaviour of the BCI. This paper presents a machine learning- based method to select these features and a classifier algorithm for building a predictive model from the EEg signal of patients with tremor. This model analyses and classifies the signal in a continous, asynchronous and adaptive way finding to identify the patient movement Intention in order for a control system to cancel the tremor during the movement execution.

Because of this, many research groups develop new algorithms for both feature extraction and classification. However, until now, no large-scale comparison of these algorithms has been accomplished due to the fact that little EEG data is publicly available. Therefore, we at Team PhyPA recorded 32-channel EEGs, electromyograms and electrooculograms of 36 participants during a simple finger movement task. The data are published on our website www.phypa.org and are freely available for downloading. We encourage BCI researchers to test their algorithms on these data and share their results. This work also presents exemplary benchmarking procedures of common feature extraction methods for slow cortical potentials and event-related desynchronization as well as for classification algorithms based on these features.

Quantifying auditory event-related responses in multichannel human intracranial recordings	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrocorticography; auditory; matching pursuit; multivariate autoregressive modeling; epilepsy; statistical testing	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC GAMMA ACTIVITY; GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFORMATION-FLOW; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; EEG ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN	Multichannel intracranial recordings are used increasingly to study the functional organization of human cortex. Intracranial recordings of event-related activity, or electrocorticography (ECoG), are based on high density electrode arrays implanted directly over cortex, combining good temporal and spatial resolution. Developing appropriate statistical methods for analyzing event-related responses in these high dimensional ECoG datasets remains a major challenge for clinical and systems neuroscience. We present a novel methodological framework that combines complementary, existing methods adapted for statistical analysis of auditory event-related responses in multichannel ECoG recordings. This analytic framework integrates single-channel (time-domain, time-frequency) and multichannel analyses of event-related ECoG activity to determine statistically significant evoked responses, induced spectral responses, and effective (causal) connectivity. Implementation of this quantitative approach is illustrated using multichannel ECoG data from recent studies of auditory processing in patients with epilepsy. Methods described include a time-frequency matching pursuit algorithm adapted for modeling brief, transient cortical spectral responses to sound, and a recently developed method for estimating effective connectivity using multivariate autoregressive modeling to measure brief event-related changes in multichannel functional interactions. A semi-automated spatial normalization method for comparing intracranial electrode locations across patients is also described. The individual methods presented are published and readily accessible. We discuss the benefits of integrating multiple complementary methods in a unified and comprehensive quantitative approach. Methodological considerations in the analysis of multichannel ECoG data, including corrections for multiple comparisons are discussed, as well as remaining challenges in the development of new statistical approaches.

In this study, it was analyzed whether patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show enhanced responses of their event-related brain potentials to novel stimuli, either in a context of potential threat or in a neutral context. Methods: In this study, 20 OCD patients and 20 matched healthy control subjects performed a visual recognition task during which irrelevant repeated standard sounds and unitary novel sounds were interspersed. Results: As expected, OCD patients showed an increase in the novelty-P3 amplitude elicited by unitary novel sounds. However, no effect of emotional context conditions was observed. Conclusion: It is suggested that the novelty P3 amplitude increase in OCD patients represents a physiological indicator of an enhanced cortical orienting response implicating stronger involuntary shifts of attention. This characteristic is driven by novelty per se and not moderated by potential threat of upcoming events. Depression and Anxiety 28: 915-923, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Offline and online experiments have been performed with ten subjects to validate the proposed system. It is shown to achieve fast and accurate CS detection without significantly compromising the performance.

Prepare for conflict: EEG correlates of the anticipation of target competition during overt and covert shifts of visual attention	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; electroencephalography; human; saccade; spatial cue	FRONTAL EYE FIELD; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY	When preparing to make a saccadic eye movement in a cued direction, perception of stimuli at the target location is enhanced, just as it is when attention is covertly deployed there. Accordingly, the timing and anatomical sources of preparatory brain activity accompanying shifts of covert attention and saccade preparation tend to exhibit a large degree of overlap. However, there is evidence that preparatory processes are modulated by the foreknowledge of visual distractor competition during covert attention, and it is unknown whether eye movement preparation undergoes equivalent modulation. Here we examine preparatory processes in the electroencephalogram of human participants during four blocked versions of a spatial cueing task, requiring either covert detection or saccade execution, and either containing a distractor or not. As in previous work, a typical pattern of spatially selective occipital, parietal and frontal activity was seen in all task versions. However, whereas distractor presence called on an enhancement of spatially selective visual cortical modulation during covert attention, it instead called on increased activity over frontomedial oculomotor areas in the case of overt saccade preparation. We conclude that, although advance orienting signals may be similar in character during overt and covert conditions, the pattern by which these signals are modulated to ameliorate the behavioral costs of distractor competition is highly distinct, pointing to a degree of separability between the overt and covert systems.

Behavioral and Brain Measures of Executive Attention and School Competence in Late Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							SELF-REGULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; TEMPERAMENT; INHIBITION; CHILDRENS; MATH; PRESCHOOLERS; ACHIEVEMENT; CONFLICT	This study examines the role of executive attention on school competence in early adolescence. Twelve-year-old children (N 37) performed a combined Flanker Go/No-Go task while their brain activation was registered using electroencephalogram (EEG). Additionally, measures of children regulation, schooling skills, and academic achievement were obtained. We observed that individual differences in executive attention and Effortful Control predict most dimensions of school competence. Also, individual differences in the amplitude of event-related potentials (ERPs) related to interference suppression predict school achievement and some skills important for school. The results are consistent with the role attributed to executive attention in self-regulation.

A pattern recognition system determines which brain activity pattern a user is producing and thereby infers the user's mental task, allowing users to send messages or commands through brain activity alone. Unfortunately, despite extensive research to improve classification accuracy, BCIs almost always exhibit errors, which are sometimes so severe that effective communication is impossible. We recently introduced a new idea to improve accuracy, especially for users with poor performance. In an offline simulation of a "hybrid" BCI, subjects performed two mental tasks independently and then simultaneously. This hybrid BCI could use two different types of brain signals common in BCIs - event-related desynchronization (ERD) and steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs). This study suggested that such a hybrid BCI is feasible. Here, we re-analyzed the data from our initial study. We explored eight different signal processing methods that aimed to improve classification and further assess both the causes and the extent of the benefits of the hybrid condition. Most analyses showed that the improved methods described here yielded a statistically significant improvement over our initial study. Some of these improvements could be relevant to conventional BCIs as well. Moreover, the number of illiterates could be reduced with the hybrid condition. Results are also discussed in terms of dual task interference and relevance to protocol design in hybrid BCIs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we have used event-related potentials to record brain activity to novel spoken word forms as they are being learnt by the human nervous system through passive auditory exposure. We found that the brain response dynamics change dramatically within the short (20 min) exposure session: as the subjects become familiarized with the novel word forms, the early (similar to 100 ms) fronto-central activity they elicit increases in magnitude and becomes similar to that of known real words. At the same time, acoustically similar real words used as control stimuli show a relatively stable response throughout the recording session; these differences between the stimulus groups are confirmed using both factorial and linear regression analyses. Furthermore, acoustically matched novel non-speech stimuli do not demonstrate similar response increase, suggesting neural specificity of this rapid learning phenomenon to linguistic stimuli. Left-lateralized perisylvian cortical networks appear to be underlying such fast mapping of novel word forms unto the brain's mental lexicon.

The measurements were performed with a 32-channel Neuroscan electroencephalographic system. Two types of stimuli were applied, pure tones (1 kHz and 2 kHz) and double syllabi consisting of one consonant and one vocal characteristic of Croatian language. The stimuli were presented in an oddball paradigm, requiring a conscious reaction for the subjects. Latencies and amplitudes of P1, N1, P2, N2, P3, N4, and SW waves were analized, as well as the reaction time and number of responses. There were found no statistically significant difference between children with special language impairment and the control group in average response time and number of responses to tone burst or double syllable. Analysis of variance of all used variables showed a statistically significant difference in P3 and Sw wave latencies after double syllable stimulation, P3 and N4 waves latencies after target stimulation., P2 and Sw wave amplitude; and in N1 wave amplitude after pure tone stimulation. Our study showed that children with speech and language disorder take longer time to perceive and discriminate between either tonal or speech auditory stimuli than children with typical speech and language development.

Although the term "sustained" suggests that this beneficial effect endures continuously as long as something is attended, we present electrophysiological evidence that perception at attended locations is actually modulated periodically. Subjects detected brief light flashes that were presented peripherally at locations that were either attended or unattended. We analyzed the correlation between detection performance for attended and unattended stimuli and the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations, which relate to subsecond fluctuations of neuronal excitability. Although on average, detection performance was improved by attention-indicated by reduced detection thresholds at attended locations-we found that detection performance for attended stimuli actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of spontaneous oscillations in the. (approximate to 7 Hz) frequency band just before stimulus onset. This fluctuation was absent for unattended stimuli. This pattern of results suggests that "sustained" attention in fact exerts its facilitative effect on perception in a periodic fashion.

However, the temporal sequence of the distributed cortical activity contributing to iCNV generation remains unclear. During iCNV generation, selectively enhanced low-beta activity has been reported. Here we studied the temporal order of activation foci in cortical regions assumed to underlie iCNV generation using source reconstruction of low-beta (13-18 Hz) activity. During the iCNV, elicited by a cued simple reaction-time task, low-beta power peaked first (750 ms after cue onset) in anterior frontal and limbic regions and last (140 ms later) in posterior areas. This activity occurred 3300 ms before target onset and provides evidence for the temporally ordered involvement of both cognitive-control and motor-preparation processes already at early stages during the preparation for speeded action.

Involuntary switching of attention mediates differences in event-related responses to complex tones between early and late Spanish-English bilinguals	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; P3a; Late negativity; Bilinguals; Basic auditory discrimination; Involuntary attention switching	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION; PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS; NATIVE LANGUAGE; SPEECH SOUNDS; BRAIN; ACQUISITION; PERCEPTION; AGE; POTENTIALS	Most research with bilinguals has used speech stimuli to demonstrate differences in auditory processing abilities. Two main factors have been identified as modulators of such differences: proficiency and age of acquisition of the second language (L2). However, whether the bilingual brain differs from the monolingual in the efficient processing of nonverbal auditory events (known to be critical to the acoustic analysis of the speech stream) remains unclear. In this EEG/ERP study, using the mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and late negativity (LN), we examined differences in discrimination, involuntary switching of attention and reorienting of attention between monolinguals and bilinguals as they processed complex tones. Further, we examined the role that age of acquisition plays in modulating such responses. A group of English monolinguals and a group of proficient Spanish-English bilinguals were presented with a multiple-deviant oddball paradigm with four deviant conditions (duration, frequency, silent gap, and frequency modulation). Late bilinguals, who learned English after age 10, exhibited larger MMN and P3a responses than early bilinguals, across all deviant conditions. Significant associations were found between amplitude of the responses and both age of L2 acquisition and years of L2 experience. Individuals who acquired English at later ages and had fewer years of L2 experience had larger MMN, P3a, and LN responses than those who learned it earlier. These findings demonstrate that age of L2 acquisition is an important modulator of auditory responses in bilinguals even when processing non-speech signals. Involuntary attention switching is suggested as the main factor driving these differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Davenport, T; Coulson, S				Davenport, Tristan; Coulson, Seana			Predictability and novelty in literal language comprehension: An ERP study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Conceptual integration; LPC; N400; Semantics; P600; Pragmatics	BRAIN POTENTIALS; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; EVENT; N400; WORD; ACTIVATION; SENTENCES; KNOWLEDGE; METAPHOR	Linguists have suggested that one mechanism for the creative extension of meaning in language involves mapping, or constructing correspondences between conceptual domains. For example, the sentence, "The clever boys used a cardboard box as a boat," sets up a novel mapping between the concepts cardboard box and boat, while "His main method of transportation is a boat," relies on a more conventional mapping between method of transportation and boat. To examine the electrophysiological signature of this mapping process, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from the scalp as healthy adults read three sorts of sentences: low-doze (unpredictable) conventional ("His main method of transportation is a boat,"), low-doze novel mapp'ing ("The clever boys used a cardboard box as a boat,"), and high-doze (predictable) conventional ("The only way to get around Venice is to navigate the canals in a boat"). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to sentence final words. The novel and conventional conditions were matched for doze probability (a measure of predictability based on the sentence context), lexical association between the sentence frame and the final word (using latent semantic analysis), and other factors known to influence ERPs to language stimuli. The high-doze conventional control condition was included to compare the effects of mapping conventionality to those of predictability. The N400 component of the ERPs was affected by predictability but not by conventionality. By contrast, a late positivity was affected both by the predictability of sentence final words, being larger for words in low-doze contexts that made target words difficult to predict, and by novelty, as words in the novel condition elicited a larger positivity 700-900 ms than the same words in the (doze-matched) conventional condition.

Although subjects with muscular dystrophy (MD) appear to be potential BCI users, the actual long-term effects of BCI use on brain activities in MD subjects have yet to be clarified. To investigate these effects, we followed BCI use by a chronic tetraplegic subject with MD over 5 months. The topographic changes in an electroencephalogram (EEG) after long-term use of the virtual reality (VR)-based BCI were also assessed. Our originally developed BCI system was used to classify an EEG recorded over the sensorimotor cortex in real time and estimate the user's motor intention (MI) in 3 different limb movements: feet, left hand, and right hand. An avatar in the internet-based VR was controlled in accordance with the results of the EEG classification by the BCI. The subject was trained to control his avatar via the BCI by strolling in the VR for 1 hour a day and then continued the same training twice a month at his home. Results: After the training, the error rate of the EEG classification decreased from 40% to 28%. The subject successfully walked around in the VR using only his MI and chatted with other users through a voice-chat function embedded in the internet-based VR. With this improvement in BCI control, event-related desynchronization (ERD) following MI was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) for feet MI (from -29% to -55%), left-hand MI (from -23% to -42%), and right-hand MI (from -22% to -51%). Conclusions: These results show that our subject with severe MD was able to learn to control his EEG signal and communicate with other users through use of VR navigation and suggest that an internet-based VR has the potential to provide paralyzed people with the opportunity for easy communication.

J	Kornmeier, J; Pfaffle, M; Bach, M				Kornmeier, Juergen; Pfaeffle, Miriam; Bach, Michael			Necker cube: Stimulus-related (low-level) and percept-related (high-level) EEG signatures early in occipital cortex	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						electrophysiology; evoked potentials; ambiguous figures; multistable perception; Necker cube; Reversal Positivity	VISUAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; REVERSAL; BRAIN; TIME; ATTENTION	During observation of an ambiguous Necker cube, our percept changes spontaneously although the external stimulus does not. An EEG paradigm allowing time-resolved EEG measurement during endogenous perceptual reversals recently revealed a chain of ERP correlates beginning with an early occipital positivity at around 130 ms (Reversal Positivity, "RP"). In order to better understand the functional role of this RP, we investigated its relation to the P100, which is spatiotemporally close, typically occurring 100 ms after onset of a visual stimulus at occipital electrodes. We compared the relation of the ERP amplitudes to varying sizes of ambiguous Necker cubes. The main results are: (1) The P100 amplitude increases monotonically with stimulus size but is independent of the participants' percept. (2) The RP, in contrast, is percept-related and largely unaffected by stimulus size. (3) A similar pattern to RP was found for reaction times: They depend on the percept but not on stimulus size. We speculate that the P100 reflects processing of elementary visual features, while the RP is related to a processing conflict during 3D interpretation that precedes a reversal. The present results indicate that low-level visual processing (related to stimulus size) and (relative) high-level processing (related to perceptual reversal) occur in close spatial and temporal vicinity.

This article presents a P300 BCI based on a 12 x 7 matrix and new paradigmatic approaches to flashing characters designed to decrease the number of flashes needed to identify a target character. Using an RC presentation, a 12 x 7 matrix requires 19 flashes to present all items twice (12 columns and seven rows) per trial. A 12 x 7 matrix contains 84 elements (characters). To identify a target character in 12 x 7 matrix using the RC pattern, 19 flashes (sub-trials) are necessary. In each flash, the selected characters (one column or one row in the RC pattern) are flashing. We present four new paradigms and compare the performance to the RC paradigm. These paradigms present quasi-random groups of characters using 9, 12, 14 and 16 flashes per trial to identify a target character. The 12-, 14- and 16-flash patterns were optimized so that the same character never flashed twice in succession. We assessed the practical bit rate and classification accuracy of the 9-, 12-, 14-, 16- and RC (19-flash) pattern conditions in an online experiment and with offline simulations. The results indicate that 16-flash pattern is better than other patterns and performance of an online P300 BCI can be significantly improved by selecting the best presentation paradigm for each subject.

Cognitive processes in disorders of consciousness as revealed by EEG time-frequency analyses	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Frontal theta; Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state; Awareness	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; LOCKED-IN SYNDROME; VEGETATIVE STATE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SEMANTIC MEMORY; BRAIN RESPONSE	Objective: Although behavioral evaluation of awareness in disorders of consciousness is difficult it remains the clinical standard. We believe that the refinement of EEG and analyses techniques would improve our characterization of those patients. Methods: We focused on cognitive processing in a sample of 12 control subjects, eight vegetative-state patients, and 13 patients in the minimally consciousness state using EEG. We used an 'active paradigm' which asks subjects to follow instructions, specifically to actively count own or other names as compared to passively listening to them. EEG data was then analyzed using an advanced EEG analysis technique. Results: Results revealed that all groups exhibit a stronger theta-synchronization to their own names when forced to count them. We also observed a delay in theta power in response to targets relative to non-targets when participants were instructed to count their own name. Conclusion: Active paradigms are able to induce a different oscillatory activity compared to passive paradigms. Differences between controls and the pathologic groups are prominent in the theta-and alpha-band. Significance: Time-frequency analyses allow to focus on distinct cognitive processes in patients with disorders of consciousness and thereby contribute to a refined understanding of severely brain-injured patients.

Are individuals with paradoxical insomnia more hyperaroused than individuals with psychophysiological insomnia? Event-related potentials measures at the peri-onset of sleep	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Insomnia; Information processing; Arousal; Inhibition; Event-related potentials; wPN	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-STIMULI; EEG FREQUENCY; INHIBITION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INVENTORY; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE; QUALITY	Preliminary QEEG studies suggest that individuals with paradoxical insomnia (Para-I) display higher cortical arousal than those with psychophysiological insomnia (Psy-1). Lately, finer measures, such as event-related potentials, and especially the N1 and P2 components have been used to document arousal processes in individuals with insomnia. The objective of the present study was to further circumscribe arousal in Psy-I and Para-I using Ni, P2 and the waking processing negativity (wPN). NI and P2 were recorded in the evening, at sleep-onset and in early stage 2 sleep in 26 good sleepers, 26 Psy-I and 26 Para-I. An oddball paradigm was used and participants received the instruction to ignore all stimuli at all times. Three difference waves (wPNs) were computed to evaluate the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset, from sleep onset to sleep and from wakefulness to sleep. Results revealed that Ni was smaller during wakefulness and sleep onset for Psy-I, while it was larger for Para-I during these same times. P2 was smaller at sleep onset for Psy-I than for Para-I and GS, while P2 during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep was larger for Para-I than GS. WPNs revealed that Psy-I showed fewer changes in information processing, while Para-I showed larger changes between recording times. Psy-I appear to present an inability to inhibit information processing during sleep onset, while Para-I seem to present overall enhanced attentional processing that results in a greater need for inhibition.

Being a more direct measure of attentional processing, the present study used event related potentials (ERPs) to test reactivity to high caloric and low caloric food pictures in women with BED compared to overweight healthy female controls (HC). In order to detect a possible motivational ambivalence, self-report and psychophysiological measures of the sympathetic and parasympathetic response system were assessed additionally. The main results yielded evidence that in women with BED high caloric food pictures elicit larger long latency ERPs compared to HC. By contrast, no such group difference was found for low caloric food pictures. Peripheral measures did not yield any group differences with respect to the processing of the caloric value of food. The results suggest that for women with BED, high caloric food may have high motivational properties and consume large parts of attentional resources. In the context of an environment in which high caloric food is omnipresent, such an abnormal processing may be relevant for the maintenance of the disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of such overactivation, EEG source analysis to brisk self-paced finger movements was performed in thirty-two ALS patients, able to initiate their movement as fast as controls and clustered according to their most affected motor neuron (upper or lower). Reduced activity within cortical sources in bilateral SMC and caudal mesial areas was found only in patients subgroup with extensive upper motor neuron (UMN) clinical signs and mild motor weakness (U>L). Its absence in patients with opposite clinical features (L>U) suggest that this reduction might represent a possible marker of UMN impairment, and that the lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration in L>U patients did not exert a retrograde effect over their cortical motor neurons. An ipsilateral premotor recruitment was observed in U>L patients only and since its extent positively correlated with movement initiation speed and right hand Medical Research Council (MRC) score, it might represent a compensatory recruitment. The latter correlation might suggest that the slight motor weakness in those patients may at least partly depend from a UMN dysfunction that can be compensated by cortical recruitment.

Here, we evaluate whether there are distinct or overlapping top-down network regions for attention to different stimulus features To this end, we explored functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data, electroencephalographic (EEG) source localization, and phase coherence that were obtained while participants attended or ignored motion and color stimuli Functional connectivity analysis indicated that attention to color relies strongly on prefrontal regions, whereas attention to motion recruits both prefrontal and parietal areas Although these networks are generally topologically segregated, both color and motion processes recruit right inferior frontal Junction (IFJ) However, the IFJ may be more critical for color processing, as only connectivity with V4 predicted the degree of attentional modulation Source localization at the time range of attentional modulation of the event related potential corroborated the role of the right IFJ and indicated that feature-based, top-down modulation occurs early during processing (< 200 ms post-stimulus onset). Furthermore, long-distance alpha (8-12 Hz) phase coherence between the IFJ and visual cortices may serve as a mechanism underlying anticipatory, top-down modulation of color feature processing.

An EEG-MEG dissociation between online syntactic comprehension and post hoc reanalysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						syntax; Broca's area; semantic; language; complexity; reversibility	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BROCAS AREA; SENTENCE; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES; MAINTENANCE; POTENTIALS	Successful comprehension of syntactically complex sentences depends on online language comprehension mechanisms as well as reanalysis in working memory. To differentiate the neural substrates of these processes, we recorded electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during sentence-picture-matching in healthy subjects, assessing the effects of two difficulty factors: syntactic complexity (object-embedded vs. subject-embedded relative clauses) and semantic reversibility on neuronal oscillations during sentence presentation, and during a subsequent memory delay prior to picture onset. Synthetic Aperture magnetometry analysis of MEG showed that semantic reversibility induced left lateralized perisylvian power decreases in a broad frequency range, approximately 8-30 Hz. This effect followed the relative clause presentation and persisted throughout the remainder of the sentence and the subsequent memory delay period, shifting to a more frontal distribution during the delay. In contrast, syntactic complexity induced enhanced power decreases only during the delay period, in bilateral frontal and anterior temporal regions. These results indicate that detailed syntactic parsing of auditory language input may be augmented in the absence of alternative cues for thematic role assignment, as reflected by selective perisylvian engagement for reversible sentences, compared with irreversible sentences in which world knowledge constrains possible thematic roles. Furthermore, comprehension of complex syntax appears to depend on post hoc reanalysis in working memory implemented by frontal regions in both hemispheres.

J	Schirmer, A; Escoffier, N				Schirmer, Annett; Escoffier, Nicolas			Emotional MMN: Anxiety and heart rate correlate with the ERP signature for auditory change detection	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Prosody; Voice; Emotion; Fear; MMN; Autonomic arousal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; RATE-VARIABILITY; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; DURATION; CORTEX; DEVIANCE; STIMULI	Objective: Previous work established the mismatch negativity (MMN) as a correlate of pre-attentive auditory change detection. The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between the MMN and emotional processes associated with the detection of change. Methods: To this end, we assessed state anxiety with a questionnaire and subsequently recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate while participants watched a silent movie and listened to a task-irrelevant auditory oddball sequence. The oddball sequence comprised meaningless syllables of which some were deviants spoken with an angry or neutral voice. Results: The MMN to angry voice deviants was larger than that to neutral deviants and correlated positively with ensuing heart rate acceleration. Additionally, both the MMN and heart rate acceleration to angry voice deviants were increased with increasing state anxiety. A similar effect for neutral voice deviants was non-significant. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that the pre-attentive processing of threat, as reflected by the MMN, is linked to an activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, this link is more strongly activated in individuals with high state anxiety. Significance: Thus, the MMN may be used as a marker for an individual's state dependent sensitivity to unattended, emotionally relevant change.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of visual stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. Methods: EEG was recorded in eight PD patients and eight controls. Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by randomized sequences of standards and by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. Peak P3b amplitude and latency were evaluated for targets after predictive and non-predictive sequences. Results: Behavioral and electrophysiological measures showed that controls processed predicted and random targets differentially, while PD patients processed these similarly. Reaction times were shorter for predictable than for random targets in controls but not in patients. PD patients failed to generate the expected P3b latency shift between predicted and random targets, which is observed in controls. Conclusions: These findings show that predictive local context effects on target detection are altered in PD patients. Significance: The findings suggest a key role for the frontostriatal system in contextual processing. (c) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. EEG was recorded in 12 subjects during two sessions: a slower (150 ms stimulus presentation, 1,000 ms interstimulus interval (ISI)) and a faster session (50 ms stimulus presentation, 800 ms ISI). Stimuli were presented to either the left or right visual field and consisted of 15% targets (downward facing triangle) and 85% of equal numbers of three types of standards (triangles facing left, upwards and right). Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by randomized sequences of standards and by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. Reaction times were faster for predicted compared to random targets in both sessions. Faster presentation rates of stimuli induced a greater P3b latency shift between predicted and random targets compared to slower presentation rates, such that P3b latency for predicted targets was shorter in the faster task compared to the slower task. These findings suggest that as stimulus presentation rates increase, predictive local context is utilized to a greater extent, increasing decision confidence in the detection of targets.

The generation of SSRs is usually attributed to the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the stimulus train. However, a more parsimonious account suggests that SSRs might result from the linear addition of the transient responses elicited by each stimulus. This study aimed to investigate this possibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded brain potentials elicited by a checkerboard stimulus reversing at different rates. We modeled SSRs by sequentially shifting and linearly adding rate-specific ERPs. Our results show a strong resemblance between recorded and synthetic SSRs, supporting the superposition hypothesis. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of entrainment of a neural oscillation at the stimulation frequency. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that visual SSRs can be explained as a superposition of transient ERPs. These findings have critical implications in our current understanding of brain oscillations. Contrary to the idea that neural networks can be tuned to a wide range of frequencies, our findings rather suggest that the oscillatory response of a given neural network is constrained within its natural frequency range.

In the alternate condition they judged stimulus duration. Using traditional event-related potential analysis techniques we found significantly greater amplitudes in the evoked potentials of the shape discrimination condition between 140 and 160 ms, a timeframe in which LOC mediated perceptual processes are believed to occur during visual object recognition Scalp voltage topography and source analysis procedures indicated the lateral occipital complex as the likely source behind this effect.

This is the first quantitative EEG evaluation of the differences between PD with and without executive dysfunction (ExD). The subjects were 32 PD patients without remarkable dementia. The lack of ischemic lesions was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. ExD was defined as <70 points on the age-controlled standardized score of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome. Absolute power was measured for four frequency bands from delta to beta. Electrodes were placed at frontal pole, frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal locations. Spectral ratio was calculated as the sum of power values for alpha and beta waves divided by the sum of values for the slow waves. In multiple logistic regression analysis of each electrode location, the dependent variable was ExD or not, and the independent variables were spectral ratio, age, and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. The only significant predictor of ExD was spectral ratio at the frontal pole (P = 0.031) and frontal (P = 0.048) locations. PD with ExD exhibited an increase in slow wave activity and a decrease in alpha and fast wave activities in these locations. These findings indicated that the ExD in PD was caused by frontal dysfunction.

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing eye fixation-related potentials (EFRP) at the encoding stage of a change blindness task; when participants freely inspect a scene containing an unmarked target region, in which a change will occur in a subsequent presentation. We measured EFRP amplitude prior to the execution of a saccade, depending on its starting or landing position relative to the target region. For those landings inside the target region, we found a difference in EFRP between correct detection and failure. Overall, correspondence between EFRP amplitude and the size of the saccade predicted successful detection of change; lack of correspondence was followed by change blindness. By contrast, saccade sizes and fixation durations around the target region were unrelated to subsequent change detection. Since correspondence between EFRP and eye movement indicates that overt attention was given to the target region, we concluded that overt attention is needed for successful encoding and that dissociation between eye movement and attention leads to change blindness.

Brain development in humans involves a protracted and highly coordinated set of maturation changes that take place over more than a decade to fine tune the neural circuitry established in infancy. The domestic chicken is particularly suitable to study the neurobiological processes involved in brain maturation because in chickens, as in humans, these changes are protracted and occur in a distinct phase of development temporally separated from the synapse formation events that established the neural circuits. We review the molecular, cellular and behavioural investigations of the mechanisms involved in brain maturation in chicken forebrain. We review some non-invasive electrophysiological techniques for assessing the functional maturation of chicken brain and present one new technique. We also present new mathematical methods for analysing such non-invasive electrophysiological data during normal or abnormal brain development.

The generation of neural activity in the gamma-band was shown to be critically related to a glutamatergic and GABAergic microcircuit which is also known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recently, a reduction of the early auditory evoked gamma-band response (eGBR) in schizophrenic patients was reported. In order to investigate the possible applicability of this neurophysiological marker as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, this is the main question of our investigation: Is the early eGBR decreased regarding evoked power and phase locking in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia? Methods: We investigated the early eGBR in 17 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in age-, gender- and education-matched groups of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls using an auditory reaction task. Results: First-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenic patients showed a significant reduction of evoked power and phase locking of the early eGBR compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: This study shows significantly reduced evoked power and phase locking of the early auditory eGBR in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia pointing to the applicability of this marker as a heritable intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. The findings are in line with the hypothesis of a disturbed GABAergic interneural modulation of pyramidal cells in schizophrenia and findings of different schizophrenia risk genes associated with transmission at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses.

Electrophysiological correlates of non-symbolic numerical magnitude processing in children: Joining the dots	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Non-symbolic numerical comparison; ERPs; Current source localization; Numerical distance effect; Subitizing; Estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSCALCULIA; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; MINDS EYE; BRAIN; REPRESENTATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; INFERIOR	Whether and in what way enumeration processes differ for small and large sets of objects is still a matter of debate. In order to shed light on this issue. EEG data were obtained from 60 normally developing elementary school children. Adopting a standard non-symbolic numerical comparison paradigm allowed us to manipulate numerical distance between stimulus arrays for different quantity ranges, i.e. the subitizing, counting and estimation ranges. In line with the existing literature, the amplitudes of parietal positive going ERP components showed systematic effects of numerical distance, which did not depend on set size. In contrast to the similarities in surface distribution of electrophysiological activity across all number ranges, applying source localization we found distance related current density effects in inferior parietal processing systems to be similar for all numerical ranges, there was, however, considerable variation in the involvement of medial parietal and lateral occipital regions. The precuneus, which is known to be involved in visual imagery, showed distance effects exclusively for numerical comparisons on large set sizes. In contrast, the processing of small quantities and stimulus arrays arranged into canonical patterns relied on lateral occipital areas that are linked to higher-level shape recognition. These findings suggest, on the one hand, that for explicit numerical decisions an involvement of domain-specific resources does not depend on quantity features of the visual input. On the other hand, it seems that the recruitment of mediating perceptual systems differs between the apprehension of small quantities and the enumeration of large sets of objects.

Our study aims to examine whether P300 abnormalities are present in DLB and to evidence possible differences between DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A second aim of this study is to look for correlations between P300 recordings and EEG, as abnormal EEG variability has been described in DLB. Patients and methods. - Auditory P300 responses were recorded by a classic oddball paradigm in 50 controls, in 36 DLB patients, and in 40 AD patients with MMSE > 20. Results. - Reliable auditory P300 responses were obtained in 26 DLB (72%), 33 AD (82.5%), and 46 controls (92%). P300 was more delayed and had lower amplitude in DLB compared to AD groups. P300 topography was also different as the anterior-to-posterior scalp amplitude gradient was reversed in DLB. P300 latency correlated with neuropsychological test scores and with EEG variables. Gradient inversion and delayed P300 responses in frontal derivations evidenced differences between DLB and AD patients with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 97%. Conclusions. - P300 recordings are abnormal in DLB and can be useful to distinguish DLB from AD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In this test, the fixed sustained attention to response task (SART) paradigm, a predictable series of single digits are presented (1-9) and subjects are required to make a response to each number (go trials) with the exception of the number 3 (no-go trial). Our results show that vigilance decline, reflected by significant changes in performance and spectral power, is accompanied by specific effects of time on the P2 and Late Positive 1 (LP1) components. The digit 2 is an upcoming cue for the critical target trial, which serves as an important marker for alert response during the task. From this perspective, the amplitude decrease of the P2 (on digit 2 exclusively) with time-on-task could be the concomitant in ERPs of the failures to observe and to attend the critical digit 3. The increase in the amplitude of the later positive component (LP1) from the first period to the last period, could be viewed as a measure of resource allocation, of the higher redeployment of effort towards the task. The progressive deterioration of vigilance level, which results in performance decline and low-frequency activity increase, could thus be a direct consequence of the failure to maintain an intrinsic alert state with time-on-task, despite the larger resource allocation deployed by the participant towards task completion.

In another subtype, animal phobia, enhanced amplitudes of late event-related potentials have consistently been identified for patients during passive viewing of disorder-relevant pictures. However, this has not been shown for BII phobics, and studies with dental phobics are lacking. Findings on cardiac responses in BII phobia during exposure are heterogeneous, as some studies showed a diphasic pattern of heart rate acceleration and deceleration, whereas others observed pure acceleration. In contrast, heart rate increase has consistently been shown for dental phobics, resembling the reaction of animal phobics. Moreover, the BII subtype is characterized by elevated disgust reactivity whereas the role of habitual disgust proneness in dental phobia is unclear. Methods: We recorded the electroencephalogram and the electrocardiogram from 18 dental phobic and 18 healthy women while they watched pictures depicting dental treatment, disgust, fear and neutral items. Results: Phobics relative to controls showed an enhanced late positive potential (300-700 ms) and heart rate acceleration towards phobic material, reflecting motivated attention and fear. Affective ratings revealed that dental phobics experienced significantly higher levels of fear than disgust during exposure to phobia-relevant material. Patients' elevated habitual disgust proneness was restricted to specific domains, such as the oral incorporation of offensive objects. Conclusion: The psychophysiology of dental phobia resembles the fear-dominated subtypes of specific phobia reported in earlier studies. Future studies should continue to investigate whether the current classification of this disorder as BII phobia needs to be reconsidered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Involvement of the human pedunculopontine nucleus region in voluntary movements	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MESENCEPHALIC LOCOMOTOR REGION; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; BLOOD-FLOW CHANGES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; MOTOR AREA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION	Objective: The pedunculopontine nucleus region (PPNR) is being investigated as a target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson disease (PD), particularly for gait and postural impairment. A greater understanding of how PPNR activities and oscillations are modulated with voluntary movements is crucial to the development of neuromodulation strategies. Methods: We studied 7 patients with PD who underwent DBS electrode implantations in the PPNR. PPNR local field potential and EEG were recorded while patients performed self-paced wrist and ankle movements. Results: Back-averaging of the PPNR recording showed movement-related potentials before electromyography onset. Frequency analysis showed 2 discrete movement-related frequency bands in the theta (6- to 10-Hz) and beta (14- to 30-Hz) ranges. The PPNR theta band showed greater event-related desynchronization with movements in the ON than in the OFF medication state and was coupled with the sensorimotor cortices in the ON state only. Beta event-related desynchronization was observed in the PPNR during the premovement and movement execution phases in the OFF state. In contrast, premovement PPNR beta event-related synchronization occurred in the ON state. Moreover, beta band coherence between the PPNR and the midline prefrontal region was observed during movement preparation in the ON but not the OFF state. Conclusions: Activities of PPNR change during movement preparation and execution in patients with PD. Dopaminergic medications modulate PPNR activities and promote the interactions between the cortex and PPNR. Beta oscillations may have different functions in the basal ganglia and PPNR, and may be prokinetic rather than antikinetic in the PPNR. Neurology (R) 2010;75:950-959	[Tsang, E.

Evoked and event related coherence of Alzheimer patients manifest differentiation of sensory-cognitive networks	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer; Evoked coherence; Event related coherence; Oddball paradigm; Brain oscillation; Cholinergic	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS	In previous studies on Alzheimer's patients it was shown that, in frontal and parietal locations, delta and theta responses of AD patients were greatly reduced. The present study analyzed coherence functions in these highly affected frontal and parietal areas. Visual sensory and event related coherences of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (AD) were analyzed comparatively. A total of 38 mild, probable AD subjects (19 untreated, 19 treated with cholinesterase inhibitors) were compared with a group of 19 healthy controls. The sensory evoked coherence and event related target coherences were analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency ranges for long-range intra-hemispheric (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The healthy control group showed significantly higher values of event related coherence in "delta", "theta" and "alpha" bands in comparison to the de nova and medicated AD groups (p<0.01 for the delta, theta and alpha) upon application of a target stimuli. In contrast, almost no changes in event related coherences were observed in beta and gamma frequency bands. Furthermore, no differences were recorded between healthy and AD groups upon application of simple light stimuli. Besides this, coherence values upon application of target stimuli were higher than sensory evoked coherence in all groups and in all frequency bands (p<0.01). The cognitive networks of AD patients were highly impaired in comparison to networks activated by sensory stimulation, thus showing separate activation of sensory and cognitive networks.

A complex functional network was found to be activated after a choice in order to process a feedback and sustain an adaptive behavior. However, many aspects of this network are still unclear and further research is needed to better understand this process. We conducted an EEG study using a simple gambling task. Twenty three subjects participated to the study. We analyzed both EEG power spectrum and ERP components evoked by presentation of a feedback signal (money gain or loss) during a simple gambling task. Our data confirmed that a negative ERP component is present about 270 ms after feedback, particularly relevant following a choice with negative outcome. Furthermore, the theta and delta oscillatory activity seem to be correlated to a dynamic decision-making process within specific cortical networks. In particular, theta activity showed a valence dependent development between 150 and 350 ms post-feedback onset. Differently from previous studies (Cohen, Elger & Ranganath, 2007; Marco-Pallares, Cucurell, Cunillera et al., 2008), we did not find any valence effect in beta range. However, our data are consistent with Christie and Tata (2009), probably due to the nature of the gambling task used in both studies. In conclusion, our data, in line with some prior findings showed that the feedback related response is correlated to a complex pattern of cortical activation probably mediated by theta and delta activity.

Methods: The spectral characteristics of the resting EEG in 111 adults in the early stages of depression and 526 non-depressed subjects were compared between groups of patients and healthy controls using a combination of ICA and sLORETA methods. Results: Comparison of the power of independent components in depressed patients and healthy controls have revealed significant differences between groups for three frequency bands: theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5-14 Hz), and beta (14-20 Hz) both in Eyes closed and Eyes open conditions. An increase in slow (theta and alpha) activity in depressed patients at parietal and occipital sites may reflect a decreased cortical activation in these brain regions, and a diffuse enhancement of beta power may correlate with anxiety symptoms playing an important role on the onset of depressive disorder. Conclusions: ICA approach used in the present study allowed us to localize the EEG spectra differences between the two groups. Significance: A relatively rare approach which uses the ICA spectra for comparison of the quantitative parameters of EEG in different groups of patients/subjects allows to improve an accuracy of measurement.

Selective Tuning of Hippocampal Oscillations by Phasic Locus Coeruleus Activation in Awake Male Rats	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						EEG; norepinephrine; noradrenaline; theta; gamma	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NORADRENERGIC BETA-RECEPTORS; THETA-RHYTHM; DENTATE GYRUS; CERULEUS ACTIVATION; BEHAVING RATS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; RAPID HABITUATION; NOREPINEPHRINE; RESPONSES	Theta and gamma oscillations are thought to provide signal sets that promote neural coding of cognitive processes. Over 40 yrs ago, Jeffrey Gray reported event-related changes in a narrow band of hippocampal theta (7.5-8.5 Hz) which appeared to involve norepinephrine (NE) release from, the noradrenergic nucleus, the locus coeruleus (LC). These event-related alterations in EEG were elicited by novelty, attentional changes, the use of preparatory signals, and signal-mismatch events. Gray et al. have since provided indirect evidence that supports the role of NE in the modulation of 7.5- to 8.5-Hz oscillations in the hippocampus, but studies investigating the effects of direct LC activation in awake rats have been lacking. In the present study, dentate gyrus EEG was examined during glutamatergic activation of the LC in awake male rats in relation to plasticity effects on simultaneously recorded perforant path-evoked field potentials. Glutamate-injected animals were divided into three groups based on histological and plasticity outcomes; perforant path stimulated controls were also included. The three injected groups were: (1) rats with positive LC placements, demonstrating NE-LTP of the dentate gyrus evoked potential, (2) rats with positive LC placements, without NE-LTP, and (3) Non-LC injected controls. Activation of the LC in awake rats demonstrating NE-LTP increased the relative power of 7- to 9-Hz theta, a result masked in broader 4- to 12-Hz analysis. Comparatively, urethane-anesthetized rats showed an increase in 5-7 Hz, but not 7- to 9-Hz theta with LC activation. Discriminative analysis in the approximate theta band predicted by Gray (7.4-8.5 Hz) revealed that awake rats demonstrating NE-LTP had increased relative power in this narrow frequency compared to rats receiving perforant path only (noninjected) and Non-LC injected rats. Transiently reduced gamma (20-40 Hz) relative power was most commonly observed in rats with verified LC placements failing to express NE-LTP. Given current theories of LC function, these results suggest oscillatory tuning within the theta and gamma range may facilitate shifts in cognitive set. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Infants are sensitive to their own name by 4 months of age, but whether they use their names as a social cue is unknown. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured as infants heard their own name or stranger's names and while looking at novel objects. Event related brain potentials (ERPs) in response to names revealed that infants differentiate their own name from stranger names from the first phoneme. The amplitude of the ERPs to objects indicated that infants attended more to objects after hearing their own names compared to another name. Thus, by 5 months of age infants not only detect their name, but also use it as a social cue to guide their attention to events and objects in the world.

We used ERPs to investigate local contextual processing in schizophrenic patients. Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. Response times of predicted targets were faster in controls compared to patients. Schizophrenia patients failed to generate the P3b latency shift between predicted and random targets that was observed in controls and demonstrated a prominent reduction of the peak of an early latency context dependent positivity. The current study provides evidence of contextual processing deficits in schizophrenia patients by demonstrating alteration in the behavioral and neural correlates of local contextual processing.

A key question is why some people are less susceptible to this bias than others. It is debated whether the bias results from a failure to monitor one's intuitive conclusions for conflict with logical considerations or from a failure to inhibit the tempting intuitions. This results in different views on the role of individual differences in executive monitoring and inhibition capacity for sound reasoning. The present study presents a new approach to address this issue. After an initial reasoning screening a group of the most and least biased reasoners were invited for an EEG study in which neural markers of their executive monitoring (ERN amplitude) and inhibition (N2 amplitude) skills were recorded. Results indicated that biased reasoners were characterized by less developed inhibition but not monitoring capacity. Findings support the view that monitoring one's intuition for conflict during thinking is a flawless and undemanding process suggesting that even the poorest reasoners at least detect that they are biased.

ERPs were recorded from 13 normal subjects and 12 depressed patients during visual search for facial expressions. The evoked N2 component of ERPs by responding to all neutral faces (F(1,22) = 5.51, P<0.05) and the positive face was reduced in the depressed patients as compared to the normal subjects (F(1,22) = 5.71, P<0.05), while the evoked N2 component by detecting the negative face showed no significant between-group effect (F(1,22) = 2.10, P = 0.16). The reduced N2 amplitude reflected deficits in effortful attentional modulation in depression. Obtained PDC values within the N2 time-window (150-300 ms post stimulus) showed weaker intra-frontal and intra-central directed interactions and enhanced occipital information output when responding to all neutral faces in depression relative to those in the normal group. Few decreased intro-frontal directed interactions were observed when detecting the emotional face in depression. The altered cortical directed connectivity contributed to the impairment occurring in the effortful attention modulation in depression. Our findings supported that the impaired attention modulation processing in depression was associated with the altered cortical connectivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, this apparent contradiction was analyzed using a computing procedure which distinguishes phase-locked and nonphase-locked alpha response during the execution of a complex event-related visual-motor task. The electroencephalographies (EEGs) of 12 male volunteers were digitized (128 electrodes), band-pass filtered for isolating a wave, and event-related averaged during the execution of the visual-motor tasks. This procedure showed a phase-locked a response to stimuli and suppressed the non-phase-locked response. When EEG envelope of the a-wave was computed (Hilbert transformation) before the event-related average, the response of the alpha amplitude to stimuli was observed while the phase-locked a response vanished. Visual stimuli induced a short-lasting increase of phase-locked alpha activity and a long-lasting decrease of non-phase-locked alpha activity whose latency and amplitude changed with the cortical region (visual vs. parietal vs. frontal cortex), with the sensory-semantic information of visual stimuli, and with the tasks associated to them (comparing the alpha response to stimuli which were used for a visual-motor tasks with those passively observed). Alpha sub-bands around the individual alpha frequency peak showed a different phase-locked response. Finally, two early evoked potentials (C1-P1) showed a time latency similar to that computed for the phase-locked alpha response, suggesting that early evoked potentials are modified by the superposition of this alpha activity. Present data suggest that alpha activity promotes the cortical processing of information by increasing the phase-locked alpha activity and by decreasing the non-phase-locked alpha activity, and disturbs cortical processing under basal conditions when it is not phase-locked to any particular task.

Control of a brain-computer interface using stereotactic depth electrodes in and adjacent to the hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2010	Monterey, CA				EPILEPSY SURGERY PROCEDURES; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; BCI OPERATION; COMPLICATIONS; POTENTIALS; HUMANS; P300; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that enables severely disabled people to communicate and interact with their environments using their brain waves. Most research investigating BCI in humans has used scalp-recorded electroencephalography or intracranial electrocorticography. The use of brain signals obtained directly from stereotactic depth electrodes to control a BCI has not previously been explored. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from bilateral stereotactic depth electrodes implanted in and adjacent to the hippocampus were used to control a P300 Speller paradigm. The ERPs were preprocessed and used to train a linear classifier to subsequently predict the intended target letters. The classifier was able to predict the intended target character at or near 100% accuracy using fewer than 15 stimulation sequences in the two subjects tested. Our results demonstrate that ERPs from hippocampal and hippocampal adjacent depth electrodes can be used to reliably control the P300 Speller BCI paradigm.	[Krusienski, D.

This suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) may generate from the initial stages a failure in involuntary attention (IA), which can be studied through the distraction potential, composed by the mismatch negativity (MMN), the P3a and the reorientation negativity (RON). This study analyzed IA using event-related potentials (ERPs) in patients with early PD with and without dopaminergic replacement therapy. Twenty-five medicated, and 17 non-medicated patients with early PD were studied, as well as 20 healthy control subjects. All subjects performed an auditory distraction task while a digital EEG was being recorded. The distraction potential was obtained by averaging methodology. Each wave was analyzed with a Repeated Measures ANOVA test. The MMN was obtained in all subjects and no significant differences in mean amplitude were found among the groups. There was a main effect of group for the amplitude of P3a (F(2,59) = 4.8, p = 0.01, epsilon = 0.411), with a significant lower amplitude in the medicated group compared to the control group (MD = -1.03, p = 0.003). RON also showed a main effect of group (F(2,59)=4.8, p = 0.01, epsilon = 0.467), with significantly lower amplitudes in non-medicated patients with respect to both the control and medicated groups (MD = 1.19, p = 0.01, MD = 1.27,p = 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences in the latencies of any of the waves among the groups. The main finding of this study was the reduction in the IA in early PD. Reorientation of attention (RON) showed a dopaminergic modulation in these patients. These results represent the basis for future in depth studies on the involvement of IA in executive impairments in PD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been generally accepted that athletes are faster, stronger, able to jump higher, more accurate, more efficient, more consistent, and more automatic in their sports performances than non-athletes. These claims have been substantiated by neuroscientific evidence of the mechanisms underlying the plastic adaptive changes in the neuronal circuits of the brains of athletes. Reinforced neural networks and plastic changes are induced by the acquisition and execution of compound motor skills during extensive daily physical training that requires quick stimulus discrimination, decision making, and specific attention. In addition, it is likely that the manner of neuronal modulation differs among sports. We also discuss several problems that should be addressed in future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Altered evoked gamma-band responses reveal impaired early visual processing in ADHD children	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ADHD; Attention; EEG; Gamma activity; Memory; Visual	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; SOUND; ACTIVATION	Neurophysiological studies yield contrary results whether attentional problems of patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to early visual processing deficits or not. Evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs), being among the first cortical responses occurring as early as 90 ms after visual stimulation in human EEG, have been assigned a pivotal role in early visual processing. In particular, they are involved in memory matching processes and are enhanced when known stimuli are processed. The current study examined whether evoked GBR patterns during early memory matching processes could be indicative of an early visual processing deficit in ADHD patients. EEG was recorded from 13 young ADHD patients as well as 13 age-matched healthy participants. Both groups performed a simple forced choice reaction task employing line drawings of either known real-world items with representations in long-term memory or physically similar unknown items without such representations. Evoked GBRs of ADHD patients did not differentiate between known and unknown items. However, in healthy children, evoked GBRs were enhanced when stimuli matched a representation stored in memory. This finding indicates disadvantages at early visual processing stages in ADHD patients: In contrast to healthy participants, ADHD children lack an early memory based classification, possibly resulting in an impaired ability to rapidly reallocate attentional resources to relevant stimuli. These findings suggest that impaired early automatic stimulus classification in ADHD patients could be involved in deficits of selective and sustained attention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, spoken language understanding of two age groups of listeners was investigated in a naturalistic "stock price monitoring" task. Stock prices of listed companies were simultaneously recited by three speakers at different positions in space and presented via headphones to 14 younger and 14 older listeners (age ranges 19-25 and 54-64 years, respectively). The listeners had to respond when prices of target companies exceeded a specific value, but to ignore all other prices as well as beep sounds randomly interspersed within the stock prices. Older listeners did not produce more missing responses, or longer response times than younger listeners. However, differences in event-related potentials indicated a reduced parietal P3b of older, relative to younger, listeners. Separate analyses for those listeners who performed relatively high or low in the behavioral task revealed a right-frontal P3a that was pronounced especially in the group of high-performing older listeners. Correlational analyses indicated a direct relationship between P3a amplitude and spoken language comprehension in older, but not younger, listeners. Furthermore, younger (especially, low-performing) listeners showed a more pronounced P2 on irrelevant beep sounds than older listeners. These subtle differences in cortical processing between age groups suggest that high performance of older middle-aged listeners in demanding listening situations is associated with increased engagement of frontal brain areas, and thus the allocation of mental resources for compensation of potential declines in spoken language understanding.

We investigated whether age-related changes in processing non-target material are present even when behavioral performance is matched between age groups. Younger (19-36 years) and older (61-80 years) participants performed a go/nogo task with different degrees of cognitive interference for two types of nogo stimuli. On each block, either the left or the right hand was used for the go responses. EEG was recorded to compute the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP), a measure of unilateral motor response preparation. Although performance was similar in the two groups, older adults showed a pronounced LRP partial response preparation not only for high-conflict nogo stimuli, but even for low-conflict ones, when both age groups performed at ceiling. These results indicate that, even without age-related performance differences, older individuals show enhanced response preparation to non-target Stimuli that can be detected with more sensitive measures such as the LRP. Negative correlations between nogo-LRPs and go-RTs in the older group Only Suggest the possibility that partial response preparation for nogo stimuli is the cost to pay to maintain optimal speed to go stimuli in normal aging.

Three body postures were manipulated to create three levels of approach motivation. Consistent with the motivational direction model, results indicated that leaning forward with arms extended (high approach) caused greater left frontal cortical activation as compared to reclining backwards (low approach). This is the first experiment to demonstrate this effect, and it suggests that leaning forward as compared to reclining backward increases approach motivation. These results provide important implications for the motivational direction model and embodiment research.

In order to form the feature tensor, electrocorticograms, recorded during behavioral experiments in freely moving animals (rats), were mapped to the spatial-temporal-frequency space using the continuous wavelet transformation. An N-way partial least squares (NPLS) method is applied for tensor factorization and the prediction of a movement intention depending on neuronal activity. To cope with the huge feature tensor dimension, an iterative NPLS (INPLS) algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments demonstrated the good accuracy and robustness of INPLS. The algorithm does not depend on any prior neurophysiological knowledge and allows fully automatic system calibration and extraction of the BCI-related features.

The brain sources that contribute to this abnormality have not yet been well documented, and were investigated in the present study using high density EEG recordings. Nineteen drug-naive first episode schizophrenics were compared to 25 normal controls. Auditory P300 was elicited using an oddball paradigm. The brain sources of P300 ERP were reconstructed by performing low resolution of electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis. No group difference in P300 latency was found. P300 amplitude was smaller for schizophrenics than for controls. Topographical analysis revealed that P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenics was significant over left and medial regions of interest (ROIs). LORETA analysis of the P300 peak revealed that, the brain sources of P300 were symmetrically distributed over left and right hemispheres among the normal controls, but were asymmetrically distributed among the patients, with a reduction predominantly over the left temporal area. Statistical non-Parametric Mapping analysis identified 29 voxels of a significant group difference, which focused on left insula, left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left postcentral gyrus (PCG). In addition, the mean P300 current source density over left insula, left STG and left PCG correlated inversely with the patients' Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores. The neural substrates that contributed to the decreased P300 amplitude in drug-naive first episode schizophrenia relatively focused on left STG and its nearby areas. These areas are probably involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and possible mechanisms for pathology need to be further clarified. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This also holds for joint action. When jointly performing a task, one needs to not only know the other's goals and intentions but also generate behavioral adjustments that are dependent on the other person's task. Previous studies have shown that in joint action people not only represent their own task but also the task of their co-actor. The current study investigated whether these so-called shared representations affect error monitoring as reflected in the response-locked error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) following own errors. Sixteen pairs of participants performed a social go/no-go task, while EEG and behavioral data were obtained. Responses were compatible or incompatible relative to the go/no-go action of the co-actor. Erroneous responses on no-go stimuli were examined. The results demonstrated increased Ne/ERN amplitudes and longer reaction times following errors on compatible compared to incompatible no-go stimuli. Thus, Ne/ERNs were larger after errors on trials that did not require a response from the co-actor either compared to errors on trials that did require a response from the co-actor. As the task of the other person is the only difference between these two types of errors, these findings show that people also represent their co-actor's task during error monitoring in joint action. An extension of existing models on performance monitoring in individual action is put forward to explain the current findings in joint action. Importantly, we propose that inclusion of a co-actor's task in performance monitoring may facilitate adaptive behavior in social interactions enabling fast anticipatory and corrective actions.

In the present study, for the first time, the long-distance intra-hemispheric event related coherence (auditory oddball paradigm) and evoked coherence (simple sound) were compared in order to evaluate the effects of cognitive tasks on the long-distance coherences. Seventeen healthy subjects (8 female, 9 male) were included in the study. The coherence was analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency ranges for (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-7, F-4-T-8, F-3-O-1,O- F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The coherence to target responses were higher than the non-target and simple auditory response coherence. This difference is significant for the delta coherence for both hemispheres and for theta coherences over the left hemisphere. The highest coherences were recorded at fronto-temporal locations for all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha). Furthermore, fronto-parietal coherences were higher than the fronto-occipital coherences for all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha).These results show that the fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal connections are most relevant for the identification of the target signal. This analysis open the way for a new interpretation of dynamic localization results during cognitive tasks.

In this electroencephalographic study, we assessed hemispheric asymmetries in regulating motor responses by analyzing oscillatory brain activity during a go/nogo task in younger and older right-handed participants. Three conditions were embedded in the task: go, high-conflict and low-conflict nogo. The hand used to respond to go stimuli was varied block-wise. Independently of the go/nogo conditions and responding hand, young participants showed asymmetric desynchronizations in the mu (10 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) frequency bands that was stronger in the scalp sensorimotor region contralateral to the hand used for the go responses, while older adults showed a more symmetric pattern of desynchronization. These findings indicate that a loss of hemispheric asymmetry is a hallmark of the aging motor system, consistent with a decline of inter-hemispheric motor inhibition in normal aging.

Gamma coherence in response to visual oddball paradigm in ten medication-free, manic patients was studied before and after six weeks of valproate monotherapy in comparison to ten controls. Inter-hemispheric F-3-F-4, C-3-C-4, T-3-T-4, T-5-T-6, P-3-P-4, O-1-O-2 and intra-hemispheric F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2, C-3-O-1, C-2-O-4 electrode pairs were included in the analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference between groups with regard to pre-treatment coherence values (p: 0.018). The coherence to the target stimuli at the right fronto-temporal location was significantly reduced by 35.41% in the patients compared to controls (p: 0.003). Patients showed significantly lower pretreatment coherence values in response to non-target stimuli compared to controls at the right frontotemporal (28.51%, p: 0.004), right fronto-occipital (23.71%, p: 0.024), and right centro-occipital (25.69%, p: 0.029) locations. After six weeks of valproate monotherapy, manic symptoms improved significantly. Post-treatment change in target and non-target coherence values was statistically non-significant. EEG coherence is a measure of functional connectivity in the brain. Event-related gamma oscillations are essential for brain electrical activity. The results show that acute mania presents right sided long distance connectivity disturbance, thus pointing to the potential importance of measuring oscillatory responses in the search for consistent neurobiological markers in such a complicated condition as bipolar disorder.

However it is not known whether acetazolamide may positively affect the excitability of neurons in the brain in vivo or cortical processing abilities. To test these possibilities we intravenously administered a low dose (7 mg/kg) acetazolamide to volunteers who performed a demanding visual signal detection task while undergoing whole brain electroencephalographic examinations. Two groups were tested twice on the same task, while receiving acetazolamide or a saline treatment in between the two sessions. Our data indicate that, while the control group showed a decrease in global gamma (30-49 Hz) power across sessions, with no correlation to performance, the acetazolamide group showed increased global gamma power that strongly related to their performance in the signal detection task. This was accompanied by a decrease in the early part of the event related potential in the control group, a decrease not seen in the acetazolamide group. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, ventilation rate, or heart rate between the two groups. It is possible that the differences between the groups, observed in this study, are related to the enhancing effect of acetazolamide on the nitric oxide generation catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, or to other actions of acetazolamide, e.g. opening of Ca2+ activated K+ channels and inhibition of Ca2+ channels.

Altered cortical somatosensory processing in chronic stroke: A relationship with post-stroke shoulder pain	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						Stroke; shoulder pain; somatosensory function; evoked potentials	LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; RISK-FACTORS; ATTENTION; BRAIN; DEPRESSION; COMPONENTS	Post-stroke shoulder pain (PSSP), traditionally regarded as purely nociceptive pain, is often persistent and the mechanisms underlying the pain complaints are not well understood. This explorative study is the first to address the possible changes in cortical somatosensory processing in patients with PSSP. Cortical potentials were recorded following intracutaneous electrostimulaton in stroke patients with chronic PSSP (n = 6), pain-free stroke patients (PF, n = 14) and healthy controls (HC, n = 20) using EEG. Amplitudes and latencies of both sensory discriminative (N90) as well as cognitive evaluative (N150, P200, the N150-P200 peak-to-peak difference and P300) evoked potential components were evaluated. Stroke was associated with reduced N150 and P300 amplitudes and increased N90, N150 and P300 latencies at both sides. Compared to PF and HC, the P200 and N150-P200 latencies were increased in PSSP patients after stimulation at both sides, even when comparing subgroups with similar lesion size and location. Stroke was associated with reduced sensory-discriminative as well as with reduced cognitive-evaluative cortical somatosensory processing. This reduction was more pronounced in patients with PSSP and may be related to the central effects of persistent nociceptive pain.

Measuring the magnetic resonance blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response or EEG event-related potentials, this has also been demonstrated for emotional versus neutral words. However, it is currently unclear whether emotion effects in word processing can also be detected with other measures such as EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) or optical brain imaging techniques. In the present study, we simultaneously performed SSVEP measurements and near-infrared diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS), a new optical technique for the non-invasive measurement of brain function, to measure brain responses to neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant nouns flickering at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. Results: The power of the SSVEP signal was significantly modulated by the words' emotional content at occipital electrodes, showing reduced SSVEP power during stimulation with pleasant compared to neutral nouns. By contrast, the DWS signal measured over the visual cortex showed significant differences between stimulation with flickering words and baseline periods, but no modulation in response to the words' emotional significance. Conclusions: This study is the first investigation of brain responses to emotional words using simultaneous measurements of SSVEPs and DWS. Emotional modulation of word processing was detected with EEG SSVEPs, but not by DWS. SSVEP power for emotional, specifically pleasant, compared to neutral words was reduced, which contrasts with previous results obtained when presenting emotional pictures. This appears to reflect processing differences between symbolic and pictorial emotional stimuli. While pictures prompt sustained perceptual processing, decoding the significance of emotional words requires more internal associative processing. Reasons for an absence of emotion effects in the DWS signal are discussed.

Inspection time is a well-established correlate of IQ where those of a higher IQ can correctly identify a briefly presented stimulus with a greater level of accuracy than those of a lower IQ This study used two age-matched samples, selected on the basis of their scores on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices from the undergraduate population of Bangor University. In order to address the confound of inspection time and IQ of previous ITT-ERP research, each participant of the presented study performed an IT task with the same five levels of stimulus duration while undergoing 64-channel EEG recording. The high IQ group made significantly fewer errors at each level of stimulus duration and exhibited a significantly larger N1 response. N1 latency and other ERP components did not distinguish the two IQ groups. Given the specificity of ERP group differences to the N1, the results of the present study suggest that the link between IT performance and g is attributable to individual differences in directing attention to a spatial region.

The LRP data showed that visually masked words triggered covert motor activations. These prime-induced motor activations preceded motor activations by subsequent (to-be-classified) visible target words. Multilevel statistical analyses of trial-level effects, applied here for the first time with electrophysiological data, revealed that accuracy and latency of classifying target words was affected by both (a) covert motor activations caused by visually masked primes and (b) spontaneous fluctuations in covert motor activations. Spontaneous covert motor fluctuations were unobserved with standard subject-level (multi-trial) analyses of grand-averaged LRPs, highlighting the utility of multilevel modeling of trial-level effects.

Forty four subjects had to categorize abstract, concrete and pseudo words, or duration of stimuli in series with different parallel auditory stimulation (simulated clock ticks with increased (1.25 Hz), normal (1.00 Hz) and decreased (0.75 Hz) rates), or without stimulation (control block). The reaction time was shown to be smaller under conditions of the decreased clock rate as compared to the increased rate or the absence of stimulation. The subjective duration of the series was also shorter in the first case. EEG data revealed the higher amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related potential and the lower alpha-rhythm power under conditions of stimulation with the decreased clock rate as compared to the increased rate.

The mean reaction time for the blink response was 188 +/- 38 ms which was 80 ms faster than the motor response. As expected, the subjects were more correct and faster to distinguish between faces and houses than when responding to particular face emotion and identity. Our results suggested that early visual processing before 150 ms is very important in face processing. This corroborates previous reports from EEG/MEG studies and intracranial recordings on the face-related response around 100 ms after stimulus onset. Our findings indicated that blinking can be used as a fast and reliable behavioral response. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The CK-SVDD has lower computational complexity than the widely-used SVM, and better classification accuracy than both SVM and SVDD, thus being able to improve the usability of the P300 speller when it is used in an online mode. We also developed a real-time EEG acquisition and preprocessing module, as well as the software written in C#, which executes the functions of data processing and classification. The results, carried out on three subjects, show that the proposed CK-SVDD consistently performs better than the SVM and the original SVDD in different numbers of rounds. The results also indicate that it can achieve a high character classification accuracy of over 95% for all subjects, even when the number of rounds is less than 4 in some cases, thus being able to provide a fast online testing speed without losing classification accuracy.

Here, we examine the possibility, implied by the nature of neural sources and the measuring principles involved, that the M100 component of auditory-evoked magnetic fields of different subjects, hemispheres, to different stimuli, and at different sensors differs by scaling factors. Such a multiplicative model predicts a linear increase in the standard deviation with the mean, and thus would have important implications for averaging and comparing such data. Our analyses, at the sensor and the source level, clearly show that the multiplicative model applies. We therefore propose geometric, rather than arithmetic, averaging of the M100 component across subjects and suggest a novel and superior normalization procedure. Our results question the justification of the common practice of subtracting arithmetic grand averages.

Methods: We confronted participants with at least two incompatible sources of information in a Simon task, a flanker task, and a NoGo task to assess whether changes in EEG theta activity correspond to executive control demands across different sources of cognitive interference. Results: Overall, increases of theta power were to a different extent observed in all interference situations: (1) differences in theta power were largest between successful response inhibition in NoGo events compared to Go responses, (2) incongruent and congruent events in the flanker task differed to a lesser extent, and (3) differences in theta power were smallest comparing incompatible and compatible Simon events. Scalp-topographies and dipole modeling of theta activity pointed to different sources across interference conditions that encompassed various MFC areas within anterior cingulate cortex and (pre-) supplementary motor areas. Conclusions: Our results indicate that theta power amplitude is sensitive to the recruitment of executive control in interference situations, whereas the MFC sources of theta power varied across different interference situations. Significance: This study shows for the first time theta power enhancement related to the recruitment of cognitive control across different types of conflicts in the stream of information processing.

J	Engell, AD; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; McCarthy, Gregory			Selective Attention Modulates Face-Specific Induced Gamma Oscillations Recorded from Ventral Occipitotemporal Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; FIELD POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; NEURONS; RESPONSES; N170; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISSOCIATION; MONKEY	EEG studies from subdural electrodes have demonstrated a face-specific event-related potential (face-N200) recorded from human ventral occipitotemporal cortex. The insensitivity of face-N200 to task manipulations has supported the proposal that face-N200 reflects an initial obligatory response to faces. This result stands in striking contrast to results of neuroimaging studies that have demonstrated strong task sensitivity of the fusiform hemodynamic response evoked by faces, and thus has created a paradox in the face perception literature. We recorded field potentials directly from the cortical surface of 16 patients while they selectively attended to faces or houses. Here we report that face-specific gamma activity recorded at face-N200 sites is strongly modulated by selective attention, while face-N200 is not. Our results reconcile prior electrophysiological and hemodynamic studies of face perception, and suggest that attentional modulation of the face response follows an initial phase that is largely insensitive to attention.

BCIs based on the P300 paradigm often use a visual stimulus of a flashing character to elicit an event related potential in the brain's EEG signal. Traditionally, P300-based BCI paradigms use a grid layout of visual targets, commonly an alphabet, and allow users to select targets using their thoughts. In our new system a multi-touch table senses objects placed upon its surface and the system can highlight the objects on the table by flashing an area of light around them. This allows us to construct a P300-based BCI that uses a user-assembled collection of objects as targets, rather than a pre-determined grid layout. An experiment shows that our new paradigm works just as well as the traditional paradigms, thus highlighting the potential for BCIs to be integrated in a broader range of situations.

This process of consolidation might be reflected after sleep in changed extent and topography of cortical activation during retrieval of information. Here, we designed an experiment to measure those changes by means of slow event-related EEG potentials (SPs). Retrieval of newly learnt verbal or spatial associations was tested both immediately after learning and two days later. In the night directly following immediate recall, participants either slept or stayed awake. In line with previous studies, SPs measured during retrieval from memory had parietal or left-frontal foci depending on whether the retrieved associations were spatial or verbal. However, contrary to our expectations, sleep-related consolidation did not further accentuate these content-specific topographic profiles. Rather, sleep modified SPs independently of the spatial or verbal type of learned association: SPs were reduced more after sleep than after waking specifically for those stimulus configurations that had been presented in the same combination at retrieval before sleep. The association-independent stimulus-specific effect might generally form a major component of sleep-related effects on memory. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to further characterize this type of error precursor activity, we investigated single-trial event-related EEG activity from 70 participants performing a modified Eriksen flanker task, in particular focusing on the trial-bytrial dynamics of a fronto-central independent component that previously has been associated with error and feedback processing. The stimulus-locked peaks in the N2 and P3 latency range in the event-related averages showed expected compatibility and error-related modulations. In addition, a small pre-stimulus negative slow wave was present at erroneous trials. Significant error-preceding activity was found in local stimulus sequences with decreased conflict in the form of less negativity at the N2 latency (310-350 ms) accumulating across five trials before errors; concomitantly response times were speeding across trials. These results illustrate that error-preceding activity in event-related EEG is associated with the performance monitoring system and we conclude that the dynamics of performance monitoring contribute to the generation of error-prone states in addition to the more remote and indirect effects in ongoing activity such as posterior alpha power in EEG and default mode drifts in fMRI.

Changes in subthalamic activity during movement observation in Parkinson's disease: Is the mirror system mirrored in the basal ganglia?	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Local field potentials; Parkinson's disease; Mirror neuron system; Movement observation; Subthalamic nucleus	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURON SYSTEM; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; IMITATION; NUCLEUS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS	Objective: The observation of a voluntary movement executed by another person is associated with an alpha and beta EEG desynchronization over the motor cortex, thought to reflect activity from the human "mirror neuron" system. The aim of our work was to study the changes in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship with cortical activity, during movement observation. Methods: Bilateral EEG and STN LFP recordings were acquired in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, through surgically implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Oscillatory changes during movement execution and movement observation were compared with two different control conditions (simple stimulus and rotating stimulus observation), in "off" and "on" motor states. Time-frequency transforms and event-related coherence were used for the analysis. Results: Movement observation was accompanied by bilateral beta reduction in subthalamic power and cortico-STN coherence, which was smaller than the decrease observed during movement execution, but significant when compared with the two control conditions. Conclusions: Movement observation is accompanied by changes in the beta oscillatory activity of the STN, similar to those observed in the EEG. Significance: These changes suggest that the basal ganglia might be engaged by the activity of the human mirror system. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Caffeine and opening the eyes have additive effects on resting arousal measures	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Arousal; EEG alpha amplitude; Skin conductance level; Eyes open vs. closed; Caffeine; Additivity of arousal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STATE AROUSAL; ORIENTING REFLEX; EEG DIFFERENCES; ACTIVATION; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; TASK; HABITUATION	Objective: Studies indicate that the change from closed to open eyes in a resting condition results in an increase in skin conductance level (SCL) and a global decrease in EEG alpha activity, both indicative of increased arousal. Other studies show that ingestion of caffeine also produces SCL increase and alpha reduction. This study investigated the additivity of the effects of these two independent arousing variables. Method: EEG activity and SCL were recorded from 22 university students during both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, under the action of both caffeine and placebo, in a counterbalanced randomised double-blind study. Results: SCL increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions, and from placebo to caffeine, with no interaction. Global reductions in EEG alpha amplitude were apparent with opening of the eyes and caffeine ingestion; again, there was no interaction. Caffeine had a larger effect than opening the eyes on SCL, but their relative effect sizes were reversed in alpha. The two dependent measures showed the predicted negative correlation in both eyes-closed placebo and eyes-open caffeine conditions, with the latter substantially reduced relative to the former. Conclusions: Caffeine and opening the eyes have additive effects on two measures of arousal, increasing SCL and reducing global EEG alpha. However, the independent variable effects are not equivalent, suggesting that one or both measures reflect additional non-arousal processes. Significance: As caffeine is widely used by both children and adults, knowledge of the additivity of arousal effects of caffeine and opening the eyes is important in controlling participant state in EEG studies. The current results confirm the use of mean global alpha amplitude as a measure of resting-state arousal, but also point to non-arousal effects of visual input.

The present ERP study extends this research by first showing that overlearned cue-spatial location associations necessary to support nonvoluntary attentional orienting can be rapidly formed in adult humans. A second experiment indicates that the nonvoluntary orienting formed by such rapid learning is semireflexive (amenable to top-down influence) rather than reflexive (resistant to top-down influence). A third experiment suggests that the rapid formation of endogenous nonvoluntary orienting requires explicit rather than implicit learning of cue-location associations. These findings provide further support for a strong connection between neurocognitive representations of space, symbol meaning, and attentional control.

In this study, ERP recordings were used to investigate the brain mechanisms that give rise to such impressions. First, in an implicit condition, participants viewed a series of photographs of unacquainted persons while performing a task that did not mention HIV risk. Second, in an explicit condition, participants estimated the HIV risk for each presented person. Dense sensor EEG was recorded during the implicit and explicit conditions. In the analysis, explicit risk ratings were used to categorize ERP data from the implicit and explicit conditions into low and high HIV risk categories. The results reveal implicit ERP differences on the basis of subsequent ratings of HIV risk. Specifically, the processing of risky individuals was associated with an early occipital negativity (240-300 ms) and a subsequent central positivity between 430 and 530 ms compared to safe. A similar ERP modulation emerged in the explicit condition for the central positivity component between 430 and 530 ms. A subsequent late positive potential component between 550 and 800 ms was specifically enhanced for risky persons in the explicit rating condition while not modulated in the implicit condition. Furthermore, ratings of HIV risk correlated substantially with ratings of trustworthiness and responsibility. Taken together, these observations provide evidence for theories of intuitive risk perception, which, in the case of HIV risk, seem to operate via appearance based stereotypic inferences.

To explore this issue, the current EEG study constructed vertical anomaly and horizontal anomaly by exchanging spatial terms in vertical and horizontal temporal sequencing concepts in Mandarin. Both the vertical and the horizontal anomaly indicated an N400 effect (340 ms after stimulus onset) and a positive effect in a late time window (620 ms after stimulus onset). Additionally, the horizontal anomaly showed a reduced P2 effect (200-260 ms after stimulus onset) that might related to spatial processing. Direct comparison between the two anomaly effects revealed that the vertical anomaly evoked a stronger effect in an early N400 time window (from 360 to 440 ms), whereas the horizontal anomaly evoked a stronger effect in a late N400 time window (from 500 to 580 ms). These results indicate multiple stages during the comprehension of temporal sequencing. The relation between the current results and spatial metaphor differences is also discussed.

The neural basis of visual perception abnormalities associated with HF-ASD is currently unclear. We sought to elucidate the functioning of bottom-up and top-down visual information processing in HF-ASD using event-related potentials (ERPs). Eleven adults with HF-ASD and 11 age-matched normal controls (NC) participated in this study. Visual ERPs were recorded using 128-channel EEG. The P1 and P300 were recorded in response to target stimuli. Visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) potentials were obtained by subtracting responses to standard from those to deviant stimuli. Behaviorally, individuals with HF-ASD showed faster target detection than NCs. However, vMMN amplitude and latency were the same between the two groups. In contrast, P1 and P300 amplitudes were significantly decreased in HF-ASD compared with NCs. In addition, P300 latency was significantly delayed in HF-ASD. Individuals with HF-ASD exhibit altered visual information processing. Intact bottom-up attention (vMMN) may contribute to their superior simple visual task performance in spite of abnormal low-level (P1) and top-down (P300) visual information processing.

Acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on performance monitoring in healthy volunteers	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						performance monitoring; error-related negativity; ERN; cannabinoids; THC; human; cannabis	ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; CANNABIS USE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE RELEASE; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; THC; ALCOHOL; ATTENTION; MARIJUANA	The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative event-related potential that occurs immediately after an erroneous response and is thought to reflect human performance monitoring. Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration in healthy volunteers has been linked to impaired performance monitoring in behavioral studies, but to date no studies have examined the effects of cannabinoids on the ERN. Methods: EEG data from 10 healthy volunteers was recorded during execution of a speeded choice-reaction time task (Flankers task) after administration of THC or placebo vapor in a double-blind randomized crossover design. Results: The findings of this study show that the ERN was significantly reduced after administration of THC. The behavioral outcomes on the Flankers task showed no indications of drug induced impairments. Discussion: The diminished ERN reflects impairments in the process of performance monitoring. The task design was not optimized to find behavioral effects. The study shows that cannabinoids impair performance monitoring.	[Spronk, Desiree; Dumont, Glenn J.

Most of the BCIs make use of visual interaction with the user, either in form of stimulation or biofeedback. However, visual BCIs challenge the ultimate use of BCIs because they require the subjects to gaze, explore and coordinate the eyes using their muscles, thus ruling out complete locked-in patients. Despite auditory BCIs overcome the problem of the visuals, there are not many examples of them in the BCI literature. In this paper we review the research and main contributions to auditory BCIs, and compare them with visual BCIs, especially to communicate with complete locked-in patients.	[Lopez-Gordo, M.

SSVEPs were elicited by task-irrelevant 10/15Hz pattern-reversing checkerboards. The participants were asked to respond to deviant transient stimuli of the attended side in the attended modality only. A phase-locking index (PLI) method was employed to characterize SSVEPs. Both unimodal and crossmodal spatial attention resulted in an increase of PLI values over contralateral occipital brain regions. Intermodal attention effects were observed as an increase of the PLI over the same brain areas when the auditory rather than the visual modality was attended. These findings support recent hypotheses that the phase resetting of the brain activity in early sensory cortices is an essential mechanism of multisensory interaction.

The temporal dynamics of emotion regulation: An EEG study of distraction and reappraisal	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion regulation; Reappraisal; Distraction; Event-related potentials; Late positive potential	BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; SUPPRESSION; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; PICTURES; PAIN	Distraction and reappraisal are two widely used forms of emotion regulation. The process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) holds that they differ (1) in when they act on the emotion-generative process, and (2) in their impact on subsequent responses to regulated stimuli. We tested these two predictions by measuring electrocortical responses to neutral and emotional images during two phases. In the regulation phase, images were watched or regulated using distraction or reappraisal. During the re-exposure phase, the same images were passively watched. As predicted, during regulation, distraction reduced the late positive potential (LPP) earlier than reappraisal. Upon re-exposure, images with a distraction (but not reappraisal) history elicited a larger LPP than images with an attend history. This pattern of results suggests that distraction and reappraisal intervene at separate stages during emotion generation, a feature which may have distinct consequences that extend beyond the regulatory episode.

The paradigm based on event related evoked potentials is used in this work. Our main goal was to efficiently solve a binary classification problem: presence or absence of P300 in the registers. Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines were used in a wrapper configuration for feature selection and classification. The original input patterns were provided by two channels (Oz and Fz) of resampled EEG registers and wavelet coefficients. To evaluate the performance of the system, accuracy, sensibility and specificity were calculated. The wrapped wavelet patterns show a better performance than the temporal ones. The results were similar for patterns from channel Oz and Fz, together or separated.

Degradation of white matter tracts related to age or alcoholism should negatively affect the oscillatory activity within the network. Objective This study aims to evaluate the effect of alcoholism and age on delta and theta oscillations and the relationship between these oscillations and measures of white matter microstructural integrity. Methods Data from ten long-term alcoholics to 25 nonalcoholic controls were used to derive P3 from Fz, Cz, and Pz using a visual GO/NOGO protocol. Total power and across trial phase synchrony measures were calculated for delta and theta frequencies. DTI, 1.5 T, data formed the basis of quantitative fiber tracking in the left and right cingulate bundles and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity (lambda L and lambda T) measures were calculated from each tract. Results NOGO P3 amplitude and delta power at Cz were smaller in alcoholics than controls. Lower delta total power was related to higher lambda T in the left and right cingulate bundles. GO P3 amplitude was lower and GO P3 latency was longer with advancing age, but none of the time-frequency analysis measures displayed significant age or diagnosis effects. Conclusions The relation of delta total power at CZ with lT in the cingulate bundles provides correlational evidence for a functional role of fronto-parietal white matter tracts in inhibitory processing.

Data collected from individuals using an SMR-based or P300-based BCI were evaluated offline to estimate the impact on performance of continually adapting the parameters of the translation algorithm during BCI operation. The performance of the SMR-based BCI was enhanced by adaptive updating of the feature weights or adaptive normalization of the features. In contrast. P300 performance did not benefit from either of these procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FZ is unable to recognize fearful facial expressions. Instead, he consistently misinterprets expressions of fear for expressions of surprise. Employing EEG/ERP measures, we investigated whether presentation of fearful and surprised facial expressions would lead to different response patterns. We also measured ERPs to aversively conditioned and unconditioned fearful faces. We compared ERPs elicited by supraliminally and subliminally presented conditioned fearful faces (CS+), unconditioned fearful faces (CS-) and surprised faces. Despite FZ's inability to recognize fearful facial expressions in emotion recognition tasks, ERP components showed different response patterns to pictures of surprised and fearful facial expressions, indicating that covert or implicit recognition of fear is still intact. Differences between ERPs to CS+ and CS-were only found when these stimuli were presented subliminally. This indicates that intact right amygdala function is not necessary for aversive conditioning. Previous studies have stressed the importance of the right amygdala for discriminating facial emotional expressions and for classical conditioning. Our study suggests that the right amygdala is necessary for explicit recognition of fear, while implicit recognition of fear and classical conditioning may still occur following lesion of the right amygdala.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants watched a silent movie (Passive condition) and discriminated deviant vowels (Active condition). The auditory sequence included 4 French vowels, /u/ (standard) and /o/, /y/ and /phi/ as deviants, produced by 3 different speakers. As the vowel /o/ is closer to /u/ than the other deviants in acoustic distance, we predicted smaller mismatch negativity (MMN) and smaller N1 component, as well as higher error rate and longer reaction times. Results were in line with these predictions. Moreover, the MMN was elicited by all deviant vowels independently of speaker variability. By contrast, the Vowel by Speaker interaction was significant in the Active listening condition thereby showing that subtle within-category differences are processed at the attentive level. These results suggest that while vowels are categorized pre-attentively according to phonemic representations and independently of speaker variability, participants are sensitive to between-speaker differences when they focus attention on vowel processing.

In the present EEG study we investigated the neural and temporal dynamics of action planning in participants with right-sided HCP (n=10) and in left-handed control subjects (n=10). An anticipatory planning task was used in which participants were required to grasp and rotate a hexagonal knob over different angles (60 degrees, 120 degrees or 180 degrees). At a behavioral level, participants with HCP were slower in their movements and often selected an inappropriate grip when grasping the object. At a neural level, individuals with HCP showed a strong reduction in the amplitude of the P2 component, likely reflecting an impaired process of action selection. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between the P2 amplitude and grasping and rotation times. The P2 component was localized to sources in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), an area that is known to be involved in orienting visual body parts in space. Together these findings suggest that anticipatory planning deficits in cerebral palsy arise mainly due to an impaired process of action selection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Preliminary MEG/EEG Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Cortical Network Analysis with Neuroelectromagnetic and Hemodynamic Signals	MAY, 2009	Univ Rome Sapienza, Rome, ITALY		Univ Rome Sapienza	Brain-computer interface; P300; MEG; EEG; SWLDA	BCI	We investigated which evoked response component occurring in the first 800 ms after stimulus presentation was most suitable to be used in a classical P300-based brain-computer interface speller protocol. Data was acquired from 275 Magnetoencephalographic sensors in two subjects and from 61 Electroencephalographic sensors in four. To better characterize the evoked physiological responses and minimize the effect of response overlap, a 1000 ms Inter Stimulus Interval was preferred to the short (< 400 ms) trial length traditionally used in this class of BCIs. To investigate which scalp regions conveyed information suitable for BCI, a stepwise linear discriminant analysis classifier was used. The method iteratively analyzed each individual sensor and determined its performance indicators. These were then plotted on a 2-D topographic head map. Preliminary results for both EEG and MEG data suggest that components other than the P300 maximally represented in the occipital region, could be successfully used to improve classification accuracy and finally drive this class of BCIs.

Twenty-eight children, 22 young adults and 20 middle-aged participants were administered the same sample of written words and normalized amplitudes of delta, theta, alpha and beta bands were analyzed. Only young adults showed rightwards lateralization in delta frequency band. Task-dependent right-lateralization marked adults' theta and alpha distributions, whereas only linguistic vs. non-linguistic differences were found in children. Concerning the high-beta band, all groups showed left-lateralized linguistic effects. In adults slow rhythms represent indices of active inhibition of task-irrelevant regions, but in children they marked incomplete automated linguistic processing. The high-beta band revealed task-relevant left hemisphere linguistic activity in all groups, therefore representing the most reliable EEG marker of language hemispheric dominance in children and adults.

Steady-state sounds lack such changing-state features and do not impair performance. An EEG experiment (N=16) explored the distinguishing neurophysiological aspects of detrimental changing-state speech (3-token sequence) compared to ineffective steady-state speech (1-token sequence) on serial recall performance. We analyzed evoked and induced activity related to the memory items as well as spectral activity during the retention phase. The main finding is that the behavioral sound effect was exclusively reflected by attenuated token-induced gamma activation most pronounced between 5060 Hz and 50100 ms post-stimulus onset. Changing-state speech seems to disrupt a behaviorally relevant ongoing process during target presentation (e.g., the serial binding of the items).

TopoToolbox: Using Sensor Topography to Calculate Psychologically Meaningful Measures from Event-Related EEG/MEG	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; MEG; TOMOGRAPHY; SEPARATION; ATTENTION; FMRI; ERP	The open-source toolbox "TopoToolbox" is a suite of functions that use sensor topography to calculate psychologically meaningful measures (similarity, magnitude, and timing) from multisensor event-related EEG and MEG data. Using a GUI and data visualization, TopoToolbox can be used to calculate and test the topographic similarity between different conditions (Tian and Huber, 2008). This topographic similarity indicates whether different conditions involve a different distribution of underlying neural sources. Furthermore, this similarity calculation can be applied at different time points to discover when a response pattern emerges (Tian and Poeppel, 2010). Because the topographic patterns are obtained separately for each individual, these patterns are used to produce reliable measures of response magnitude that can be compared across individuals using conventional statistics (Davelaar et al. Submitted and Huber et al., 2008). TopoToolbox can be freely downloaded. It runs under MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) and supports user-defined data structure as well as standard EEG/MEG data import using EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).

The contingent negative variation resolution (CNV-R) is an electroencephalographic potential elicited after the second (informative) stimulus in warned Go/NoGo tasks requiring a response to one type of stimulus (Go) but not to the other (NoGo). Whereas the CNV-R across conditions is a measure of executive functions, the augmented potential in the NoGo condition is a specific measure of inhibitory processes. The aim was to examine the presumed linkage between executive processes and the CNV-R with special regard to inhibition in the NoGo condition, and to test whether any effects of age on this potential can be explained by a failure of (inhibitory) executive functions. Nineteen young and 15 elderly non-demented healthy volunteers were examined in a Go/NoGo CNV-R paradigm and on a test of executive functions focussed on set shifting (Trail Making test). Results showed: (1) Better executive functions are associated with higher amplitudes of the CNV-R across conditions. (2) The CNV-R is higher for elderly than younger subjects; this increment is much stronger in the NoGo condition. In conclusion, the CNV-R across conditions reflects executive processes such as the shift of motor set. A higher CNV-R for elderly subjects (particularly of the inhibition-related NoGo CNV-R) indicates that this group is not impaired in the available amount of executive control but may exert such control for task demands where young subjects do not require it.

Association of impaired EEG mu wave suppression, negative symptoms and social functioning in biological motion processing in first episode of psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						First-episode psychosis; Mu suppression; Biological motion; Negative symptoms; Social adjustment	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTION; RHYTHM; 1ST-EPISODE; MODULATION; ANHEDONIA; CHILDREN	Background: Event related desynchronization (ERD) of mu waves, or mu suppression, over sensorimotor cortex has been observed in response to self-generated movement, viewing movement, or imaging movement. Mu suppression is especially pronounced when the movement has social relevance and is being generated by a biological entity indicating successful social adaptation. And since social adaptation problems are common in schizophrenia, the authors designed a study to test mu wave suppression in a first episode of psychosis population. Methods: A total of 32 subjects (first episode of psychosis patients N = 20; healthy comparison subjects N = 12) aged 13-34 watched movement videos with and without socially relevant cues, executed by biological or nonbiological agents. Scalp electrode EEG recordings of mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) over sensorimotor cortex during the session were used to calculate mu wave suppression. Average mu suppression was compared within and between groups, as well as correlations between mu suppression and clinical measures. Results: First episode patients showed significantly reduced mu wave suppression over sensorimotor cortex when viewing biological motion, compared to healthy subjects. In addition, negative symptom burden and poor social adjustment correlated with impaired mu wave suppression. Conclusions: Our finding provides the first description of impaired event related desynchronization of mu waves in response to biological motion and its correlation with negative symptoms and social adjustment in the first episode of psychosis. Future studies can be conducted to determine if mu wave suppression represents an endophenotype with potential applications in biological treatments of negative symptoms and social functioning deficits in schizophrenia.

Abnormal ERD/ERS but Unaffected BOLD Response in Patients with Unverricht-Lundborg Disease During Index Extension: A Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Unverricht-Lundborg disease; ERD/ERS analysis; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI	PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONUS EPILEPSY; SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL REFLEX MYOCLONUS; EPM1-UNVERRICHT-LUNDBORG DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COREGISTRATION; CONNECTIVITY	Electrophysiological studies indicate that Unverricht-Lundborg's disease (ULD), the most common form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy in Europe, is characterized by the involvement of multiple cortical regions in degenerative changes that lead to enhanced excitation and deficient inhibition. We searched for the haemodynamic correlates of these effects using functional MRI (fMRI) of self-paced index extensions, a well-accepted task highlighting significant differences. EEG and fMRI were simultaneously acquired in 11 ULD patients and 16 controls, performing the index extensions individually (event-related task) as well as repetitively (block task). ERD/ERS analysis was performed for the EEG data in the alpha and beta bands. fMRI time-series were analyzed using the traditional general linear model, as well as with an assumption-free approach, and by means of cross-region correlations representing functional connectivity. In line with the existing literature, ULD patients had enhanced desynchronization in the alpha band and reduced post-movement synchronization in the beta band. By contrast, fMRI did not reveal any difference between the two groups; there were no activation intensity, latency or extent effects, no significant engagement of additional regions, and no changes to functional connectivity. We conclude that, so long as the patients are executing a task which does not induce obvious action myoclonus, the hypothesized abnormalities in pyramidal neuron and interneuron dynamics are relatively subtle, embodied in processes which are not metabolically-demanding and take place at a time-scale invisible to fMRI.

Cognitive Abilities and 50-and 100-msec Paired-Click Processes in Schizophrenia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSE; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; TEMPORAL GYRUS VOLUME; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; POTENTIAL ABNORMALITIES; THOUGHT-DISORDER; P50 SUPPRESSION; GATING DEFICITS; ATTENTION	Objective: Abnormal 50- and 100-msec event-related brain activity derived from paired-click procedures are well established in schizophrenia. There is little agreement on whether group differences in the ratio score, i.e., the ratio of EEG amplitude after the second stimulus (S2) to the amplitude after the first stimulus (S1), reflect an encoding or gating abnormality. In addition, the functional implications remain unclear. In the present study, EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were used to examine paired-click measures and cognitive correlates of paired-click activity. Method: EEG and whole-cortex MEG data were acquired during the standard paired-click paradigm in 73 comparison subjects and 79 schizophrenia patients. Paired-click ratio scores were obtained at 50 msec (P50 evoked potential at Cz, M50 at left and right superior temporal gyrus STG]) and 100 msec (N100 at Cz, M100 at left and right STG). A cognitive battery assessing attention, working memory, and long-delay memory was administered. IQ was also estimated. Results: Groups differed on ratio score and amplitude of S1 response. Ratio scores at 50 msec and 100 msec and S1 amplitude predicted variance in attention (primarily S1 amplitude), working memory, and long-delay memory. The attention findings remained after removal of variance associated with IQ. Conclusions: Associations between paired-click measures and cognitive performance in patients support 50- msec and 100-msec ratio and amplitude scores as clinically significant biomarkers of schizophrenia. In general, cognitive performance was better predicted by the ability to encode auditory information than the ability to filter redundant information.

Especially, its counterpart in frequency domain, spectral GC, as well as other Granger-like causality measures have recently been applied to study causal interactions between brain areas in different frequency ranges during cognitive and perceptual tasks. In this paper, we show that: 1) GC in time domain cannot correctly determine how strongly one time series influences the other when there is directional causality between two time series, and 2) spectral GC and other Granger-like causality measures have inherent shortcomings and/or limitations because of the use of the transfer function (or its inverse matrix) and partial information of the linear regression model. On the other hand, we propose two novel causality measures (in time and frequency domains) for the linear regression model, called new causality and new spectral causality, respectively, which are more reasonable and understandable than GC or Granger-like measures. Especially, from one simple example, we point out that, in time domain, both new causality and GC adopt the concept of proportion, but they are defined on two different equations where one equation (for GC) is only part of the other (for new causality), thus the new causality is a natural extension of GC and has a sound conceptual/theoretical basis, and GC is not the desired causal influence at all. By several examples, we confirm that new causality measures have distinct advantages over GC or Granger-like measures. Finally, we conduct event-related potential causality analysis for a subject with intracranial depth electrodes undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and show that, in the frequency domain, all measures reveal significant directional event-related causality, but the result from new spectral causality is consistent with event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral GC as well as other Granger-like measures are shown to generate misleading results. The proposed new causality measures may have wide potential applications in economics and neuroscience.

The use of the P300 event-related potentials as control feature allows users to choose between various options (letters or icons) requiring a very short calibration phase. The aim of this work is to improve performances and flexibility of P300 based BCIs. An efficient BCE system should be able to understand user's intentions from the ongoing EEG, abstaining from doing a selection when the user is engaged in a different activity, and changing its speed of selection depending on current user's attention level. Our self-paced system addresses all these issues representing an important step beyond the classical synchronous P300 BCI that forces the user in a continuous control task. Experimentation has been performed on 10 healthy volunteers acting on a BCI-controlled domestic environment in order to demonstrate the potential usability of BCI systems in everyday life. Results show that the self-paced BCI increases information transfer rate with respect to the synchronous one, being very robust, at the same time, in avoiding false negatives when the user is not engaged in a control task.

J	Kopp, F; Lindenberger, U				Kopp, Franziska; Lindenberger, Ulman			Effects of joint attention on long-term memory in 9-month-old infants: an event-related potentials study	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; 1ST YEAR; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; NOVELTY; PREFERENCES; FAMILIAR; OBJECTS; RECALL; TIME	Joint attention develops during the first year of life but little is known about its effects on long-term memory. We investigated whether joint attention modulates long-term memory in 9-month-old infants. Infants were familiarized with visually presented objects in either of two conditions that differed in the degree of joint attention (high versus low). EEG indicators in response to old and novel objects were probed directly after the familiarization phase (immediate recognition), and following a 1-week delay (delayed recognition). In immediate recognition, the amplitude of positive slow-wave activity was modulated by joint attention. In the delayed recognition, the amplitude of the Pb component differentiated between high and low joint attention. In addition, the positive slow-wave amplitude during immediate and delayed recognition correlated with the frequency of infants' looks to the experimenter during familiarization. Under both high- and low-joint-attention conditions, the processing of unfamiliar objects was associated with an enhanced Arc component. Our results show that the degree of joint attention modulates EEG during immediate and delayed recognition. We conclude that joint attention affects long-term memory processing in 9-month-old infants by enhancing the relevance of attended items.

The processing of relatively high intensity stimuli has been well documented. Sleep normally occurs in much less noisy environments. The present study therefore employed ERPs to examine the extent of processing of very low intensity (near-hearing threshold) stimuli. Design: Brief duration 1000 Hz auditory tone bursts varying in intensity at random from -5 to +45 dB from normative hearing level (nHL) in 10 dB steps were presented every 1.5 to 2.5 s when the subject was awake and reading a book and again during all-night sleep. Subjects: n = 10 healthy young adults. Measurements and Results: In the waking state, the auditory stimuli elicited a negative-going deflection, N1, peaking at about 100 ms, followed by a smaller positivity, P2, peaking at about 180 ms. N1-P2 gradually decreased in amplitude with decreases in stimulus intensity and remained visible at near-hearing threshold levels. During NREM sleep, the amplitude of N1 was at baseline level and was reduced to only 15% to 20% of its waking amplitude during REM sleep. P2 was much larger in sleep than in wakefulness. Importantly, during sleep, P2 could be reliably elicited by the auditory stimuli to within 15 dB of threshold. During NREM, a large amplitude negativity peaking at about 350 ms was elicited by the higher intensity stimuli. This N350 was much reduced in amplitude during REM sleep. A significant N350 was not, however, elicited when stimuli intensity levels were below 25 dB nHL. Conclusions: Auditory stimuli that are only slightly above hearing threshold appear to be processed extensively during a 200 to 400 ms interval in both NREM and REM sleep. The nature of this processing is, however, very different compared to the waking state.

Modulations in the Oscillatory Activity of the Globus Pallidus internus neurons during a Behavioral Task-A Point Process Analysis	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION/SYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; DISCHARGE; MOVEMENTS; CORTEX; EEG	The behavioral state of a subject is hypothesized to be reflected in the oscillatory modulations of the spiking activity of certain groups of neurons. In particular, the beta-and gamma-bands have been experimentally shown to be related to movement in the motor cortex and parts of the basal ganglia. Here, we analyze the relationship between directional tuning and oscillations in the beta-and gamma-bands of the neurons in the Globus Pallidus internus (GPi) of two healthy nonhuman primates during a radial center-out motor task. We find that, during the planning stages of the movement, the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying gamma oscillations increases when compared to the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying beta oscillations. A similar trend is not seen in non-directionally tuned neurons. This suggests that the GPi neurons involved in the planning of movement communicate information using an emergence of oscillations in the gamma-band.

To perceive 3D, the visual system has to reconstruct 3D configurations of objects, their structures and locations in space, from their 2D image on the retinas. In this study, we used the EEG to analyze the brain activities during the subjects watched the horizontal size disparity pattern and the vertical size disparity pattern (two similar binocular parallax activities) stimulus, and compared the difference between these conditions. The experiment results indicated that a bigger negative voltage appeared at occipitotemporal sites around 120 ms latencies when using the horizontal size disparity. However, there is no obvious change when using the vertical size disparity. All of the data in this experiment suggest that the brain activities activated by the horizontal size disparity pattern are stronger than those by the vertical size disparity.

Why some faces won't be remembered: brain potentials illuminate successful versus unsuccessful encoding for same-race and other-race faces	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						facial memory; recognition; social categorization; expertise; EEG; ERPs; other-race effect	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OUT-GROUP HOMOGENEITY; OWN-RACE; RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS; SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION; CONTACT HYPOTHESIS; PERSON PERCEPTION; AMBIGUOUS FACES; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL-SEARCH	Memory is often less accurate for faces from another racial group than for faces from one's own racial group. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are a topic of active debate. Contemporary theories invoke factors such as inferior expertise with faces from other racial groups and an encoding emphasis on race-specifying information. We investigated neural mechanisms of this memory bias by recording event-related potentials while participants attempted to memorize same-race (SR) and other-race (OR) faces. Brain potentials at encoding were compared as a function of successful versus unsuccessful recognition on a subsequent-memory test. Late positive amplitudes predicted subsequent memory for SR faces and, to a lesser extent, for OR faces. By contrast, the amplitudes of earlier frontocentral N200 potentials and occipito-temporal P2 potentials were larger for later-remembered relative to later-forgotten OR faces. Furthermore, N200 and P2 amplitudes were larger for OR faces with features considered atypical of that race relative to faces that were race-stereotypical (according to a consensus from a large group of other participants). In keeping with previous reports, we infer that these earlier potentials index the processing of unique or individuating facial information, which is key to remembering a face. Individuation may tend to be uniformly high for SR faces but lower and less reliable for OR faces. Individuation may also be more readily applied for OR faces that appear less stereotypical. These electrophysiological measures thus provide novel evidence that poorer memory for OR faces stems from encoding that is inadequate because it fails to emphasize individuating information.

So far, on electroencephalographic data, only event-related potentials (ERPs) were considered. In this study, we examined the frequency properties of SON. Methods: Data of 17 healthy subjects were processed for equiprobable stimuli of SON, other- and own-name backwards by calculating ERPs, evoked and induced activity for a period of 2000 ms from stimulus onset in the delta, theta, lower and upper alpha bands and averaging for four consequent temporal segments of 500 ms each. Results: For SON, the N1 component's amplitude was larger, while induced activity in the alpha band decreased in the second temporal segment (of 500-1000 ms). No differences between other- and own-name backwards were found. Conclusions: The late reactivity may indicate responses to a stimulus after having recognised it. Alpha is known to play a role in attention and alertness. The results may reflect the fact that the SON stimulus enhances alertness. Significance: The findings correlate previous work about alertness and alpha activity with those about attention capturing of the SON stimulus. We suggest using frequency analysis in research on disorders of consciousness. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective electrophysiological evidence for tDCS-induced excitability changes has been demonstrated for the visual and somatosensory cortex, while evidence for excitability changes in the auditory cortex is lacking. In the present study, we applied tDCS over the left temporal as well as the left temporo-parietal cortex and investigated tDCS-induced effects on auditory evoked potentials after anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation. Results show that anodal and cathodal tDCS can modify auditory cortex reactivity. Moreover, auditory evoked potentials were differentially modulated as a function of site of stimulation. While anodal tDCS over the temporal cortex increased auditory P50 amplitudes, cathodal tDCS over the temporo-parietal cortex induced larger N1 amplitudes. The results directly demonstrate excitability changes in the auditory cortex induced by active tDCS over the temporal and temporo-parietal cortex and might contribute to the understanding of mechanisms involved in the successful treatment of auditory disorders like tinnitus via tDCS.

Deconstructing the "resting" state: exploring the temporal dynamics of frontal alpha asymmetry as an endophenotype for depression	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG asymmetry; resting-state; EEG dynamics; endophenotype; depression	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EEG ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ASYMMETRY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ACTIVATION ASYMMETRY; AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY	Asymmetry in frontal electrocortical alpha-band (8-13 Hz) activity recorded during resting situations (i.e., in absence of a specific task) has been investigated in relation to emotion and depression for over 30 years. This asymmetry reflects an aspect of endogenous cortical dynamics that is stable over repeated measurements and that may serve as an endophenotype for mood or other psychiatric disorders. In nearly all of this research, EEG activity is averaged across several minutes, obscuring transient dynamics that unfold on the scale of milliseconds to seconds. Such dynamic states may ultimately have greater value in linking brain activity to surface EEG asymmetry, thus improving its status as an endophenotype for depression. Here we introduce novel metrics for characterizing frontal alpha asymmetry that provide a more in-depth neurodynamical understanding of recurrent endogenous cortical processes during the resting-state. The metrics are based on transient "bursts" of asymmetry that occur frequently during the resting-state. In a sample of 306 young adults, 143 with a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder (62 currently symptomatic), three questions were addressed: (1) How do novel peri-burst metrics of dynamic asymmetry compare to conventional fast-Fourier transform-based metrics? (2) Do peri-burst metrics adequately differentiate depressed from non-depressed participants? and, (3) what EEG dynamics surround the asymmetry bursts? Peri-burst metrics correlated with traditional measures of asymmetry, and were sensitive to both current and past episodes of major depression. Moreover, asymmetry bursts were characterized by a transient lateralized alpha suppression that is highly consistent in phase across bursts, and a concurrent contralateral transient alpha enhancement that is less tightly phase-locked across bursts. This approach opens new possibilities for investigating rapid cortical dynamics during resting-state EEG.	[Allen, John J.

Current evidence suggests that biochemical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neuropsychological markers can track the disease over time since the MCI stage (also called prodromal AD). The amount of evidence supporting their validity is of variable strength. We have reviewed the current literature and categorized evidence of validity into three classes: Class A, availability of multiple serial studies; Class B a single serial study or multiple cross sectional studies of patients with increasing disease severity from MCI to probable AD; and class C, multiple cross sectional studies of patients in the dementia stage, not including the MCI stage. Several Class A studies suggest that episodic memory and semantic fluency are the most reliable neuropsychological markers of progression. Hippocampal atrophy, ventricular volume and whole brain atrophy are structural MRI markers with class A evidence. Resting-state fMRI and connectivity, and diffusion MR markers in the medial temporal white matter (parahippocampus and posterior cingulum) and hippocampus are promising but require further validation. Change in amyloid load in MCI patients warrant further investigations, e.g. over longer period of time, to assess its value as marker of disease progression. Several spectral markers of resting state EEG rhythms that might reflect neurodegenerative processes in the prodromal stage of AD (EEG power density, functional coupling, spectral coherence, and synchronization) suffer from lack of appropriately designed studies. Although serial studies on late event-related potentials (ERPs) in healthy elders or MCI patients are inconclusive, others tracking disease progression and effects of cholinesterase inhibiting drugs in AD, and cross-sectional including MCI or predicting development of AD offer preliminary evidence of validity as a marker of disease progression from the MCI stage. CSF Markers, such as A beta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau are valuable markers which support the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, these markers are not sensitive to disease progression and cannot be used to monitor the severity of Alzheimer's disease.

Current evidence suggests that biochemical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neuropsychological markers can track the disease over time since the MCI stage (also called prodromal AD). The amount of evidence supporting their validity is of variable strength. We have reviewed the current literature and categorized evidence of validity into three classes: Class A, availability of multiple serial studies; Class B a single serial study or multiple cross sectional studies of patients with increasing disease severity from MCI to probable AD; and class C, multiple cross sectional studies of patients in the dementia stage, not including the MCI stage. Several Class A studies suggest that episodic memory and semantic fluency are the most reliable neuropsychological markers of progression. Hippocampal atrophy, ventricular volume and whole brain atrophy are structural MRI markers with class A evidence. Resting-state fMRI and connectivity, and diffusion MR markers in the medial temporal white matter (parahippocampus and posterior cingulum) and hippocampus are promising but require further validation. Change in amyloid load in MCI patients warrant further investigations, e.g. over longer period of time, to assess its value as marker of disease progression. Several spectral markers of resting state EEG rhythms that might reflect neurodegenerative processes in the prodromal stage of AD (EEG power density, functional coupling, spectral coherence, and synchronization) suffer from lack of appropriately designed studies. Although serial studies on late event-related potentials (ERPs) in healthy elders or MCI patients are inconclusive, others tracking disease progression and effects of cholinesterase inhibiting drugs in AD, and cross-sectional including MCI or predicting development of AD offer preliminary evidence of validity as a marker of disease progression from the MCI stage. CSF Markers, such as A beta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau are valuable markers which support the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, these markers are not sensitive to disease progression and cannot be used to monitor the severity of Alzheimer's disease. For Isoprostane F2 some evidence exists that its increase correlates with the progression and the severity of AD.

For this purpose, we ran an EEG study (N=11) using an oddball paradigm, during which subjects were presented with the phoneme /a/, superimposed with varying degrees of signal-correlated noise. Based on this data set, we address the question to which degree the degradation of the auditory stimuli is reflected on a neural level, even if the disturbance is below the threshold of conscious perception. For those stimuli that are consciously recognized as being disturbed, we suggest the use of the amplitude and latency of the P300 component for assessing the level of disturbance. For disturbed stimuli for which the noise is not perceived consciously, we show for two subjects that a classifier based on shrinkage LDA can be applied successfully to single out stimuli, for which the noise was presumably processed subconsciously.

Evaluation of wavelet techniques in rapid extraction of ABR variations from underlying EEG	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						auditory brainstem response; bioelectric potentials; feature extraction; wavelet transforms; latency-intensity curve	BRAIN-STEM RESPONSE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SIGNALS; FORMS	The aim of this study is to analyse an effective wavelet method for denoising and tracking temporal variations of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The rapid and accurate extraction of ABRs in clinical practice has numerous benefits, including reductions in clinical test times and potential long-term patient monitoring applications. One method of achieving rapid extraction is through the application of wavelet filtering which, according to earlier research, has shown potential in denoising signals with low signal-to-noise ratios. The research documented in this paper evaluates the application of three such wavelet approaches on a common set of ABR data collected from eight participants. We introduced the use of the latency-intensity curve of ABR wave V for performance evaluation of tracking temporal variations. The application of these methods to the ABR required establishing threshold functions and time windows as an integral part of the research. Results revealed that the cyclic-shift-tree-denoising performed superior compared to other tested approaches. This required an ensemble of only 32 epochs to extract a fully featured ABR compared to the 1024 epochs with conventional ABR extraction based on linear moving time averaging.	[De Silva, A.

This research demonstrates that partial-ingroup members are recognized in a manner distinct from double-ingroup and double-outgroup targets. Specifically, when race and university-affiliation are crossed, university-affiliation does not influence recognition for own-race targets, but does for other-race targets, in that other-race/own-university targets are recalled more accurately than other-race/other-university targets. The neurological mechanisms involved in the effect are explored through the inclusion of electroencephalography. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Twelve typically developing children between the ages of 6 and 12 years were administered two visual P300, oddball tasks with a 32-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) system. One of the oddball tasks was specifically designed to reflect sensitivity to asymmetry, a phenomenon common in children and in a variety of disorders involving compulsive behavior. Parents completed the Childhood Routines Inventory. Children's repetitive, compulsive-like behaviors were strongly associated with faster processing of an asymmetrical target stimulus, even when accounting for their P300 latencies on a control task. The research punctuates the continuity between observed brain-behavior links in clinical disorders such as OCD and autism spectrum disorders, and normative variants of repetitive behavior.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Scalp electrode impedance; Combing; Scalp abrading	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG	Electrical activity from the human brain can be recorded via electrodes on the scalp. It is important to reduce the impedance of each electrode to minimize unwanted noise in the recording. Electrode impedance can be improved by abrading the skin to remove dead skin cells. In this experiment, we tested if abrading the skin by combing the scalp leads to a significant reduction in electrode impedance. We compared the mean electrode impedance values of 20 subjects whose scalps were combed prior to electrode cap placement, with 20 subjects whose scalps were not combed. Combing significantly reduced the impedances at central, right, and left areas of the scalp. This finding supports the use of scalp combing to reduce the time and subject discomfort that can be associated with placing scalp electrodes. This is particularly important for experiments testing children. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The short-term effect of verbally assessing drivers' state on vigilance indices during monotonous daytime driving	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Vigilance; Fatigue; Monotony; Driving; Self assessment; Fatigue countermeasures	CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; SLEEPINESS; FATIGUE; PERFORMANCE; TIME; EEG; VALIDATION; SYMPTOMS; TASK	To investigate the effects of verbal assessment of subjective driver state on objective indicators of vigilance state during a monotonous daytime drive, a real road driving study was conducted. During a 4-h drive participants' subjective state (sleepiness, inattention, monotony) was assessed every 20 min by an investigator accompanying the drive. The assessment procedure consisted of roughly 1 min of verbal interaction. Physiological indicators (EEG alpha spindle rate, blink duration, heart rate) revealed a significant improvement of vigilance state during the communication episode as compared to a pre-assessment baseline. The activation persisted for up to 2 min following the end of the verbal interaction. Reaction times supported these findings by indicating a significant decrease after the communication. The P3 amplitude of the auditory event-related potential did not show any consistent results. It can be concluded that a short verbal assessment has positive effects on drivers' vigilance state. However, these effects persist only for a very limited time. The implications of these findings for the frequency of verbal assessment during experimental studies and for the use of verbal communication as a fatigue countermeasure are discussed.

Same-race faces are better recognized than other-race faces: the so-called other-race effect (ORE). Inverting faces impairs recognition more than for any other inverted visual object: the so-called face inversion effect (FIE). Interestingly, the FIE is stronger for same-compared to other-race faces. At the electrophysiological level, inverted faces elicit consistently delayed and often larger N170 compared to upright faces. However, whether the N170 component is sensitive to race is still a matter of ongoing debate. Here we investigated the N170 sensitivity to race in the framework of the FIE. We recorded EEG from Western Caucasian and East Asian observers while presented with Western Caucasian, East Asian and African American faces in upright and inverted orientations. To control for potential confounds in the EEG signal that might be evoked by the intrinsic and salient differences in the low-level properties of faces from different races, we normalized their amplitude-spectra, luminance and contrast. No differences on the N170 were observed for upright faces. Critically, inverted same-race faces lead to greater recognition impairment and elicited larger N170 amplitudes compared to inverted other-race faces. Our results indicate a finer-grained neural tuning for same-race faces at early stages of processing in both groups of observers.

Oddball paradigms are used in BCI to generate event-related potentials (ERPs), like the P300 wave, on targets selected by the user. A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300 waves allows the user to write characters. The P300 speller is composed of two classification problems. The first classification is to detect the presence of a P300 in the electroencephalogram ( EEG). The second one corresponds to the combination of different P300 responses for determining the right character to spell. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The topology of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 waves in the time domain. Seven classifiers based on the CNN are proposed: four single classifiers with different features set and three multiclassifiers. These models are tested and compared on the Data set II of the third BCI competition. The best result is obtained with a multiclassifier solution with a recognition rate of 95.5 percent, without channel selection before the classification. The proposed approach provides also a new way for analyzing brain activities due to the receptive field of the CNN models.

J	Bischoff, P; Rundshagen, I				Bischoff, Petra; Rundshagen, Ingrid			Awareness Under General Anesthesia	DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL			English	Review							INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS; PREVENT AWARENESS; DEPTH; BIS; RECALL	Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind. Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death. For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality. Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed. Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event. In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher. These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness. They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants). Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise. EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness. If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.

Dynamics of large-scale cortical interactions at high gamma frequencies during word production: Event related causality (ERC) analysis of human electrocorticography (ECoG)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Effective connectivity; Granger causality; Large-scale brain networks; High gamma oscillations; Language mapping	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; INFORMATION-FLOW; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NONLINEAR CAUSALITY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Intracranial EEG studies in humans have shown that functional brain activation in a variety of functional-anatomic domains of human cortex is associated with an increase in power at a broad range of high gamma (> 60 Hz) frequencies. Although these electrophysiological responses are highly specific for the location and timing of cortical processing and in animal recordings are highly correlated with increased population firing rates, there has been little direct empirical evidence for causal interactions between different recording sites at high gamma frequencies. Such causal interactions are hypothesized to occur during cognitive tasks that activate multiple brain regions. To determine whether such causal interactions occur at high gamma frequencies and to investigate their functional significance, we used event-related causality (ERC) analysis to estimate the dynamics, directionality, and magnitude of event-related causal interactions using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded during two word production tasks: picture naming and auditory word repetition. A clinical subject who had normal hearing but was skilled in American Signed Language (ASL) provided a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis with reference to a predictable pattern of causal interactions, i.e. that language cortex interacts with different areas of sensorimotor cortex during spoken vs. signed responses. Our ERC analyses confirmed this prediction. During word production with spoken responses, perisylvian language sites had prominent causal interactions with mouth/tongue areas of motor cortex, and when responses were gestured in sign language, the most prominent interactions involved hand and arm areas of motor cortex. Furthermore, we found that the sites from which the most numerous and prominent causal interactions originated, i.e. sites with a pattern of ERC "divergence", were also sites where high gamma power increases were most prominent and where electrocortical stimulation mapping interfered with word production. These findings suggest that the number, strength and directionality of event-related causal interactions may help identify network nodes that are not only activated by a task but are critical to its performance.

The aim of this simultaneous EEG/fMRI study was to examine associated neural correlates in ADHD patients. Patients with ADHD and healthy subjects performed an adapted go/nogo task including a voluntary selection condition allowing participants to freely decide, whether to press the response button. Electrophysiologically, response inhibition and voluntary selection led to fronto-central responses. The fMRI data revealed increased medial/lateral frontal and parietal activity during the voluntary selection task. Frontal brain responses were reduced in ADHD patients compared to controls during free responses, whereas parietal brain functions seemed to be unaffected. These results may indicate that selection processes are related to dysfunctions, predominantly in frontal brain regions in ADHD patients.

The design included false feedback on some trials in order to test the hypothesis that anxious people show stronger neural reactions to feedback that is worse than expected. Participants completed a trial-and-error learning task that required learning the correct key to press in response to face images. EEG was recorded during the task, and the response-locked error-related negativity (ERN) and feedback-locked ERN were computed to measure neural responses to error commission and feedback. As expected, errors produced a response-locked ERN and false feedback produced a feedback-locked ERN in the group as a whole. High levels of trait worry predicted a disproportionately larger ERN following false feedback, but did not predict the magnitude of the response-locked ERN following errors. These results imply that worry-prone people react more strongly to violations of expectations, rather than to errors themselves.

The experiments presented here investigated whether low level musical features, specifically the timbre of a sound, have a direct access route to meaningful representations. Short musical sounds with varying timbres were investigated with regard to their ability to elicit meaningful associations, and the neural mechanisms underlying the meaningful processing of sounds were compared to those underlying the semantic processing of words. Two EEG experiments were carried out, and N400 effects were found for sound and word targets following sound and word primes in a semantic relatedness judgment task. No N400 effects were found in a memory task. The results show that even short musical sounds outside of a musical context are capable of conveying meaning information, but that sounds require more elaborate processing than other kinds of meaningful stimuli.

Not much is known about the cortical information processing of fathers of children suffering from ADHD. The aim of the study was to investigate the cortical information processing of the fathers using the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm. Methods: 14 fathers (mean age 39,4 years) of ADHD children compared with 14 healthy controls (mean age 36,7 years) patients were tested with a contingent negative variation (CNV-) paradigm. We recorded amplitudes of CNV (Cz and Fz) and we calculated habituation slopes. Results: Between groups highly significant differences emerged in a reduced CNV reaction time and a faster habituation within ADHD fathers. Moreover, fathers of ADHD children showed significant higher CNV amplitudes in the frontal area. Conclusion: Fathers of children with ADHD show similar slow potentials as children. The cortical information deficit processing in ADHD could be discussed as genetic disposition, as well as an epigenetic determination.

Lateralized Frontal Eye Field Activity Precedes Occipital Activity Shortly before Saccades: Evidence for Cortico-cortical Feedback as a Mechanism Underlying Covert Attention Shifts	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CONCURRENT TMS-FMRI; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; ERP COMPONENTS; MOVEMENTS	When an eye movement is prepared, attention is shifted toward the saccade end-goal. This coupling of eye movements and spatial attention is thought to be mediated by cortical connections between the FEFs and the visual cortex. Here, we present evidence for the existence of these connections. A visual discrimination task was performed while recording the EEG. Discrimination performance was significantly improved when the discrimination target and the saccade target matched. EEG results show that frontal activity precedes occipital activity contralateral to saccade direction when the saccade is prepared but not yet executed; these effects were absent in fixation conditions. This is consistent with the idea that the FEF exerts a direct modulatory influence on the visual cortex and enhances perception at the saccade end-goal.

The assessment was based on the assay of event related potentials (ERPs). Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 15 volunteers, including 7 men and 8 women. The test protocol comprised determination of P300 wave in each volunteer during exposure to the EMF. To eliminate possible effects of the applied test procedure on the final result, the test was repeated without EMF exposure. P300 latency, amplitude, and latency of the N1, N2, P2 waves were analysed. Results: The statistical analysis revealed an effect of EMF on P300 amplitude. In the experiment with EMF exposure, lower P300 amplitudes were observed only at the time in which the volunteers were exposed to EMF; when the exposure was discontinued, the values of the amplitude were the same as those observed before EMF application. No such change was observed when the experiment was repeated with sham exposure, which may be considered as an indirect proof that lower P300 amplitude values were due to EMF exposure. No statistically significant changes were noted in the latencies of the N1, N2, P2 waves that precede the P300 wave, nor in the latency of the P300 itself. Conclusions: The results suggest that exposure to GSM EMF exerts some effects on CNS, including effects on long latency ERPs.

J	Pires, G; Nunes, U; Castelo-Branco, M				Pires, Gabriel; Nunes, Urbano; Castelo-Branco, Miguel			Statistical spatial filtering for a P300-based BCI: Tests in able-bodied, and patients with cerebral palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; P300; Spatial filtering; Signal-to-noise ratio	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; DATA SET IIB; COMPETITION 2003; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNAL; LOCALIZATION; SELECTION	The effective use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in real-world environments depends on a satisfactory throughput. In a P300-based BCI, this can be attained by reducing the number of trials needed to detect the P300 signal. However, this task is hampered by the very low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of P300 event related potentials. This paper proposes an efficient methodology that achieves high classification accuracy and high transfer rates for both disabled and able-bodied subjects in a standard P300-based speller system. The system was tested by three subjects with cerebral palsy (CP), two subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and nineteen able-bodied subjects. The paper proposes the application of three statistical spatial filters. The first is a beamformer that maximizes the ratio of signal power and noise power (Max-SNR). The second is a beamformer based on the Fisher criterion (FC). The third approach cascades the FC beamformer with the Max-SNR beamformer satisfying simultaneously sub-optimally both criteria (C-FMS). The calibration process of the BCI system takes about 5 min to collect data and a couple of minutes to obtain spatial filters and classification models. Online results showed that subjects with disabilities have achieved, on average, an accuracy and transfer rate only slightly lower than able-bodied subjects. Taking 23 of the 24 participants, the averaged results achieved a transfer rate of 4.33 symbols per minute with a 91.80% accuracy, corresponding to a bandwidth of 19.18 bits per minute. This study shows the feasibility of the proposed methodology and that effective communication rates are achievable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ketamine Modulates Theta and Gamma Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; NMDA RECEPTOR CHANNELS; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VITRO; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; ANIMAL-MODELS; GLUTAMATERGIC MECHANISMS	Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glutamatergic antagonist, has been studied as a model of schizophrenia when applied in subanesthetic doses. In EEG studies, ketamine affects sensory gating and alters the oscillatory characteristics of neuronal signals in a complex manner. We investigated the effects of ketamine on in vivo recordings from the CA3 region of mouse hippocampus referenced to the ipsilateral frontal sinus using a paired-click auditory gating paradigm. One issue of particular interest was elucidating the effect of ketamine on background net-work activity, poststimulus evoked and induced activity. We find that ketamine attenuates the theta frequency band in both background activity and in poststimulus evoked activity. Ketamine also disrupts a late, poststimulus theta power reduction seen in control recordings. In the gamma frequency range, ketamine enhances both background and evoked power, but decreases relative induced power. These findings support a role for NMDA receptors inmediating the balance between theta and gamma responses to sensory stimuli, with possible implications for dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Currently, there remains a high rate of misdiagnosis of the vegetative state. The increasing use of fMRI and EEG tools permits the clinical characterization of these patients to be improved. We first discuss "resting metabolism" and "passive activation" paradigms, used in neuroimaging and evoked potential studies, which merely identify neural activation reflecting "automatic" processing-that is, occurring without the patient's willful intervention. Secondly, we present an alternative approach consisting of instructing subjects to imagine well-defined sensory-motor or cognitive-mental actions. This strategy reflects volitional neural activation and, hence, witnesses awareness. Finally, we present results on blood-oxgen-level-dependent "default mode network"/resting state studies that might be a promising tool in the diagnosis of these challenging patients.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether musical expertise also leads to an altered neurophysiological processing of sub-segmental information available in the speech signal, in particular the voice-onset-time. Using high density EEG recordings we analyzed the neurophysiological responses to voiced and unvoiced consonant-vowel-syllables and noise-analogs in 26 German speaking adult musicians and non-musicians. From the EEG the N1 amplitude of the event-related potential and two microstates from the topographical EEG analysis (one around the N1 amplitude and one immediately preceding the N1 microstate) were calculated to the different stimuli. Similar to earlier studies the N1 amplitude was different to voiced and unvoiced stimuli in non-musicians with larger amplitudes to voiced stimuli The more refined microstate analysis revealed that the microstate within the N1 time window was shorter to unvoiced stimuli in non-musicians. For musicians there was no difference for the N1 amplitudes and the corresponding microstates between voiced and unvoiced stimuli. In addition, there was a longer very early microstate preceding the microstate at the N1 time window to non-speech stimuli only in musicians. Taken together, our findings suggest that musicians process unvoiced stimuli (irrespective whether these stimuli are speech or non speech stimuli) differently than controls. We propose that musicians utilize the same network to analyze unvoiced stimuli as for the analysis of voiced stimuli. As a further explanation it is also possible that musicians devote more neurophysiological resources into the analysis of unvoiced segments.

This type of attention has been explored in vision with the N2pc component, and the present study sought to find an analogous auditory effect. In Experiment 1, two 750-ms sounds were presented simultaneously, one from each of two lateral speakers. On each trial, participants indicated whether one of the two sounds was a pre-defined target. We found that targets elicited an N2ac component: a negativity in the N2 latency range at anterior contralateral electrodes. We also observed a later and more posterior contralateral positivity. Experiment 2 replicated these effects and demonstrated that they arose from competition between attended and unattended tones rather than reflecting lateralized effects of attention for individual tones. The N2ac component may provide a useful tool for studying selective attention within auditory scenes.

J	Dionisie, B; Luca, V				Dionisie, B.; Luca, Veronica			REACTION TIMES (RTs) AND COGNITIVE VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS DURING READING - A COMPARED STUDY	MEDICAL-SURGICAL JOURNAL-REVISTA MEDICO-CHIRURGICALA			Unspecified	Article						PSYCHO-VERBAL VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS (EPs); PSYCHOMETRIC REACTION TIMES (RTS); READING PROCESS		Objective: The main aim of the experiment is to prove the Paivio's theory about the concrete-abstract effect. Methods: A psychoverbal stimulation interface, created by us, was experimented as an IT extension of an EEG / EMG device dedicated for the human brain Evoked Potentials acquisitions (EPs) and reaction times techniques in reading mechanisms assessment. Results: The shortest reaction time was achieved in tests at which the reading has no access to the meaning of words, for concrete word, in both hemisphere. But, in left hemisphere the reaction times for abstract words was shorter than for the abstract word in right hemisphere. EPs acquisition exhibits more negativity of N400 for concrete word and more reverberation of P650 - N750 for abstract words. Conclusions: The difference in mean reaction times sustain the Paivio's theory and the difference in amplitude of N400, P650-N750 for concrete and abstract nouns show that the electric activities of brain are correlated in time and in amplitude with the same effort of processing the words. The psycho-verbal stimulation interface can be used as a medical research tool for studying and assessment the cognitive processes of reading, memory or learning using the endogenous visual event related potentials and the psychometric reaction times.

In the present study, both tonic and phasic theta activity were analysed in 22 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 16 healthy elderly controls. Single-trial theta power responses were evaluated by an active auditory oddball paradigm along an early poststimulus window (0-250 ms) and a late time window (250-500 ms), and then compared to prestimulus theta power during both target tone and standard tone processing. The main findings were: (1) in AD patients, there was an increased prestimulus theta power, as well as no significant poststimulus theta power increase upon both target and non-target stimulus processing; (2) in healthy aged controls, only during target tone processing, an enhancement of both early and late theta responses relative to the prestimulus baseline was found. Moreover, healthy controls had a frontal dominance of theta power. The results might indicate that, during target processing, theta response is not functionally sensitive in AD and cannot be involved in processing demands as efficiently as in healthy controls. From a psychophysiological point of view, this might suggest an impairment of attentional allocation resources. The psychological implications might be related to selective attention/working-memory impairment from the early stage of the disease. Our data confirm that both tonic and phasic theta are relevant indicators of cognitive performance: the lack of a phasic theta and an increase in tonic theta are congruous findings in cognitive decline. Another factor worth noting is that in AD patients theta response is not dominant at the frontal site (as observed in healthy controls), indicating a weaker frontal lobe network reactivity during stimulus processing.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of visual stimuli before delivery of a target event. Stimuli were presented to either the left or right visual field and consisted of 15% targets (downward facing triangle) and 85% of equal numbers of three types of standards (triangles facing left, upwards and right). Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a three-standard predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. Predictive local context affected target detection by reducing the duration of stimulus evaluation compared to detection of non-predictive random targets comparably for both young and older adults, as shown by a P3b latency shift. The peak of an earlier latency context positivity, which was seen only in the predicted compared to the random target condition, was prolonged in the older population compared to young adults. Finally, older subjects elicited a late sustained positivity in the predictive condition, not seen in the younger subjects. Taken together, these findings suggest that local contextual effects on target detection processes are altered with age. (C) 2009 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.

Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus Alters the Cortical Profile of Response Inhibition in the Beta Frequency Band: A Scalp EEG Study in Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ONGOING RESPONSES; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; COMPONENT	Stopping an initiated response could be implemented by a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit, including the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Intracranial recording studies in humans reveal an increase in beta-band power (similar to 16-20 Hz) within the rIFC and STN when a response is stopped. This suggests that the beta-band could be important for communication in this network. If this is the case, then altering one region should affect the electrophysiological response at the other. We addressed this hypothesis by recording scalp EEG during a stop task while modulating STN activity with deep brain stimulation. We studied 15 human patients with Parkinson's disease and 15 matched healthy control subjects. Behaviorally, patients OFF stimulation were slower than controls to stop their response. Moreover, stopping speed was improved for ON compared to OFF stimulation. For scalp EEG, there was greater beta power, around the time of stopping, for patients ON compared to OFF stimulation. This effect was stronger over the right compared to left frontal cortex, consistent with the putative right lateralization of the stopping network. Thus, deep brain stimulation of the STN improved behavioral stopping performance and increased the beta-band response over the right frontal cortex. These results complement other evidence for a structurally connected functional circuit between right frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. The results also suggest that deep brain stimulation of the STN may improve task performance by increasing the fidelity of information transfer within a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit.

Toward a hybrid brain-computer interface based on imagined movement and visual attention	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							OPTIMAL ELECTRODE POSITIONS; EEG; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; SEARCH; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; PATIENT; IMAGERY; PEOPLE	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems do not work for all users. This article introduces a novel combination of tasks that could inspire BCI systems that are more accurate than conventional BCIs, especially for users who cannot attain accuracy adequate for effective communication. Subjects performed tasks typically used in two BCI approaches, namely event-related desynchronization (ERD) and steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), both individually and in a 'hybrid' condition that combines both tasks. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded across three conditions. Subjects imagined moving the left or right hand (ERD), focused on one of the two oscillating visual stimuli (SSVEP), and then simultaneously performed both tasks. Accuracy and subjective measures were assessed. Offline analyses suggested that half of the subjects did not produce brain patterns that could be accurately discriminated in response to at least one of the two tasks. If these subjects produced comparable EEG patterns when trying to use a BCI, these subjects would not be able to communicate effectively because the BCI would make too many errors. Results also showed that switching to a different task used in BCIs could improve accuracy in some of these users. Switching to a hybrid approach eliminated this problem completely, and subjects generally did not consider the hybrid condition more difficult. Results validate this hybrid approach and suggest that subjects who cannot use a BCI should consider switching to a different BCI approach, especially a hybrid BCI. Subjects proficient with both approaches might combine them to increase information throughput by improving accuracy, reducing selection time, and/or increasing the number of possible commands.

An investigation of EEG, genetic and cognitive markers of treatment response to antidepressant medication in patients with major depressive disorder: A pilot study	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Personalized medicine; Antidepressant treatment outcome; Major depressive disorder; Biomarkers; ERPs; QEEG; Neuropsychology; Single nucleotide polymorphism	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; PERCEPTUAL ASYMMETRY; POLYMORPHISM; PREDICTION; ASSOCIATION; FLUOXETINE; PAROXETINE	The aim of this study was to investigate if biomarkers in QEEG, genetic and neuropsychological measures are suitable for the prediction of antidepressant treatment outcome in depression. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were assessed twice, pretreatment and at 8-wk follow-up, on a variety of QEEG and neuropsychological tasks. Additionally, cheek swab samples were collected to assess genetic predictors of treatment outcome. The primary outcome measure was the absolute decrease on the HAM-D rating scale. Regression models were built in order to investigate which markers contribute most to the decrease in absolute HAM-D scores. Patients who had a better clinical outcome were characterized by a decrease in the amplitude of the Auditory Oddball NI at baseline. The 'Met/Met' variant of the COMT gene was the best genetic predictor of treatment outcome. Impaired verbal memory performance was the best cognitive predictor. Raised frontal Theta power was the best EEG predictor of change in HAM-D scores. A tentative integrative model showed that a combination of N1 amplitude at Pz and verbal memory performance accounted for the largest part of the explained variance. These markers may serve as new biomarkers suitable for the prediction of antidepressant treatment outcome. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, when interpreting the results of studies of stroke patients versus healthy controls, there is an inherent difficulty in disentangling the contribution of neuropathology from other sources of between-subject variability. In the present work, we had an unusual opportunity to study an aphasic patient with severe anomia who had incidentally performed a picture naming task in an ERP study as a control subject one year before suffering a left hemisphere stroke. The fortuitous recording of this patient's brain activity before his stroke allows direct comparison of his pre- and poststroke brain activity in the same language production task. The subject did not differ from other healthy subjects before his stroke, but presented major electrophysiological differences after stroke, both in comparison to himself before stroke and to the control group. ERP changes consistently appeared after stroke in a specific time window starting about 250 msec after picture onset, characterized by a single divergent but stable topographic configuration of the scalp electric field associated with a cortical generator abnormally limited to left temporal posterior perilesional areas. The patient's pattern of anomia revealed a severe lexical-phonological impairment and his ERP responses diverged from those of healthy controls in the time window that has previously been associated with lexical-phonological processes during picture naming. Given that his prestroke ERPs were indistinguishable from those of healthy controls, it seems highly likely that the change in his poststroke ERPs is due to changes in language production processes as a consequence of stroke. The patient's neurolinguistic deficits, combined with the ERPs results, provide unique evidence for the role of left temporal cortex in lexical-phonological processing from about 250 to 450 msec during word production.

The novel concept that aspects of sleep homeostasis are determined locally in the cortex contrasts with the established views that global changes in neocortical activity during sleep are achieved through inhibition of ascending arousal systems that originate in the brainstem and hypothalamus. Recent findings Experiments in animals and humans document asymmetries in neocortical electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA), a marker of homeostatic sleep need, as a result of functional activity during waking. In addition to local, use-dependent augmentation of EEG SWA and evoked potentials, expression of plasticity-related genes and of sleep-regulatory cytokines and neuromodulators have been shown to be elevated in a use-dependent manner in neocortex. The functional consequences of local sleep are hypothesized to involve regulation of synaptic plasticity, synaptic homeostasis and energy balance. Summary The evidence for use-dependent modulation of neocortical activity during sleep is compelling and provides novel insights into sleep function. However, local changes in neocortex are generally expressed on a background of global sleep. It remains to be determined if events initiated in the cortex have global sleep-promoting effects and how neocortical and hypothalamic mechanisms of sleep control interact.

Primary maternal preoccupation represents a psychological state in women, marked by heightened sensitivity to one's infant during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Recent neuroimaging research has supported the proposition that there are neural changes that accompany motherhood, differentiating mothers from non-mothers when presented with infant cues.

Certain irregularities in the particular oculomotor behaviour have been proposed they may correspond with specific type of mental disorder. It was our aim to contribute to this question by analyzing the bioelectrical correlates of the visual-oculomotor integration in patients suffering from panic disorder and from depressive symptoms. METHODS: The horizontal saccadic eye movements, optokinetic nystagmus, saccadic eye movement evoked potentials as well as saccadic eye movement related potentials we recorded in the groups of outpatients suffering from depressive symptoms and panic disorder respectively. Groups of healthy volunteers served as control. RESULTS: Saccadic eye movements were found to be significantly more inaccurate as compared to healthy subjects. The gain of the optokinetic nystagmus at middle and high velocities was significantly lower in panic patients. Preparation of motor plan for a saccade as well as the time of the maximal recruitment of the oculomotor muscle units was delayed in both groups of patients and their oculomotor event-related potentials were of the overall longer duration and higher variability as well. CONCLUSION: The changes in oculomotor behavior as well as in its EEG correlates in the groups of above mentioned patients can not be taken as specific for the given disorder. On the other hand, they may help to follow up the course of the complex therapy.

Aversive picture processing: Effects of a concurrent task on sustained defensive system engagement	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; EMG; EEG/ERP; Startle blink; Electrodermal; heart rate	EMOTION; REFLEX; BRAIN	Viewing a series of aversive pictures prompts emotional reactivity reflecting sustained defensive engagement. The present study examined the effects of a concurrent visual task on autonomic, somatic, electrocortical, and facial components of this defensive state. Results indicated that emotional activation was largely preserved despite continuous visual distraction, although evidence of attenuation was observed in startle reflex and electrocortical measures. Concurrent task-specific reactivity was also apparent, suggesting that motivational circuits can be simultaneously activated by stimuli with intrinsic survival significance and instructed task significance and that these processes interact differently across the separate components of defensive engagement.

This is largely associated with sensory feedback from the fingertip when mechanical load is limited. Here, it is possible that the central nervous system facilitates cortical sensory processing to augment feedback to control upright stance. To test this, we compared cortical sensory excitability between tasks with and without light finger touch while standing. Subjects stood in tandem on a force plate with eyes closed while lightly touching a stable surface with the index finger. This was, in two different studies, compared to: (1) no haptic contact or (2) light touch on an object not referenced to balance. Throughout testing, the median nerve was stimulated and electroencephalography was used to measure somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). As expected, availability of stable light touch reduced medial-lateral COP sway. Peak amplitudes for SEP components revealed reduced P100 (48%), but increased P50 (31%), N140 (80%), and P200 (20%) during stable touch versus no touch. The modulation of P50 and N140 was no longer present when comparing stable to control (touch), which suggested that attending to touch on either surface, regardless of stability reference, accounted for these changes. Conversely, P200 was increased (19%) when touching the stable surface. Our data show SEP modulation during a standing balance task related to hand contact. Facilitation of P200 in particular may indicate task-specific regulation of the cortical representation of fingertip afferent input when it is relevant to providing stable cues for static balance control.

The function of this extended period of pre-movement activity is unclear. Although recent studies have suggested that pre-movement activity is influenced by attention to action, little is understood about the specific processes that are involved in this preparatory period prior to voluntary action. We recorded readiness potentials averaged from EEG activity as participants made voluntary self-paced finger movements. We manipulated the processing resources available for action preparation using concurrent perceptual load and cognitive working memory load tasks. Results showed that pre-movement activity was significantly reduced only under conditions of high working memory load, when resources for planning action were limited by the concurrent cognitive load task. In contrast, limiting attentional resources in the perceptual load task had no effect on pre-movement readiness activity. This suggests that movement preparatory processes involve mechanisms of cognitive control that are also required for working memory, and not more general engagement of selective attentional resources. We propose that the extended period of pre-movement neural activity preceding voluntary action reflects the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms for endogenously orienting attention in time, in readiness for the initiation of voluntary action.

Anatomical and neurophysiologic evidence indicates that the rat PPC is part of a network of brain areas involved in directed attention, specifically when new task parameters or conditions are introduced. Here, we test the hypothesis that changes in the local field potential (LFP) of the PPC of rats performing a sustained attention task reflect aspects of detection. Two event-related potentials were observed during detection: the P300 response and the contingent negative variation (CNV). Spectrogram analysis also indicated a detection-specific increase in alpha power in the retention interval of this task. This is consistent with observations from human studies, which indicate that tasks requiring a subject to withhold a response produced a pronounced synchronization of alpha rhythms during the delay, and desynchronization during retrieval. We also found cycles of alpha synchrony and desynchrony in response to a periodic distractor. These cycles were most pronounced in the initial trial block of the distractor when the false alarm rate was highest, and as task performance improved these cycles significantly diminished. This result suggests that alpha cycling in the PPC represent neural activity critical for learning to inhibit distractors. The occurrence of alpha synchronization and desynchronization to attention-demanding stimuli, in addition to the P300 and CNV responses observed during detection, is evidence that rat PPC is involved in sustained attention, particularly in the presence of distractors.

Its diagnosis relies on subjective reports from the afflicted individual and is defined as difficulties in initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, waking up too early or non-restorative sleep. However, insomnia and especially, primary insomnia, has received much attention in insomnia research with the use of objective measures. Insomnia, its peculiarities, most frequent subtypes and two most prominent models will first be briefly introduced. Then, insomnia will be reviewed according to results obtained with the use of neurophysiological measures as basic/traditional as polysomnography to more sophisticated ones such as power spectral analysis, neuroimaging, cyclic alternating patterns and event-related potentials. In addition, a review of the discrepancies between subjective and objective reports of cognitive alterations through neuropsychological testing is offered. The need to combine measures is then highlighted in conclusion.

In the present study, subjects participated as recipients in an ultimatum game, while we recorded their electro-encephalogram (EEG). Participants responded to fair and unfair offers from different human proposers. In addition, participants rated themselves on a measure evaluating their concern for fairness. Results showed that MFN amplitude was more pronounced for unfair offers compared to fair offers. Moreover, this effect was shown to be most pronounced for subjects with high concerns for fairness. Our findings suggest that the MFN not only reflects whether outcomes match expectations, but also reflects whether the process by which these outcomes came about matches a social or even a moral norm. In addition, the present results suggest that people in bargaining situations are not only concerned with their own outcomes, but are also concerned with the fairness of the process that resulted in these outcomes.

We investigated whether dimension-based attention affects processing in early visual stages. Subjects searched for a singleton target among an 8-item array, with the search display preceded by an identical cue array with a dimensionally non-predictive, but spatially predictive singleton. Reaction times (RTs) were increased for changes in the target-defining dimension but not for featural changes within a dimension. This RT effect was mirrored by modulations of the P1 and anterior transition N2 (tN2). Current density reconstructions revealed increased activity in dorsal occipital cortex and decreased activity in left frontopolar cortex owing to repeated dimensional pop-out identities. These findings strengthen dimension-based theories of visual attention by indicating dimension-, rather than feature-, specific influences within the first 110 ms of visual processing.

Load effects in auditory selective attention: Evidence for distinct facilitation and inhibition mechanisms	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Sound; EEG; Human; Electrophysiology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOWN SUPPRESSION DEFICIT; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; CORTEX; MODULATION	It is unknown whether facilitation and inhibition of stimulus processing represent one or two mechanisms in auditory attention. We performed electrophysiological experiments in humans to address these two competing hypothesis. Participants performed an attention task under low or high memory load. Facilitation and inhibition were measured by recording electrophysiological responses to attended and ignored sounds and comparing them to responses to these same sounds when attention was considered to be equally distributed towards all sounds. We observed two late frontally distributed components: a negative one in response to attended sounds, and a positive one to ignored sounds. These two frontally distributed responses had distinct timing and scalp topographies and were differentially affected by memory load. Taken together these results provide evidence that attention-mediated top-down control reflects the activity of distinct facilitation and inhibition mechanisms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Time-variant analysis of phase couplings and amplitude-frequency dependencies of and between frequency components of EEG burst patterns in full-term newborns	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG burst patterns; Full-term neonates; Oscillatory frequency components; Phase-locking; Synchronization; Quadratic phase coupling; Amplitude-frequency correlations; Oscillator model	TRACE ALTERNANT EEG; CORTICOTHALAMIC SYSTEMS; SUPPRESSION PERIOD; QUIET SLEEP; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; QUANTIFICATION; INTERRELATIONS	Objective: Burst activity of the 'trace alternant' (TA) EEG pattern in the quiet sleep of full-term newborns is investigated to explore the timing and the time-variant coupling characteristics of and between a burst's oscillatory components. The working hypothesis is that signal properties provide information about the neuronal initiation processes of the burst, and about the coupling and interrelation dynamics between cortical low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency spindles in thalamic structures which substantially contribute to the burst pattern. Methods: For time-variant phase-locking index (PLI), phase-synchronization index (PSI), quadratic phase coupling (QPC) measures, and amplitude-frequency dependency analyses the Gabor and the Hilbert transformation, both implemented as fast Fourier transformation-based approaches, were used. Additionally, models of mutually coupled Duffing oscillators were adapted to the burst data derived from the neonates ('measured bursts'), and the corresponding 'modeled burst' simulations were analyzed in comparison to the measured bursts. Results: A strong phase-locking of the high-frequency oscillations and synchronization between low-and high-frequency oscillatory activity at burst onset can be observed. The QPC courses and the amplitude of all oscillations rise slightly before or at the burst onset and reach their maximum within the following 1-3 s after onset. Additionally, correlative envelope-envelope and envelope-frequency couplings within and between the burst oscillations can be demonstrated. All theses time-variant signal properties can be simulated by the model. Conclusions: The amplitude-independent phase measures point to a phase stabilization of high-frequency oscillatory activity which occurs before the initiation of the low-frequency oscillation. This finding points to a trigger process in which the thalamus is initially involved. After burst onset the cortical low-frequency oscillation modulates the high-frequency oscillatory activities, where modulation and additional coupling effects can be explained by three mutually coupled oscillators. Significance: The model-based analysis strategy offers an up-to-date methodological guideline and sets a new standard of analysis for the investigation of EEG patterns and event-related potentials.

Absorbed in the task: Personality measures predict engagement during task performance as tracked by error negativity and asymmetrical frontal activity	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; RESPONSE-CONFLICT; SELF-REGULATION; MENTAL FATIGUE; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG ASYMMETRY; REWARD	We hypothesized that interactions between traits and context predict task engagement, as measured by the amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN), performance, and relative frontal activity asymmetry (RFA). In Study 1, we found that drive for reward, absorption, and constraint independently predicted self-reported persistence. We hypothesized that, during a prolonged monotonous task, absorption would predict initial ERN amplitudes, constraint would delay declines in ERN amplitudes and deterioration of performance, and drive for reward would predict left RFA when a reward could be obtained. Study 2, employing EEG recordings, confirmed our predictions. The results showed that most traits that have in previous research been related to ERN amplitudes have a relationship with the motivational trait persistence in common. In addition, trait context combinations that are likely associated with increased engagement predict larger ERN amplitudes and RFA. Together, these results support the hypothesis that engagement may be a common underlying factor predicting ERN amplitude.

This study investigated how violation-, response-, and feedback-related electrophysiological (EEG) activity changes over time during language learning. Twenty-two Dutch learners of German classified short prepositional phrases presented serially as text. The phrases were initially presented without feedback during a pre-test phase, and then with feedback in a training phase on two separate days spaced 1 week apart. The stimuli included grammatically correct phrases, as well as grammatical violations of gender and declension. Without feedback, participants' classification was near chance and did not improve over trials. During training with feedback, behavioral classification improved and violation responses appeared to both types of violation in the form of a P600. Feedback-related negative and positive components were also present from the first day of training. The results show changes in the electrophysiological responses in concert with improving behavioral discrimination, suggesting that the activity is related to grammar learning.

Pathological worry, the hallmark of GAD, has been linked to increased error-related brain activity, although no studies to date have examined the ERN among a clinical GAD sample. The present study measured electrocortical indices of error monitoring in a well-characterized, medication-free GAD sample. Brain activity was recorded in 17 GAD and 24 control subjects. The GAD group was characterized by a larger ERN and an increased difference between error and correct trials: a larger ERN was associated with increased self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with GAD have exaggerated early neural responses to errors, consistent with fMRI work implicating ACC abnormalities in GAD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although early research suggested that greater left than right frontal cortical activity was associated with positive affect, more recent research, primarily on anger, suggests that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with approach motivation, which can be positive (e.g., enthusiasm) or negative in valence (e.g., anger). In addition to reviewing this research on anger, research on guilt, bipolar disorder, and various types of positive affect is reviewed with relation to their association with asymmetric frontal cortical activity. The reviewed research not only contributes to a more complete understanding of the emotive functions of asymmetric frontal cortical activity, but it also points to the importance of considering motivational direction as separate from affective valence in psychological models of emotional space.

Our group has investigated brain oscillatory responses in a small group of AD subjects. We found that the de novo (untreated) AD group differs from both the cholinergically-treated AD group and aged-matched healthy controls in theta and delta responses over left frontal-central areas after cognitive stimulation. On the contrary, the difference observed in AD groups upon a sensory visual stimulation includes response increase over primary or secondary visual sensorial areas compared to controls. These findings imply at least two different neural networks, depending on type of stimulation (i.e. cognitive or sensory). The default mode defined as activity in resting state in AD seems to be affected electrophysiologically. Coherences are also very valuable in observing the group differences, especially when a cognitive stimulus is applied. In healthy controls, higher coherence values are elicited after a cognitive stimulus than after a sensory task. Our findings support the notion of disconnectivity of cortico-cortical connections in AD. The differences in comparison of oscillatory responses upon sensory and cognitive stimulations and their role as a biomarker in AD await further investigation in series with a greater number of subjects.

Neural Time Course of Echo Suppression in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MIDDLE LATENCY COMPONENTS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; DISCRIMINATION SUPPRESSION; PRECEDENCE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; SOUND	In reverberant environments, the brain can suppress echoes so that auditory perception is dominated by the primary or leading sounds. Echo suppression comprises at least two distinct phenomena whose neural bases are unknown: spatial translocation of an echo toward the primary sound, and object capture to combine echo and primary sounds into a single event. In an electroencephalography study, we presented subjects with primary-echo (leading-lagging) click pairs in virtual acoustic space, with interclick delay at the individual's 50% suppression threshold. On each trial, subjects reported both click location (one or both hemifields) and the number of clicks they heard (one or two). Thus, the threshold stimulus led to two common percepts: Suppressed and Not Suppressed. On some trials, a subset of subjects reported an intermediate percept, in which two clicks were perceived in the same hemifield as the leading click, providing a dissociation between spatial translocation and object capture. We conducted time-frequency and event-related potential analyses to examine the time course of the neural mechanisms mediating echo suppression. Enhanced gamma band phase synchronization (peaking at similar to 40 Hz) specific to successful echo suppression was evident from 20 to 60 ms after stimulus onset. N1 latency provided a categorical neural marker of spatial translocation, where as N1 amplitude still reflected the physical presence of a second (lagging) click. These results provide evidence that (1) echo suppression begins early, at the latest when the acoustic signal first reaches cortex, and (2) the brain spatially translocates a perceived echo before the primary sound captures it.

These representations have been associated to the left and the right hemispheres respectively (Kosslyn, 1987). Recent studies have focused on the temporal dynamics of spatial relation processing, with working memory task designs. In this light, we examined the suggested lateralization effect in an ERP study incorporating a visual half field match-to-sample design, in which two sequentially presented stimuli were compared. By manipulating the length of the retention intervals between the two stimuli (500 ms, 2000 ms, and 5000 ms), spatial working memory effects were studied at three separate stages of working memory; encoding, memorization, and retrieval. The hypothesized interaction of instruction and visual field was found in the behavioural data, restricted to the 2000 ms retention interval. The EEG data indicate a strong overall right hemisphere effect which is likely related to spatial working memory in general. Categorical and coordinate processing appears to already differentiate during the encoding stage in the P300 complex (300-500 ms after presentation of the first stimulus), where instruction interacts significantly with hemisphere in the parietal area. We found a clear right hemisphere advantage for coordinate processing and no lateralization for categorical processing. We argue that the outcome indicates qualitative rather than quantitative differences between categorical and coordinate processing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[van der Ham, Ineke J.

In the present chapter we first provide an introduction to the techniques and signals of non-invasive electrophysiology (Part 1) and then explain its application to perceptual (2) and cognitive processes (3). We discuss some of the most widely investigated and replicated electrophysiological features of schizophrenia, including the P50, P1, MMN and P3. Recent applications of time frequency analysis techniques have allowed for a more detailed investigation of the neural mechanisms of cognition and its dysfunction through measures of oscillatory activity (4). We finally introduce some of the current approaches that combine non-invasive neurophysiology, pharmacology and genetics. We will discuss their findings in the context of cellular and molecular models of schizophrenia, particularly in relation to several neurotransmitter systems (5). We argue that cognitive neurophysiology can provide interesting intermediate phenotypes of schizophrenia.

It is unclear, however, at what stage of processing multiple ACSs are implemented. We took advantage of the excellent temporal resolution of electroencephalography to demonstrate that the maintenance of multiple ACSs influences later stages of attentional selection rather than providing an early attentional filter. N2pc analyses for cues and targets revealed a similar degree of spatial capture for any peripheral cue, regardless of control settings, with target P3s reflecting the application of the ACS color contingencies.

Effects of Parametrical and Trial-to-Trial Variation in Prior Probability Processing Revealed by Simultaneous Electroencephalogram/Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT PREPARATION; NEURAL CIRCUITRY	Prior knowledge of the probabilities concerning decision alternatives facilitates the selection of more likely alternatives to the disadvantage of others. The neural basis of prior probability (PP) integration into the decision-making process and associated preparatory processes is, however, still essentially unknown. Furthermore, trial-to-trial fluctuations in PP processing have not been considered thus far. In a previous study, we found that the amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) in a precueing task is sensitive to PP information (Scheibe et al., 2009). We investigated brain regions with a parametric relationship between neural activity and PP and those regions involved in PP processing on a trial-to-trial basis in simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Conventional fMRI analysis focusing on the information content of the probability precue revealed increasing activation of the posterior medial frontal cortex with increasing PP, supporting its putative role in updating action values. EEG-informed fMRI analysis relating single-trial CNV amplitudes to the hemodynamic signal addressed trial-to-trial fluctuations in PP processing. We identified a set of regions mainly consisting of frontal, parietal, and striatal regions that represents unspecific response preparation on a trial-to-trial basis. A subset of these regions, namely, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the inferior parietal lobule, showed activations that exclusively represented the contributions of PP to the trial-to-trial fluctuations of the CNV.

AEGR) and target detection (auditory event-related gamma responses. AERGR) in healthy controls (n = 10) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 10) using both single-trial and averaged time-frequency data analysis. The results show that single-trial gamma responses in patients were altered in magnitude and topographic pattern for both the AEGR and the AERGR experimental conditions, whereas no differences were found for the averaged evoked gamma response. At the single-trial level, auditory stimuli elicited higher gamma responses at both anterior and occipital sites in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Furthermore, in patients with schizophrenia target detection compared to passive listening to stimuli was related to increased single-trial gamma power at frontal sites. In controls enhancement of the gamma response was only apparent for the averaged gamma response, with a distribution largely restricted to anterior sites. The differences in oscillatory activity between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia were not reflected in the behavioral measure (i.e., counting targets). We conclude that gamma activity triggered by auditory stimuli in schizophrenic patients might have less selectivity in timing and alterations in topography and may show changes in amplitude modulation with task demands. The present study may indicate that in patients with schizophrenia neuronal information is not adequately transferred, possibly due to an over-excitability of neuronal networks and excessive pruning of local connections in association cortex.

However, rather than characteristic peak deferral and suppression, the time jitter of the peak in SSEP related with time-variant neurological abnormalities is diminished by the commonly used ensemble average method. This paper utilizes the second order blind identification (SOBI) technique to extract characteristic peak information from one trial of SSEPs. Sixteen male Wistar rats were subjected to 7 or 9 min of asphyxial CA (n = 8 per group). The SSEPs from median nerve stimulation were recorded for 4 h after CA and then for 15 min periods at 24,48 and 72 h. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by neurologic deficit score (NDS) at 72 h post-CA. The SSEP signal was analyzed offline with SOBI processing in Matlab. The N10 feature of SSEP was compared between good (NDS >= 50) and bad (NDS < 50) outcomes. After processed by SOBI, the N10 detection rate was significantly increased (p < 0.001) from 90 min post-CA. Statistical difference of the latency variance of the N10 between good and bad outcome groups existed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-CA (p <= 0.001). Our study is the first application using SOBI detecting variance in neural signals like SSEP. N10 latency variance, related with neurophysiological dysfunction, increased after hypoxic-ischemic injury. The SOBI technique is an efficient method in the identification of peak detection and offers a favorable alternative to reveal the neural transmission variation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Habitual Short Sleep Impacts Frontal Switch Mechanism in Attention to Novelty	SLEEP			English	Article						Short sleep; ERPs; attention; memory; sleep extension	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; PRIMARY INSOMNIA; HUMAN BRAIN; DEPRIVATION; MEMORY; RISK; ERP; REPRESENTATION	Study Objectives: Reduced time in bed relative to biological sleep need is common. The impact of habitual short sleep on auditory attention has not been studied to date. In the current study, we utilized novelty oddball tasks to evaluate the effect of habitual short sleep on brain function underlying attention control processes measured by the mismatch negativity (MMN, index of pre-attentive stage), P3a (attention-dependent), and P3b (memory-dependent) event related brain potentials (ERPs). An extended time in bed in a separate study was used to evaluate the possible reversal of the impairments of these processes in habitual short sleepers. Methods: Ten self-defined short sleepers (total sleep time [TST] <= 6h) and 9 normal-sleeping subjects with TST 7-8 h, participated. ERPs were recorded via a 64-channel EEG system. Two test conditions: "ignore" and "attend" were implemented. The ERPs were analyzed and compared between groups on the 2 task conditions and frontal/central/parietal electrodes by 3-factor ANOVA. Sleep diary data were compared between groups by t-test. Sleep was recorded by the Zeo sleep monitoring system for a week in both habitual and extended sleep conditions at home. Results: The main findings of the present study show that short sleeping individuals had deficiency in activity of the MMN and P3a brain responses over frontal areas compared to normal-sleeping subjects. The P3b amplitude was increased over frontal areas and decreased over parietal with respect to the control group. Extension of time in bed for one week increased TST (from 5.7 h to 7.4 h), and concomitantly MMN amplitude increased from -0.1 mu V up to -1.25 mu V over frontal areas. Conclusions: Reduced time in bed is associated with deficiency of the neuronal process associated with change detection, which may recover after one week of sleep extension, whereas attention-dependent neural processes do not normalize after this period of time in habitually short sleeping individuals and may require longer recovery periods.

Here, we investigated the temporal and spectral dynamics as well as the cortical networks underlying the lateralized modulation of executive functions related to response inhibition. To this end, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during tachistoscopic presentation of verbal 'Go' and 'Nogo' stimuli in the left (LVF) and the right visual field (RVF). Participants committed fewer false alarms to verbal Nogo stimuli presented in the RVF than to stimuli presented in the LVF. This asymmetry was paralleled by neurophysiological data. The Nogo-N2 and related delta frequency band power were stronger when response inhibition was driven by stimuli presented in the LVF, implying a stronger response conflict. This effect was mediated by stronger activations in bilateral medial-prefrontal and especially left parietal networks. This shows that asymmetries in behavioural performance do not necessarily reflect differences in the overall capability of one hemisphere to solve a task. Even though information is initially confined to one hemisphere after tachistoscopic presentation, this does not primarily cause behavioural asymmetries. Instead, hemispheric dominances in information processing can induce differences in demands on cognitive processes operating via bilateral networks that ultimately drive behavioural asymmetries.

Effect of Homobaric Pure Oxygen on Sensory Gating in the Human Brain	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Pure oxygen; Auditory sensory gating; Event-related field potential (ERFP); Field potential mapping	SCHIZOPHRENIA; THERAPY; INJURY; IMPAIRMENT; MODULATION; ATTENTION	Sensory gating, a viable function of the brain, is an adaptive mechanism to prevent overstimulation of nervous system. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of homobaric pure (i.e. 100%) oxygen on the human brain at different periods of inhalation. EEG was recorded while an auditory paired-click sensory gating test was conducted during 4 study periods: before inhalation of pure oxygen (Before), inhalation of 100% oxygen (air in control group) for 20 min (Oxy20) and 50 min (Oxy50), 30 min after oxygen (air in control group) inhalation (After). Each of the auditory stimuli elicited 4 clear peaks at 20, 39, 55 and 100 ms in ERPs, demonstrating that sensory gating is a multi-stage process. Comparing the S1-S2 differences of field potentials between two groups, significant experimental effects (P < 0.05-0.01) were shown at Oxy50 and After periods mainly at the 20 and 100 ms peak in ERPs. Pure oxygen was experimentally shown, for the first time, to affect the human brain activation, at the beginning of early P20 sensory cortical activation and late N100 auditory perception. The effect found in this study shall encourage further investigation on the oxygen treatment in human brain.	[Yu, Qiu Hong; Yang, Jie; He, Kim Yuan; Chen, Andrew C.

With regard to the first point, the present results are disappointing, since some abnormalities found in TTH patients may be frequently observed also in migraineurs. On the other hand, clinical neurophysiology has played an important role in the debate about the pathogenesis of TTH. Studies on the exteroceptive suppression of the temporalis muscle contraction have detected a dysfunction of the brainstem excitability and of its suprasegmental control. A similar conclusion has been reached by using the trigeminocervical reflexes, whose abnormalities in TTH have suggested a reduced inhibitory activity of brainstem interneurons, reflecting abnormal endogenous pain control mechanisms. It is interesting that the neural excitability abnormality in TTH seems to be a generalized phenomenon, not limited to the cranial districts. Defective DNIC-like mechanisms have indeed been evidenced also in somatic districts by nociceptive flexion reflex studies.

This is particularly challenging for clinicians who must decide whether a certain behavior, which might be inconsistent or incomplete, reflects a conscious or an unconscious process. These assessments are not only highly subjective, but also dependent upon the ability of the patient to produce an appropriate motor response. Recent developments in neuroimaging techniques can provide a measure of the levels of awareness that these patients may retain, and importantly, they overcome the necessity for these patients to produce detectable movements by instead relying on their adopting appropriate 'mindsets' as instructed by the task. In this article, we review recent advances in this field and discuss how they may accompany behavioral assessments in future in order to provide diagnostic and prognostic information.

We used EEG and simultaneous frequency tagging of auditory and visual sources to study intermodal focused and divided attention in detection and discrimination performance. Divided-attention costs were smaller, but still significant, in detection than in discrimination. The auditory steady-state response (SSR) showed no effects of attention at frontocentral locations, but did so at occipital locations where it was evident only when attention was divided between audition and vision. Similarly, the visual SSR at occipital locations was substantially enhanced when attention was divided across modalities. Both effects were equally present in detection and discrimination. We suggest that both effects reflect a common cause: An attention-dependent influence of auditory information processing on early cortical stages of visual information processing, mediated by enhanced effective connectivity between the two modalities under conditions of divided attention.

This is why stimuli with emotional value are more efficient in Capturing attention than neutral stimuli, and why the processing of unexpected novel stimuli is enhanced under a negative emotional context. Here we measured the phase-synchronization (PS) of gamma-band responses (GBR) from human EEG scalp-recordings during performance of a visual discrimination task in which task-irrelevant standard and novel Sounds were presented in either a neutral or a negative emotional context, in order to elucidate the brain mechanisms by which emotion tunes the processing of novel events. Visual task performance was distracted by novel sounds, and this distraction was enhanced by the negative emotional context. Similarly, gamma PS was enhanced after novel as compared to standard Sounds and it was also larger to auditory stimuli in the negative than in the neutral emotional context, reflecting the synchronization of neural networks for increasing of attentional processing. Remarkably, the larger PS increase of GBR after novel sounds in the negative as compared to the neutral emotional context over midline and right frontal regions reveals that a negative emotional context tunes novelty processing by means of the PS of brain activity in the gamma frequency band around 40 Hz in specific neural networks.

Each visual-cue consisted of either a sentence or hand gesture instructing the subject to press or not to press the button. Regardless of the recorded hemisphere, viewing sentence and gesture cues elicited gamma-augmentation sequentially in the lateral-polar occipital and inferior occipital-temporal areas; subsequently, button-press movement elicited gamma-augmentation in the Rolandic area. The magnitudes of gamma-augmentation in the Rolandic and inferior occipital-temporal areas were larger when the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere was used for motor responses. A double dissociation was found in the left inferior occipital-temporal cortex in one subject; the lateral portion had greater gamma-augmentation elicited by a sentence-cue, whereas the medial portion had greater gamma-augmentation elicited by a gesture-cue. The present study has increased our understanding of the physiology of the human visuomotor system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to obtain experimental confirmation and extension of findings, cortical processing of experimentally-induced pain was used. Method: A sample of 78 individuals with chronic low back pain complaints and 37 healthy controls underwent EEG registration. Event-Related Potentials were measured in response to electrical nociceptive stimuli and moderation by COMT Val(158)Met, BDNF Val(66)Met and OPRM1 A(118)G polymorphisms was assessed. Results: Genetic variation did not have a direct effect on cortical processing of experimental pain. However, genetic effects (COMT Val(158)Met and BDNF Val(66)Met) on experimental pain were moderated by the presence of chronic pain. In the presence of chronic pain, the COMT Met allele and the BDNF Met allele augmented cortical pain processing, whilst reducing pain processing in pain-free controls. No significant effects were found concerning the OPRM1 A(118)G polymorphism. Conclusions: The current study suggests that chronic experience of pain enhances genetic sensitivity to experimentally induced mildly painful stimuli, possibly through a process of epigenetic modification.

Using Brain Imaging Measures in Studies of Procognitive Pharmacologic Agents in Schizophrenia: Psychometric and Quality Assurance Considerations	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Biomarkers; clinical trials; cognition; imaging; schizophrenia; treatment	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY PARADIGM; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; REPRODUCIBILITY; ACTIVATION; VARIABILITY; COGNITION	The first phase of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICs) initiative focused on the identification of cognitive constructs from human and animal neuroscience that were relevant to understanding cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, as well as promising task paradigms that could be used to assess these constructs behaviorally. The current phase of CNTRICs has the goal of expanding this initial work by including measures of brain function that can augment these behavioral tasks as biomarkers to be used in drug development processing. Here we review many of the psychometric issues that need to be addressed regarding the development and inclusion of such methods in the drug development process. In addition, we review quality assurance concerns, issues associated with multicenter trials, concerns associated with potential pharmacologic confounds on imaging measures, as well as power and analysis considerations. Although review is couched in the context of the use of biomarkers for treatment studies in schizophrenia, we believe the issues and suggestions included are relevant to the entire range of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as to a wide range of imaging modalities (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, event-related potentials, electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, near infrared spectroscopy, etc.) and are relevant to both pharmacologic and psychological intervention approaches.

Methods: We investigated PINV as an indicator of performance uncertainty in an audio-visual contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with an interstimulus interval of 3 seconds. A constant, unilateral, quick motor reaction with either the right or the left thumb was required after an auditory forewarned (S1) visual imperative stimulus (S2). We examined 18 ADHD patients (combined or hyperactive-impulsive subtype) aged between 8 and 14 years and an age-, sex and IQ-matched control group of 19 healthy subjects using 64-channel high-density EEG. A first run was recorded drug-free, a second one under methylphenidate (MPH) medication in the ADHD group. Results: We found a significantly increased negativity of the PINV-component over the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in ADHD children compared to the healthy control group. PINV amplitude was influenced by movement side, most likely due to the slightly more difficult task when left hand responses were required. After the intake of MPH, PINV amplitudes of ADHD children normalized. Conclusions: We conclude that children with ADHD are likely to be more uncertain about the correctness of their performance and interpret the increased PINV as a hint towards compensatory mechanisms for a deficit in the evaluation of contingencies. Further studies are needed to assess the exact extent to which remainders of eye-movement related potentials contribute to PINV amplitude despite the correction for eye-artifacts.

J	Jacques, C; Rossion, B				Jacques, Corentin; Rossion, Bruno			Misaligning face halves increases and delays the N170 specifically for upright faces: Implications for the nature of early face representations	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Face perception; Holistic processing; Event-related potential; N170; EEG; composite face	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INVERTED FACES; SENSITIVE N170; HUMAN BRAIN; INVERSION; OBJECT; PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; CORTEX; POTENTIALS	The N170 is an occipito-temporal visual event-related potential that is larger in response to faces than other nonface object categories and has been associated with the early activation of visual face representations in the human brain. It has been recently showed that spatially misaligning the bottom and top halves of a face stimulus-a manipulation used in behavioural studies to disrupt the processing of the whole face configuration (i.e. holistic processing)increases the latency and the amplitude of the N170, particularly in the right hemisphere. Here we show that these observations cannot be accounted for by a general effect of spatial misalignment of visual patterns. A first experiment showed that the effect of misalignment on the N170 was larger when both top and bottom halves of the stimulus were made of face parts (i.e. a full face) compared to when one of the two halves was made of visual noise. The N170 delay and increase for misaligned faces is similar to the effect of upside-down face inversion, a manipulation thought to disrupt holistic processing. Supporting this view, in a second experiment in which we presented upside-down versions of the stimuli used in the first experiment, we did not observe such a larger effect of misalignment on the N170 for a full face compared to the control conditions. These observations support the view that the early face representation activated in the human brain at the level of the N170, is that of a global upright face pattern. Specifically, when the global configuration of a face is modified by inverting it or spatially misaligning its top and bottom halves, the activation of its representation is delayed in cortical areas coding preferentially for faces. Moreover, when the global face configuration is disrupted, the face stimulus appears to recruit additional neural processes compared to normal face processing, leading to an increase of the N170 amplitude on the scalp.

Methods: EEG data were recorded from 17 male schizophrenia patients in a stable phase of illness and 17 healthy controls. Results: As compared with controls, patients displayed smaller N200 amplitudes and less evoked theta for correct hit trials; and smaller N200 and P300 amplitudes and less evoked delta and theta for correct reject trials. Effect sizes were largest for evoked delta. Source localisation revealed reduced activation in schizophrenia patients during the N200 and P300 time windows in anterior and posterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus and precuneus. Evoked delta and theta oscillations were significantly correlated with the variability of reaction times and the performance level statistic d-prime. Conclusions: The results demonstrate impairment of frontal and parietal brain areas involved in response control in schizophrenia. They also suggest that the timing of oscillations in patients is less precise leading to smaller evoked amplitudes and more variable reaction times. Significance: These findings add to the evidence that abnormal EEG oscillations contribute to impaired behavioural control in schizophrenia.

Reflection of the Emotional Significance of Visual Stimuli in the Characteristics of Evoked EEG Potentials	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						evoked potentials; amplitude; latency; emotiogenic stimuli; emotional valency; images of IAPS	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; PICTURES	Healthy subjects (n = 88) were asked to passively visualize positive and passive emotiogenic visual stimuli and also stimuli with a neutral emotional content. Images of the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were used. Amplitude/time characteristics of the components of evoked EEG potentials (EPs), P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 and topographic distribution of the latter components were analyzed. The latencies, amplitudes, and topography of the EP waves induced by presentation of positive and negative stimuli were found to be different from the respective values for the EPs induced by neutral stimuli. The level and pattern of these differences typical of different EP components were dissimilar and depended on the sign of the emotions. Specificities related to the valency of an identified stimulus were observed within nearly all stages of processing of visual signals, for the negative stimuli, beginning from an early stage of sensory analysis corresponding to the development of wave D 1. The latencies of components D 1 in the case of presentation of emotiogenic negative stimuli and those of components N1, N2, and D 3 in the case of presentation of the stimuli of both valencies were shorter than the latencies observed at neutral stimuli. The amplitude of component N2 at perception of positive stimuli was, on average, lower, while the D 3 amplitude at perception of all emotiogenic stimuli was higher than in the case of presentation of neutral stimuli. The time dynamics of topographic peculiarities of processing of emotiogenic information were complicated. Activation of the left hemisphere was observed during the earliest stages of perception, while the right hemisphere was activated within the intermediate stages. Generalized activation of the cortex after the action of negative signals and dominance of the left hemisphere under conditions of presentation of positive stimuli were observed only within the final stages. As is supposed, emotiogenic stimuli possess a greater biological significance than neutral ones, and this is why the former attract visual attention first; they more intensely activate the respective cortical zones, and the corresponding visual information is processed more rapidly. The observed effects were more clearly expressed in the case of action of negative stimuli; these effects involved more extensive cortical zones. These facts are indicative of the higher intensity of activating influences of negative emotiogenic stimuli on neutral systems of the higher CNS structures.	[Kovalenko, A. A.; Pavlenko, V.

Classical behavioral studies have shown that risk-attitude changes across different contexts, but little is so far known about the brain correlates of processing of outcomes across such context shifts. In this study, EEG was recorded while subjects performed a gambling task. Participants could choose between a risky and a safer option, within two different contexts: one in which options yielded gains and losses of the same magnitude (Zero Expected Value context) and another in which gains were larger than losses (Positive Expected Value context). Based on their risk-attitude, two groups were compared: subjects who are risk-seekers in the zero Expected Value context (Zero-Oriented group) and subjects who are risk-seekers in the positive Expected Value condition (Positive-Oriented group). The Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) reflects this distinction, with each group being insensitive to magnitude Of Outcomes in the condition in which they were risk-prone. P300 amplitude mirrored the behavioral results, with larger amplitudes in the condition in which each group showed a higher risk-tendency. Source analyses highlighted the involvement of posterior cingulate cortex in risky decision-making. Taken together, the findings make a contribution to the clarification of the neurocognitive substrates of risky decision-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we manipulated the orientations of Gabor elements surrounding an embedded shape outline. The amplitudes of early visual components over posterior scalp regions were changed by the presence of a contour, and by the orientation of elements surrounding the contour. Differences in context type had an effect on the early P1 and N1 components, but not on the later P2 component. The presence of a contour had an effect on the N1 and P2 components, but not on the earlier P1 component. A modulatory effect of context on contour integration was observed on the N1 component. These results highlight the importance of the context in which contour integration takes place.

It is also a time of dramatic structural and functional neurodevelopment. In recent years studies have examined the precise nature of these brain and behavioral changes, and several hypotheses link them together. In this review we discuss this research and recent electrophysiological data from behaving rats that demonstrate reduced neuronal coordination and processing efficiency in adolescents. A more comprehensive understanding of these processes will further our knowledge of adolescent behavioral vulnerabilities and the pathophysiology of mental illnesses that manifest during this period.

It is based on an extension of the state-space model for a multivariate time series to a matrix-state-space model for multi-trial multivariate time series. The result is a general linear Kalman filter (GLKF). The GLKF enables a tvMVAR model estimation which was applied for interaction analysis of simulated data and high-dimensional multi-trial laser-evoked brain potentials (LEP). The tv partial Granger causality index (tvpGCI) Was used to investigate the interaction patterns between LEPs derived from an experiment with noxious laser stimulation. First, the new approach was compared with the multi-trial version of the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with forgetting factor (Moller et al., 2001) by using 24 distinct electrodes. The RLS failed for a channel number (dimension) higher than 24. Secondly, the analysis was repeated by using all 58 electrodes and the similarities and differences of the GCI-based interaction patterns are discussed. It can be demonstrated that the application of high-dimensional tvMVAR modelling will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A hybrid car normally has two engines to enhance energy efficiency and reduce CO2 output. Similarly, a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) is composed of two BCIs, or at least one BCI and another system. A hybrid BCI, like any BCI, must fulfill the following four criteria: (i) the device must rely on signals recorded directly from the brain; (ii) there must be at least one recordable brain signal that the user can intentionally modulate to effect goal-directed behaviour; (iii) real time processing; and (iv) the user must obtain feedback. This paper introduces hybrid BCIs that have already been published or are in development. We also introduce concepts for future work. We describe BCIs that classify two EEG patterns: one is the event-related (de) synchronisation (ERD, ERS) of sensorimotor rhythms, and the other is the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Hybrid BCIs can either process their inputs simultaneously, or operate two systems sequentially, where the first system can act as a "brain switch". For example, we describe a hybrid BCI that simultaneously combines ERD and SSVEP BCIs. We also describe a sequential hybrid BCI, in which subjects could use a brain switch to control an SSVEP-based hand orthosis. Subjects who used this hybrid BCI exhibited about half the false positives encountered while using the SSVEP BCI alone. A brain switch can also rely on hemodynamic changes measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Hybrid BCIs can also use one brain signal and a different type of input. This additional input can be an electrophysiological signal such as the heart rate, or a signal from an external device such as an eye tracking system.

Transient changes in frontal alpha asymmetry as a measure of emotional and physical distress during sleep	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Frontal alpha asymmetry; Distress; Emotion; Aversive stimulation; Conditioning; Sleep; Non-communicative states	AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSE; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; AFFECTIVE STYLE; HEART-RATE; REM-SLEEP; AWARENESS	The aim of this project was to identify measurable physiological responses linked to the human experience of distress in a non-communicative state. Since sleep is a state of sensory-motor detachment in which subjects cannot report how they feel or what they experience, it can be considered a suitable model of non communicative states. A transitory distress-related response has consistently been reported in healthy awake subjects in the form of power spectrum alpha band changes in frontal brain areas. Hence, changes in frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) were analysed in 16 volunteers before and after administration of distressful aversive stimuli during sleep. Transient physical or emotional distress was achieved by presentation of conditioned (to electroshocks or affective images) or directly-applied aversive stimuli (electroshocks). Frontal beta asymmetry (FBA) was also evaluated for comparisons. Power spectrum data were assessed from frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) leads (F3/F4). Galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR) were also simultaneously monitored. To test the possibility that the short lasting stimulations would have long-term physiological effects, we included saliva cortisol sampling, evaluation of dream emotional valence and a standard assessment of sleep quality measurements. Aversive stimulation of diverse nature, compared to neutral valence stimuli, produced measurable changes in FAA (left>right) and in GSR evoked responses in both stage 2 (S2) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suggesting implicit processing of experiences with negative valence. Noticeably, dream content evaluation showed a trend towards increased negative emotionality. No FBA was observed, confirming the specificity of FAA responses. Saliva cortisol, and sleep parameters were not significantly affected by the protocol. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an aversive imaging conditioning protocol has been successfully applied during sleep. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Regel, SJ; Achermann, P				Regel, Sabine J.; Achermann, Peter			Cognitive Performance Measures in Bioelectromagnetic Research - Critical Evaluation and Recommendations	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Review							MOBILE PHONE EXPOSURE; RADIOFREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; AFFECTS HUMAN SLEEP; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CELLULAR PHONES; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; EEG	Background: The steady increase of mobile phone usage has led to a rising concern about possible adverse health effects of radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF) exposure at intensities even below the existing safety limits. Accumulating evidence suggests that pulse-modulated RF EMF may alter brain physiology. Yet, whereas effects on the human electroencephalogram in waking and sleep have repeatedly been shown in recent years, results on cognitive performance are inconsistent. Methods: This review compares 41 provocation studies regarding the effects of RF EMF exposure similar to mobile telephones on cognitive performance measures in humans. The studies were identified via systematic searches of the databases Pub Med and ISI Web of Science and were published in peer-reviewed journals between 1998 and the end of 2009. Results: Based on a critical discussion within the scope of methodological standards it is concluded that state-of-the-art-methods in bio-electromagnetic research on RF EMF effects and cognition have neither been specified nor fully implemented over the last 10-11 years. The lack of a validated tool, which reliably assesses changes in cognitive performance caused by RF EMF exposure, may contribute to the current inconsistencies in outcomes. The high variety of findings may also be due to methodological issues such as differences in sample size and the composition of study groups, experimental design, exposure setup as well as the exposure conditions, and emphasizes the need for a standardized protocol in bioelectromagnetic research. Conclusions: At present, no underlying biological mechanism has been identified which mediates the effects on brain functioning as observed in electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. A future aim must be to identify this mechanism as well as a reliable exposure protocol in order to gain more insights into possible behavioral and related health consequences of high-frequency EMF exposure.

An electrophysiological study of task demands on concreteness effects: evidence for dual coding theory	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Imagery; N400; Semantic processing; Time-frequency analysis; Theta band; Alpha band; Delta band	THETA-POWER INCREASES; CONTEXT-AVAILABILITY; EEG; RETRIEVAL; WORDS; ATTENTION; KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN	We examined ERP responses during the generation of word associates or mental images in response to concrete and abstract concepts. Of interest were the predictions of dual coding theory (DCT), which proposes that processing lexical concepts depends on functionally independent but interconnected verbal and nonverbal systems. ERP responses were time-locked to either stimulus onset or response to compensate for potential latency differences across conditions. During word associate generation, but not mental imagery, concrete items elicited a greater N400 than abstract items. A concreteness effect emerged at a later time point during the mental imagery task. Data were also analyzed using time-frequency analysis that investigated synchronization of neuronal populations over time during processing. Concrete words elicited an enhanced late going desynchronization of theta-band power (723-938 ms post stimulus onset) during associate generation. During mental imagery, abstract items elicited greater delta-band power from 800 to 1,000 ms following stimulus onset, theta-band power from 350 to 205 ms before response, and alpha-band power from 900 to 800 ms before response. Overall, the findings support DCT in suggesting that lexical concepts are not amodal and that concreteness effects are modulated by tasks that focus participants on verbal versus nonverbal, imagery-based knowledge.

Saturation thresholds of evoked neural and hemodynamic responses in awake and asleep rats	DYNAMICS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN BIOMEDICAL PHOTONICS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on the Dynamics and Fluctuations in Biomedical Photonics VIII	JAN 22-24, 2011	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		auditory cortex; evoked response potential (ERP); neurovascular coupling; NIRS; quiet sleep	BARREL CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SLEEP	Neural activation generates a hemodynamic response to the localized region replenishing nutrients to the area. Changes in vigilance state have been shown to alter the vascular response where the vascular response is muted during wake compared to quiet sleep. We tested the saturation thresholds of the neurovascular response in the auditory cortex during wake and sleep by chronically implanting rats with an EEG electrode, a light emitting diode (LED, 600 nm), and photodiode to simultaneously measure evoked response potentials (ERPs) and evoked hemodynamic responses. We stimulated the cortex with a single speaker click delivered at random intervals 2-13 s at varied stimulus intensities ranging from 45-80 dB. To further test the potential for activity related saturation, we sleep deprived animals for 2, 4, or 6 hours and recorded evoked responses during the first hour recovery period. With increasing stimulus intensity, integrated ERPs and evoked hemodynamic responses increased; however the hemodynamic response approached saturation limits at a lower stimulus intensity than the ERP. With longer periods of sleep deprivation, the integrated ERPs did not change but evoked hemodynamic responses decreased. There may be physical limits in cortical blood delivery and vascular compliance, and with extended periods of neural activity during wake, vessels may approach these limits.

J	Andrew, C; Fein, G				Andrew, Colin; Fein, George			Induced theta oscillations as biomarkers for alcoholism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Event-related oscillations; Event-related synchronization; Induced oscillations; Alcoholism; Biomarker	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY LOAD; BAND POWER; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DEPENDENCE; RISK; TASK	Objective: Studies have suggested that non-phase-locked event-related oscillations (ERO) in target stimulus processing might provide biomarkers of alcoholism. This study investigates the discriminatory power of non-phase-locked oscillations in a group of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAAs) and nonalcoholic controls (NACs). Methods: EEGs were recorded from 48 LTAAs and 48 age and gender comparable NACs during rest with eyes open (EO) and during the performance of a three-condition visual target detection task. The data were analyzed to extract resting power, ERP amplitude and non-phase-locked ERO power measures. Data were analyzed using MANCOVA to determine the discriminatory power of induced theta ERO vs. resting theta power vs. P300 ERP measures in differentiating the LTAA and NAC groups. Results: Both groups showed significantly more theta power in the pre-stimulus reference period of the task vs. the resting EO condition. The resting theta power did not discriminate the groups, while the LTAAs showed significantly less pre-stimulus theta power vs. the NACs. The LTAAs showed a significantly larger theta event-related synchronization (ERS) to the target stimulus vs. the NACs, even after accounting for pre-stimulus theta power levels. ERS to non-target stimuli showed smaller induced oscillations vs. target stimuli with no group differences. Alcohol use variables, a family history of alcohol problems, and the duration of alcohol abstinence were not associated with any theta power measures. Conclusions: While reference theta power in the task and induced theta oscillations to target stimuli both discriminate LTAAs and NACs, induced theta oscillations better discriminate the groups. Induced theta power measures are also more powerful and independent group discriminators than the P3b amplitude. Significance: Induced frontal theta oscillations promise to provide biomarkers of alcoholism that complement the well-established P300 ERP discriminators.

A compact electroencephalogram recording device with integrated audio stimulation system	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EEG; STANDARDS	A compact (96 x 128 x 32 mm(3), 374 g), battery-powered, eight-channel electroencephalogram recording device with an integrated audio stimulation system and a wireless interface is presented. The recording device is capable of producing high-quality data, while the operating time is also reasonable for evoked potential studies. The effective measurement resolution is about 4 nV at 200 Hz sample rate, typical noise level is below 0.7 mu V-rms at 0.16-70 Hz, and the estimated operating time is 1.5 h. An embedded audio decoder circuit reads and plays wave sound files stored on a memory card. The activities are controlled by an 8 bit main control unit which allows accurate timing of the stimuli. The interstimulus interval jitter measured is less than 1 ms. Wireless communication is made through bluetooth and the data recorded are transmitted to an external personal computer (PC) interface in real time. The PC interface is implemented with LABVIEW (R) and in addition to data acquisition it also allows online signal processing, data storage, and control of measurement activities such as contact impedance measurement, for example. The practical application of the device is demonstrated in mismatch negativity experiment with three test subjects. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

In the present study, we continuously measured electrocortical dynamics in human visual cortex, as evoked by happy, neutral, fearful, and angry faces. Thirty-seven participants endorsing high versus low generalized social anxiety (upper and lower tertiles of 2104 screened undergraduates) viewed naturalistic faces flickering at 17.5 Hz to evoke steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), recorded from 129 scalp electrodes. Electrophysiological data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain after linear source space projection using the minimum norm method. Source estimation indicated an early visual cortical origin of the face-evoked ssVEP, which showed sustained amplitude enhancement for emotional expressions specifically in individuals with pervasive social anxiety. Participants in the low symptom group showed no such sensitivity, and a correlational analysis across the entire sample revealed a strong relationship between self-reported interpersonal anxiety/avoidance and enhanced visual cortical response amplitude for emotional, versus neutral expressions. This pattern was maintained across the 3500 ms viewing epoch, suggesting that temporally sustained, heightened perceptual bias towards affective facial cues is associated with generalized social anxiety.

However, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the exact contribution of each region. The present study benefited from intracerebral EEG recordings in epileptic patients to record directly the neural activity in each of those frontal structures in response to positive and negative feedback. Both types of feedback induced a sequence of high-frequency responses (>40 Hz) in a widespread network involving medial frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and insular cortex. The pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), DLPFC, and lateral OFC showed higher activation in response to negative feedback, while medial OFC and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were more responsive to positive feedback. Responses in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA and dACC) were sustained (lasting more than 1,000 ms), while responses in the DLPFC, insula, and the OFC were short lasting (less than 800 ms). Taken together, our findings show that evaluating the outcome of our actions triggers gamma-range activity modulations in several frontal and insular regions. Moreover, we found that the timing and amplitude of those gamma-band responses reveal fine-scale dissociations between the neural dynamics of positive versus negative feedback processing.

Effects of 2G and 3G mobile phones on performance and electrophysiology in adolescents, young adults and older adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						GSM900; W-CDMA; Acute exposure; EEG Sensory processing; Cognitive processing; Adolescents; Elderly	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CELLULAR PHONES; MEMORY TASK; WORKING-MEMORY; RF EXPOSURE; BRAIN; EEG	Objective: This study examined sensory and cognitive processing in adolescents, young adults and older adults, when exposed to 2nd (2G) and 3rd (3G) generation mobile phone signals. Methods: Tests employed were the auditory 3-stimulus oddball and the N-back. Forty-one 13-15 year olds, forty-two 19-40 year olds and twenty 55-70 year olds were tested using a double-blind cross-over design, where each participant received Sham, 2G and 3G exposures, separated by at least 4 days. Results: 3-Stimulus oddball task: Behavioural: accuracy and reaction time of responses to targets were not affected by exposure. Electrophysiological: augmented N1 was found in the 2G condition (independent of age group). N-back task: Behavioural: the combined groups performed less accurately during the 3G exposure (compared to Sham), with post hoc tests finding this effect separately in the adolescents only. Electrophysiological: delayed ERD/ERS responses of the alpha power were found in both 3G and 2G conditions (compared to Sham; independent of age group). Conclusion: Employing tasks tailored to each individual's ability level, this study provides support for an effect of acute 2G and 3G exposure on human cognitive function. Significance: The subtlety of mobile phone effect on cognition in our study suggests that it is important to account for individual differences in future mobile phone research.

Reduced sensory oscillatory activity during rapid auditory processing as a correlate of language-learning impairment	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Specific language impairment; Dyslexia; Auditory rate processing; Electroencephalography; Gamma-band activity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; ALTERED HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; VISUAL-CORTEX; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; DYSLEXIA	Successful language acquisition has been hypothesized to involve the ability to integrate rapidly presented, brief acoustic cues in sensory cortex. A body of work has suggested that this ability is compromised in language-learning impairment (LLI). The present research aimed to examine sensory integration during rapid auditory processing by means of electrophysiological measures of oscillatory brain activity using data from a larger longitudinal study. Twenty-nine children with LLI and control participants with typical language development (n = 18) listened to tone doublets presented at a temporal interval that is essential for accurate speech processing (70-ms interstimulus interval). The children performed a deviant (pitch change of second tone) detection task, or listened passively. The electroencephalogram was recorded from 64 electrodes. Data were source-projected to the auditory cortices and submitted to wavelet analysis, resulting in time-frequency representations of electrocortical activity. Results show significantly reduced amplitude and phase-locking of early (45-75 ms) oscillations in the gamma-band range (29-52 Hz), specifically in the LLI group, for the second stimulus of the tone doublet. This suggests altered temporal organization of sensory oscillatory activity in LLI when processing rapid sequences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several different methods have been used, such as electromyography, recruitment analysis, H-reflex, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography and event-related potentials. The positive effect of caffeine on vigilance, attention, speed of reaction, information processing and arousal is supported by a number of electrophysiological studies. The evidence in favor of an increased muscle fiber resistance is not definitive, but higher or lower motor neuron excitability can occur as a consequence of a greater excitation of the descending input from the brainstem and upper motor neurons. TMS can address the influence of caffeine on the upper motor neuron. Previous studies showed that cortico-motor threshold and intracortical excitatory and inhibitory pathways are not influenced by caffeine. Nonetheless, our results indicate that cortical silent period (CSP) is reduced in resting muscles after caffeine consumption, when stimulating the motor cortex with intensities slightly above threshold. We present new data demonstrating that this effect is also observed in fatigued muscle. We conclude that CSP can be considered a surrogate marker of the effect of caffeine in the brain, in particular of its central ergogenic effect.

We measured the P50 auditory evoked response potential in two groups of subjects who immersed their foot in either cold (0-2 degrees C) or room temperature (22-24 degrees C) water for 50 seconds. The P50, which was recorded before and after stimulation, is sleep-state dependent and sensitive to states of arousal in clinical populations. We found a significant reduction in P50 amplitude after exposure to cold, but not room temperature water. In comparison with other studies, these results indicate that cold pressor stimulation in normal subjects may evoke a regulatory process that modulates the P50 amplitude, perhaps to preserve the integrity of sensory perception, even as autonomic and subjective aspects of arousal increase.

Memory problems in ADHD are thought to be related to deficits in memory organisation, but could also be associated with a reduced availability of dopamine at the time of encoding. We investigated with different methods (fMRI, EEG) how encoding processes and their neurobiological correlates are affected in children and adolescents with ADHD. Our results show that encoding-related activity is particularly altered in ADHD when stimuli of low salience are used. Emotional stimuli, on the other hand, can actually normalise electrophysiological and haemodynamic correlates of encoding. Overall, our findings suggest that memory problems in ADHD are caused by an interaction of executive and basal encoding mechanisms.

Telling one face from another: Electrocortical correlates of facial characteristics among individual female faces	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Electroencephalography; ERPs; Face perception; Facial characteristics; N170	SINGLE NEURONS; BRAIN; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; N170; ERP; RECOGNITION; INVERSION; COMPONENT	Research investigating the neural correlates of face processing has emphasized differences in neural activity when participants view faces versus other stimulus categories (e.g., houses). Much less is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the discrimination among individual faces. Using a large number of female faces, here we show that the amplitude of the face-sensitive N170 electrocortical component is related to a range of facial characteristics. The right N170 amplitude was related to eye color and face width. The left N170 amplitude was related to eye shape and face proportions, suggesting a functional dissociation between hemispheres. In contrast, the amplitude of the P100 and N250 components was largely unaffected by these facial characteristics. Consistent with recent findings in non-human primates, we identify for the first time evidence of human electrocortical brain potentials that are sensitive to variations in specific facial characteristics, a prerequisite for recognizing the identity of individual faces.

A novel P300-based brain-computer interface stimulus presentation paradigm: Moving beyond rows and columns	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; EEG; P300; Event-related potential; Rehabilitation	P300 SPELLING SYSTEM; BCI SYSTEM; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; PROBABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INTERVAL; ERPS	Objective: An electroencephalographic brain-computer interface (BCI) can provide a non-muscular means of communication for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other neuromuscular disorders. We present a novel P300-based BCI stimulus presentation - the checkerboard paradigm (CBP). CBP performance is compared to that of the standard row/column paradigm (RCP) introduced by Farwell and Donchin (1988). Methods: Using an 8 x 9 matrix of alphanumeric characters and keyboard commands, 18 participants used the CBP and RCP in counter-balanced fashion. With approximately 9-12 min of calibration data, we used a stepwise linear discriminant analysis for online classification of subsequent data. Results: Mean online accuracy was significantly higher for the CBP, 92%, than for the RCP, 77%. Correcting for extra selections due to errors, mean bit rate was also significantly higher for the CBP, 23 bits/min, than for the RCP, 17 bits/min. Moreover, the two paradigms produced significantly different waveforms. Initial tests with three advanced ALS participants produced similar results. Furthermore, these individuals preferred the CBP to the RCP. Conclusions: These results suggest that the CBP is markedly superior to the RCP in performance and user acceptability. Significance: The CBP has the potential to provide a substantially more effective BCI than the RCP. This is especially important for people with severe neuromuscular disabilities.

Transient and steady-state responses to mechanical stimulation of different fingers reveal interactions based on lateral inhibition	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Perception; Sensory interaction; Somatosensory evoked potentials; EEG; Lateral inhibition; Convergence	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; TACTILE STIMULATION; NERVE-STIMULATION; CORTEX; FLUTTER; VIBRATION; AREAS; REPRESENTATIONS; GENERATION	Objective: Simultaneous tactile finger stimulation evokes transient ERP responses that are smaller than the linear summation of ERP responses to individual stimulation. Occlusion and lateral inhibition are two possible mechanisms responsible for this effect. The present study disentangles these two effects using steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP). Simultaneous stimulation on adjacent and distant finger pairs with the same and different stimulation frequencies are compared. Methods: The index finger (IF), middle finger (MF) and little finger (LF) were mechanically stimulated with a frequency of 18, 22 or 26 Hz, respectively. Stimulation was applied for each finger separately, and for the IF (18 Hz) in combination with either the MF or LF for 22 and 26 Hz, respectively. A measure for interaction (IR) was calculated for the P60 component and the SSSEP amplitude. Results: Significant interactions were found in both the P60 response and in the SSSEP response. Stimulation of adjacent finger combinations caused more interaction than distant finger combinations. No difference was found between stimulation of two fingers with the same or a different frequency. Conclusions: Our results indicate that lateral inhibition is mainly responsible for the interaction effect. Significance: These observations provide further insight in the mechanisms behind interaction between somatosensory inputs. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Markers of preparatory attention predict visual short-term memory performance	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Visual short term memory; Attention; Precision; EDAN; ADAN; CDA	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ERP COMPONENTS; SHIFTS; VOLUNTARY; STORAGE	Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is limited in capacity. Therefore, it is important to encode only visual information that is most likely to be relevant to behaviour. Here we asked which aspects of selective biasing of VSTM encoding predict subsequent memory-based performance. We measured EEG during a selective VSTM encoding task, in which we varied parametrically the memory load and the precision of recall required to compare a remembered item to a subsequent probe item. On half the trials, a spatial cue indicated that participants only needed to encode items from one hemifield. We observed a typical sequence of markers of anticipatory spatial attention: early attention directing negativity (EDAN), anterior attention directing negativity (ADAN), late directing attention positivity (LDAP); as well as of VSTM maintenance: contralateral delay activity (CDA). We found that individual differences in preparatory brain activity (EDAN/ADAN) predicted cue-related changes in recall accuracy, indexed by memory-probe discrimination sensitivity (d'). Importantly, our parametric manipulation of memory-probe similarity also allowed us to model the behavioural data for each participant, providing estimates for the quality of the memory representation and the probability that an item could be retrieved. We found that selective encoding primarily increased the probability of accurate memory recall; that ERP markers of preparatory attention predicted the cue-related changes in recall probability.

It is still unclear how various cues interact to achieve this unified percept and whether this interaction depends on task demands. Studies investigating the effect of cue combination on the human EEG are still lacking. in the present study, we combined psychophysics, ERP and time-frequency analysis to investigate the interaction of orientation and spatial frequency as visual cues in a figure detection task. The figure was embedded in a matrix of Gabor elements, and we systematically varied figure saliency by changing the underlying cue configuration. We found a strong correlation between the posterior P2 amplitude and the perceived saliency of the figure: the P2 amplitude decreased with increasing saliency. Analogously, the power of the theta-band decreased for more salient figures. At longer latencies, the posterior P3 component was modulated in amplitude and latency, possibly reflecting increased decision confidence at higher saliencies. in conclusion, when the cue composition (e.g. one or two cues) or cue strength is changed in a figure detection task, first differences in the electrophysiological response reflect the perceived saliency and not directly the underlying cue configuration.

Building on a study by Augustin, Leder, Hutzler, and Carbon (2008) the current ERP study examined the neural time course of two central aspects of representational art, one of which is closely related to object- and scene perception, the other of which is art-specific: content and style. We adapted a paradigm that has repeatedly been employed in psycholinguistics and that allows one to examine the neural time course of two processes in terms of when sufficient information is available to allow successful classification. Twenty-two participants viewed pictures that systematically varied in style and content and conducted a combined go/nogo dual choice task. The dependent variables of interest were the Lateralised Readiness Potential (LRP) and the N200 effect. Analyses of both measures support the notion that in the processing of art style follows content, with style-related information being available at around 224 ms or between 40 and 94 ms later than content-related information. The paradigm used here offers a promising approach to further explore the time course of art perception, thus helping to unravel the perceptual and cognitive processes that underlie the phenomenon of art and the fascination it exerts.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is commonly used to study these changes because it possesses high temporal resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio. However, it provides limited spatial information. Non-invasive fast optical signals (FOS) have been proposed as a neuroimaging tool combining spatial and temporal resolution. Yet, this technique has not been applied to study high frequency brain oscillations because of its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we investigate the sensitivity of FOS to relatively high-frequency brain oscillations. We measured the steady-state optical response elicited in medial and lateral occipital cortex by checkerboard reversals occurring at 4, 6, and 8 Hz in younger and older adults. Stimulus-dependent oscillations were observed at the predicted stimulation frequency. In addition, in the younger adults the FOS steady-state response was smaller in lateral than medial areas, whereas in the older adults it was reversed in these two cortical regions. This may reflect diminished top-down inhibitory control in the older adults. The results indicate that FOS can be used to study the modulation of relatively high-frequency brain oscillations in adjacent cortical regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address this issue, we recorded the mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked by violin and pure sine-wave tones in a group of 7.5-to 12-year-old children who had either several years of musical experience with Suzuki violin lessons, or no musical training. The strength of the MMN responses to violin tones evident in the Suzuki students clearly surpassed responses in controls; the reverse pattern was observed for sine-wave tones. Suzuki students showed significantly shorter MMN latencies to violin tones than to pure tones; the MMN latency did not differ significantly between pure tones and violin sounds in the control group. Thus, our data provide general evidence of how and to what extent extensive musical experience affects the maturation of human auditory function at multiple levels, namely, accuracy and speed of auditory discrimination processing. Our findings add to the present understanding of neuroplastic organization and function of the mammalian nervous system. Furthermore, behavioural recordings obtained from the participating children provide corroborating evidence for a relationship between the duration and intensity of training, the specific sensitivity to instrumental timbre, and pitch recognition abilities.

Time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation to assist delineation of epileptogenic cortex	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; electrocorticography; single pulse electrical stimulation; high-frequency oscillations; time-frequency analysis	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HZ; IDENTIFICATION; SURGERY; BRAIN	Epilepsy surgery depends on reliable pre-surgical markers of epileptogenic tissue. The current gold standard is the seizure onset zone in ictal, i.e. chronic, electrocorticography recordings. Single pulse electrical stimulation can evoke epileptic, spike-like responses in areas of seizure onset also recorded by electrocorticography. Recently, spontaneous pathological high-frequency oscillations (80-520 Hz) have been observed in the electrocorticogram that are related to epileptic spikes, but seem more specific for epileptogenic cortex. We wanted to see whether a quantitative electroencephalography analysis using time-frequency information including the higher frequency range could be applied to evoked responses by single pulse electrical stimulation, to enhance its specificity and clinical use. Electrocorticography data were recorded at a 2048-Hz sampling rate from 13 patients. Single pulse electrical stimulation (10 stimuli, 1 ms, 8 mA, 0.2 Hz) was performed stimulating pairs of adjacent electrodes. A time-frequency analysis based on Morlet wavelet transformation was performed in a [-1 s : 1 s] time interval around the stimulus and a frequency range of 10-520 Hz. Significant (P = 0.05) changes in power spectra averaged for 10 epochs were computed, resulting in event-related spectral perturbation images. In these images, time-frequency analysis of single pulse-evoked responses, in the range of 10-80 Hz for spikes, 80-250 Hz for ripples and 250-520 Hz for fast ripples, were scored by two observers independently. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of time-frequency single pulse-evoked responses in the three frequency ranges were compared with seizure onset zone and post-surgical outcome. In all patients, evoked responses included spikes, ripples and fast ripples. For the seizure onset zone, the median sensitivity of time-frequency single pulse-evoked responses decreased from 100% for spikes to 67% for fast ripples and the median specificity increased from 17% for spikes to 79% for fast ripples. A median positive predictive value for the evoked responses in the seizure onset zone of 17% was found for spikes, 26% for ripples and 37% for fast ripples. Five out of seven patients with < 50% of fast ripples removed by resection had a poor outcome. A wavelet transform-based time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation reveals evoked responses in the frequency range of spikes, ripples and fast ripples. We demonstrate that time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation can assist in delineation of the epileptogenic cortex using time-frequency single pulse-evoked fast ripples as a potential new marker.

Alcohol dependence and anxiety increase error-related brain activity	ADDICTION			English	Article						Alcohol dependence; anxiety; dual diagnosis; EEG; ERN; error monitoring; error-related negativity	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER ADHD; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; POLYMORPHISM; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; DEFICITS; CORTEX	Aims Detection of errors is crucial for efficient goal-directed behaviour. The ability to monitor behaviour is found to be diminished in patients with substance dependence, as reflected in decreased error-related brain activity, i.e. error-related negativity (ERN). The ERN is also decreased in other psychiatric disorders with impaired response inhibition, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and borderline personality disorder, but increased in anxiety disorders. The objective of the current study was to assess error monitoring in alcohol-dependent patients in relation to psychiatric comorbidity. We expected decreased error monitoring in alcohol-dependent patients with impulse control disorders and increased error monitoring in anxious alcohol-dependent patients. Design In a case-control design alcohol-dependent patients were compared with healthy controls. Setting and participants A consecutive series of 29 male alcohol-dependent patients, between 18 and 55 years of age, applying for in-patient detoxification were recruited at Novadic Kentron Center for Addiction Treatment. Fifteen age-matched healthy controls were recruited through advertisements in regional newspapers. Measurements Event-related potentials were recorded while performing a speeded choice-reaction task, from which ERN amplitudes were calculated. Axis-I and -II psychiatric comorbidity were assessed using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality disorders. All participants completed the Temperament and Character Inventory and Profile of Mood States. Findings ERN amplitudes were increased for alcohol-dependent patients compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders. Conclusions Increased error monitoring in alcohol-dependent patients, particularly those with comorbid anxiety disorders, is in contrast with previous studies that suggested decreased error monitoring to be a general feature in substance use disorders. Psychiatric disorders co-occurring with alcohol dependence, such as anxiety disorders, may indicate subpopulations of alcohol-dependent patients, with distinct neurobiological and genetic characteristics, possibly requiring different treatment strategies.

Successful detection of evoked responses can be enhanced by the user selectively attending to specific stimuli presented in the BCI task. Because BCI users need a system that performs well in a variety of contexts, even ones that may impair selective attention, it is critical to understand how single trial detection is affected by attention. We tested 16 participants using a rapid serial visual/auditory presentation paradigm under three conditions, one in which they detected the presence of a visual target, one in which they detected the presence of an auditory target, and one in which they detected both visual and auditory targets. The behavioral performance indicates that the visual task was more difficult than the auditory task. Consistent with the higher behavioral difficulty of the visual task, single trial performance showed no difference between single and dual-task for the visual target detection (mean=0.76). However, the area under the curve for the auditory target detection was significantly lower than the dual-task (mean=0.81 for single task, 0.75 for dual-task). The results support the conclusion that single-trial target detection is impaired when attention is divided between multiple tasks.

Stimulus Novelty, and Not Neural Refractoriness, Explains the Repetition Suppression of Laser-Evoked Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTERSTIMULUS-INTERVAL; PAIN INTENSITY; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; CORTICAL RESPONSES; VERTEX RESPONSE; EEG RESPONSES	Wang AL, Mouraux A, Liang M, Iannetti GD. Stimulus novelty, and not neural refractoriness, explains the repetition suppression of laser-evoked potentials. J Neurophysiol 104: 2116-2124, 2010. First published June 30, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.01088.2009. Brief radiant laser pulses selectively activate skin nociceptors and elicit transient brain responses (laser-evoked potentials [LEPs]). When LEPs are elicited by pairs of stimuli (S1-S2) delivered at different interstimulus intervals (ISIs), the S2-LEP is strongly reduced at short ISIs (250 ms) and progressively recovers at longer ISIs (2,000 ms). This finding has been interpreted in terms of order of arrival of nociceptive volleys and refractoriness of neural generators of LEPs. However, an alternative explanation is the modulation of another experimental factor: the novelty of the eliciting stimulus. To test this alternative hypothesis, we recorded LEPs elicited by pairs of nociceptive stimuli delivered at four ISIs (250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 ms), using two different conditions. In the constant condition, the ISI was identical across the trials of each block, whereas in the variable condition, the ISI was varied randomly across trials and single-stimulus trials were intermixed with paired trials. Therefore the time of occurrence of S2 was both less novel and more predictable in the constant than in the variable condition. In the constant condition, we observed a significant ISI-dependent suppression of the biphasic negative-positive wave (N2-P2) complex of the S2-LEP. In contrast, in the variable condition, the S2-LEP was completely unaffected by stimulus repetition. The pain ratings elicited by S2 were not different in the two conditions. These results indicate that the repetition-suppression of the S2-LEP is not due to refractoriness in nociceptive afferent pathways, but to a modulation of novelty and/or temporal predictability of the eliciting stimulus. This provides further support to the notion that stimulus saliency constitutes a crucial determinant of LEP magnitude and that a significant fraction of the brain activity time-locked to a brief and transient sensory stimulus is not directly related to the quality and the intensity of the corresponding sensation, but to bottom-up attentional processes.

HUMAN HYPOTHALAMUS SHOWS DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO BASIC MOTIVATIONAL STIMULI-AN INVASIVE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hypothalamus; local field potentials; invasive recordings; motivational stimuli	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; CLUSTER HEADACHE; DECISION-MAKING; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; EEG-DATA; ACTIVATION; FOOD; NEURONS; SIGHT; LESIONS	The hypothalamus supports basic motivational behaviours such as mating and feeding. Recording directly from the posterior inferior hypothalamus in a male patient receiving a deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode for the alleviation of cluster headache, we tested the hypothalamic response to different classes of motivational stimuli (sexually relevant: pictures of dressed and undressed women; pictures of food) and pictures of common objects as control. Averaged local field potentials (LFP) to sexually relevant stimuli were characterized by a biphasic significantly enhanced response (relative to objects; bootstrapping statistics) with a first phase starting at around 200 ms and a second phase peaking at around 600 ms. Sexually relevant stimuli also showed a greatly enhanced positivity relative to other stimulus classes in surface event-related potentials in a group of 11 male control participants. It is suggested that the hypothalamus is involved in the recruitment of attentional resources by sexually relevant stimuli reflected in this surface positivity. In a second session, the response to food stimuli relative to objects was tested in two states: after fasting for 14 h, LFPs to food and object stimuli showed significant differences in between 300 and 850 ms, which disappeared after a full high-calorie meal, thus replicating classic studies in monkeys [Rolls et al., Brain Res (1976) 111:53-66]. The current data are the first to demonstrate hypothalamic responses to the sight of motivational stimuli in man and thus shows that recording from DBS electrodes might provide important information about the cognitive functions of subcortical structures.

Subjects in the present study covertly planned a mock terrorist attack on a major city. They were then given three separate blocks of concealed information testing, examining for knowledge of the location, method, and date of the planned terrorist attack, using the Complex Trial Protocol (Rosenfeld et al., 2008). With prior knowledge of the probe items, we detected 12/12 guilty subjects as having knowledge of the planned terrorist attack with no false positives among 12 innocent subjects. Additionally, we were able to identify 10/12 subjects and among them 20/30 crime-related details with no false positives using restricted a priori knowledge of the crime details, suggesting that the protocol could potentially identify future terrorist activity.

Electrophysiological correlates of facial configuration and audio-visual congruency: evidence that face processing is a visual rather than a multisensory task	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Face recognition; EEG; Multisensory; Congruence; Auditory; Visual	INTEGRATION; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; IDENTIFICATION; PERCEPTION; COMPONENTS; FUSIFORM; HUMANS; CORTEX; AREA	Behavioural, neuroimaging and lesion studies show that face processing has a special role in human perception. The purpose of this EEG study was to explore whether auditory information influences visual face perception. We employed a 2 x 2 factorial design and presented subjects with visual stimuli that could be cartoon faces or scrambled faces where size changes of one of the components, the mouth in the face condition, was either congruent or incongruent with the amplitude modulation of a simultaneously presented auditory signal. Our data show a significant main effect for signal congruence at an ERP peak around 135 ms and a significant main effect of face configuration at around 200 ms. The timing and scalp topology of both effects corresponds well to previously reported data on the integration of non-redundant audio-visual stimuli and face-selective processing. Our analysis did not show any significant statistical interactions. This double disassociation suggests that the early component, at 135 ms, is sensitive to auditory-visual congruency but not to facial configuration and that the later component is sensitive to facial configuration but not to AV congruency. We conclude that facial configurational processing is not influenced by the congruence of simultaneous auditory signals and is independent from featural processing where we see evidence for multisensory integration.

In the scalp-recorded EEG, error processing is reflected in two components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). These components have been widely studied, but debate remains regarding the precise aspects of error processing they reflect. The present study investigated the relation between the ERN and the Pe using a novel version of the flanker task to allow a comparison between errors reflecting different causes response conflict versus stimulus masking. The conflict and mask conditions were matched for overall behavioural performance but differed in underlying response dynamics, as indexed by response time distributions and measures of lateralised motor activity. ERN amplitude varied in relation to these differing response dynamics, being significantly larger in the conflict condition compared to the mask condition. Furthermore, differences in response dynamics between participants were predictive of modulations in ERN amplitude. In contrast, Pe activity varied little between conditions, but varied across trials in relation to participants' awareness of their errors. Taken together, these findings suggest a dissociation between the ERN and the Pe, with the former reflecting the dynamics of response selection and conflict, and the latter reflecting conscious recognition of an error.

Avoiding risk may be aided by rapid access to cognitive models for danger. This study investigated whether these schemata are immature in adolescence. An N400 sentential priming paradigm compared risky, predictable, and incongruent sentence processing in adolescents and adults. Adults and teens processed predictable sentences similarly, as evidenced by equivalent N400 priming. However, in adults, more activation was required to access final words in a risky sentence than when the situation was predictable and benign. Conversely, teens showed little difference in N400s generated by risky or expected sentences. This suggests that risky scenario final words were unexpected for adults but not for adolescents because of age-related differences in world knowledge and risk-related schemata. This study may help to explain why teenagers engage in risky activities when there is little time for deliberative thought.

J	Meixner, JB; Rosenfeld, JP				Meixner, John B.; Rosenfeld, J. Peter			Countermeasure mechanisms in a P300-based concealed information test	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Deception; EEG/ERP; Countermeasures; P300; Guilty Knowledge Test; Concealed Information Test	P300; FACE	We recently introduced an accurate and Countermeasure (CM)-resistant P300-based deception detection test (J.P. Rosenfeld et al., 2008). When Subjects use CMs to all irrelevant items in the test, the probe P300 is increased rather than reduced, as, in previous P300-based deception protocols, allowing detection of CM users. Evidence herein suggests this is partly due to an omit effect; the probe was the only uncountered item. Three groups were tested: a guilty omit probe group performed an explicit response to each irrelevant item but not to the probe, an innocent omit irrelevant group saw only irrelevant items and omitted a response to one item, and a guilty no omit group had a concealed information item as probe and performed an explicit response to each. We found a greater P300 amplitude to probes in the guilty omit probe condition as compared with the other two conditions, indicating a P300 enhancing effect of omitting a response to a single stimulus.

The brainstem response to speech can be assessed noninvasively by examining scalp-recorded evoked potentials. Morphologically, two main components of the scalp-recorded brainstem response can be differentiated, a transient onset response and a sustained frequency-following response (FFR). Together, these two components are capable of conveying important segmental and suprasegmental information inherent in the typical speech syllable. Here we examine the putative neural sources of the scalp-recorded brainstem response and review recent evidence that demonstrates that the brainstem response to speech is dynamic in nature and malleable by experience. Finally, we propose a putative mechanism for experience-dependent plasticity at the level of the brainstem.

The present study examines how a native-vowel prototype and an atypical vowel are discriminated by 9-year-old children with (n=14) and without (n=12) DD. MMN was elicited in all conditions in both groups. The control group revealed enhanced MMN to the native-vowel prototype in comparison to the atypical vowel. Children with DD did not show enhanced MMN amplitude to the native-vowel prototype, suggesting impaired tuning to native language speech representations. Furthermore, higher MMN amplitudes to the native-vowel prototype correlated with more advanced reading (r=-.47) and spelling skills (r=-.52).

To this end, fourteen healthy adults performed a speeded Go/Nogo task comprising Nogo trials of varying levels of difficulty, designed to elicit aware and unaware errors. Error awareness was indicated by participants with a second key press after the target key press. Meanwhile, electromyogram (EMG) from the response hand was recorded in addition to high-density scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). In the EMG-locked grand averages, aware errors clearly elicited an error-related negativity (ERN) reflecting error detection, and a later error positivity (Pe) reflecting conscious error awareness. However, no Pe was recorded after unaware errors or hits. These results are in line with previous studies suggesting that error awareness is associated with generation of the Pe. Source localisation results confirmed that the posterior cingulate motor area was the main generator of the ERN. However, inverse solution results also point to the involvement of the left posterior insula during the time interval of the Pe, and hence error awareness. Moreover, consecutive to this insular activity, the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was activated in response to aware and unaware errors but not in response to hits, consistent with the implication of this area in the evaluation of the value of an error. These results reveal a precise sequence of activations in these three non-overlapping brain regions following error commission, enabling a progressive differentiation between aware and unaware errors as a function of time elapsed, thanks to the involvement first of interoceptive or proprioceptive processes (left insula), later leading to the detection of a breach in the prepotent response mode (right OFC).

However, the timing of attentional modulation of visual cortex during object-based attention remains a controversial issue. Results: In this study, EEG recording and LORETA source reconstruction were performed. A large number of subjects (29) and of trial repetitions were used (13,312). EEG was recorded from 128 scalp sites at a sampling rate of 512 Hz. Four square-wave gratings (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6 c/deg) were randomly presented in the 4 quadrants of the visual field. Participants were instructed to pay conjoined attention to a given stimulus quadrant and spatial frequency. The C1 and P1 sensory-evoked components of ERPs were quantified by measuring their mean amplitudes across time within 5 latency ranges 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-120 and 120-140 ms. Conclusions: Early attention effects were found in the form of an enhanced C1 response (40-80 ms) to frequency-relevant gratings. LORETA, within its spatial resolution limits, identified the neural generators of this effect in the striate cortex (BA17), among other areas.

Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: Electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses	PAIN			English	Article						Pain; Anticipation; Meditation; Mindfulness; Attention; EEG; LORETA; Nociception	ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; BRAIN RESPONSES; MINDFULNESS; ATTENTION; ACCEPTANCE; ANXIETY; CONTEXT; CORTEX; STATES	The aim of mindfulness meditation is to develop present-focused, non-judgmental, attention. Therefore, experience in meditation should be associated with less anticipation and negative appraisal of pain. In this study we compared a group of individuals with meditation experience to a control group to test whether any differences in the affective appraisal of pain could be explained by lower anticipatory neural processing. Anticipatory and pain-evoked ERPs and reported pain unpleasantness were recorded in response to laser stimuli of matched subjective intensity between the two groups. ERP data were analysed after source estimation with LORETA. No group effects were found on the laser energies used to induce pain. More experienced meditators perceived the pain as less unpleasant relative to controls, with meditation experience correlating inversely with unpleasantness ratings. ERP source data for anticipation showed that in meditators, lower activity in midcingulate cortex relative to controls was related to the lower unpleasantness ratings, and was predicted by lifetime meditation experience. Meditators also reversed the normal positive correlation between medial prefrontal cortical activity and pain unpleasantness during anticipation. Meditation was also associated with lower activity in 52 and insula during the pain-evoked response, although the experiment could not disambiguate this activity from the preceding anticipation response. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation reduces the anticipation and negative appraisal of pain, but effects on pain-evoked activity are less clear and may originate from preceding anticipatory activity. Further work is required to directly test the causal relationship between meditation, pain anticipation, and pain experience. (C) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

The present study examined neurophysiological underpinnings of this effect. In a single-blinded within-subject design, we traced effects of A-tDCS compared to sham stimulation over the left DPFC using electrophysiological and behavioural correlates during overt picture naming. Online effects were examined during A-tDCS by employing the semantic interference (SI-)Effect - a marker that denotes the functional integrity of the language system. The behavioural SI-Effect was found to be reduced, whereas the electrophysiological SI-Effect was enhanced over left compared to right temporal scalp-electrode sites. This modulation is suggested to reflect a superior tuning of neural responses within language-related generators. After -(offline) effects of A-tDCS were detected in the delta frequency band, a marker of neural inhibition. After A-tDCS there was a reduction in delta activity during picture naming and the resting state, interpreted to indicate neural disinhibition. Together, these findings demonstrate electrophysiological modulations induced by A-tDCS of the left DPFC. They suggest that A-tDCS is capable of enhancing neural processes during and after application. The present functional and oscillatory neural markers could detect positive effects of prefrontal A-tDCS, which could be of use in the neuro-rehabilitation of frontal language functions.

Single-trial reconstruction of auditory evoked magnetic fields by means of Template Matching Pursuit	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Evoked responses; Magnetoencephalography; Matching Pursuit; Single-trial analysis; Template matching	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; BRAIN; VARIABILITY; EEG; LATENCY; DECOMPOSITION; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION	We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (IMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (similar to 4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diminished Parietal Cortex Activity Associated with Poor Motion Direction Discrimination Performance in Schizophrenia	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						ERP; motion; motion processing; P1; parietal cortex; schizophrenia; smooth pursuit; visual	TEMPORAL VISUAL AREA; PERCEPTION FOLLOWING LESIONS; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; PROCESSING DEFICITS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PARVOCELLULAR CONTRIBUTIONS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; OBJECT RECOGNITION; BACKWARD-MASKING	The results of multiple investigations indicate visual motion-processing abnormalities in schizophrenia. There is little information, however, about the time course and neural correlates of motion-processing abnormalities among these subjects. For the present study, 13 schizophrenia and 13 healthy subjects performed a simple motion direction discrimination task with peripherally presented moving grating stimuli (5 or 10 deg/s). Dense-array electroencephalography data were collected simultaneously. The goal was to discern whether neural deviations associated with motion-processing abnormalities among schizophrenia patients occur early or late in the visual-processing stream. Schizophrenia patients were worse at judging the direction of motion gratings, had enhanced early neural activity (about 90 ms after stimulus onset), and deficient target detection-related late neural activity over parietal cortex (about 400 ms after stimulus onset). In addition, there was a strong association (accounting for 36% of performance variance) between poor behavioral performance and lower target detection-related brain activity among schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that abnormalities in later stages of motion-processing mechanisms, perhaps beyond extrastriate cortex, may account for behavioral deviations among schizophrenia subjects.

However, a growing body of sound-symbolism research suggests the existence of some naturally-biased mappings between phonological properties of labels and perceptual properties of their referents (Maurer, Pathman, & Mondloch, 2006). We present new behavioural and neurophysiological evidence for the psychological reality of sound-symbolism. In a categorisation task that captures the processes involved in natural language interpretation, participants were faster to identify novel objects when label-object mappings were sound-symbolic than when they were not. Moreover, early negative EEG-waveforms indicated a sensitivity to sound-symbolic label-object associations (within 200 ms of object presentation), highlighting the non-arbitrary relation between the objects and the labels used to name them. This sensitivity to sound-symbolic label-object associations may reflect a more general process of auditory-visual feature integration where properties of auditory stimuli facilitate a mapping to specific visual features.

Theta synchrony supports Weber-Fechner and Stevens' Laws for error processing, uniting high and low mental processes	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Weber-Fechner Law; Stevens' Law; EEG oscillations; theta; ACC; rule violation	WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; CONFLICT; REPRESENTATIONS; CORTEX; JUDGMENTS; FEEDBACK; NUMBERS; POWER	Human brain theta rhythm has been related to the operation of a generic mechanism involved in error detection processes of different types (e.g., detecting incorrect motor responses or incorrect arithmetic equations). This theta activity seems to be sensitive to error salience or magnitude, that is, stronger theta activity is found with larger or more deviant errors (e.g., 1+2=8) than with smaller or less deviant ones (e.g., 1+2=4). A time-frequency decomposition analysis indicated that theta activity is modulated by the magnitude of erroneous information in a nonlinear fashion, which can be characterized using Weber-Fechner's law of logarithmic function and Stevens' law of power function. The present study suggests that the generic mechanisms for error detection and evaluation may share similar fundamental neural schemes with primary cognitive and sensory or perceptual processes, which are directly involved in processing the specific type of input.

Previous event-related potential studies have identified an early (> 120 ms) negative potential shift over occipito-temporal regions (early posterior negativity, EPN) presumed to indicate the facilitated processing of survival-relevant stimuli. The present study investigated whether this neural signature of motivated attention is also responsive to the intrinsic significance of man-made objects and consumer goods. To address this issue, we capitalized on gender differences towards specific man-made objects, shoes and motorcycles, for which the Statistical Yearbook 2005 of Germany's Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2005) revealed pronounced differences in consumer behavior. In a passive viewing paradigm, male and female participants viewed pictures of motorcycles and shoes, while their magnetoencephalographic brain responses were measured. Source localization of the magnetic counterpart of the EPN (EPNm) revealed pronounced gender differences in picture processing. Specifically, between 130 and 180 ms, all female participants generated stronger activity in occipito-temporal regions when viewing shoes compared to motorcycles, while all men except one showed stronger activation for motorcycles than shoes. Thus, the EPNm allowed a sex-dimorphic classification of the processing of consumer goods. Self-report data confirmed gender differences in consumer behavior, which, however, were less distinct compared to the brain based measure. Considering the latency of the EPNm, the reflected automatic emotional network activity is most likely not yet affected by higher cognitive functions such as response strategies or social expectancy. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging measures of early brain activity may thus serve as objective measure for individual preferences towards consumer goods.

Eighteen participants observed the following stimuli: "wo de" (Chinese for "my"/"mine"), "ta de" (Chinese for "his"), "wo" (Chinese for "1"/"me"), "ta" (Chinese for "he"/"him"), small circle and big circle. Relative to "ta de", "wo" and "ta", "wo de" elicited a significantly larger P300 amplitude, i.e. the effect of SRPP. The results showed that the effect was not due to the difference between the characters that comprise "wo de" and the characters that comprise "ta de". Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was also conducted, which showed activities in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate and postcentral cortex. Two representations of SRPP, self-referential content (SRC) and first-person perspective (FPP), are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Decisions to shoot in a weapon identification task: The influence of cultural stereotypes and perceived threat on false positive errors	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Weapon bias; Stereotypes; Threat perception; Event-related potential; Pupil size; Anterior cingulate cortex	POLICE OFFICERS; SOCIAL COGNITION; RACIAL BIAS; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; PREJUDICE; RESPONSES; RACE	The decision to shoot a gun engages executive control processes that can be biased by cultural stereotypes and perceived threat. The neural locus of the decision to shoot is likely to be found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where cognition and affect converge. Male military cadets at Norwich University (N=37) performed a weapon identification task in which they made rapid decisions to shoot when images of guns appeared briefly on a computer screen. Reaction times, error rates, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity were recorded. Cadets reacted more quickly and accurately when guns were primed by images of Middle-Eastern males wearing traditional clothing. However, cadets also made more false positive errors when tools were primed by these images. Error-related negativity (ERN) was measured for each response. Deeper ERNs were found in the medial-frontal cortex following false positive responses. Cadets who made fewer errors also produced deeper ERNs, indicating stronger executive control. Pupil size was used to measure autonomic arousal related to perceived threat. Images of Middle-Eastern males in traditional clothing produced larger pupil sizes. An image of Osama bin Laden induced the largest pupil size, as would be predicted for the exemplar of Middle East terrorism. Cadets who showed greater increases in pupil size also made more false positive errors. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate predictions based on current models of perceived threat, stereotype activation, and cognitive control. Measures of pupil size (perceived threat) and ERN (cognitive control) explained significant proportions of the variance in false positive errors to Middle-Eastern males in traditional clothing, while measures of reaction time, signal detection response bias, and stimulus discriminability explained most of the remaining variance.

Low intensity intra-epidermal electrical stimulation can activate A delta-nociceptors selectively	PAIN			English	Article						Nociception; Intra-epidermal stimulation; Laser-evoked potentials; Event-related brain potentials; Capsaicin; Nerve pressure block; A delta-nociceptors	EPIDERMAL NERVE-FIBERS; CO2-LASER STIMULI; TOPICAL CAPSAICIN; C-FIBER; SECONDARY HYPERALGESIA; MECHANICAL STIMULI; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; HEAT PAIN; SKIN	In the past 30 years, the study of nociception has relied mostly on thermal stimulation to activate nociceptors selectively. However, thermal stimulation suffers from some important limitations. For this reason, investigators have proposed intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES) as an alternative method to activate nociceptors selectively. This method relies on the fact that nociceptors are located mainly in the epidermis, while non-nociceptive fibres terminate more deeply in the dermis. Therefore, provided that the difference in receptor depth is sufficient, electric currents spatially restricted to the epidermal layers might activate nociceptors selectively. Here, we examined whether or not IES provides a fully selective nociceptive input. In a first experiment, we used capsaicin to induce a selective denervation of capsaicin- sensitive nociceptors, and thereby test whether the responses to IES are mediated by this population of afferent fibres. We found that capsaicin abolishes both the behavioural and the electrophysiological responses to IES applied at twice the perceptual threshold. In a second experiment, we applied a nerve pressure block to the superficial radial nerve to induce a temporally dissociated impairment of A beta-, A delta- and C-fibre afferents, and thereby determine the fibre populations contributing to the responses elicited by IES. We found that the time course of the blockade of the responses to IES follows closely the time course of the blockade of A delta-fibres, but not of A beta-fibres. Taken together, our results provide converging evidence that A delta-nociceptors can be activated selectively using IES, provided that low intensities of stimulation are used.

The present study investigated the effects of 2-h head-down bed rest on subjective and cortical responses elicited by electrical, pain-related somatosensory stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Twenty male subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, head-down bed rest (BR) or sitting control condition. Starting from individual electrical thresholds, Somatosensory Evoked Potentials were elicited by electrical stimuli administered randomly to the left wrist and divided into four conditions: control painless condition, electrical pain threshold, 30% above pain threshold, 30% below pain threshold. Subjective pain ratings collected during the EEG session showed significantly reduced pain perception in BR compared to Control group. Statistical analysis on four electrode clusters and sLORETA source analysis revealed, in sitting controls, a P1 component (40-50 ms) in the right somatosensory cortex, whereas it was bilateral and differently located in BR group. Controls' N1 (80-90 ms) had widespread right hemisphere activation, involving also anterior cingulate, whereas BR group showed primary somatosensory cortex activation. The P2 (190-220 ms) was larger in left-central locations of Controls compared with BR group. Conclusions/Significance: Head-down bed rest was associated to an overall decrease of pain sensitivity and an altered pain network also outside the primary somatosensory cortex. Results have implications not only for astronauts' health and spaceflight risks, but also for the clinical aspects of pain detection in bedridden patients at risk of fatal undetected complications.

The current study investigated the patterns of brain oscillations during simultaneous processing of music and language using visually presented sentences and auditorily presented chord sequences. Music-syntactically regular or irregular chord functions were presented in sync with syntactically or semantically correct or incorrect words. Irregular chord functions (presented simultaneously with a syntactically correct word) produced an early (150-250 ms) spectral power decrease over anterior frontal regions in the theta band (5-7 Hz) and a late (350-700 ms) power increase in both the delta and the theta band (2-7 Hz) over parietal regions. Syntactically incorrect words (presented simultaneously with a regular chord) elicited a similar late power increase in delta-theta band over parietal sites, but no early effect. Interestingly, the late effect was significantly diminished when the language-syntactic and music-syntactic irregularities occurred at the same time. Further, the presence of a semantic violation occurring simultaneously with regular chords produced a significant increase in later delta-theta power at posterior regions; this effect was marginally decreased when the identical semantic violation occurred simultaneously with a music syntactical violation. Altogether, these results show that low frequency oscillatory networks get activated during the syntactic processing of both music and language, and further, these networks may possibly be shared.

Impaired top-down processes in schizophrenia: A DCM study of ERPs	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BINOCULAR DEPTH INVERSION; BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; BACKWARD-MASKING; EVOKED-RESPONSES; BRAIN MECHANISMS; VISUAL MASKING; EEG	Perception is not simply based on a hierarchical organization of the brain; it arises from an interplay between inputs from the environment and internal predictions of these inputs. It is an active process which involves an interaction between bottom-up information coming from the senses and feedback connections coming from higher-order cortical areas. In our experiment, we use the hollow-mask illusion to investigate the strength of top-down processes in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. By using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) data, we have presented evidence to suggest that patients with schizophrenia are less constrained by top-down processes during perception (Dima, D., Roiser, J.P., Dietrich, D.E., Bonnemann, C., Lanfermann, H., Emrich, H.M., Dillo, W., 2009. Understanding why patients with schizophrenia do not perceive the hollow-mask illusion using dynamic causal modeling. Neuroimage 46, 1180-1186). In this study, we re-address this issue by using DCM on event-related potentials (ERPs) data. Our aim was to validate our previous findings by conducting the same connectivity analysis - DCM - on data obtained from a different neuroimaging method. Our results confirm our initial hypothesis that top-down influences are constrained in schizophrenia, especially in perceptual tasks that require top-down control, like the hollow-mask illusion.

The BCI was used by a 51-year-old male with ALS who could no longer use conventional assistive devices. Caregivers learned to place the electrode cap, add electrode gel, and turn on the BCI. After calibration, the system allowed the user to communicate via EEG. Re-calibration was performed remotely (via the internet), and BCI accuracy assessed in periodic tests. Reports of BCI usefulness by the user and the family were also recorded. Results showed that BCI accuracy remained at 83% (r = -.07, n.s.) for over 2.5 years (1.4% expected by chance). The BCI user and his family state that the BCI had restored his independence in social interactions and at work. He uses the BCI to run his NIH-funded research laboratory and to communicate via e-mail with family, friends, and colleagues. In addition to this first user, several other similarly disabled people are now using the BCI in their daily lives. In conclusion, long-term independent home use of this BCI system is practical for severely disabled people, and can contribute significantly to quality of life and productivity.

The patient performed a speeded go/nogo task and made a substantial number of commission errors (false alarms). As predicted, intracranial Local Field Potentials (iLFPs) in dorsal anterior cingulate indexed the detection of errors, showing an early differential activity around motor execution for false alarms, relative to correct responses (either hits or correct inhibitions). More surprisingly, we found that the left amygdala also participated to error monitoring (although no emotional stimuli were used), but with a very different neurophysiological profile as compared with the dorsal cingulate cortex. Amygdala iLFPs showed a precise and reproducible temporal unfolding, characterized by an early monophasic response for correct hits around motor execution, which was delayed by similar to 300 ms for errors (even though actual RTs were almost identical in these two conditions). Moreover, time-frequency analyses demonstrated a reliable and transient coupling in the theta band around motor execution between these two distant regions. Additional fMRI investigation in the same patient confirmed a differential involvement of the dorsal cingulate cortex vs. amygdala in error monitoring during this go/nogo task. Finally, these intracranial results for the left amygdala were replicated in a second patient with intracranial electrodes in the right amygdala. Altogether, these results suggest that the amygdala may register the motivational significance of motor actions on a trial-by-trial basis, while the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may provide signals concerning failures of cognitive control and behavioral adjustment. More generally, these data shed new light on neural mechanisms underlying self-monitoring by showing that even "simple" motor actions recruit not only executive cognitive processes (in dorsal cingulate) but also affective processes (in amygdala).

Particularly, a high status of so-called fluid cognitive functions is crucial for the employability at an older age. This status, which can be assessed by psychometric and neuroimaging methods, depends on a number of factors like physical constitution, nutrition, education and work demands. This paper systematically analyses factors affecting cognitive functions in aging and reviews current neuroscientific findings regarding training induced neuronal plasticity and compensation of cognitive declines in aging. In the second part the relationship between cognitive functions and the type of work will be discussed and the project PFIFF presented as an example for transfer of neuroscientific basic research to an applied context that aimed at ameliorating and evaluating age-and job-related cognitive deficits. The results of the first project period showed that cognitive decline, as revealed in behavior and brain wave data, may be accelerated by long-lasting unchallenging work and, hence, may occur already in middle age. In the second part of PFIFF a 3-month program consisting of a supervised cognitive training was implemented in a group of 120 assembly-line employees. Before and after the training a comprehensive battery of psychometric and EEG-based tests was administered. The results provide evidence that training in older employees with repetitive work improves impaired cognitive abilities and brain processes found in the first part of the project. These beneficial effects are apparently mediated by preserved brain plasticity in middle-aged and older individuals. This training approach appears to be suitable in order to improve mental fitness of elderly employees. The PFIFF project can be seen as a part of a comprehensive program for promoting mental fitness in older employees.

In light of converging biological and behavioral evidence that depressive symptoms are associated with impaired reward processing, we examined whether adolescent girls with a parental history of depression would also exhibit abnormal reward sensitivity. We performed a negative mood induction and then recorded the feedback negativity, a neural index of reward processing, while individuals completed a gambling task. High-risk adolescents reported greater sadness following the mood induction compared to low-risk adolescents. Among the high-risk group, sadness was strongly associated with a blunted feedback negativity, even after controlling for baseline mood and trait neuroticism. This suggests that high-risk adolescents are more reactive to negative stimuli, which significantly alter neural sensitivity to monetary gains and losses. The feedback negativity might be used to identify information processing abnormalities in high-risk populations prior to the onset of a major depressive episode.

However, few studies were established by using well-controlled task with respect to the preparatory processing and stimulus probability. In the present study, we examined the peak amplitude and latency of Go-P300 (P300 evoked by visual Go stimuli) and Nogo-P300 (P300 evoked by visual Nogo stimuli) component in healthy children. Methods: High resolution EEG data were recorded from 13 children (7-11 years old) during a cued equiprobable Go/Nogo task. The P300 component was measured at frontal (F3, Fz, F4) and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) regions in response to both Go and Nogo stimuli. Data were analyzes using a three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results: These children displayed higher P300 amplitude in the Go relative to Nogo condition at parietal region. In addition, decrease in P300 latency was observed at the frontal in comparison to parietal region. Discussion: The results might suggest that the P300 is related to different processes or arise from different generators in execution and inhibition conditions.

The aim of the present EEG study was to examine the impact of language training as experienced by simultaneous interpreters (SI) on auditory word processing and to disentangle its influence from that of proficiency and age of acquisition. Eleven native German SI and controls matched in L2 proficiency and age of acquisition were asked to judge whether auditory presented disyllabic noun pairs both within and across the German (L1) and English (L2) languages were either semantically congruent or incongruent. We revealed enlarged N400 responses in SI while they detected incongruent trials both within the native (L1) and non-native (L2) language and also while they performed the task in the opposite direction as specifically trained (L1 to L2). These enlarged N400 responses in SI suggest a training-induced altered sensitivity to semantic processing within and across L1 and L2. The enlarged N400 responses we revealed in SI to congruent noun pairs during the German-English condition (L1 to L2) may indicate that SI could not benefit from an L1 prime when the target was a L2 word, suggesting additional processing resulting from long-term backwards (L2 to L1) training.

Here we use a neural model mimicking the cortical anatomy of sensory and motor areas and their connections to explain brain activity indexing auditory change and memory access. Our simulations indicate that while neuronal adaptation and local inhibition of cortical activity can explain aspects of change detection as observed when a repeated unfamiliar sound changes in frequency, the brain dynamics elicited by auditory stimulation with well-known patterns (such as meaningful words) cannot be accounted for on the basis of adaptation and inhibition alone. Specifically, we show that the stronger brain responses observed to familiar stimuli in passive oddball tasks are best explained in terms of activation of memory circuits that emerged in the cortex during the learning of these stimuli. Such memory circuits, and the activation enhancement they entail, are absent for unfamiliar stimuli. The model illustrates how basic neurobiological mechanisms, including neuronal adaptation, lateral inhibition, and Hebbian learning, underlie neuronal assembly formation and dynamics, and differentially contribute to the brain's major change detection response, the mismatch negativity.

Due to their large number and very close proximity to the user's head, mobile phones deserve special attention. This work is intended to give a systematic review of objective studies, assessing the effects of mobile phone EMF on the functions of the central nervous system (CNS) structures. Our review shows that short exposures to mobile phone EMF, experienced by telephone users during receiving calls, do not affect the cochlear function. Effects of GSM mobile phone EMF on the conduction of neural impulses from the inner ear neurons to the brainstein auditory centres have not been detected either. If Picton's principle, saying that P300 amplitude varies with the improbability of the targets and its latency varies with difficulty of discriminating the target stimulus from standard stimuli, is true, EMF changes the improbability of the targets without hindering their discrimination. Experiments with use of indirect methods do not enable unequivocal verification of EMF effects on the cognitive functions due to the CNS anatomical and functional complexity. Thus, it seems advisable to develop a model of EMF effects on the excitable brain structures at the cellular level.

It is thought to take place immediately after the early extraction of sensory information and is specifically reflected in a positive component of the event related potentials, peaking at similar to 220 ms after stimulus onset. However, in the previous research, neural processes associated with the monitoring of overall task difficulty were confounded by those associated with the increased sensory processing demands as a result of adding noise to the stimuli. Here we dissociated the effect of phase noise on sensory processing and overall decision difficulty using a face gender categorization task. Task difficulty was manipulated either by adding noise to the stimuli or by adjusting the female/male characteristics of the face images. We found that it is the presence of noise and not the increased overall task difficulty that affects the electrophysiological responses in the first 300 ms following stimulus onset in humans. Furthermore, we also showed that processing of phase-randomized as compared to intact faces is associated with increased fMRI responses in the lateral occipital cortex. These results revealed that noise-induced modulation of the early electrophysiological responses reflects increased visual cortical processing demands and thus failed to provide support for a task-difficulty component taking place between the early sensory processing and the later sensory accumulation stages of perceptual decision making.

In this study, EEG was continuously recorded from 128 scalp sites in 15 right-handed university students while they received stimuli in the form of 150 pictures of familiar non-tool objects and 150 pictures of manipulable tools, matched for size, luminance and perceptual familiarity. To select the 300 images for the study, a wider set of preliminary stimuli was screened for motoric content by 20 judges using a 3-point scale (0 = absent; 2 = strong); pictures that scored below 1.5 or above 0.6 were excluded from the tool and non-tool categories, respectively. Tools and non-tools were presented in random order, interspersed with 25 photos of live plants. Each slide was presented for 1000 ms, with an interval ranging from 1500 to 1900 ms. The task consisted of responding to the photos of plants while ignoring the other stimuli. Both an anterior negativity (210-270 ms) and a centroparietal P300 (550-600 ms) were larger in response to tools than objects, particularly in the left hemisphere. swLORETA inverse solution identified the occipito-temporal cortex (BA19 and BA37) as the most significant source of activity (in the 210-270-ms time window) for both types of visual objects and the left postcentral gyrus (BA3) and the left and right premotor cortex (BA6) as the most significant source of activity for tools only. These data hint at an automatic access to motoric object properties even under conditions in which attention is devoted to other stimulus categories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding Actions of Others: The Electrodynamics of the Left and Right Hemispheres. A High-Density EEG Neuroimaging Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; AUTISM-SPECTRUM-DISORDERS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MOTOR FACILITATION; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; IDEOMOTOR APRAXIA; HAND ACTIONS	Background: When we observe an individual performing a motor act (e. g. grasping a cup) we get two types of information on the basis of how the motor act is done and the context: what the agent is doing (i.e. grasping) and the intention underlying it (i.e. grasping for drinking). Here we examined the temporal dynamics of the brain activations that follow the observation of a motor act and underlie the observer's capacity to understand what the agent is doing and why. Methodology/Principal Findings: Volunteers were presented with two-frame video-clips. The first frame (T0) showed an object with or without context; the second frame (T1) showed a hand interacting with the object. The volunteers were instructed to understand the intention of the observed actions while their brain activity was recorded with a high-density 128-channel EEG system. Visual event-related potentials (VEPs) were recorded time-locked with the frame showing the hand-object interaction (T1). The data were analyzed by using electrical neuroimaging, which combines a cluster analysis performed on the group-averaged VEPs with the localization of the cortical sources that give rise to different spatio-temporal states of the global electrical field. Electrical neuroimaging results revealed four major steps: 1) bilateral posterior cortical activations; 2) a strong activation of the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortices with almost a complete disappearance of activations in the right hemisphere; 3) a significant increase of the activations of the right temporo-parietal region with simultaneously co-active left hemispheric sources, and 4) a significant global decrease of cortical activity accompanied by the appearance of activation of the orbito-frontal cortex. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that the early striking left hemisphere involvement is due to the activation of a lateralized action-observation/action execution network. The activation of this lateralized network mediates the understanding of the goal of object-directed motor acts (mirror mechanism). The successive right hemisphere activation indicates that this hemisphere plays an important role in understanding the intention of others.

J	Smith, AL; Staines, WR				Smith, Alison L.; Staines, W.

Moreover, we lack a methodology to measure cortical adaptations in response to modes of movement training. Therefore, the present study measured the cued movement-related potential (MRP) to investigate cortical adaptations during cued inphase versus antiphase BMT that transferred to a unimanual task and how cortical modulations related to behavior. Three specific hypotheses were investigated: (1) cued inphase BMT would induce cortical adaptations within regions subserving motor preparation and movement execution, (2) repetitive cued unimanual training would induce cortical activity modulations associated with motor execution, and (3) increased cortical activity would be associated with enhanced performance. On three separate days, EEG was recorded from 22 electrodes during three types of cued movement training: inphase BMT, antiphase BMT and repetitive unimanual movement, in addition to pre- and post-training unimanual movement trials involving cued right wrist flexion. The MRP was measured for each repetition during each trial. Results showed a significant training-related increase in preparatory activation correlated with a behavioral enhancement following cued inphase BMT. This effect was not attributable to a change in arousal. No significant training-related modulation occurred in response to cued antiphase BMT or repetitive unimanual movement training. These results suggest that cortical adaptations in relation to the preparation of a cued movement enhance in response to cued inphase BMT, and the MRP is an effective measurement tool to assess training-related adaptations in response to inphase BMT specifically.

Instead, lateralization of linguistic processes involved in reading develops more slowly in parallel with learning to read. In adults there is limited evidence that language lateralization differs across genders. With the present experiment we aimed at demonstrating that gender-related lateralization difference begins earlier, in school-aged children, with characteristics similar to those observed in adults. To this aim, 14 boys and 14 girls aged 10 participated in a linguistic experiment including Orthographic, Phonological, and Semantic tasks. Early potentials evoked by single-word reading revealed a posterior negative wave peaking at 230 msec, corresponding to the N150-Recognition Potential, and a more anterior and late N350. Boys showed a bilateral N150 in all tasks, whereas girls' N150 was right lateralized in both the Phonological and the Orthographic tasks. In the later interval (300-400 msec) boys' N350 was left lateralized over anterior sites during the Phonological task and girls exhibited bilateral activation in all tasks. Results support the hypothesis that a reduced left language lateralization can be functionally detected in females since the first years of development of reading skills.

Previous fMRI studies have reported that goal match enhancement, a component of working memory involving object identity and location, significantly activates the posterior hippocampus. However, information regarding the timing of this process is limited. In the current study, facilitated by the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial recording from human patients, we confirmed that the left posterior hippocampus plays an important role in the goal match enhancement effect. We also found that this effect occurs within 600 to 650 milliseconds of probe onset, about 200 ms later than perceptual effects such as the physical match enhancement effect or the P300. More specifically, within individuals, goal match enhancement latency is positively correlated with mean reaction time. The results suggest that the hippocampus plays an important role in working memory in tasks involving feature-location binding. The results further suggest that goal match enhancement effects occur after perceptual processes, implying a dissociation of different working memory components in the hippocampus.

In dense-array EEG studies of human learning, we observed brain activity in medial prefrontal cortex (the medial frontal negativty or MFN) was not only observed in early stages, but, surprisingly, continued to increase as learning progressed. In the present study we investigated this finding by examining MFN amplitude as participants learned an arbitrary associative learning task over three sessions. On the fourth seassion the same task with new stimuli was presented to assess changes in MFN amplitude. The results showed that MFN amplitude continued to increase with practice over the first three sessions, in contrast to P3 amplitudes. Even when participants were presented with new stimuli in session 4, MFN amplitude was larger than that observed in the first session. Furthermore, MFN activity from the third session predicted learning rate in the fourth session. The results point to an interaction between early and late stages in which learning results in corticolimbic consolidation of cognitive context models that facilitate new learning in similar contexts.

Whole-cortex magnetoencephalography (MEG) was obtained from 17 typically developing children and 25 children with ASD. Subjects were presented tones with frequencies of 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 Hz, and left and right STG M50 and M100 STG activity was examined. No M50 latency or amplitude Group differences were observed. In the right hemisphere, a Group x Frequency ANOVA on M100 latency produced a main effect for Group (P = 0.01), with an average M100 latency delay of 11 msec in children with ASD. In addition, only in the control group was the expected association of earlier M100 latencies in older than younger children observed. Group latency differences remained significant when hierarchical regression analyses partialed out M100 variance associated with age, IQ, and language ability (all P-values <0.05). Examining the right-hemisphere 500 Hz condition (where the largest latency differences were observed), a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 81%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 86% was obtained at a threshold of 116 msec. The M100 latency delay indicates disruption of encoding simple sensory information. Given similar findings in language impaired and nonlanguage impaired ASD subjects, a right-hemisphere M100 latency delay appears to be an electrophysiological endophenotype for autism.

Attention-driven auditory cortex short-term plasticity helps segregate relevant sounds from noise	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						processing negativity; cocktail party phenomenon; event-related potentials; negative difference; auditory scene analysis	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CORTICAL SURFACE; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HUMAN BRAIN; COORDINATE SYSTEM; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TASK-DIFFICULTY; SINGLE NEURONS; FREQUENCY	How can we concentrate on relevant sounds in noisy environments? A "gain model" suggests that auditory attention simply amplifies relevant and suppresses irrelevant afferent inputs. However, it is unclear whether this suffices when attended and ignored features overlap to stimulate the same neuronal receptive fields. A "tuning model" suggests that, in addition to gain, attention modulates feature selectivity of auditory neurons. We recorded magnetoencephalography, EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI) while subjects attended to tones delivered to one ear and ignored opposite-ear inputs. The attended ear was switched every 30 s to quantify how quickly the effects evolve. To produce overlapping inputs, the tones were presented alone vs. during white-noise masking notch-filtered +/- 1/6 octaves around the tone center frequencies. Amplitude modulation (39 vs. 41 Hz in opposite ears) was applied for "frequency tagging" of attention effects on maskers. Noise masking reduced early (50-150 ms; N1) auditory responses to unattended tones. In support of the tuning model, selective attention canceled out this attenuating effect but did not modulate the gain of 50-150 ms activity to nonmasked tones or steady-state responses to the maskers themselves. These tuning effects originated at nonprimary auditory cortices, purportedly occupied by neurons that, without attention, have wider frequency tuning than +/- 1/6 octaves. The attentional tuning evolved rapidly, during the first few seconds after attention switching, and correlated with behavioral discrimination performance. In conclusion, a simple gain model alone cannot explain auditory selective attention. In nonprimary auditory cortices, attention-driven short-term plasticity retunes neurons to segregate relevant sounds from noise.

A study using time-frequency analysis of mismatch responses from 7 years to adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; NEGATIVITY MMN; SOUND DISCRIMINATION; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MATURATION; EEG; DYNAMICS; STIMULI	Behavioural and electrophysiological studies give differing impressions of when auditory discrimination is mature. Ability to discriminate frequency and speech contrasts reaches adult levels only around 12 years of age, yet an electrophysiological index of auditory discrimination, the mismatch negativity (MMN), is reported to be as large in children as in adults. Auditory ERPs were measured in 30 children (7 to 12 years), 23 teenagers (13 to 16 years) and 32 adults (35 to 56 years) in an oddball paradigm with tone or syllable stimuli. For each stimulus type, a standard stimulus (1000 Hz tone or syllable [ba]) occurred on 70% of trials, and one of two deviants (1030 or 1200 Hz tone, or syllables [da] or [bi]) equiprobably on the remaining trials. For the traditional MMN interval of 100-250 ms post-onset, size of mismatch responses increased with age, whereas the opposite trend was seen for an interval from 300 to 550 ms post-onset, corresponding to the late discriminative negativity (LDN). Time-frequency analysis of single trials revealed that the MMN resulted from phase-synchronization of oscillations in the theta (4-7 Hz) range, with greater synchronization in adults than children. Furthermore, the amount of synchronization was significantly correlated with frequency discrimination threshold. These results show that neurophysiological processes underlying auditory discrimination continue to develop through childhood and adolescence. Previous reports of adult-like MMN amplitudes in children may be artefactual results of using peak measurements when comparing groups that differ in variance.	[Bishop, Dorothy V.

These N400 effects are often delayed compared with native (L1) comprehension, suggesting that semantic integration in one's second language occurs later than in one's first language. In this study, we investigated whether such a delay could be attributed to (1) intralingual lexical competition and/or (2) interlingual lexical competition. We recorded EEG from Dutch-English bilinguals who listened to English (L2) sentences in which the sentence-final word was (a) semantically fitting and (b) semantically incongruent or semantically incongruent but initially congruent due to sharing initial phonemes with (c) the most probable sentence completion within the L2 or (d) the L1 translation equivalent of the most probable sentence completion. We found an N400 effect in each of the semantically incongruent conditions. This N400 effect was significantly delayed to L2 words but not to L1 translation equivalents that were initially congruent with the sentence context. Taken together, these findings firstly demonstrate that semantic integration in nonnative listening can start based on word initial phonemes (i.e., before a single lexical candidate could have been selected based on the input) and secondly suggest that spuriously elicited L1 lexical candidates are not available for semantic integration in L2 speech comprehension.

Testing the dorsal stream attention hypothesis: Electrophysiological correlates and the effects of ventral stream damage	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Attention; Dorsal stream; Ventral stream; Visual orienting; Visual perception	SPATIAL CORRESPONDENCE; PERIPHERAL CUES; N2PC COMPONENT; ERP COMPONENTS; SHAPE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; SAMPLE	The roles of dorsal and ventral processing streams in visual orienting and conscious perception were examined in two experiments. The first employed high density EEG with source localization. The second comprised a neuropsychological case study. Visual orienting was assessed with an attention procedure, where peripheral letters cued participants towards a target location. In the perception procedure participants responded to the same letters by performing an explicit conscious discrimination. In Experiment 1, the peripheral letters elicited rapid dorsal stream activation in the attention procedure, and this activation preceded top-down enhancement of target processing in occipital cortex. In the perception procedure early ventral stream activation was seen. In addition, peripheral letters elicited an "early directing attention negativity" (EDAN) over parietal recording sites in the attention procedure, but not in the perception procedure. In Experiment 2, a patient with a bilateral ventral stream lesion but preserved dorsal stream function showed clear disruption to performance in the perception procedure, whilst exhibiting a normal visual orienting effect in the attention procedure. Taken together these findings (1) highlight the distinct roles of the dorsal and ventral streams in attention and perception, and (2) suggest how these streams might interact, via reentrant effects of attention on perceptual processing.

The sample comprised 30 healthy male subjects (mean perpendicular to SD: 25.3 perpendicular to 2.6 years), who were tested on nine study days in which they were exposed to three exposure conditions (sham, GSM 900 and WCDMA) in a randomly assigned and balanced order. All tests were presented twice (morning and afternoon) on each study day within a fixed timeframe. Univariate comparisons revealed significant changes when subjects were exposed to GSM 900 compared to sham, only in the vigilance test. In the WCDMA exposure condition, one parameter in the vigilance and one in the test on divided attention were altered compared to sham. Performance in the selective attention test and the n-back task was not affected by GSM 900 or WCDMA exposure. Time-of-day effects were evident for the tests on divided and selective attention, as well as for working memory. After correction for multiple testing, only time-of-day effects remained significant in two tests, resulting in faster reactions in the afternoon trials. The results of the present study do not provide any evidence of an EMF effect on human cognition, but they underline the necessity to control for time of day. Bioelectromagnetics 32:179-190, 2011.

The proposed algorithm combines the advantages associated with voltage-window count-based and event-based threshold-voltage detections. The result is an algorithm that is more tolerant to noise, dc offsets, baseline energy variations, and seconds-long nonseizure related sharp activities. In addition, only one parameter (one threshold voltage) needs to be optimized per patient, and for that, only one seizure per patient is used for training, making the process of optimizing the patient-specific detector a simple task. The time evaluation period when counting is performed is kept constant across all patients studied, and is fixed at 5 s in this work. A novel dual path digital signal processing unit in the back-end of the detector is included and is shown to decrease the detection latency by 14%. Experimental results on a printed circuit board using commercially available discrete components confirm the correct functionality of the proposed detector. The proposed algorithm achieves 100% sensitivity, 10.7 s average detection delay, and a single false alarm when evaluated on a total of 25 seizures and 24 nonseizure datasets of intracerebral electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings from five patients from the epilepsy monitoring unit of Notre-Dame Hospital in Montreal. In addition, monolithic integration of the overall system, including bio-amplification and comparison, is also carried out in a TSMC 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Simulations show that a static power dissipation of 7, 99% of which is consumed by the front-end bio-amplifier, is achieved, showing the potential of using the proposed seizure detector in a closed-loop brain-prosthesis device interface for seizure control and treatment.

This study tested these models by investigating the influence of task-directed effort, as manipulated by stimulus degradation, on interference control deficits in children with AD/HD. Twenty children with AD/HD aged between 7 and 14 years were matched in age to 20 controls and performed a modified visual Eriksen flanker task, while EEG and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded. Participants completed the task under three conditions varying in stimulus degradation: none, 30% or 60%. Results revealed a quadratic effect with improved task performance in the 30% degradation condition, relative to the other conditions. Overall, children with AD/HD showed a tendency towards increased errors and more variable responding, although this did not differ between conditions. Importantly, children with AD/HD showed no deficits in interference control at a behavioural level. SCL revealed reduced activity in the AD/HD group during the non-degraded condition which normalised to control levels in the highest degradation condition. ERPs revealed two functionally distinct N2 components, one of which, along with the P3, was larger to incongruent stimuli, consistent with previous studies linking this component to inhibitory processing. Atypical activation of these components was evident in children with AD/HD and occurred as a function of degradation condition. Taken together these findings suggest the role of other factors such as state regulation as underlying deficits in AD/HD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dopamine Transporter (DAT1) and Dopamine Receptor D4 (DRD4) Genotypes Differentially Impact on Electrophysiological Correlates of Error Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; PERSONALITY-TRAIT; ANTISACCADE TASK; NOVELTY SEEKING; ERP COMPONENTS; ADULT PATIENTS	Recent studies as well as theoretical models of error processing assign fundamental importance to the brain's dopaminergic system. Research about how the electrophysiological correlates of error processing-the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe)-are influenced by variations of common dopaminergic genes, however, is still relatively scarce. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether polymorphisms in the DAT1 gene and in the DRD4 gene, respectively, lead to interindividual differences in these error processing correlates. One hundred sixty participants completed a version of the Eriksen Flanker Task while a 26-channel EEG was recorded. The task was slightly modified in order to increase error rates. During data analysis, participants were split into two groups depending on their DAT1 and their DRD4 genotypes, respectively. ERN and Pe amplitudes after correct responses and after errors as well as difference amplitudes between errors and correct responses were analyzed. We found a differential effect of DAT1 genotype on the Pe difference amplitude but not on the ERN difference amplitude, while the reverse was true for DRD4 genotype. These findings are in line with predictions from theoretical models of dopaminergic transmission in the brain. They furthermore tie results from clinical investigations of disorders impacting on the dopamine system to genetic variations known to be at-risk genotypes.

Effects of adolescent ethanol exposure on event-related oscillations (EROs) in the hippocampus of adult rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Adolescent; Electroencephalogram; Ethanol; Event-related oscillations; Hippocampus; Rat	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; HUMAN BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; STIMULUS CHARACTERISTICS; DIZOCILPINE MK-801; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; S-TRANSFORM	Electrophysiological studies have shown that adolescent ethanol (EtOH) exposure can produce long-term changes in hippocampal EEG and ERP activity. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that event-related oscillations (EROs) may be good indices of alcoholism risk in humans, however, have not been evaluated for their ability to index the effects of EtOH exposure. The objective of the present study was to characterize EROs generated in hippocampus in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence. Adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 12 h/d for 10 days. A time-frequency representation method was used to determine delta, theta, alpha and beta ERO energy and the degree of phase variation in the hippocampus of adult rats exposed to EtOH and age-matched controls. The present results suggest that the decrease in P3 amplitudes, previously observed in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence, is associated with increases in evoked theta ERO energy. These studies suggest that EROs are suitable for characterizing the long-term effects of adolescent EtOH exposure. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between the mechanisms that regulate these neurophysiological endophenotypes and the consequences of adolescent EtOH exposure.

In the final stages of the disease, a BCI cannot rely on the visual modality. This study examined a method to achieve high accuracies using auditory stimuli only. Methods: We propose an auditory BCI based on a three-stimulus paradigm. This paradigm is similar to the standard oddball but includes an additional target (i.e. two target stimuli, one frequent stimulus). Three versions of the task were evaluated in which the target stimuli differed in loudness, pitch or direction. Results: Twenty healthy participants achieved an average information transfer rate (ITR) of up to 2.46 bits/min and accuracies of 78.5%. Most subjects (14 of 20) achieved their best performance with targets differing in pitch. Conclusions: With this study, the viability of the paradigm was shown for healthy participants and will next be evaluated with individuals diagnosed with ALS or locked-in syndrome (LIS) after stroke. Significance: The here presented BCI offers communication with binary choices (yes/no) independent of vision. As it requires only little time per selection, it may constitute a reliable means of communication for patients who lost all motor function and have a short attention span.

If it does, it might occur in our mind, or perhaps it may represent a snapshot of our early vision. An affirmative answer, one way or another, may affect our current understanding of this phenomena and potentially for related applications. How can we be sure about this in the psychophysical sense? We begin with the physiology of our brain's homeostasis, of which an isothermal equilibrium is characterized by the minimum of Helmholtz isothermal Free Energy: A = U - T0S >= 0, where T-0 = 37 degrees C, the Boltzmann Entropy S = KBIn(W), and U is the unknown internal energy to be computed. We assume that a pre-attentive recognition is effortless, meaning A approximate to 0 implying U = T0S, Q. E. D. We estimate the early brain vision processing space to be proportional to the size of a digital image. To illustrate the importance of foreground and background interaction by the thermodynamics principle, we further approximate a distant panoramic view of low-quality night vision imagery, in terms of sparse binary macro-pixel features of connected ones and zeros. Then, to estimate the brain energy U = T0S consumed in the early vision, we shall compute the entropy of the image. According to Boltzmann, the entropy is a logarithmic function of the phase space W, which are the combinatorial choices to realize the macroscopic condition. We have obtained W proportional to N!/(P-0!P-1!P-2!...), where the total number of macro-pixels N = P-0+P-1+P-2+ for the i(th) class of macro-pixels (i = 0, 1, 2, respectively for zero, single ones, paired ones). Besides occlusion, a natural physical interaction is shadowing, which when viewed, may form paired macro-pixels; ones from the foreground while others are from the background. By computing the entropy reduction due to shadowing which creates a new class of macro-pixels, e. g. edge elements, entropy is decreased as given a constant total number of pixels N, the number of classes, P-i, increases in the denominator of W = N!/(P-0!P-1!P-2!..).. We have explicitly computed the entropy and demonstrated indeed that the existence of a physical interaction between foreground and background reduces the thermodynamic energy consumed for early vision. Furthermore, we theorized "aha" could be due to the interaction between background and foreground happening at effortless early vision minimum free energy. Therefore, we mathematically map the well-known physiology "Ganglion response function," namely the Hubel-Wiesel early vision edge map, DoG Laplacian paradigm, or Mexican hat wavelets, into two parameters: (i) the contrast between the foreground ( F) and the background ( B): -2 <= alpha I-F - I-B/(I) over bar <= 2, where the mean intensity (I) over bar = I-F - I-B/2 gives the extra factor 2; as well as (ii) the celebrated Herman Haken phase transition base on a nonlinear Hooke's spring constant beta > 0. As a result, we have also proved that disambiguated vision can happen as an instantaneous phase transition without invoking associative memory at the Hippocampus. It seems that this phase transition happens at the early vision of our retinas, then by the LGN, where both optic nerves converge in the middle of brain. We have demonstrated the effortless phenomenon of an "aha" discovery may happen at this early visual stage, rather than the conventionl EEG confirmed " event evoked potential" P300 (meaning: 300 ms=0.3 second time spent of neuro-response across the whole brain). A realistic neuropsychology vision experimentation should be conducted based on available high-resolution EEG devices (in non-interference fashion utilizing a wireless head-mount baseball cap) to determine exactly where the " see-no-see" response happen in the brain, and whether it is ahead of the P300 event or not. Without IRB for EEG human subjects, therefore, a preliminary non-invasive vision test has explored with encouraging results through an Internet based delivery system.

The rationale was that areas playing a crucial role in arithmetic fact retrieval should show a systematic increase of activation with increasing retrieval effort. To achieve this goal, we utilized the problem-size effect as this is known to be systematically related to retrieval effort. In contrast to many previous studies, we here took a parametric approach to account for the continuous increase of retrieval effort with problem size. BOLD signals were modeled with problem size as parametric regressor and negative slow waves of the EEG were categorized into six levels of problem size. The fMRI data showed that activation in the angular gyrus and ACC/SMA increased parametrically with problem size. The ERP data showed a systematic amplitude increase with increasing problem size, especially at fronto-central electrodes. Consistent with the fMRI data, source modeling localized this effect to the ACC. While these findings support previous notions about the crucial role of the angular gyrus during fact retrieval, they also provide evidence that the medial frontal cortex is involved when single-digit multiplications are solved. Thus, both parietal and frontal structures seem to be integral parts of a system that enables and controls arithmetic fact retrieval. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 51-59, 2011. (C) 2010Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Dietrich, A; Kanso, R				Dietrich, Arne; Kanso, Riam			A Review of EEG, ERP, and Neuroimaging Studies of Creativity and Insight	PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Review						art; divergent thinking; music; right brain; prefrontal cortex	DIVERGENT-THINKING; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VERBAL CREATIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION; FMRI	Creativity is a cornerstone of what makes us human, yet the neural mechanisms underlying creative thinking are poorly understood. A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight. Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation. These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity. A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance, except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal areas. Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated with specific neurocognitive processes.

Visual search paradigms have provided evidence for the enhanced capture of attention by threatening faces. In two EEG experiments, we sought to determine whether the detection of threat requires complete faces or salient features underlying the facial expression. Measuring the N2pc component as an electrophysiological indicator of attentional selection we investigated participants searching for either a complete discrepant schematic threatening or friendly face within an array of neutral faces, or single features (eyebrows and eyes vs. eyebrows) of threatening and friendly faces. Threatening faces were detected faster compared to friendly faces. In accordance, threatening angry targets showed a more pronounced occipital N2pc between 200 and 300 ms than friendly facial targets. Moreover, threatening configurations, were detected more rapidly than friendly-related features when the facial configuration contained eyebrows and eyes. No differences were observed when only a single feature (eyebrows) had to be detected. Threatening-related and friendly-related features did not show any differences in the N2pc across all configuration conditions. Taken together, the findings provide direct electrophysiological support for rapid prioritized attention to facial threat, an advantage that seems not to be driven by low level visual features.

Relationships between pre-stimulus gamma power and subsequent P300 and reaction time breakdown in schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Schizophrenia; P300; Gamma power; Reaction time	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BAND ACTIVITY; ANTICIPATORY ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; GESTALT PERCEPTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; MEMORY TASK; DUAL-TASK; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Introduction: Little is known about the relationship between gamma-band oscillations prior to the arrival of a target stimulus and subsequent sensory processing and response execution. Although schizophrenia has been associated with abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations, P300, and reaction time (RI), few studies have examined the possible correspondence between these three neurobiological and behavioral markers in schizophrenia. To characterize the relationship between preparatory processes, information processing, and subsequent behavioral performance in schizophrenia, the present study investigated the relationships between pre-stimulus gamma-band power, RI and P300 amplitude. Methods: EEG and behavioral data were collected from 18 schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy controls during a conventional auditory oddball task. Results: In controls, single-trial pre-stimulus gamma power was positively correlated with RI, and average P300 amplitude was positively correlated with average pre-stimulus gamma power. Discussion: We interpret these findings as evidence that gamma power enhancement reflects a state of greater pre-stimulus preparation resulting in fuller evaluation of the target stimulus and therefore slower RT, as proposed by Jokeit and Makeig (1994). Consistent with previous research, schizophrenia patients exhibited RI slowing and P300 amplitude reductions relative to controls. Importantly, neither RI nor P300 amplitude was related to pre-stimulus gamma power in schizophrenia, suggesting a breakdown in the preparatory brain state critical for stimulus processing and later motor execution. The present findings underscore the behavioral significance of gamma-band responses, and provide an additional link between gamma-band oscillations and information processing abnormalities in schizophrenia.

The Role of the Cingulate Cortex as Neural Generator of the N200 and P300 in a Tactile Response Inhibition Task	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						inhibition; nogo; N200; P300; anterior cingulated; source analysis; ACC; generator; EEG; stop	INFERIOR FRONTAL JUNCTION; STOP-SIGNAL; ERP COMPONENTS; GO/NO-GO; PERFORMANCE; INTERFERENCE; DISSOCIATION; METAANALYSIS; INVOLVEMENT; RESOLUTION	Both the N200 and P300, which are, for example, evoked by Go/Nogo or Stop-Signal tasks, have long been interpreted as indicators for inhibition processes. Such interpretations have recently been challenged, and interest in the exact neural generators of these brain responses is continuously growing. Using recent methodological advancements, source estimations for the N200 and P300 as evoked by a tactile response inhibition task were computed. Current density reconstructions were also calculated accounting for interindividual differences in head geometry by incorporating information from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. To ease comparability with relevant paradigms, the task was designed to mimic important characteristics of both Go/Nogo and Stop-Signal tasks as prototypes for a larger set of paradigms probing response inhibition. A network of neural generators was revealed, which has previously been shown to act in concert with executive control processes and thus is in full agreement with observations from other modalities. Importantly, a spatial segregation of midcingulate sources was observed. Our experimental data indicate that a left anterior region of the midcingulate cortex (MCC) is a major neural generator of the N200, whereas the midcingulate generator of the P300 is located in the right posterior MCC. Analyses of the P300 also revealed several areas, which have previously been associated with motor functions, for example, the precentral region. Our data clearly suggest a neuroanatomical and therefore also functional dissociation of the N200 and P300, a finding that cannot easily be provided by other imaging techniques.

In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A Strong negative Correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400-450 ms), (ii) beta band (14-30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.

Whereas alpha is an ongoing process, the P1 is the manifestation of an event-related process. It is suggested that alpha and the P1 reflect inhibition that is effective during early access to a complex knowledge system (KS). Most importantly, inhibition operates in two different ways. In potentially competing and task irrelevant networks, inhibition is used to block information processing. In task relevant neural networks, however, inhibition is used to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) by enabling precisely timed activity in neurons with a high level of excitation but silencing neurons with a comparatively low level of excitation. Inhibition is increased to modulate the SNR when processing complexity and network excitation increases and when certain types of attentional demands such as top down control, expectancy or reflexive attention increase. A variety of findings are reviewed to demonstrate that they can well be interpreted on the basis of the suggested theory. One interesting aspect thereby is that attentional benefits (reflected e.g., by a larger P1 for attended as compared to unattended items at contralateral sites) and costs (reflected e.g., by a larger PI. at ipsilateral sites) can both be interpreted in terms of inhibition. In the former case an increased P1 is associated with a more effective processing of the presented item (due to an inhibition modulated increase in SNR), in the latter case, however, with a suppression of item processing (due to inhibition that blocks information processing).

No Evidence for Early Modulation of Evoked Responses in Primary Visual Cortex to Irrelevant Probe Stimuli Presented during the Attentional Blink	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN; CONSCIOUSNESS; POTENTIALS; STRIATE; EVENTS; AREAS; SUPPRESSION; COMPONENTS; SELECTION; NETWORK	Background: During rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), observers often miss the second of two targets if it appears within 500 ms of the first. This phenomenon, called the attentional blink (AB), is widely held to reflect a bottleneck in the processing of rapidly sequential stimuli that arises after initial sensory registration is complete (i.e., at a relatively late, post-perceptual stage of processing). Contrary to this view, recent fMRI studies have found that activity in the primary visual area (V1), which represents the earliest cortical stage of visual processing, is attenuated during the AB. Here we asked whether such changes in V1 activity during the AB arise in the initial feedforward sweep of stimulus input, or instead reflect the influence of feedback signals from higher cortical areas. Methodology/Principal Findings: EEG signals were recorded while participants monitored a sequential stream of distractor letters for two target digits (T1 and T2). Neural responses associated with an irrelevant probe stimulus presented simultaneously with T2 were measured using an ERP marker - the C1 component - that reflects initial perceptual processing of visual information in V1. As expected, T2 accuracy was compromised when the inter-target interval was brief, reflecting an AB deficit. Critically, however, the magnitude of the early C1 component evoked by the probe was not reduced during the AB. Conclusions/Significance: Our finding that early sensory processing of irrelevant probe stimuli is not suppressed during the AB is consistent with theoretical models that assume that the bottleneck underlying the AB arises at a post-perceptual stage of processing. This suggests that reduced neural activity in V1 during the AB is driven by re-entrant signals from extrastriate areas that regulate early cortical activity via feedback connections with V1.

J	Wierda, SM; van Rijn, H; Taatgen, NA; Martens, S				Wierda, Stefan M.; van Rijn, Hedderik; Taatgen, Niels A.; Martens, Sander			Distracting the Mind Improves Performance: An ERP Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTENTIONAL BLINK; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; TASK; SELECTION; P3	Background: When a second target (T2) is presented in close succession of a first target (T1), people often fail to identify T2, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). However, the AB can be reduced substantially when participants are distracted during the task, for instance by a concurrent task, without a cost for T1 performance. The goal of the current study was to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of this paradoxical effect. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants successively performed three tasks, while EEG was recorded. The first task (standard AB) consisted of identifying two target letters in a sequential stream of distractor digits. The second task (grey dots task) was similar to the first task with the addition of an irrelevant grey dot moving in the periphery, concurrent with the central stimulus stream. The third task (red dot task) was similar to the second task, except that detection of an occasional brief color change in the moving grey dot was required. AB magnitude in the latter task was significantly smaller, whereas behavioral performance in the standard and grey dots tasks did not differ. Using mixed effects models, electrophysiological activity was compared during trials in the grey dots and red dot tasks that differed in task instruction but not in perceptual input. In the red dot task, both target-related parietal brain activity associated with working memory updating (P3) as well as distractor-related occipital activity was significantly reduced. Conclusions/Significance: The results support the idea that the AB might (at least partly) arise from an overinvestment of attentional resources or an overexertion of attentional control, which is reduced when a distracting secondary task is carried out. The present findings bring us a step closer in understanding why and how an AB occurs, and how these temporal restrictions in selective attention can be overcome.

Sleep: Learning and Memory	ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, VOL 3: P-Z			English	Article; Book Chapter							REM-SLEEP; PLASTICITY; ACTIVATION	Dendritic spines - Dendritic spines are contiguous with dendrites and continuously sense the local dendritic membrane potential. Majority of synapses in the central nervous system and almost all excitatory synapses in the hippocampus are at this specialized structure. These spines are small well-circumscribed biochemical compartments that localize proteins and signaling molecules to a specific postsynaptic compartment. Hippocampal theta rhythm - The theta rhythm consists of regular, sinusoidal oscillations of waves in the range of 5-8 Hz that normally appear in the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG). The appearance of the hippocampal theta rhythm in the EEG is one of the most prominent electrophysiological characteristics of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in mammals. Theta rhythm could also occur in the wake state when animals perform ecologically relevant species-specific behaviors. Theta waves are involved in the acquisition and processing of meaningful environmental information. Learning - Learning is an altered behavioral and/or individual neuronal response produced by the individual's experience with a novel environmental stimulus. Normally, to assess learning, participants are exposed to repeated acquisition experiences and progressive changes in performance are observed. This activity provides an acquisition curve - an assessment of learning as a function of acquisition trials and time. Traditionally, measuring behavioral performance has been a gauge of learning. More recently, evaluation of learning has been possible by direct examination of physiological and cellular changes in the brain (neuronal plasticity). The term learning has thus taken on a broader meaning that now includes observed cellular changes that can also be used as indices of learning. Such changes include any number of cellular and/or subcellular neuronal alterations that result in improved performance. Long-term potentiation (LTP) - LTP is an increase in synaptic excitability that persists for hours or more than days after the delivery of a few seconds of brief tetanic stimulus (100-500 Hz) to certain afferent pathways. LTP is now widely accepted as a neuronal model of memory. Memory - In the experimental neuroscience literature, a concept related to learning is memory (the ability of the organism to retain acquired information over a period of time). Learning is believed to include the process of forming memory (memory consolidation). Memory is believed to be a store of acquired information made more or less permanent by plastic changes in the brain's cellular structure at some level. In contrast, the philosopher and psychologist William James believed that there is a fine distinction between learning (explained as habits) and memory. He viewed memory as the conscious recollection of events and facts and this definition of memory still remains popular with many contemporary scientists and philosophers. There are different taxonomies for the classification of human and animal memory types. The most widely accepted taxonomy divides human memories first into declarative and nondeclarative, based on their accessibility to conscious recall, and then into finer and finer subdivisions of these categories. Memory trace - A subset of neuronal elements that exhibit the learning-training-induced plasticity essential for such learned behavior. P-wave generator - The P-wave generator is a collection of glutamatergic cells in the pons. P-wave generating cells discharge high-frequency (>500 Hz) spike bursts (3-5 spikes/burst) in the background of tonically increased firing rates (30-40 Hz) during the transition between nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep. These cells remain silent during wake and NREM sleep. P-wave generating cells project to the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, visual cortex, and many other regions of the brain known to be involved in memory processing. The P-wave in the rat is equivalent to the pontine component of the pontoeniculo-occipital (PGO) waves in other mammals.

Efficacy and Safety of Zopiclone and Eszopiclone in the Treatment of Primary and Comorbid Insomnia	GABA AND SLEEP: MOLECULAR, FUNCTIONAL AND CLINICAL ASPECTS			English	Article; Book Chapter							GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; LONG-TERM EFFICACY; DOUBLE-BLIND; DOSE-RESPONSE; COMPARATIVE TOLERABILITY; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY; PHYSICAL-DEPENDENCE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; NIGHTLY TREATMENT	Drug enantiomers with chiral factors exhibit different effects on pharmacological activity, metabolism, and toxicity in the human body, and thus may differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Many currently used medications in clinical practice are mixtures of enantiomers (racemates), and replacing existing racemates with single isomers has resulted in improved efficacy and/or safety profile of the racemic mixtures. This "chiral switch" allows the existing racemate to be switched to one of its isomers and provides a safer, better-tolerated, and more efficacious alternative medication. Since the introduction and widespread use of asymmetric synthesis and chiral separation technologies, as well as the publication of formal FDA guidelines, which encourage the development of chiral drugs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers have developed single-enantiomer drugs. Zopiclone [(R,S)-zopiclone] is a hypnotic, which has been available in countries outside the United States (US) for over 20 years, while eszopiclone (S-zopiclone) is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of racemic zopiclone, approved as a hypnotic in the United States in 2004. Both zopiclone and eszopiclone are pyrrolopyrazine derivatives of the cyclopyrrolone class, and are both active at GABA(A) receptors, whereas (S)-zopiclone has a relatively higher affinity and accounts for much of the action of racemic zopiclone. The hypnotic effects of zopiclone and eszopiclone have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials in healthy subjects and patients with insomnia. Both hypnotics are utilized in the management of insomnia in patients who either experience difficulty initiating sleep or are unable to maintain sleep through the night. Clinical studies utilizing zopiclone at a dose of 7.5 mg administered nightly have demonstrated the hypnotic's efficacy in reduced sleep onset latency, increased total sleep time, and a reduction in the number of night-time awakenings. In treating insomnia, 7.5 mg zopiclone nightly is at least effective as the benzodiazepine hypnotics, flurazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam, and midazolam, used at approved therapeutic doses. Trials with zopiclone administered for up to 6 weeks duration as well as EEG analysis of sleep parameters in a 17-week study have revealed no marked tolerance to the effects of the hypnotic. Additionally, studies with zopiclone have demonstrated that it does not have a high dependence potential or cause rebound insomnia, and does not cause significant next-day psychomotor impairment. In clinical trials, eszopiclone 2 mg and 3 mg in adults with chronic insomnia significantly improved subjective and objective sleep measures including improved sleep efficiency, sleep latency, total sleep time, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, number of nights awakened weekly, and quality and depth of sleep. In elderly patients, eszopiclone 2 mg was associated with significantly shorter sleep latency compared to placebo and significantly improved ratings of sleep quality and depth, wake time after sleep onset, sleep duration, and decreased cumulative number of naps. Long-term treatment of primary insomnia with eszopiclone for 6 months improved daytime functioning and health-related quality of life. In clinical trials of up to 12 months duration, eszopiclone 3 mg showed a sustained beneficial effect on sleep induction and sleep maintenance, was well tolerated, with no clinically significant evidence of tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependence noted. Nightly use of eszopiclone 3 mg did not impair next-day driving-related skills or measures of cognition relative to placebo. Randomized, double-blind trials have demonstrated that eszopiclone 3 mg administered once nightly for 4-8 weeks produced significantly greater improvements in measures of sleep induction and maintenance compared to placebo in patients with insomnia and comorbid conditions, as well as improvements in certain measures of the comorbid conditions compared to standard therapies alone. In 2005, eszopiclone was the first sedative hypnotic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the long-term management of chronic insomnia. Both zopiclone and eszopiclone appear to be well tolerated in short-term and in longer-term studies in nonelderly and elderly patients. Numerous studies performed on a self-reporting basis show the absence of serious adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials with both zopiclone and eszopiclone are unpleasant or bitter taste, headache, dizziness, and dry mouth.
