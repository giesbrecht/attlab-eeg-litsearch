Since researchers have difficulties with a suitable long-term storage and management of electrophysiology data the presented system helps them to increase both efficiency and effectiveness of their work by providing the means for the storage, management, search and sharing of EEG/ERP data. The requirements specification including the system context, system requirements, project scope, basic features, system users, and data formats and metadata structures are presented. The database structure is proposed; upload, download and interchange of EEG/ERP data and metadata using the web interface are described. The system architecture, used technologies and the final realization are described. Data and metadata search over the system and user accounts including system security management are also presented. Additional tools and structures as converters of data formats and semantic web ontology are mentioned.

Whereas these methods-when carefully applied-provide valid and reliable quality indices, they provide little insight into the processes underlying perception and judgment. In this paper, we analyze the performance of electroencephalography (EEG) for indicating different types of degradations in speech stimuli. We show that a certain EEG technique, event-related-potentials (ERP) analysis, is a useful and valid tool in quality research. Three experiments are reported which show that quality degradations can be monitored in conscious and presumably non-conscious stages of processing. Potential and limitations of the approach are discussed and lines of future research are drawn.

ANC is implemented through five versions of Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Methods A comparative study of the performance of PSO and its different versions such as constant weighted inertia PSO (CWI PSO), linear decay inertia PSO (LDI-PSO), constriction factors inertia PSO (CFI-PSO), nonlinear inertia PSO (NLI-PSO), and dynamic inertia PSO (DI-PSO) has been done. Fidelity parameters like signal to noise ratio (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and template ERP, and mean square error (MSE) are observed with varying range of particles and inertia weights. Results In this the results of two data sets, simulated ERP and real visual evoked potential (VEP) are compared. Fidelity parameters as well as quality (shape) of extracted ERP are determined with Kurtosis and skewness measures. Conclusions From the simulation results and comparative studies, it is found that that NLI and LDI version of PSO are most suitable for ANC for ERP filtering.

Our data comes from a motor task experiment where an ERP arises before the motor response of the participant to a stimulus. We consider models based on stationary and non-stationary kernel functions. The comparison is done based on two different criteria: model likelihood and model reaction time prediction. We show how models with high likelihoods do not necessarily perform well at predicting reaction time. The non-stationary kernel function achieved the best predictive performance.

Despite this large time span, surprisingly little is known about the early neural processing of taste perception. Here, we are providing a comprehensive and critical overview of over four decades of research, with a focus on the temporal dimension of cerebral taste processing in healthy humans. For this purpose, we review studies using techniques that permit a high temporal resolution, namely, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, ERP, and event-related magnetic fields (ERF). Our current knowledge of taste ERP is interpreted in the context of our understanding of other, nonchemical senses. Gaps in the existing literature are identified and discussed. Finally, we suggest directions for future investigations using gustatory ERP/ERF.

J	Engell, AD; Huettel, S; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; Huettel, Scott; McCarthy, Gregory			The fMRI BOLD signal tracks electrophysiological spectral perturbations, not event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ECoG; ERP; Gamma; Hemodynamic	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREAS; EEG	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are primary tools of the psychological neurosciences. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses. An early study by Huettel and colleagues found that the coupling of fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal (BOLD) and subdurally-recorded signal-averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) was not consistent across brain regions. Instead, a growing body of evidence now indicates that hemodynamic changes measured by fMRI reflect non-phase-locked changes in high frequency power rather than the phase-locked ERP. Here, we revisit the data from Huettel and colleagues and measure event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) to examine the time course of frequency changes. We found that, unlike the ERP, gamma-ERSP power was consistently coupled with the hemodynamic response across three visual cortical regions. Stimulus duration modulated the BOLD signal and the gamma-ERSP in the peri-calcarine and fusiform cortices, whereas there was no such modulation of either physiological signal in the lateral temporal-occipital cortex. This finding reconciles the original report with the more recent literature and demonstrates that the ERP and ERSP reflect dissociable aspects of neural activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In ERP applications, arithmetic mean (AM) is normally employed in processing the ERPs prior to ERP detection, whereas also other averaging methods might have beneficial properties. Fast ERP detection is essential, for example, in brain computer interfaces and during spine surgery. Thus, it is of interest to search for methods to aid in detecting ERPs with as few stimulus repetitions as possible. Here, noise reduction properties of AM, geometric mean (GM), and harmonic mean (HM) are demonstrated with simulations, and ERP processing by the three methods is illustrated by processing real visual evoked potentials (VEPs).

In the last few years, authors have demonstrated that there are neurophysiological alterations already in the prodromal period, before the development of psychosis. This makes them promising tools for predicting a future transition to psychosis. In this paper we review the latest studies using event-related potentials (ERP) in subjects clinically at high-risk of developing psychosis. We particularly focus in the P300, Mismatch-Negativity (MMN) and P50 paradigms, discussing the main findings, but also the limitations and challenges in electrophysiological studies in this population.

J	Hsu, YF; Waszak, F				Hsu, Yi-Fang; Waszak, Florian			Stimulus-classification traces are dominant in response learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Priming; Stimulus-response associations; Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERPs)	TIME-COURSE; REPETITION; BINDINGS; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; COMPONENTS; AMNESIA	Priming can reflect the stimulus-driven retrieval of output-related memory traces, commonly referred to as stimulus-response associations. The purpose of the current study was to investigate which aspects of the output exactly are preserved in these traces using electroencephalography (EEG). We orthogonally manipulated the repetition of action and classification whilst participants performed one of the two semantic tasks according to the cue. We found no evidence of stimulus-action associations but significant effects relevant to the retrieval of stimulus-classification associations in participants' accuracy and RT. Event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory analysis further revealed a classification-related modulation at around 200 ms after stimulus onset, which appeared much earlier than the one reported in previous studies. These classification effects possibly indicate the modification of memory traces which requires the dynamic interaction of temporal and frontal cortices. The finding of classification effects across behavioural and EEG data suggested that the formation of stimulus-classification traces is rather spontaneous and may be dominant in single trial stimulus-response binding.

Traditionally, time locking, or perfect timing, information between stimulus and EEG recordings have been crucial in locating the region of possible neural response. In reality, the stimulus' time information is usually unavailable and the latency of test subjects may not be constant (due to fatigue, concentration, interference, etc.). Therefore, new classification approaches that do not depend on stimulus' time information are needed. To tackle this problem, we firstly characterized the brain response pattern of the target event using the EEG data, in which the timing information is available. Then, based on the pattern, a sliding window was applied to the EEG recordings to detect possible target image response started from each individual location. Finally, the probability of a target image event appeared during an entire EEG recording epoch is estimated by summarizing all the possible locations. The results show that, for classification of EEG epochs of 5s, the approach we proposed can obtain a median area under ROC 0.96, a result that comparable to that with perfect stimulus time information.

The P3b event-related potential (ERP), evoked when an infrequent target stimulus is presented, indexes cognitive function and is typically compared across subjects' scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, the clustering of independent components (ICs) is superior to scalp-based EEG methods because it can accommodate the spatiotemporal overlap inherent in scalp EEG data. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; event-related mean power spectral changes) and inter-trial coherence (ITCs; event-related consistency of spectral phase) reveal a more comprehensive overview of EEG activity. Ninety-five subjects (56 MS patients, 39 controls) completed visual and auditory two-stimulus P3b event-related potential tasks and the PASAT. MS patients were also divided into CI and non-CI groups (n = 18 in each) based on PASAT scores. Data were recorded from 128-scalp EEG channels and 4 IC clusters in the visual, and 5 IC clusters in the auditory, modality were identified. In general, MS patients had significantly reduced ERSP theta power versus controls, and a similar pattern was observed for CI vs. non-CI MS patients. The ITC measures were also significantly different in the theta band for some clusters. The finding that MS patients had reduced P3b task-related theta power in both modalities is a reflection of compromised connectivity, likely due to demyelination, that may have disrupted early processes essential to P3b generation, such as orientating and signal detection. However, for posterior sources, MS patients had a greater decrease in alpha power, normally associated with enhanced cognitive function, which may reflect a compensatory mechanism in response to the compromised early cognitive processing.

However, currently not much is known about the temporal structure of number adaptation. In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to elucidate the time course of neural events in symbolic number adaptation. The numerical distance of deviants relative to standards was manipulated. In order to avoid perceptual confounds, all levels of deviants consisted of perceptually identical stimuli. Multiple successive numerical distance effects were detected in event-related potentials (ERPs). Analysis of oscillatory activity further showed at least two distinct stages of neural processes involved in the automatic analysis of numerical magnitude, with the earlier effect emerging at around 200 ms and the later effect appearing at around 400 ms. The findings support for the hypothesis that numerical magnitude processing involves a succession of cognitive events. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identification enhancement of auditory evoked potentials in EEG by epoch concatenation and temporal decorrelation	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potentials; Blind source separation; Epoch concatenation; Temporal decorrelation	BRAIN; RESPONSES; MEG; SEPARATION; ARTIFACTS; ALGORITHM	Event-related potentials (ERP) recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) are brain responses following an external stimulus, e.g., a sound or an image. They are used in fundamental cognitive research and neurological and psychiatric clinical research. ERPs are weaker than spontaneous brain activity and therefore it is difficult or even impossible to identify an ERP in the brain activity following an individual stimulus. For this reason, a blind source separation method relying on statistical information is proposed for the isolation of ERP after auditory stimulation. In this paper it is suggested to integrate epoch concatenation into the popular temporal decorrelation algorithm SOBI/TDSEP relying on time shifted correlations. With the proposed epoch concatenation temporal decorrelation (ecTD) algorithm a component representing the auditory evoked potential (AEP) is found in electroencephalographic data from an auditory stimulation experiment lasting 3 min. The ecTD result is compared with the averaged AEP and it is superior to the result from the SOBI/TDSEP algorithm. Furthermore the ecTD processing leads to significant increases in the signal-to-noise ratio (shape SNR) of the AEP and reduces the computation time by 50% if compared to the SOBI/TDSEP calculation. It can be concluded that data concatenation in combination with temporal decorrelation is useful for isolating and improving the properties of an AEP especially in a short duration stimulation experiment.

Atypical electrophysiological activity during pain observation in amputees who experience synaesthetic pain	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synaesthesia for pain; empathy for pain; phantom pain; electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED THETA; EEG-ALPHA; TOUCH SYNAESTHESIA; NEURAL PROCESSES; EMPATHY; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; OTHERS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	There are increasing reports of people experiencing pain when observing pain in another. This describes the phenomenon of synaesthetic pain which, until recently, had been primarily reported in amputees with phantom pain. In the current study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how amputees who experience synaesthetic pain process pain observed in another. Participants were grouped according to amputees who experience phantom and synaesthetic pain (n=8), amputees who experience phantom pain but not synaesthetic pain (n=10) and healthy controls (n=10). Participants underwent EEG as they observed still images of hands and feet in potentially painful and non-painful situations. We found that pain synaesthetes showed some reduced event-related potential (ERP) components at certain electrode sites, and reduced theta- and alpha band power amplitude at a central electrode. The finding of reduced ERP amplitude and theta band power may reflect inhibition of the processing of observed pain (e.g. avoidance/guarding as a protective strategy), and reduced alpha band power may indicate a disinhibition in control processes that may result in synaesthetic pain. These results provide the first documentation of atypical neurophysiological activity in amputees who experience synaesthetic pain when processing pain in another.

After mixed data is decomposed by Infomax ICA, independent component (IC) of ERP is automatically selected according to the standard deviation of fixed temporal pattern of IC, and applied in ERP reconstruction. Visual evoked potential extraction, used to confirm effectiveness of algorithm, can be obtained automatically after 6 trials on experimental data, and result of its Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) within the average of 205 trials (standard signal) is 0.9106. However, PCC of average result of 6 trials within standard signal is only 0.3066, demonstrating practical applicability of proposed method. This algorithm enhances objectivity of ERP extraction within several trials.

Such investigations have been limited, however, by quantifying only event-related potential peaks and/or broad frequency bands at limited scalp locations without considering possible mediating factors (e.g., baseline differences). Results from 64-sensor EEG collected in 180 age- and gender-matched participants reveal (i) accentuated prestimulus gamma oscillations and (ii) reduced P2 amplitudes and theta/alpha oscillations to S1 among participants with both SZ and BPP. Conversely, (iii) N1s in those with SZ to S1 were reduced compared to healthy volunteers and those with BPP, whereas (iv) beta range oscillations 200300?ms following S2 were accentuated in those with BPP but not those with SZ. Results reveal a pattern of both unique and shared neurophysiological phenotypes occurring within major psychotic diagnoses.

Although EEG measurements are suitable for infants, the method poses several challenges including setting up an infant-friendly, but interference-free lab environment and designing age-appropriate stimuli and paradigms. Certain specifics of infant EEG data have to be considered when deriving event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate cognitive processes in the developing brain. The present article summarizes the practical aspects of conducting ERP research with infants and describes how researchers typically deal with the specific challenges entailed in this work.

This paper presents several insights on the neural correlates of human visual perception by analyzing the neural correlates that result when humans view realistic images using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) image display paradigm. We propose an image information extraction model and examine the relationship between the brain evoked response - using event related potential (ERP) characteristics - and the level of difficulty for humans to detect targets as a function of both visual stimulus complexity and task difficulty. We develop a computational model to quantify subject performance and the difficulty of realistic stimuli. Our results show that: (1) more difficult trials produce less prominent ERP patterns, thus reducing the performance of machine-based ERP detection; (2) on average for the same behavioral performance level, a pair of ERP's extracted from two easy trials are more similar than a pair of ERP's from two hard trials; and (3) both stimulus and task difficulty are correlated with neural activity. Our findings indicate that, for dynamic tasks involved in visual information processing, the brain may allocate additional cognitive resources, such as attention, to a given visual stimulus, as the task and/or stimulus difficulty increases.				catherine.huang@intel.com; k.hild@ieee.org; pavelm@ohsu.edu; Santosh.Mathan@honeywell.com; erdogmus@ece.neu.edu							15	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2161-0363		978-1-4673-1026-0	IEEE INT WORKS MACH			2012														6	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering	BCY19					2022-08-02	WOS:000311966000057

Two channel electroencephalogram was analyzed with five subjects during simple string retrieval tasks using web browser with active eye movements, i. e., saccadic eye movements. After the saccadic eye movements the ERP signals were observed in target string retrievals, whereas not observed in standard string retrievals. The classification algorithm was applied and the average decoding performance of single-shot post-saccadic ERP could be 78.2% and 77.6% in recall and precision, respectively. The eye-tracking was also studied and the eye gaze points were confirmed to be on and around target strings when the ERP was elicited. This result suggests that the post-saccadic ERP with eye-tracking leads to a possibility of the use in the brain-computer interface for information retrieval.

Previous studies have shown that task-related information contained in event-related potential (ERP) components could discriminate two or three categories of object images. In this study, we investigated whether four categories of objects (human faces, buildings, cats and cars) could be mutually discriminated using single-trial EEG data. Here, the EEG waveforms acquired while subjects were viewing four categories of object images were segmented into several ERP components (P1, N1, P2a and P2b), and then Fisher linear discriminant analysis (Fisher-LDA) was used to classify EEG features extracted from ERP components. Firstly, we compared the classification results using features from single ERP components, and identified that the N1 component achieved the highest classification accuracies. Secondly, we discriminated four categories of objects using combining features from multiple ERP components, and showed that combination of ERP components improved four-category classification accuracies by utilizing the complementarity of discriminative information in ERP components. These findings confirmed that four categories of object images could be discriminated with single-trial EEG and could direct us to select effective EEG features for classifying visual objects.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS WITHOUT MINIMAL OR CLINICALLY-OVERT HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						attentional blink; cognitive functions; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; hepatic encephalopathy; liver cirrhosis	CRITICAL FLICKER FREQUENCY; WORKING PARTY; P300; DIAGNOSIS; AWARENESS; COMPONENT; TESTS	Liver cirrhosis is often accompanied by a spectrum of cognitive deficits, labelled hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The precise specification of cognitive impairment associated with HE has not been yet elucidated. The aim of this study was an attempt to examine cortical function in cirrhotic patients using EEG event-related potentials during a demanding task involving selective attention. We compared group of 30 patients with liver cirrhosis without minimal or overt HE with education-, age-and sex-matched 29 non-cirrhotic controls. Both groups performed an attentional blink (AB) task, which requires detecting and identifying two target characters in a longer series of rapidly and sequentially presented characters. EEG signals from 32 electrodes were measured and then analyzed in the paradigm of event-related potentials (ERP). Though the groups did not differ in the detection rate of the target stimuli, ERP waveforms revealed two group diffrences of component amplitudes. The first difference was related to the waveform amplitude within the 200-400 ms after first target in the right frontal region (frontocentral N2 component). Moreover, in patient group this amplitude positively correlated with the blood plasma level of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The second amplitude difference was observed in the midline parieto-occipital regions within the 400-600 ms after the first target (P3b component). The AB task and ERP analysis allowed to find differences in cortical functioning in cirrhotic patients even without overt cognitive deficits. Our finding demonstrates that liver dysfunction can influence cortical processing associated with detecting and categorizing stimulus change.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been successfully applied to event related electroencephalography (EEG) to decompose it into a sum of spatially fixed and temporally independent components that can be attributed to underlying cortical activity. A major problem in the application of ICA is the stability of estimated independent components. In this paper we exploited the split-half approach to assess component stability. We used different measures quantifying both phase and energy aspects of the ERP, in order to distinguish evoked from induced oscillations. We applied these measures to the stable independent components derived from a dataset of progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (PMCI) and elderly controls. We found reduced energy in the induced theta activity in PMCI subjects, in accordance with previous studies. In addition, PMCI subjects presented lower phase-locking values and diminished late alpha band energy in contrast to controls.

A visual "oddball" color identification task was performed while individuals' electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded. Approximate entropy (ApEn), a nonlinear measure, along with P300 latencies and amplitudes were used to analyze ERP data and compare these three groups. The patients with VD showed more complex ERP waveforms and higher ApEn values than did ECs while performing the visual task. It was further found that patients with VD showed reduced P300 amplitudes and increased latencies. The results indicate that patients with VD have fewer attention resources to devote to processing stimuli, lower speed of stimulus classification, and lower synchrony in their cortical activity during the response period. We suggest that ApEn, as a measure of ERP complexity, is a promising marker for early diagnosis of VD.

Familiar ERP components have been shown to reflect the phase shifting of oscillatory activity that is present in varying degrees before the event. Even with single trials, understanding the underlying neural activity may require methods of dealing with the spatial superposition of neural signals at the head surface electrodes. We conclude with an illustration in which the modulation of averaged ERPs by trait anxiety may be related to underlying sources of theta oscillations.

It relies on rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) and does not require precise eye gaze control. Existing BCI typing systems which uses event related potentials (ERP) in EEG suffer from low accuracy due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Henceforth, RSVP Keyboard (TM) utilizes a context based decision making via incorporating a language model, to improve the accuracy of letter decisions. To further improve the contributions of the language model, we propose recursive Bayesian estimation, which relies on non-committing string decisions, and conduct an offline analysis, which compares it with the existing naive Bayesian fusion approach. The results indicate the superiority of the recursive Bayesian fusion and in the next generation of RSVP Keyboard (TM) we plan to incorporate this new approach.

In the future, machine will be able to understand human intention and communicate with human even though there is no explicit expression such as speech, gesture, etc. In this study, a new experiment design is proposed to understand human intention by using electroencephalography (EEG). Two types of stimulus are given to the subjects; affirmative and negative sentences. Each sentence was separated by two blocks which are contents and sentence end. Subjects were asked to make a decision of agreement or disagreement after sentence end is shown. Based on the EEG analysis, intention to the sentences was found while seeing contents, i.e., before giving an explicit answer. It is shown that decision making is done before the end of the sentence, and answering "Yes" or "No" is determined only up to the sentence end. This study shows the relationship of implicit intention and average event-related potentials (ERPs) at the frontal sites and how to predict implicit intention based on the central frontal ERPs using support vector machine (SVM).

BASIS Team	Novel Machine Learning Methods for ERP Analysis: A Validation From Research on Infants at Risk for Autism	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACES; VARIABLE SELECTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PREDICTION ERROR; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION	Machine learning and other computer intensive pattern recognition methods are successfully applied to a variety of fields that deal with high-dimensional data and often small sample sizes such as genetic microarray, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and, more recently, electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The aim of this article is to discuss the use of machine learning and discrimination methods and their possible application to the analysis of infant event-related potential (ERP) data. The usefulness of two methods, regularized discriminant function analyses and support vector machines, will be demonstrated by reanalyzing an ERP dataset from infants (Elsabbagh et al., 2009). Using cross-validation, both methods successfully discriminated above chance between groups of infants at high and low risk of a later diagnosis of autism. The suitability of machine learning methods for the use of single trial or averaged ERP data is discussed.

THE PROCESSING BIAS FOR THREATENING CUES REVEALED BY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL AND EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATION ANALYSES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						threatening picture; processing bias; event-related potential; event-related oscillation; emotion	ATTENTIONAL BIAS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; ANGRY FACES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; TRAIT ANXIETY; THETA BAND; BRAIN; EMOTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION	The processing bias of threat is crucial for survival. However, the neurophysiological underpinnings of this bias are not fully understood. To contribute to a better understanding of the processing bias for threat, both event-related potential (ERP) and event-related oscillation (ERO) analyses were applied to the electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from subjects while performing a go/no-go variant of the dot-probe task. In the task, subjects responded to the infrequent target stimuli and didn't respond to the standard stimuli. Both target and standard stimuli were preceded by a bilateral picture pair [one emotional (threatening or pleasant) and one neutral] as an emotional cue. The behavioral data and the P1 elicited by standard stimuli didn't show any significant main effect or interaction. The mean amplitude of N1 was greater negative for threatening cues than pleasant cues with the most significant effect in the fronto-central region, indicating a processing bias for threat related to early attention processing. In addition, the theta synchronization was stronger for threatening cues than pleasant cues with significant effect in posterior regions, suggesting that the posterior theta synchronization reflects the evaluation of emotional significance of stimuli. Taken together, the ERP and ERO analyses provide some independent insights into the processing bias for threatening cues and illustrate this bias more comprehensively. (C) 2011 IBRO.

EEG-ERP phase dynamics of children in the auditory Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain dynamics; Event-related potentials; Orthogonal phase effects; Phase synchronisation; Auditory Go/NoGo task; Children	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODDBALL TASK; BRAIN DYNAMICS; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; STIMULUS ONSET; ADULTS	Using a child sample, we examined the effects of the phase of narrow-band electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at stimulus onset on the resultant event-related potentials (ERPs) in an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task with a fixed stimulus-onset asynchrony. We used FFT decomposition of the EEG at Cz to assess prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1 Hz bands from to 13 Hz) for each trial. From the cycle at stimulus onset, trials were sorted into four phases for each of the 13 frequencies. ERPs were derived for each of these from the raw EEG activity at the midline sites. ERP responses were analysed in the context of a simple conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). At a number of frequencies, crossing the traditional frequency bands, the predicted non-random occurrence of phase-defined brain states was confirmed. The preferred states of negativity and negative driving were each associated with more efficient stimulus processing, as reflected in latency and amplitude differences of the N1 and P3 ERP components. The present results confirm the existence of preferred brain states and their impact on the efficiency of brain dynamics involved in perceptual and cognitive processing, and extend their occurrence from adults to children.

Feasibility of measuring Event Related Desynchronization with Electroencephalography during Walking	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			MOTOR IMAGERY; MU-RHYTHM; EEG; TREADMILL; GAIT	Brain Computer Interfaces could be useful in rehabilitation of movement, perhaps also for gait. Until recently, research on movement related brain signals has not included measuring electroencephalography (EEG) during walking, because of the potential artifacts. We investigated if it is possible to measure the event Related Desynchronization (ERD) and event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) during walking. Six subjects walked on a treadmill with a slow speed, while EEG, electromyography (EMG) of the neck muscles and step cycle were measured. A Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) was used to remove EMG artifacts from the EEG signals. It was shown that this method correctly deleted EMG components. A strong ERD in the mu band and a somewhat less strong ERD in the beta band were found during walking compared to a baseline period. Furthermore, lateralized ERSPs were found, depending on the phase in the step cycle. It is concluded that this is a promising method to use in BCI research on walking. These results therefore pave the way for using brain signals related to walking in a BCI context.

However, the specific mechanism of ERP generation is still unclear. In this study, pulse and noise-type visual stimuli were administered to subjects. Then the phase response of the EEG in a-waves was analyzed. The magnitudes of the phase response were found to vary with the stimulus administered phase and no power increase was observed. These results indicate that the ERP in a-waves is generated by phase resetting of brain activity. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present data from two affective picture-viewing tasks comparing event-related potential (ERP) modulation effects when emotional information is present but not task relevant (Task 1) followed by a condition directing attention to the categorization of emotional content (Task 2). Controls show a robust, persistent ERP positivity (200900?ms) associated with emotional target photos compared to neutral targets in both tasks. Individuals with psychopathy only showed this differentiation when explicitly attending to the emotional content of the photos (Task 2), and these effects remained smaller than the amplitude differences demonstrated by controls. Although abnormal allocation of attention may play a critical role, this cannot completely account for emotional processing deficits associated with psychopathy.

ERP analyses comparing children who switched flexibly (passed) to those who perseverated on post-switch trials (failed) focused on the N2 component, which was maximal over fronto-central sites. N2 amplitude was smaller (less negative) for children who passed the DCCS than for children who failed, suggesting that the N2, often associated with conflict monitoring, may serve as a neural marker of individual differences in executive function.

To increase classification accuracy, it is thus crucial to identify discriminant spatio-temporal features. This paper presents a method for analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics associated with Event related Potentials (ERPs). First, a resampling procedure based on Global Field Power (GFP) extracts temporal features. Second, a spatially weighted SVM (sw-SVM) is used to learn a spatial filter optimizing the classification performance for each temporal feature. Third, the so-obtained ensemble of sw-SVM classifiers are combined using a weighted combination of all sw-SVM outputs. Results indicate that the inclusion of temporal features provides useful insight regarding classification performance and physiological understanding. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial attention boosts short-latency neural responses in human visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERPs; EEG synchrony; Spatial attention; Theta; Alpha	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG; DYNAMICS; INHIBITION	In a previous study of visual-spatial attention, Martinez et al. (2007) replicated the well-known finding that stimuli at attended locations elicit enlarged early components in the averaged event-related potential (ERP), which were localized to extrastriate visual cortex. The mechanisms that underlie these attention-related ERP modulations in the latency range of 80-200 ms, however, remain unclear. The main question is whether attention produces increased ERP amplitudes in time-domain averages by augmenting stimulus-triggered neural activity, or alternatively, by increasing the phase-locking of ongoing EEG oscillations to the attended stimuli. We compared these alternative mechanisms using Morlet wavelet decompositions of event-related EEG changes. By analyzing single-trial spectral amplitudes in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands, which were the dominant frequencies of the early ERP components, it was found that stimuli at attended locations elicited enhanced neural responses in the theta band in the P1 (88-120 ms) and N1 (148-184 ms) latency ranges that were additive with the ongoing EEG. In the alpha band there was evidence for both increased additive neural activity and increased phase-synchronization of the EEG following attended stimuli, but systematic correlations between pre- and post-stimulus alpha activity were more consistent with an additive mechanism. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date in humans that short-latency neural activity elicited by stimuli within the spotlight of spatial attention is boosted or amplified at early stages of processing in extrastriate visual cortex.

In respect of eating disorders, in the 1950s a new line of study about the neurological bases of anorexia nervosa was started and has since been developed. The purpose of this review is to update the existing literature data on the main findings in respect of EEG in eating disorders by means of a search conducted in PubMed. Despite the fact that weight gain tends to normalize some brain dysfunctions assessed by means of EEG, the specific effect of gaining weight remains controversial. Different studies have reported that cortical dysfunctions can be found in patients with anorexia nervosa even after weight gain, whereas others have reported a normalization of EEG in respect of the initial reduced alpha/increased beta power in those patients with refeeding. Findings of studies that have analyzed the possible relationship between eating disorders and depression, based on sleep EEG disturbances, do not support the idea of eating disorders as a variant of depression or affective disorders. Some EEG findings are very consistent with previous neuroimaging results on patients with anorexia nervosa, reporting neural disturbances in response to stimuli that are relevant to the pathology (eg, stimuli like food exposure, different emotional situations, or body images).

To investigate how noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals correlate with intended movement directions in the PPC, this study recorded whole-head EEG during a delayed saccade-or-reach task and found direction-related changes in both event-related potentials (ERPs) and the EEG power in the theta and alpha bands in the PPC. Single-trial (left versus right) classification using ERP and EEG spectral features prior to motor execution obtained an average accuracy of 65.4% and 65.6% respectively on 10 subjects. By combining the two types of features, the classification accuracy increased to 69.7%. These results show that ERP and EEG spectral power modulations contribute complementary information to decoding intended movement directions in the PPC. The proposed paradigm might lead to a practical brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding movement intention of individuals.

Most existing classification methods for P300-based BCIs extract features based on temporal structure related to P300 components of event-related potentials (ERPs). Some others exploit the spatial distribution of ERPs optimally selected by recursive channel elimination. However, none of them employed multilinear structures which exploit hidden features in P300-based BCI data. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method based on tensor decomposition for ERP-based BCIs. The method seeks an optimal feature subspace simultaneously spanned by temporal and spatial bases, and additional bases which indicate a variant of ERPs obtained by different degrees of polynomial fittings. The proposed method has been evaluated by both the BCI competition III data set II and the affective face driven paradigm data set, and achieved 92% and 95% classification accuracies respectively, which were better than those of most existing P300-based BCI algorithms.

We created a highly salient social hierarchy based on the performance of a simple time estimation task. Subjects could achieve high, middle or low status while performing this task simultaneously with other two players who were either higher or lower in status. Subjects received feedback on their own performance, as well as on the performance of the other two players simultaneously. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from all three participants. The results showed that medial frontal negativity (an event-related potential reflecting performance evaluation) was significantly enhanced for low-status subjects. Implications for status-related differences in goal-directed behaviour are discussed.	[Boksem, Maarten A.

Correlation between single-trial visual evoked potentials and the blood oxygenation level dependent response in simultaneously recorded electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						electroencephalography; visual evoked potential; functional magnetic resonance imaging; alpha power	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; FMRI; ARTIFACT; DYNAMICS	To compare different electroencephalography (EEG)-based regressors and their ability to predict the simultaneously recorded blood oxygenation level dependent response during blocked visual stimulation, simultaneous EEGfunctional magnetic resonance imaging in 10 healthy volunteers was performed. The performance of different single-trial EEG regressors was compared in terms of predicting the measured blood oxygenation level dependent response. The EEG-based regressors were the amplitude and latency of the primary positive (P1) and negative (N2) peaks of the visual evoked potential, the combined P1N2 amplitude, and the alpha power. Apart from peak latencies, all regressors showed significant positive or negative correlation with the blood oxygenation level dependent response in visual cortex. In addition, several EEG-based regressors were found to predict blood oxygenation level dependent variations in different occipital and extraoccipital cortical areas not explained by the boxcar regressor. The results suggest that the P1N2 regressor is the best EEG-based regressor to model the visual paradigm, but when looking for additional effects like habituation or attention modulation that cannot be modeled by the boxcar regressor, it is better to include regressors based on individual peaks or alpha power.

Three participants are asked to visualize these shapes. During visualization, a 14-channel neuroheadset is used to record electroencephalogram (EEG) signals along the scalp. The EEG recordings are then averaged to increase the signal to noise ratio which is referred to as an event related potential (ERP). Every possible subsequence of each ERP signal is analyzed in an attempt to determine a time series which is maximally representative of a particular class. These time series are referred to as shapelets and form the basis of our classification scheme. After implementing a voting technique for classification, an average classification accuracy of 60% is achieved. Compared to naive classification rate of 33%, we determine that the shapelets are in fact capturing features that are unique in the ERP representation of a unique class.

Improvements in quantitative EEG following consumption of a natural citicoline-enhanced beverage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION			English	Article						citicoline; EEG; nutrition; attention; functional beverage	ENERGY DRINK CONSUMPTION; ATTENTION; CAFFEINE	The present study examined the impact of a taurine-free drink enhanced with citicoline and other natural ingredients on electrophysiological markers of mental alertness. Ten healthy adult participants enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study and were randomized to receive either placebo or the citicoline supplement on the first visit. Measures of electrical brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) were collected 30 min after consuming the beverage. Seven days after the initial assessment participants completed the alternative condition (placebo or citicoline beverage). Compared to placebo, significant improvements were found in frontal alpha EEG and N100 event related potentials (ERP) associated with the citicoline-enhanced supplement. These preliminary findings suggest that a novel brain drink containing compounds known to increase choline in the brain significantly improved attention as measured by ERP and EEG. These findings suggest that a viable and alternative brain supplement without potential compounds such as taurine may augment attentional mechanisms in healthy individuals.

The desire to communicate remains one of the primary issues for people with locked-in syndrome (LIS). While many assistive and augmentative communication systems that use various physiological signals are available commercially, the need is not satisfactorily met. Brain interfaces, in particular, those that utilize event related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the intent of a person noninvasively, are emerging as a promising communication interface to meet this need where existing options are insufficient. Existing brain interfaces for typing use many repetitions of the visual stimuli in order to increase accuracy at the cost of speed. However, speed is also crucial and is an integral portion of peer-to-peer communication; a message that is not delivered timely often looses its importance. Consequently, we utilize rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in conjunction with language models in order to assist letter selection during the brain-typing process with the final goal of developing a system that achieves high accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper presents initial results from the RSVP Keyboard system that is under development. These initial results on healthy and locked-in subjects show that single-trial or few-trial accurate letter selection may be possible with the RSVP Keyboard paradigm.

Systematic biases in early ERP and ERF components as a result of high-pass filtering	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						ERP; ERF; High-pass filtering; Data processing; C1	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; DYNAMICS; STRIATE; LOAD; V1; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	The event-related potential (ERP) and event-related field (ERF) techniques provide valuable insights into the time course of processes in the brain. Because neural signals are typically weak, researchers commonly filter the data to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. However, filtering may distort the data, leading to false results. Using our own EEG data, we show that acausal high-pass filtering can generate a systematic bias easily leading to misinterpretations of neural activity. In particular, we show that the early ERP component C1 is very sensitive to such effects. Moreover, we found that about half of the papers reporting modulations in the C1 range used a high-pass digital filter cut-off above the recommended maximum of 0.1 Hz. More generally, among 185 relevant ERP/ERF publications, 80 used cutoffs above 0.1 Hz. As a consequence, part of the ERP/ERF literature may need to be re-analyzed. We provide guidelines on how to minimize filtering artifacts. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Forty participants navigated through a virtual city and rated their sensation of being in the VR (experience of presence), while hearing frequent standard tones and infrequent deviant tones, which were irrelevant for the VR task. Different ERP components elicited by the tones were compared between participants experiencing a high level of presence and participants with a low feeling of presence in the virtual city. Early ERP components, which are more linked to automatic stimulus processing, showed no correlation with presence experience. In contrast, an increased presence experience was associated with decreased late negative slow wave amplitudes, which are associated with central stimulus processing and allocation of attentional resources. This result supports the assumption that increased presence is associated with a strong allocation of attentional resources to the VR, which leads to a decrease of attentional resources available for processing VR-irrelevant stimuli. Hence, ERP components elicited by the tones are reduced. Particularly, frontal negative slow waves turned out to be accurate predictors for presence experience. Summarizing, late ERPs elicited by VR-irrelevant tones differ as a function of presence experience in VR and provide a valuable method for measuring presence in VR. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Retest reliability of event-related potentials: Evidence from a variety of paradigms	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; COMPONENTS	Event-related potentials (ERPs) offer unparalleled temporal sensitivity in tracing the distinct electrocortical processing stages enabling cognition and are frequently utilized in clinical and experimental investigations, yet few studies have investigated their retest reliability. We administered a battery of typical ERP paradigms to elicit a diverse range of components linked to distinct perceptual and cognitive processes (P1, N1, N170, P3a, P3b, error-related negativity, error positivity, P400). Twenty-five participants completed the battery on two occasions, 1 month apart. Analysis of component amplitudes indicated moderate-to-strong split-half and strong test-retest reliability. Peak latency reliability varied substantially across components and ranged from weak to strong. We confirm that a range of prominent ERPs provide highly stable neurophysiological indices of human cognitive function.

Current neuroscientific research utilizes technologies that allow measurement of variables that are undetected by the tools typically used by behavior analysts. Data from a specific neuroscientific technique, event-related potential (ERP), suggest that emission of otherwise covert responses can be indexed and that such covert responses are sensitive to stimulus control and selection by consequences. The P3 ERP effect is proposed as indicative of emission. Moreover, ERP results in semantic priming experiments suggest that operants are sensitive to changes in stimulus control even when they are not emitted (latent responses). Changes in response strength of latent responses as a function of stimulus control can in fact be measured by reaction time data and an ERP dependent variable called the N400 effect. If the interpretations provided in this paper are accurate, an index of covertly emitted operants (P3 effect) constitutes experimental evidence suggesting the validity of a Skinnerian radical behaviorist perspective on behavior. Moreover, in a Skinnerian paradigm, measured fluctuations in the response strength of latent operants as a function of environmental changes (N400 effect) would validate Palmer's (2009) concept of the repertoire.

This phenomenon is called switch cost (SC). Researchers have recently used several kinds of task-switching paradigms to uncover neural mechanisms underlying the SC. Task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set have been reported to contribute to the cost of task switching. Methodology/Principal Findings: An unpredictable cued task-switching paradigm was used, during which subjects were instructed to switch between a color and an orientation discrimination task. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were recorded in 14 subjects. Response-stimulus interval (RSI) and cue-stimulus interval (CSI) were manipulated with short and long intervals, respectively. Switch trials delayed reaction times (RTs) and increased error rates compared with repeat trials. The SC of RTs was smaller in the long CSI condition. For cue-locked waveforms, switch trials generated a larger parietal positive event-related potential (ERP), and a larger slow parietal positivity compared with repeat trials in the short and long CSI condition. Neural SC of cue-related ERP positivity was smaller in the long RSI condition. For stimulus-locked waveforms, a larger switch-related central negative ERP component was observed, and the neural SC of the ERP negativity was smaller in the long CSI. Results of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for both ERP positivity and negativity showed that switch trials evoked larger activation than repeat trials in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Conclusions/Significance: The results provide evidence that both RSI and CSI modulate the neural activities in the process of task-switching, but that these have a differential role during task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set.

Since the evoked responses obtained by stimulation are much weaker than the continuous EEG signal, the correct signal analysis enhances stimulation-driven signal components. This paper proposes methods for event-related potential processing for BCIs based on matching pursuit. The suggested method is compared with other simple methods which are frequently used for feature extraction. A multilayer perceptron was used for classification. The results can be used to improve the feature extraction for BCI systems.

Here, we take advantage of this rich information at a single-trial level to decode stimulus-related signals in two event-related potential (ERP) studies. Our method models the statistical distribution of the voltage topographies with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which reduces the dataset to a number of representative voltage topographies. The degree of presence of these topographies across trials at specific latencies is then used to classify experimental conditions. We tested the algorithm using a cross-validation procedure in two independent EEG datasets. In the first ERP study, we classified left- versus right-hemifield checkerboard stimuli for upper and lower visual hemifields. In a second ERP study, when functional differences cannot be assumed, we classified initial versus repeated presentations of visual objects. With minimal a priori information, the GMM model provides neurophysiologically interpretable features - vis a vis voltage topographies - as well as dynamic information about brain function. This method can in principle be applied to any ERP dataset testing the functional relevance of specific time periods for stimulus processing, the predictability of subject's behavior and cognitive states, and the discrimination between healthy and clinical populations.

EEG signals related to the confidence level (uncertainty) of the subject about given responses remain to be clarified. Methods: Two discrimination tasks that create difficulty in stimulus processing and response selection stages of decision making were used. Conditions were certain-hit (hit trials where subjects were certain), certain-error (trials where subject was aware of the error), uncertain (trials where subject was uncertain). Analyzes of event-related potentials (ERP) (ERN, Pe, P3) in the time domain were extended by time-frequency analysis of both phase-locked and non-phase-locked oscillatory activities. Results: Errors caused by difficulty in stimulus processing led more uncertainty than the ones related to the response selection, and tended to elicit ERN with shorter latency. Each condition was discriminated from the others by at least one parameter. Uncertainty was discriminated by total theta activity following response, total delta activity following stimulus and mean P3 amplitude. Conclusions: Subjective confidence levels of decision making can be discriminated by time and time-frequency analyses of ERPs and EEG. Significance: Time-frequency parameters of EEG can be useful in the detection of subjective confidence in single-trials, which might be efficiently used for faster human-computer interaction.

The rapid image triage (RIT) system which is a human cognition guided computer vision technique is potentially a promising solution to the problem. In the RIT procedure, images are sequentially presented to a subject at a high speed. At the instant of observing a POI image, unique POI event-related potentials (ERP) characterized by P300 will be elicited and measured on the scalp. With accurate single-trial detection of such unique ERP. RIT can differentiate POI images from non-POI images. However, like other brain-computer interface systems relying on single-trial detection, RIT suffers from the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the single-trial ERP. This paper presents a spatio-temporal filtering approach tailored for the denoising of single-trial ERP for RIT. The proposed approach is essentially a non-uniformly delayed spatial Gaussian filter that attempts to suppress the non-event related background electroencephalogram (EEG) and other noises without significantly attenuating the useful ERP signals. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by both simulation tests and real RIT experiments. In particular, the real RIT experiments on 20 subjects show a statistically significant and meaningful average decrease of 9.8% in RIT classification error rate, compared to that without the proposed approach.

The differences in the direct event-related potentials (ERPs) and in the lateralized readiness potential between those categories were studied. The ERP correlates of recognition and access to semantic and lexical information were similar between K and TOT, but showed amplitude differences with respect to DK. A delayed onset of the response selection was obtained in TOT in comparison with K, suggesting an insufficient activation of phonological information from 360?ms onwards. The continuous search for the name and the conflict monitoring in TOT led to differences in ERP amplitudes between TOT and the other categories from 750?ms onwards as well as to a delayed onset of response preparation, indicating a continuous engagement of processing resources.

This study investigated the factors behind such age-related changes, using time-frequency analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). We hypothesized that brain rhythms was affected by age-related changes, which could be reflected in the ERP indices. An oddball task was conducted in two experimental groups, namely young participants (N = 15; mean age 23.7 +/- 2.8 years) and older participants (N = 15; mean age 70.1 +/- 7.9 years). Two types of stimuli were used: the target (1 kHz frequency) and standard (2 kHz frequency). We scrutinized three ERP indices: event-related spectral power (ERPSP), inter-trial phase-locking (ITPL), and event-related cross-phase coherence (ERP-COH). Both groups performed equally well for correct response rate. However, the results revealed a statistically significant age difference for inter-trial comparison. Compared with the young, the older participants showed the following age-related changes: (a) power activity decreased; however, an increase was found only in the late (P3, 280-450 ms) theta (4-7 Hz) component over the bilateral frontal and temporo-frontal areas; (b) low phase-locking in the early (N1, 80-140 ms) theta band over the parietal/frontal (right) regions appeared; (c) the functional connections decreased in the alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, but no difference emerged in the theta band between the two groups. These results indicate that age-related changes in task-specific brain activity for a normal aging population can be depicted using the three ERP indices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Non-conscious word processing in a mirror-masking paradigm causing attentional distraction: An ERP-study	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Non-conscious word processing; Reading; Attentional distraction; EEG; ERP; Phonology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; DUAL-ROUTE; RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE; ORTHOGRAPHY; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS	In this event-related potential (ERP) study a masking technique that prevents conscious perception of words and non-words through attentional distraction was used to reveal the temporal dynamics of word processing under non-conscious and conscious conditions. In the non-conscious condition, ERP responses differed between masked words and nonwords from 112 to 160 ms after stimulus-onset over posterior brain areas. The early onset of the word-non-word differences was compatible with previous studies that reported non-conscious access to orthographic information within this time period. Moreover, source localisations provided evidence for automatic activation of prelexical phonological information, whereas no evidence for non-conscious semantic processing was found. When subjects were informed about the masking technique, lexical differences occurred at later time intervals, suggesting conscious access to additional word related information. These results indicate that early visual word processing does not depend entirely on attentional resources, but that non-conscious processing probably is restricted to rather lower-level linguistic information.

J	Reed, P; Savile, A; Truzoli, R				Reed, Phil; Savile, Amy; Truzoli, Roberto			Event related potential analysis of stimulus over-selectivity	RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						Over-selectivity; Attention; Post-processing; ERP; EEG	NOVELTY; PARADIGM; CHILDREN; CUES; LOAD; AGE; P3	Stimulus over-selectivity is a phenomenon often displayed by individuals with many forms of developmental and intellectual disabilities, and also by individuals lacking such disabilities who are under cognitive strain. It occurs when only one of potentially many aspects of the environment controls behavior. Adult participants were trained and tested on a trial-and-error discrimination learning task, with a concurrent memory load task, and displayed over-selectivity. Participants brain responses were also monitored and analyzed using an electroencephalogram (EEG). The results demonstrated a significant difference between the event-related potentials generated to the over-selected and under-selected stimuli. Although there was no difference in the P300a wave between over- and under-selected stimuli, the P300b wave was associated with over-selected, but not under-selected stimuli. This finding suggests that, in this context, the under-selected stimulus did not elicit ERP activity typically associated with novelty, which, in turn, suggests that over-selectivity may not be entirely an attention-based effect.

Consistent with previous findings (e.g., Westwood, Heath, & Roy, 2003), memory-guided reaches undershot veridical target location to a greater extent than their visually guided counterparts. Analysis of the ERP data revealed that memory-guided reaches were associated with reduced potentials over medial-frontal cortex at target presentation and following movement onset. Further, we found that the amplitudes of the potentials over medial-frontal cortex for visually and memory-guided reaches were significantly correlated with the peak accelerations and decelerations of the reaching movements. Our results suggest that memory-guided reaches are mediated by a motor plan that is generated while a target is visible, and then stored in memory until needed-a result counter to recent behavioral theories asserting that memory-guided reaches are planned just before movement onset via a stored, sensory-based target representation.

This paper builds a basic framework using classification and an optimization model based on this framework for estimating event-related potentials. Then the SingleTrialEM algorithm is derived by introducing a logistic regression model, which could be obtained by training before SingleTrialEM is used, to instantiate the optimization model. The simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed method is correct and solid. The advantage of this method is verified by the comparison between this method and the Woody filter in simulation tests. Also, the cognitive test results are consistent with the conclusions of cognitive science.

Preserved reward outcome processing in ASD as revealed by event-related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Reward processing; Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; ERP; EEG; Feedback-related negativity; Medial-frontal negativity	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; SOCIAL-ANXIETY-SCALE; PREDICTION ERROR; CHILDREN; BRAIN; DOPAMINE; CONNECTIVITY	Background: Problems with reward system function have been posited as a primary difficulty in autism spectrum disorders. The current study examined an electrophysiological marker of feedback monitoring, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), during a monetary reward task. The study advanced prior understanding by focusing exclusively on a developmental sample, applying rigorous diagnostic characterization and introducing an experimental paradigm providing more subtly different feedback valence (reward versus non-reward instead of reward versus loss). Methods: Twenty-six children with autism spectrum disorder and 28 typically developing peers matched on age and full-scale IQ played a guessing game resulting in monetary gain ("win") or neutral outcome ("draw"). ERP components marking early visual processing (N1, P2) and feedback appraisal (FRN) were contrasted between groups in each condition, and their relationships to behavioral measures of social function and dysfunction, social anxiety, and autism symptomatology were explored. Results: FRN was observed on draw trials relative to win trials. Consistent with prior research, children with ASD exhibited a FRN to suboptimal outcomes that was comparable to typical peers. ERP parameters were unrelated to behavioral measures. Conclusions: Results of the current study indicate typical patterns of feedback monitoring in the context of monetary reward in ASD. The study extends prior findings of normative feedback monitoring to a sample composed exclusively of children and demonstrates that, as in typical development, individuals with autism exhibit a FRN to suboptimal outcomes, irrespective of neutral or negative valence. Results do not support a pervasive problem with reward system function in ASD, instead suggesting any dysfunction lies in more specific domains, such as social perception, or in response to particular feedback-monitoring contexts, such as self-evaluation of one's errors.

We describe a sequence of fixation-event related potentials (fERPs) that unfolds during similar to 400 ms following each fixation. This sequence highly resembles the event-related responses in a replay experiment, in which subjects kept fixation while a sequence of images occurred around the fovea simulating the spatial and temporal patterns during the free viewing experiment. Similar responses were also observed in a second control experiment where the appearance of stimuli was controlled by the experimenters and presented at the center of the screen. We also observed a relatively early component (similar to 150 ms) that distinguished between targets and distractors only in the freeviewing condition. We present a novel approach to match the critical properties of two conditions (targets/distractors), which can be readily adapted to other paradigms to investigate EEG components during free eye-movements.

EEG correlates of P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; MEMORY; COMMUNICATION; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; DEVICE; SIGNAL; ALPHA; HOME	The purpose of this study was to identify electroencephalography (EEG) features that correlate with P300-based brain-computer interface (P300 BCI) performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Twenty people with ALS used a P300 BCI spelling application in copy-spelling mode. Three types of EEG features were found to be good predictors of P300 BCI performance: (1) the root-mean-square amplitude and (2) the negative peak amplitude of the event-related potential to target stimuli (target ERP) at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, and P4; and (3) EEG theta frequency (4.5-8 Hz) power at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, P4, PO7, PO8 and Oz. A statistical prediction model that used a subset of these features accounted for >60% of the variance in copy-spelling performance (p < 0.001, mean R-2 = 0.6175). The correlations reflected between-subject, rather than within-subject, effects. The results enhance understanding of performance differences among P300 BCI users. The predictors found in this study might help in: (1) identifying suitable candidates for long-term P300 BCI operation; (2) assessing performance online. Further work on within-subject effects needs to be done to establish whether P300 BCI user performance could be improved by optimizing one or more of these EEG features.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as the oscillatory dynamics of the EEG signal, specifically, frequency power changes expressed as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S), were analyzed. Replicating earlier results, we found an N400 on semantically incongruent words, as well as on low doze probability words. For the bilinguals investigated in the present study, N400 latency in the low doze probability condition was found to be modulated by L2 proficiency, indicating that L2 proficiency in our sample might have influenced the speed of semantic integration. Relative Theta power increased for all three word conditions, but no influence of proficiency was observed. Different from the ERP results, we found a stronger increase in theta power for low doze probability words than for incongruent and high doze probability words, especially over temporo-parietal brain areas. The spatial distribution of the theta ERD/S results also differed from the N400 topography. Whereas the N400 showed a typical topography with a maximum over temporo-posterior electrode positions, the theta ERD/S topography was maximal for high and low doze probability words over left central-posterior electrode positions. These findings show that the ERP and ERD/S results are sensitive to semantic processing. The different pattern of the ERD/S results compared to the ERP results, functionally and with regard to topography, suggests that the ERD/S reflects a different aspect or stage of semantic processing, possibly the successful conceptualization of a sentence.

Brain-Computer Interface speller using hybrid P300 and motor imagery signals	2012 4TH IEEE RAS & EMBS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ROBOTICS AND BIOMECHATRONICS (BIOROB)	Proceedings of the IEEE RAS-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE RAS and EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob) / Symposium on Surgical Robotics	JUN 24-27, 2012	Rome, ITALY	IEEE, RAS, EMBS			CLASSIFICATION; EEG; BCI	In this paper we propose a fast brain computer interface speller based on electroencephalography (EEG). The slow performance of conventional BCI spellers is overcome by combining the fast motor evoked potentials (MEPs) with the accuracy of P300 event related potentials. The .mu rhythms associated with motor imagery are extracted using morlet wavalet based time-frequency analysis. Selected features were subsequently classified using minimum Mahalanobis distance. A hybrid MEP-P300 algorithm incorporating text prediction was proposed and experiments were conducted to gauge its accuracy and speed. Results show significantly faster performance when compared with conventional P300 spellers while comparable, but reduced accuracy was also noted.	[Roula, M.

These activities can be decoded by signal processing techniques, however, they are typically influenced by extraneous interference, like muscle movements, eye blinks, eye movements, background noise, etc. Therefore, a preprocessing step to remove artifacts is extremely important. This paper presents an effective artifact removal algorithm, based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Hierarchical Clustering. Our technique utilizes general temporal and spectral features and particular information about target Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) (e.g. the timing of N200 and P300 on inhibition task or the specific electrodes contributing to the ERPs) to separate ERPs and artifact activities. Our method considers templates for desired ERPs to select event-related components for signal reconstruction. In our experimental study, we show that our proposed method can effectively enhance the ERPs for all fifteen subjects in the study, even for those that barely display ERPs in the raw recordings.

We assessed whether multiple variables related to self-regulation (perceived mental effort) emotional states (e.g., anxiety, stress, etc.) and motivational states (e.g., boredom, engagement, etc.) may co-occur or interact with frontal attentional processing probed in two matched-samples of fourteen lower-SES and higher-SES adolescents. ERP and EEG activation were measured during a task probing selective attention to sequences of tones. Pre- and post-task salivary cortisol and self-reported emotional states were also measured. At similar behavioural performance level, the higher-SES group showed a greater ERR differentiation between attended (relevant) and unattended (irrelevant) tones than the lower-SES group. EEG power analysis revealed a cross-over interaction, specifically, lower-SES adolescents showed significantly higher theta power when ignoring rather than attending to tones, whereas, higher-SES adolescents showed the opposite pattern. Significant theta asymmetry differences were also found at midfrontal electrodes indicating left hypo-activity in lower-SES adolescents. The attended vs. unattended difference in right midfrontal theta increased with individual SES rank, and (independently from SES) with lower cortisol task reactivity and higher boredom. Results suggest lower-SES children used additional compensatory resources to monitor/control response inhibition to distracters, perceiving also more mental effort, as compared to higher-SES counterparts. Nevertheless, stress, boredom and other task-related perceived states were unrelated to SES. Ruling out presumed confounds, this study confirms the midfrontal mechanisms responsible for the SES effects on selective attention reported previously and here reflect genuine cognitive differences.

This paper proposes a novel speech discrimination assessment method using electroencephalograms (EEGs). The method utilizes event-related potentials (ERPs) to visual stimuli instead of the conventionally used auditory stimuli. A spoken letter is played through a speaker as an initial auditory stimulus. The same letter can then be visually displayed on a screen as a match condition, or a different letter is displayed (mismatch condition). The participant determines whether the two stimuli represent the same letter or not. The P3 component or late positive potential (LPP) component are elicited when a participant detects either a match or mismatch between the auditory and visual stimuli, respectively. The hearing ability of each participant can be estimated objectively via analysis of these ERP components.

Event-related potential studies, meanwhile, have focused on the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and the feedback negativity (FN) during reward anticipation and delivery, respectively. In anticipation of uncertain outcomes, we observed an increased SPN among Met homozygotes. We also observed an increased FN among Met homozygotes in response to outcome delivery, an effect that was driven primarily by an increased response to monetary gains. The COMT genotype moderates event-related potential responses during both the anticipation and delivery of uncertain reward, suggesting that the SPN and FN are sensitive to dopaminergically mediated and reward-related neural activity.

The recurrent processing hypothesis, a prominent theoretical account of perceptual awareness, states that, although stimuli might in principle evoke feedforward activity propagating through the visual cortex, stimuli that become consciously detected are further processed in feedforward-feedback loops established between cortical areas. To test this theory in the tactile modality, we applied dynamic causal modeling to electroencephalography (EEG) data acquired from humans in a somatosensory detection task. In the analysis of stimulation-induced event-related potentials (ERPs), we focused on model-based evidence for feedforward, feedback, and recurrent processing between primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. Bayesian model comparison revealed that, although early EEG components were well explained by both the feedforward and the recurrent models, the recurrent model outperformed the other models when later EEG segments were analyzed. Within the recurrent model, stimulus detection was characterized by a relatively early strength increase of the feedforward connection from primary to secondary somatosensory cortex (>80 ms). At longer latencies (>140 ms), also the feedback connection showed a detection-related strength increase. The modeling results on relative evidence between recurrent and feedforward model comparison support the hypothesis that the ERP responses from sensory areas arising after aware stimulus detection can be explained by increased recurrent processing within the somatosensory network in the later stages of stimulus processing.

In both studies, participants (Study 1, N = 26; Study 2, N = 56) were first recorded for baseline EEG to measure approach-related left frontal EEG activity. They then completed either the color-naming Stroop task (Study 1) or the Multi-Source Interference Task (Study 2) to measure error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that has been associated with aversive motivation and distress. In both studies, higher leftward frontal EEG asymmetry predicted reduced ERN amplitude. Hierarchical regression analyses of the separate frontal nodes that comprised the asymmetry score further showed that left frontal activity predicted reduced ERN amplitude whereas right frontal activity predicted greater ERN amplitude. Results have implications for understanding emotion and motivation and for understanding the personal resilience associated with approach motivated states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We use an acoustic oddball paradigm to compare the efficiency of RQA with a linear amplitude based analysis of single trial ERPs with regard to the power to distinguish responses to different tone types. We further probed the robustness of both analyses towards structured noise induced by parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: RQA provided robust discrimination of responses to different tone types, even when EEG data were contaminated by structured noise. Yet, its power to discriminate responses to different tone types was not significantly superior to a linear amplitude analysis. RQA measures were only moderately correlated with EEG amplitudes, suggesting that RQA may extract additional information from single trial responses not detected by amplitude evaluation. Conclusions: RQA allows quantifying signal characteristics of single trial ERPs measured with and without noise induced by parallel MRI. RQA power to discriminate responses to different tone types was similar to linear amplitude based analysis. Significance: RQA has the potential to detect differences of signal features in response to a standard oddball paradigm and provide additional trial-by-trial information compared to classical amplitude based analysis.

Electrophysiological investigations of brain function in coma, vegetative and minimally conscious patients	ARCHIVES ITALIENNES DE BIOLOGIE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Evoked related potential; Brain computer interface; Coma; Vegetative state; Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; Minimally conscious state; Locked in syndrome	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; LOCKED-IN-SYNDROME; P300 SPELLING SYSTEM; COMPUTER INTERFACE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BISPECTRAL INDEX; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; OWN NAME	Electroencephalographic activity in the context of disorders of consciousness is a Swiss knife like tool that can evaluate different aspects of cognitive residual function, detect consciousness and provide a mean to communicate with the outside world without using muscular channels. Standard recordings in the neurological department offer a first global view of the electrogenesis of a patient and can spot abnormal epileptiform activity and therefore guide treatment. Although visual patterns have a prognosis value, they are not sufficient to provide a diagnosis between vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) processes the data and retrieves features, not visible on the raw traces, which can then be classified. Current results using qEEG show that MCS can be differentiated from VS/UWS patients at the group level. Event Related Potentials (ERP) are triggered by varying stimuli and reflect the time course of information processing related to the stimuli from low-level peripheral receptive structures to high-order associative cortices. It is hence possible to assess auditory, visual, or emotive pathways. Different stimuli elicit positive or negative components with different time signatures. The presence of these components when observed in passive paradigms is usually a sign of good prognosis hut it cannot differentiate VS/UWS and MCS patients. Recently, researchers have developed active paradigms showing that the amplitude of the component is modulated when the subject's attention is focused on a task during stimulus presentation. Hence significant differences between ERPs of a patient in a passive compared to an active paradigm can be a proof of consciousness. An EEG-based brain-computer interface (BC!) can then be tested to provide the patient with a communication tool. BCIs have considerably improved the past two decades. However they are not easily adaptable to comatose patients as they can have visual or auditory impairments or different lesions affecting their EEG signal. Future progress will require large databases of resting state-EEG and ERPs experiment of patients of different etiologies. This will allow the identification of specific patterns related to the diagnosis of consciousness. Standardized procedures in the use of BCIs will also be needed to find the most suited technique for each individual patient.

Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), often referred to as concussion when it occurs in sports, produces persistent cognitive problems in at least 15% of patients. Unfortunately, conventional neuropsychological tests usually yield results within normal limits in this population. The main objective of this event-related potential (ERP) study was to understand brain functioning during the performance of a working memory (WM) task in patients who have sustained an MTBI, mostly due to motor vehicle accident or sports concussion. This study also aimed for a better understanding of the association between brain functioning as measured with ERP, behavioral performance on the WM task, postconcussion symptoms, type of injury (that is, sports concussion vs other types), and time since the injury. Methods. Forty-four patients with MTBI (7.6 +/- 8.4 months postinjury) were tested on a visual WM task with simultaneous recording of ERP, and were compared with 40 control volunteers who were their equivalent for age and sex. Amplitude and latency of frontal (N200 and N350) and parietal (P200 and P300) ERP waves were measured and were compared between groups. Correlation analyses were also performed between ERP characteristics, clinical variables, and behavioral performance. Results. A significant group difference was found for behavioral performance on the WM task, in which the MTBI group had a lower percentage of correct answers than the control group (p < 0.05). The patients with MTBI also had smaller amplitudes of both frontal N350 and parietal P300 ERP components when compared with control volunteers (p < 0.05). No changes were found for latency of ERP components. Smaller ERP amplitudes were associated with slower reaction times and worse accuracy on the WM task among patients with MTBI (p < 0.05). Types of injury (that is, sports concussion vs other mechanisms) were not associated with different ERP characteristics. Conclusions. Abnormal ERP results are observed in patients after MTBI or sports concussion, even for those in the nonacute stage after their injury. Current standard clinical evaluations most often fail to detect cerebral dysfunction after MTBI, even when patients or athletes report symptoms. Clinicians should be aware that patients with MTBI, including sports concussion, probably have underlying mild but persistent cerebral dysfunctions that require further investigation.

J	Memon, IA; Luhano, ML; Ansari, M				Memon, Irfan Ali; Luhano, Mohan Lal; Ansari, Moin			Electroencephalography Changes during Change Blindness Disorder	JOURNAL OF THE LIAQUAT UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Electroencephalography; approximate entropy; correlation dimension; event related potentials; change blindness		BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the process of recording electrical potentials produced by neurons in the brain. For understanding the neuro-physiological mechanism of various cognitive and neurological disorders, EEG has been proved a vital technique for many years. The change blindness which is incapability of brain to notice substantial visual changes is among such disorders. This study investigates the complexity in information process of EEG signals during the change blindness disorder using the two different measures called entropy and correlation dimension functions. METHODS: The EEG data of change blindness disorder was recorded from 22 subjects while they were performing change detection and change blindness trials for two types of stimuli. These were (1) single stimulus followed by another matching stimulus, (2) single stimulus followed by another non-matching stimulus. The measure of complexity in recorded EEG was estimated using both correlation dimension and approximate entropy functions. RESULTS: The results have shown significant decrease in values of approximate entropy and correlation dimension at frontal position of electrodes for change blindness trials. CONCLUSION: The neurophysiological implication of these results provide the possibility that the increase of brain complexity, which can be interpreted as increase of information process and integration, was not sustained in frontal position of brain during the change blindness disorder.

A physiological method of measuring dog cognitive processing would be instructive and could complement behavioural response. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used in humans to study stimulus processing, which results in waveforms called event-related potentials (ERPs). One ERP component, mismatch negativity (MMN), is a negative deflection approximately 160-200 ms after stimulus onset, which may be related to change detection from echoic sensory memory. We adapted a minimally invasive technique to record MMN in dogs. Dogs were exposed to an auditory oddball paradigm in which deviant tones (10% probability) were pseudo-randomly interspersed throughout an 8 min sequence of standard tones (90% probability). A significant difference in MMN ERP amplitude was observed after the deviant tone in comparison to the standard tone, t(5) = -2.98,p = 0.03. This difference, attributed to discrimination of an unexpected stimulus in a series of expected stimuli, was not observed when both tones occurred 50% of the time, t(1) = 0.82,p > 0.05. Dogs showed no evidence of pain or distress at any point. We believe this is the first illustration of MMN in a group of dogs and anticipate that this technique may provide valuable insights in cognitive tasks such as object discrimination.

Different individuals perceive the very same painful event largely differently. Here, we aimed to predict the individual pain sensitivity from brain activity. We repeatedly applied identical painful stimuli to healthy human subjects and recorded brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG). We applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the time-frequency transformed single-trial EEG responses. Our results show that a classifier trained on a group of healthy individuals can predict another individual's pain sensitivity with an accuracy of 83%. Classification accuracy depended on pain-evoked responses at about 8 Hz and pain-induced gamma oscillations at about 80 Hz. These results reveal that the temporal-spectral pattern of pain-related neuronal responses provides valuable information about the perception of pain. Beyond, our approach may help to establish an objective neuronal marker of pain sensitivity which can potentially be recorded from a single EEG electrode.

Likewise, brain development during this age is characterized by its "blossoming" nature, showing some of its most dynamic and elaborative anatomical and physiological changes. In this article, we review human brain development during the preschool years, sampling scientific evidence from a variety of sources. First, we cover neurobiological foundations of early postnatal development, explaining some of the primary mechanisms seen at a larger scale within neuroimaging studies. Next, we review evidence from both structural and functional imaging studies, which now accounts for a large portion of our current understanding of typical brain development. Within anatomical imaging, we focus on studies of developing brain morphology and tissue properties, including diffusivity of white matter fiber tracts. We also present new data on changes during the preschool years in cortical area, thickness, and volume. Physiological brain development is then reviewed, touching on influential results from several different functional imaging and recording modalities in the preschool and early school-age years, including positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

Despite the complexity, development is often indexed only by age in event-related potential (ERP) studies. To broaden this approach, we address the effects of gender and pubertal development, along with age, in adolescents using a psychophysiological probe of decision making, the P300 component. Overall, girls exhibited shorter P300 latencies and smaller P300 amplitudes compared to boys, suggesting more efficient information processing. In both genders, P300 latency and amplitude also diminished as age and pubertal status increased, again suggesting increasing efficiency of information processing with development. Our findings highlight the necessity of considering more than age when examining cognitive functioning in adolescents and, in particular, the necessity of considering gender whenever developmental issues are addressed.

Bilinear common spatial pattern for single-trial ERP-based rapid serial visual presentation triage	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; FILTERS	Common spatial pattern (CSP) analysis is a useful tool for the feature extraction of event-related potentials (ERP). However, CSP is essentially time invariant, and thus unable to exploit the temporal information of ERP. This paper proposes a variant of CSP, namely bilinear common spatial pattern (BCSP), which is capable of accommodating both spatial and temporal information. BCSP generalizes CSP through iteratively optimizing bilinear filters. These bilinear filters constitute a spatio-temporal subspace in which the separation between two conditions is maximized. The method is unique in the sense that it is mathematically intuitive and simple, as all the bilinear filters are obtained by maximizing the power ratio as CSP does. The proposed method was evaluated on 20 subjects' ERP data collected in rapid serial visual presentation triage experiments. The results show that BCSP achieved significantly higher average test accuracy (12.3% higher, p < 0.001).	[Shen, K.; Shao, S.; Ng, W.

Within-subject joint independent component analysis of simultaneous fMRI/ERP in an auditory oddball paradigm	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; ICA; Multimodal neuroimaging; Auditory oddball paradigm; P300	TARGET DETECTION; P300; EEG; POTENTIALS; BRAIN; FUSION; DISCRIMINATION; GENERATORS; RESPONSES; CORTEX	The integration of event-related potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can contribute to characterizing neural networks with high temporal and spatial resolution. This research aimed to determine the sensitivity and limitations of applying joint independent component analysis (jICA) within-subjects, for ERP and fMRI data collected simultaneously in a parametric auditory frequency oddball paradigm. In a group of 20 subjects, an increase in ERP peak amplitude ranging 1-8 mu V in the time window of the P300 (350-700 ms), and a correlated increase in fMRI signal in a network of regions including the right superior temporal and supramarginal gyri, was observed with the increase in deviant frequency difference. JICA of the same ERP and fMRI group data revealed activity in a similar network, albeit with stronger amplitude and larger extent. In addition, activity in the left pre- and post-central gyri, likely associated with right hand somato-motor response, was observed only with the jICA approach. Within-subject, the jICA approach revealed significantly stronger and more extensive activity in the brain regions associated with the auditory P300 than the P300 linear regression analysis. The results suggest that with the incorporation of spatial and temporal information from both imaging modalities, jICA may be a more sensitive method for extracting common sources of activity between ERP and fMRI.

Investigating the impact of parental status and depression symptoms on the early perceptual coding of infant faces: An event-related potential study	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Infant face; Parenting; Depression; ERP/EEG, N170	FACIAL EXPRESSION; MATERNAL BRAIN; BDI-II; INVENTORY; MOTIVATION; COMMUNITY; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; EDITION; MOTHER	Infant faces are highly salient social stimuli that appear to elicit intuitive parenting behaviors in healthy adult women. Behavioral and observational studies indicate that this effect may be modulated by experiences of reproduction, caregiving, and psychiatric symptomatology that affect normative attention and reward processing of infant cues. However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of these effects. Using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, this study investigated the impact of parental status (mother, non-mother) and depression symptoms on early visual processing of infant faces in a community sample of adult women. Specifically, the P1 and N170 ERP components elicited in response to infant face stimuli were examined. While characteristics of the N170 were not modulated by parental status, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between depression symptom severity and N170 amplitude. This relationship was not observed for the P1. These results suggest that depression symptoms may modulate early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues, even at sub-clinical levels.

For more than 40 years, EEG research has attempted to characterize and quantify the neurophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most consistently associating it with increased frontocentral theta band activity and increased theta to beta (theta/beta) power ratio during rest compared to non-ADHD controls. Recent reports suggest that while these EEG measures demonstrate strong discriminant validity for ADHD, significant EEG heterogeneity also exists across ADHD-diagnosed individuals. In particular, additional studies validating the use of the theta/beta power ratio measure appear to be needed before it can be used for clinical diagnosis. In recent years, the number and the scientific quality of research reports on EEG-based neurofeedback (NF) for ADHD have grown considerably, although the studies reviewed here do not yet support NF training as a first-line, stand-alone treatment modality. In particular, more research is needed comparing NF to placebo control and other effective treatments for ADHD. Currently, after a long period of relative stasis, the neurophysiological specificity of measures used in EEG research is rapidly increasing. It is likely, therefore, that new EEG studies of ADHD using higher density recordings and new measures drawn from viewing EEG as a 3-dimensional functional imaging modality, as well as intensive re-analyses of existing EEG study data, can better characterize the neurophysiological differences between and within ADHD and non-ADHD subjects, and lead to more precise diagnostic measures and effective NF approaches.

The paper describes experiments and algorithms that use the BCI for selecting different surface of geometrical objects in the CAD systems using the P300 wave. The P300 (P3) wave is an event related potential (ERP) elicited by infrequent, stimuli (target faces flashing). Users wear an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset and try to select a target face of an object. Different faces of the object randomly flash which make the flashing of target face, an infrequent event. The EEG headset collects brain activity from 14 locations on the scalp. The data is analyzed with independent component analysis (ICA) and the discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to detect the P300 component in the signal. The flashing face which causes the P300 component in the EEG signal is classified as the target face. Using a linear discriminant analysis, the target face is classified correctly with an average accuracy of 73.9%.

In particular, response errors are important events that require behavioral adjustments. Correct and incorrect responses, as well as feedback to responses, are followed by brain activity originating mainly in the anterior cingulate, which can be measured with fMRI and event-related potential (ERP) techniques. After each response a small negativity (Nc or CRN) is elicited in the ERP, which is strongly enhanced in incorrect trials (Ne or ERN). Following feedback stimuli that signal a negative outcome of an action, a similar negativity, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is elicited. Recently it has been shown that these neurophysiological correlates of response monitoring and evaluation can be classified even on the single-trial level in the EEG and thus could be utilized not only to distinguish between correct and erroneous actions, but also can be used online for a wide range of applications such as prediction of clinical outcomes or brain computer interfaces.

However, behavioral studies have failed to show an association between tasks that measure these distinct types of inhibition. In the present study, we hypothesized neural markers reflecting each type of inhibition may reveal a relationship across inhibitory domains in older adults. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were used to explore whether there was an across-participant correlation between sensory suppression and motor inhibition. Sixteen healthy older adult participants (65-80 years) engaged in two separate experimental paradigms: a selective attention, delayed-recognition task and a stop-signal task. Results: Findings revealed no significant relationship existed between neural markers of sensory suppression (P1 amplitude; N170 latency) and markers of motor inhibition (N2 and P3 amplitude and latency) in older adults. Conclusions: These distinct inhibitory domains are differentially impacted in normal aging, as evidenced by previous behavioral work and the current neural findings. Thus a generalized inhibitory deficit may not be a common impairment in cognitive aging. Significance: Given that some theories of cognitive aging suggest age-related failure of inhibitory mechanisms may span different modalities, the present findings contribute to an alternative view where age-related declines within each inhibitory modality are unrelated.

The proposed method is based on the fact that the frequency responses of WLD conform to the frequency properties of the studied signal. Thus, a suitable wavelet for the decomposition and the appropriate levels for the reconstruction required to extract the desired signal can be selected. The reverse biorthogonal wavelet of the order of 6.8 is suitable for decomposing conventionally averaged EEG recordings of the MMN activity of children elicited by an uninterrupted sound under the oddball paradigm. With seven-level decomposition, the coefficients of the fifth and sixth levels are appropriate for extracting the MMN from the averaged trace. Results show that WLD can be used to extract MMN with much better properties than those of that extracted by the difference wave or an optimal band-pass digital filter. The improved properties mean that the deviant stimuli with larger magnitude deviance in contrast to the standard stimuli can elicit the MN1N with a larger peak amplitude and a shorter latency. The proposed method can be used as a preprocessing step for multichannel data processing and for the study of other event-related potentials.

Neural Signatures of Economic Parameters During Decision-Making: A Functional MRI (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Autonomic Monitoring Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Decision making; Prospect theory; Functional MRI (fMRI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Autonomic monitoring	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; SOMATIC MARKER HYPOTHESIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PROSPECT-THEORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; LOSS AVERSION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; REWARD EXPECTATION	Adaptive behaviour requires an ability to obtain rewards by choosing between different risky options. Financial gambles can be used to study effective decision-making experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients.

The significance of multimodal brain imaging is documented by a steadily increasing number of laboratories now using simultaneous EEG-fMRI aiming to achieve both high temporal and spatial resolution of human brain function. Due to recent developments in technical and algorithmic instrumentation, the rate-limiting step in multimodal studies has shifted from data acquisition to analytic aspects. Here, we introduce and compare different methods for data integration and identify the benefits that come with each approach, guiding the reader toward an understanding and informed selection of the integration approach most suitable for addressing a particular research question.

In this study, we measured mental fatigue in drivers using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiograph (ECG). Together, thirteen healthy subjects performed a continuous simulated driving task for 90 min with simultaneous ECG and multi-channel EEG recording of each subject. Several important physiological parameters were investigated using preprocessed ECG and EEG signals. The results show that the EEG alpha and beta, the relative power, the amplitude of P300 wave of event-related potential (ERP), the approximated entropy of the ECG, and the lower and upper bands of power of heart rate variability (HRV) are significantly different before and after finishing the driving task (p < 0.05). These metrics are possible indices for measuring simulated driving mental fatigue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One such multimodal approach is the combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, no standard integration procedure has been established so far. One promising data-driven approach consists of a joint decomposition of event-related potentials (ERPs) and fMRI maps derived from the response to a particular stimulus. Such an algorithm (joint independent component analysis or JointICA) has recently been proposed by Calhoun et al. (2006). This method provides sources with both a fine spatial and temporal resolution, and has shown to provide meaningful results. However, the algorithm's performance has not been fully characterized yet, and no procedure has been proposed to assess the quality of the decomposition. In this paper, we therefore try to answer why and how JointICA works. We show the performance of the algorithm on data obtained in a visual detection task, and compare the performance for EEG recorded simultaneously with fMRI data and for EEG recorded in a separate session (outside the scanner room). We perform several analyses in order to set the necessary conditions that lead to a sound decomposition, and to give additional insights for exploration in future studies. In that respect, we show how the algorithm behaves when different EEG electrodes are used and we test the robustness with respect to the number of subjects in the study. The performance of the algorithm in all the experiments is validated based on results from previous studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two blink correction strategies are compared. ICA-SSP combines independent component analysis (ICA) with signal space projection (SSP) and ICA-EMD uses empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to improve the performance of the standard ICA method. Five voluntary subjects performed an auditory oddball task. The resulting ERPs are used to compare the two blink correction methods to each other and against blink rejection. The results suggest that both methods qualitatively preserve the ERP waveform but that they underestimate some of the peak amplitudes. ICA-EMD performs slightly better than ICA-SSP. In conclusion, the use of blink correction is justified, especially if blink rejection leads to severe data loss.

Specifically, mid-frontal ERP components in the N2 time range and error-related negativity time range are parsimoniously characterized as reflections of theta band activities. Forty participants completed three different tasks with varying stimulusresponse demands. Permutation tests were used to identify the dominant timefrequency responses of stimulus- and response-locked conditions as well as the enhanced responses to novelty, conflict, punishment, and error. A dominant theta band feature was found in all conditions, and both ERP component amplitudes and theta power measures were similarly modulated by novelty, conflict, punishment, and error. The findings support the hypothesis that generic and reactive medial prefrontal cortex processes are parsimoniously reflected by theta band activities.

Mindfulness based cognitive therapy improves frontal control in bipolar disorder: a pilot EEG study	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SUSTAINED ATTENTION-DEFICIT; MIDLINE THETA; ANXIETY DISORDERS; ALPHA-ASYMMETRY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MEDITATION; DEPRESSION; ACTIVATION; ANTERIOR; MANIA	Background: Cognitive processing in Bipolar Disorder is characterized by a number of attentional abnormalities. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy combines mindfulness meditation, a form of attentional training, along with aspects of cognitive therapy, and may improve attentional dysfunction in bipolar disorder patients. Methods: 12 euthymic BD patients and 9 control participants underwent record of electroencephalography (EEG, band frequency analysis) during resting states (eyes open, eyes closed) and during the completion of a continuous performance task (A-X version, EEG event-related potential (ERP) wave component analysis). The individuals with BD completed an 8-week MBCT intervention and record of EEG was repeated. Results: (1) Brain activity, individuals with BD showed significantly decreased theta band power, increased beta band power, and decreased theta/beta ratios during the resting state, eyes closed, for frontal and cingulate cortices. Post MBCT intervention improvement over the right frontal cortex was seen in the individuals with BD, as beta band power decreased. (2) Brain activation, individuals with BD showed a significant P300-like wave form over the frontal cortex during the cue. Post MBCT intervention the P300-like waveform was significantly attenuated over the frontal cortex. Conclusions: Individuals with BD show decreased attentional readiness and activation of non-relevant information processing during attentional processes. These data are the first that show, MBCT in BD improved attentional readiness, and attenuated activation of non-relevant information processing during attentional processes.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually investigated by the group-level analysis, for which tensor factorization can be used. However, sizes of a tensor including time-frequency representation of ERPs of multiple channels of multiple participants can be immense. It is time-consuming to decompose such a tensor. The low-rank approximation based sequential nonnegative Tucker decomposition (LraSNTD) has been recently developed and shown to be computationally efficient with respect to some benchmark datasets. Here, LraSNTD is applied to decompose a fourth-order tensor representation of ERPs. We find that the decomposed results from LraSNTD and a benchmark nonnegative Tucker decomposition algorithm are very similar. So, LraSNTD is promising for ERP studies.

The FRN was larger after losses than gains, and was modulated by the magnitude of gains, but not the magnitude of losses, for all participants regardless of age. FRN amplitude was larger in adolescents than adults and also discriminated relatively less strongly between gains and losses in adolescents. In addition, the morphology of the waveform after high losses suggests that feedback in this condition may have been processed less efficiently by adolescents. Our results suggest that, although the FRN in adults and adolescents share some common characteristics, the neural processes that generate the FRN are still developing in midadolescence. These findings are discussed in the context of adolescent risk taking.

The olfactory stimulus in this study was a mixture of 60 % humidity air and 40 % phenyl ethanol alcohol generated by a computer-controlled olfactometer with a constant flow rate of 8 L/min. A 32-channel whole-head EEG system was utilized to investigate the olfactory responses in 12 healthy subjects. Each EEG epoch was segmented based on the olfactory stimulus onset and subsequently decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using EMD. Only IMFs that met both frequency and spatial dual criteria were chosen as OERP-related IMFs for reconstructing the noise-suppressed single-trial activity, and those significant trials with N1/P2 amplitudes lower/greater than the mean minus/plus two times the standard deviations of baseline amplitudes were denoted as single-trial OERP for intertrial variability analysis. The present approach enables the capability to study intertrial OERP features, such as the latencies and amplitudes of N1 and P2 peaks, on trial-by-trial basis, which may be helpful to shed light on future olfactory dysfunction studies.

In this study, a new approach based on wavelet coefficients (WCs) and kernel learning algorithm is proposed to identify concealed information. Totally 16 subjects went through the designed CIT paradigm and the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Then, the high-dimensional WCs of ERP in delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms were extracted. For the analysis of the data, kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) and a support vector machines (SVM) classifier are implemented. The results show that WCs features are significant differences between concealed information and irrelevant information (P < 0.05). The KPCA is able to effectively reduce feature dimensionalities and increase generalization performance of SVM. A high accuracy (93.6%) in recognizing concealed information and irrelevant information is achieved, which indicates the combination KPCA and SVM may provide a useful tool for detecting the concealed information.

Multiple measures were recorded, such as psychophysiological (skin conductance response, heart rate, and electromyography) and ERPs (event-related potentials) responses, during viewing IAPS figures, that varied in terms of pleasantness (appetitive vs. aversive) and arousing power (high vs. low intensity). Autonomic variables and two ERP positive deflections (P3 and LPP ERP effects) were found to be modulated by valence and arousal rating, with an increased response for high arousing and negative or positive stimuli in comparison with low arousing and neutral stimuli. Moreover, high BAS subjects were more responsive to positive than negative emotions, whereas high BIS subjects responded in greater measure to negative and arousing emotions. Findings were discussed in light of biphasic model of emotion comprehension.

Methods: Spatio-temporal interrelations and synchronicity of multi-sited ERP activity peaks were extracted in a group of 13 ADHD patients and 13 control subjects for the No-go stimulus in a Go/No-go task. Participants were scored by cross-validation against the most discriminative ensuing group patterns and scores were correlated to neuropsychological evaluation scores. Results: A distinct frontal-central-parietal pattern in the delta frequency range, dominant at the P3 latency, was unraveled in controls, while central activity in the theta and alpha frequency ranges predominated in the ADHD pattern, involving early ERP components (P1-N1-P2-N2). Cross-validation based on this analysis yielded 92% specificity and 84% sensitivity and individual scores correlated well with behavioral assessments. Conclusions: These results suggest that the ADHD group was more characterized by the process of exerting attention in the early monitoring stages of the No-go signal while the controls were more characterized by the process of inhibiting the response to that signal. Significance: The BNA method may provide both diagnostic and drug development tools for use in diverse neurological disorders. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

CNV and spectral power (4-100 Hz) were calculated from EEG activity in the preparatory interval in 16 healthy adult participants. As previously reported, CNV amplitudes were higher in Go compared to NoGo trials. In addition, event-related spectral power of the Go condition was reduced in the theta to low gamma range compared to the NoGo condition, confirming that preparing to respond is associated with modulation of event-related spectral activity as well as the CNV. Altogether, the impact of the experimental manipulation on both slow event-related potentials and oscillatory EEG activity may reflect coordinated dynamic changes in the excitability of distributed neural networks involved in preparation.

Weighted phase lag index stability as an artifact resistant measure to detect cognitive EEG activity during locomotion	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Walking; Movement artifact; Artifact removal; Connectivity; Phase lag	BRAIN; NETWORK; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; REMOVAL; P300; P3A	Background: High-density electroencephalography (EEG) with active electrodes allows for monitoring of electrocortical dynamics during human walking but movement artifacts have the potential to dominate the signal. One potential method for recovering cognitive brain dynamics in the presence of gait-related artifact is the Weighted Phase Lag Index. Methods: We tested the ability of Weighted Phase Lag Index to recover event-related potentials during locomotion. Weighted Phase Lag Index is a functional connectivity measure that quantified how consistently 90 degrees (or 270 degrees) phase 'lagging' one EEG signal was compared to another. 248-channel EEG was recorded as eight subjects performed a visual oddball discrimination and response task during standing and walking (0.8 or 1.2 m/s) on a treadmill. Results: Applying Weighted Phase Lag Index across channels we were able to recover a p300-like cognitive response during walking. This response was similar to the classic amplitude-based p300 we also recovered during standing. We also showed that the Weighted Phase Lag Index detects more complex and variable activity patterns than traditional voltage-amplitude measures. This variability makes it challenging to compare brain activity over time and across subjects. In contrast, a statistical metric of the index's variability, calculated over a moving time window, provided a more generalized measure of behavior. Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability returned a peak change of 1.8% + -0.5% from baseline for the walking case and 3.9% + -1.3% for the standing case. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both Weighted Phase Lag Index and Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability have potential for the on-line analysis of cognitive dynamics within EEG during human movement. The latter may be more useful from extracting general principles of neural behavior across subjects and conditions.

Intra- and interhemispheric features of P100/N100 and N170 components evoked by different types of verbal stimuli were revealed. It was found that N170 amplitude evoked by target known words was higher than that evoked by nontarget known words and unknown words. The results suggest that motivation can affect the early word processing.	[Rebreikina, A. B.; Strelets, V.

In this work, we aim to understand the nature of the event related oscillation (ERO) components which form the basis for N170 wave (face marker) and how these components may be used to differentiates domain specific nature of the brain in recognizing animate objects (faces) from inanimate objects (house). Event related potentials (ERPs) studies along with S-Transform decomposition method are used to pin down the ERO measures integrating with temporal integration. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA to find out the differences of specific regions for object processing in human brain. The results indicate that effect of face recognition is better compared to objects in right occipito and occipito-temporal region than left hemisphere and the time of differentiation is more in case of inanimate objects compared to faces (animate). Secondly, N170 ERP waveform, known as the face-marker is composed of contribution from various brain waves in unique pattern. ERO measures which underlie and compose N170 wave provide additional information to that offered by conventional ERP amplitude measures and serve as a useful genetic markers in the study of prosopagnosia. Studies on object and face processing using ERP integrating with time-frequency analysis opens a new avenue of research in neuroelectrophysiology. This may lead to better understanding of cognitive processing lead to improved clinical diagnosis and provide pathways to understand early visual differences in object recognition in human brain.

Participants performed a visuospatial short-term memory task with orienting cues that appeared before or after a memory display and reported whether a probe item had appeared on the cued side. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for cues, memory displays, and probes. Performance was better in precued versus postcued conditions. ERPs to orienting cues and memory displays were lateralized in relation to the direction of attention in precued but not postcued conditions. ERPs to recognition probes were lateralized, but this was similar between pre- and postcued conditions. Results suggest that we can orient visuospatial attention outwardly to external events and inwardly to remembered events alike, but knowing where to attend information in advance gives a bigger boost to brain and behavior.

However, no studies have tested the generalizability of error-foreshadowing positivity to tasks without stimulus-response interference. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study adopted an alternating-response task, in which the participants responded to the pointing direction of an arrowhead (up or down). Although the arrowhead direction alternated for the majority of trials (95%), occasionally this pattern was broken by a repeated stimulus, termed a lure trial. We compared the matched-reaction-time correct-preceding ERP with the error-preceding ERP on lure-preceding trials. There was no evidence that errors are foreshadowed by the increase of a positive electroencephalogram (EEG) deflection. To the contrary, analyses of ERPs time-locked to electromyogram (EMG) onset on the five consecutive lure-preceding trials showed larger positive deflections on correct-preceding than error-preceding trials. The post-response negativity did not differ between correct-preceding and error-preceding trials. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that in minimal conflict tasks a decreased positivity may foreshadow incorrect performance several trials prior to the error, possibly reflecting the waning of task-related efforts. Therefore, error-foreshadowing brain signals may be task-specific.

This is largely due to the fact that initial treatments frequently do not lead to remission and recovery. The current treatment approach involves lengthy trial-and-error periods. It would be beneficial to have early reliable predictors to determine whether patients will respond to treatment or not. Electroencephalography (EEG) derived biomarkers namely change in the activity of EEG frequency bands, hemispheric alpha asymmetry, theta cordance, the antidepressant treatment response index (ATR) and evoked potentials have all been shown to predict response to a variety of antidepressant medications. However, the neurobiology in support of this association has been largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss biological mechanisms for each EEG derived biomarker predictive of treatment response. Validating such biomarkers will not only greatly aid clinicians in selecting antidepressant treatment for individual patients but will also provide a critical step in drug discovery.

Four-term analogies (A:B::C:D) have an encoding period in which the A:B pair is evaluated prior to a mapping phase. The electrophysiological timing associated with analogical reasoning has remained unclear. We used event-related potentials to identify neural timing related to analogical reasoning relative to perceptual and semantic control conditions. Spatiotemporal principal-components analyses revealed differences primarily in left frontal electrodes during encoding and mapping phases of analogies relative to the other conditions. The timing of the activity differed depending upon the phase of the problem. During the encoding of A:B terms, analogies elicited a positive deflection compared to the control conditions between 400 and 1,200 ms, but for the mapping phase analogical processing elicited a negative deflection that occurred earlier and for a shorter time period, between 350 and 625 ms. These results provide neural and behavioral evidence that 4-term analogy problems involve a highly active evaluation phase of the A:B pair.	[Maguire, Mandy J.; McClelland, M.

Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system mainly consists of three procedures; enhanced active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student 2-sample t statistics, the two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic Gaussian filter further refines the selection of active segments. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by using proposed modified fractal dimension. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. Compared to original active segment selection, with several popular features and classifier on both the MI and finger-lifting data from 2 data sets, the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in EEG classification.

To examine changes in event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced brain oscillations of object repetition priming with aging, we recorded EEGs of healthy groups of young (n = 14; mean age = 29.93 years) and older adults (n = 15; mean age = 66.4). Both groups exhibited similar behavioral haptic priming across repetitions, although young adults responded faster than the older group. Young and older adults showed ERP repetition enhancement at the 500-900 ms time window. In contrast, only the young participants showed ERP repetition suppression at the 1200-1500 ms segment. The results from the induced oscillations showed more positive amplitudes in young than in older adults at theta, alpha and beta frequencies (4-30 Hz). In addition, we found amplitude modulation related to stimulus repetition in the upper alpha and low beta sub-bands only in young adults (1250-1750 ms).The results suggest that although behavioral priming is spared with age, normal aging affects ERPs and oscillatory responses when performing an incidental priming symmetry detection task with haptically explored objects.

Specifically, we measured alpha power, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and event-related brain potentials during early training of the Space Fortress task, and correlated these measures with subsequent learning rate and performance in transfer tasks. Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50% of the learning rate variance and 10%-20% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures. Thus, control processes, as indexed by alpha and delta EEG oscillations, can predict learning and skill improvements. The results are of potential use to optimize training regimes.

Event related potentials to digit learning: Tracking neurophysiologic changes accompanying recall performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event related potentials; Digit span; Learning; Memory; P300	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE; SERIAL-RECALL; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; MODEL; P300; N100	The aim of this study was to track recall performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) across multiple trials in a digit-learning task. When a sequence is practiced by repetition, the number of errors typically decreases and a learning curve emerges. Until now, almost all ERP learning and memory research has focused on effects after a single presentation and, therefore, fails to capture the dynamic changes that characterize a learning process. However, the current study used a free-recall task in which a sequence of ten auditory digits was presented repeatedly. Auditory sequences of ten digits were presented in a logical order (control sequences) or in a random order (experimental sequences). Each sequence was presented six times. Participants had to reproduce the sequence after each presentation. EEG recordings were made at the time of the digit presentations. Recall performance for the control sequences was close to asymptote right after the first learning trial, whereas performance for the experimental sequences initially displayed primacy and recency effects. However, these latter effects gradually disappeared over the six repetitions, resulting in near-asymptotic recall performance for all digits. The performance improvement for the middle items of the list was accompanied by an increase in P300 amplitude, implying a close correspondence between this ERP component and the behavioral data. These results, which were discussed in the framework of theories on the functional significance of the P300 amplitude, add to the scarce empirical data on the dynamics of ERP responses in the process of intentional learning.

We used simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the relationship between the electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses to errors. Participants performed a modified Flanker task. When analyzed independently, we found the ERN and hemodynamic activations in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. fMRI-informed dipole modeling and joint independent component analysis (ICA) were used to couple electrophysiological and hemodynamic data. Both techniques revealed a temporal evolution of the areas found in the fMRI analysis, with the right hemisphere activations peaking before the left hemisphere. However, joint ICA added information, revealing a number of cortical and subcortical areas that had not been shown with parametric mapping. This technique also uncovered how these areas evolve over time. All together, these analyses provide a more detailed picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the processing of performance errors.

We conducted comparative analysis of the characteristics of P100 and N170 in healthy controls and in patients with the first episode of schizophrenia during passive perception of verbal stimuli as well as under conditions of relevant words and pseudowords. The latency of early ERP components P100 and N170 appeared to be shorter in comparison with healthy subjects in the temporal, parietal and occipital areas. The latency of P100 in patients was significantly shorter in the temporal, parietal and occipital areas, whereas the latency of NI 70 was shorter in the parietal and occipital areas than in controls. The latency of N170 in healthy subjects was significantly longer to words than to pseudowords and in patients vice versa. The latencies of N170 in all TPO areas were equal in healthy subjects during word processing, and this equality was upset during non-word processing. In patients with schizophrenia the equality was upset, but, opposite to healthy patients, the upset of equality was more expressed during words processing. Thus, the early stage of verbal information processing in schizophrenic patients is insufficient in time. The time deficit of the automatic processes may lead to defective processing of overall information.	[Strelets, V. B.; Garakh, Zh V.; Maryina, I. V.; Zaytseva, Yu S.; Gurovich, I.

We used a phonetic oddball paradigm in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to elicit the MMN response at fronto-central sites and the mismatch positivity (MMP) response at mastoid sites. The MMN in 26 patients was compared with that of 26 age- and gender-matched healthy control participants. Electroencephalography responses were recorded during the presentation of speech sounds: the vowels 'a' and 'o' in alternation. Average waveforms were obtained for standard and deviant trials. We found that the MMP response at bilateral mastoid sites was reduced, whereas the MMN response at fronto-central sites did not change significantly. These results support the view that the MMN is generated by separable sources in the frontal and temporal lobes and that these sources are differentially affected by TLE. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Auditory grouping mechanisms reflect a sound's relative position in a sequence	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; grouping; streaming; EEG; perception; bistable	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; STREAM SEGREGATION; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; TONE SEQUENCES; CORTEX; POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; HEARING; SPEECH	The human brain uses acoustic cues to decompose complex auditory scenes into its components. For instance to improve communication, a listener can select an individual "stream," such as a talker in a crowded room, based on cues such as pitch or location. Despite numerous investigations into auditory streaming, few have demonstrated clear correlates of perception; instead, in many studies perception covaries with changes in physical stimulus properties (e.g., frequency separation). In the current report, we employ a classic ABA streaming paradigm and human electroencephalography (EEG) to disentangle the individual contributions of stimulus properties from changes in auditory perception. We find that changes in perceptual state-that is the perception of one versus two auditory streams with physically identical stimuli-and changes in physical stimulus properties are reflected independently in the event-related potential (ERP) during overlapping time windows. These findings emphasize the necessity of controlling for stimulus properties when studying perceptual effects of streaming. Furthermore, the independence of the perceptual effect from stimulus properties suggests the neural correlates of streaming reflect a tone's relative position within a larger sequence (1st, 2nd, 3rd) rather than its acoustics. By clarifying the role of stimulus attributes along with perceptual changes, this study helps explain precisely how the brain is able to distinguish a sound source of interest in an auditory scene.

It has been suggested that this mnemonic boost may be observed for both age groups, particularly the old, in part because emotional information is retrieved with less effort than neutral information. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that inefficient retrieval processing (temporally delayed and attenuated) may contribute to age-related impairments in episodic memory for neutral events. It is not entirely clear whether emotional salience may reduce these age-related changes in neural activity associated with episodic retrieval for neutral events. Here, we investigated these ideas using event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess the neural correlates of successful source memory retrieval ("old-new effects") for neutral and emotional (negative and positive) images. Behavioral results showed that older adults demonstrated source memory impairments compared to the young but that both groups showed reduced source memory accuracy for negative compared to positive and neutral images; most likely due to an arousal-induced memory tradeoff for the negative images, which were subjectively more arousing than both positive and neutral images. ERP results showed that early onsetting old-new effects, between 100 and 300 ms, were observed for emotional but not neutral images in both age groups. Interestingly, these early effects were observed for negative items in the young and for positive items in the old. These ERP findings offer support for the idea that emotional events may be retrieved more automatically than neutral events across the lifespan. Furthermore, we suggest that very early retrieval mechanisms, possibly perceptual priming or familiarity, may underlie the negativity and positivity effects sometimes observed in the young and old, respectively, for various behavioral measures of attention and memory.

Despite the advancements on these techniques, determining the number of embedded sources and their reliability are still open issues. In particular to date no method takes into account trial-to-trial variability in order to provide a reliability measure of independent components extracted in Event Related Potentials (ERPs) studies. In this work we present ErpICASSO, a new method which modifies a data-driven approach named ICASSO for the analysis of trials (epochs). In addition to ICASSO the method enables the user to estimate the number of embedded sources, and provides a quality index of each extracted ERP component by combining trial-to-trial bootstrapping and CCA projection. We applied ErpICASSO on ERPs recorded from 1 4 subjects presented with unpleasant and neutral pictures. We separated potentials putatively related to different systems and identified the four primary ERP independent sources. Standing on the confidence interval estimated by ErpICASSO, we were able to compare the components between neutral and unpleasant conditions. ErpICASSO yielded encouraging results, thus providing the scientific community with a useful tool for ICA signal processing whenever dealing with trials recorded in different conditions.

Participants saw pictures of objects (e.g., a swimming duck) after listening to noun phrases describing the same object in the identical state, a shape-mismatching state (flying duck), or an incongruent object (e.g., sliced bread). Individual differences in the vividness of mental imagery and preference for mental imagery were assessed after the experiment. ERP effects of context arose 170?ms after picture onset, differentiating the incongruent-object context from the other two. The N400 mirrored these context effects. Self-rated vividness of imagery affected responses to pictures already after 100?ms, and modulated the N400 effect. Participants with highly vivid imagery showed larger context effects than participants low in imagery. The context effects at 170?ms were not modulated by individual differences.

The temporal resolution of EEG is excellent, managing to capture neural events in the order of milliseconds. On the other hand, its spatial resolution lacks precision. Conversely, fMRI offers high spatial resolution, typically on the order of mm(3). However, it has limited temporal resolution (similar to sec), which is determined by the haemodynamic response. Therefore, simultaneous acquisition of EEG and fMRI is highly desirable. In recent years, the ability to perform combined EEG-fMRI has attracted considerable attention from the neuroscience community. In this chapter, relevant methodological aspects of EEG-fMRI will be first described, focused on the nature of neurophysiologic signals and difficulties to integrate electric and haemodynamic signals derived from both techniques. Second, state of the art strategies related to artifact correction and signal analysis will be described. Finally, a possible use of EEG-fMRI will be presented, focused on its potential application in epilepsy.

The spotlight of attention illuminates failed feature-based expectancies	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Sensation; perception; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MEMORY; BRAIN; MECHANISMS; COLOR; AREA	A well-replicated finding is that visual stimuli presented at an attended location are afforded a processing benefit in the form of speeded reaction times and increased accuracy (Mangun, ; Posner, ). This effect has been described using a spotlight metaphor, in which all stimuli within the focus of spatial attention receive facilitated processing, irrespective of other stimulus parameters. However, the spotlight metaphor has been brought into question by a series of combined expectancy studies that demonstrated that the behavioral benefits of spatial attention are contingent on secondary feature-based expectancies (Kingstone, ). The present work used an event-related potential (ERP) approach to reveal that the early neural signature of the spotlight of spatial attention is not sensitive to the validity of secondary feature-based expectancies.

The most popular technique to evaluate brain responses to chemosensory stimuli is across trial time-domain averaging to reveal chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERP) embedded within the ongoing EEG. Nevertheless, this technique has a poor signal-to-noise ratio and cancels out stimulus-induced changes in the EEG signal that are not strictly phased-locked to stimulus onset. The fact that consistent CSERP are not systematically identifiable in healthy subjects currently constitutes a major limitation to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of chemosensory dysfunction. In this review, we will review the different techniques related to the recording and identification of CSERP, discuss some of their limitations, and propose some novel signal processing methods which could be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of chemosensory event-related brain responses.

Neural correlates of oddball detection in self-motion heading: A high-density event-related potential study of vestibular integration	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Evoked potentials; Vestibular; Heading; Self; motion; P3; Cognition	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; P300 TOPOGRAPHY; RESPONSES; EEG; PERCEPTION; LATENCY; ERP; ACCELERATION; MOVEMENT; ARTIFACT	The perception of self-motion is a product of the integration of information from both visual and non-visual cues, to which the vestibular system is a central contributor. It is well documented that vestibular dysfunction leads to impaired movement and balance, dizziness and falls, and yet our knowledge of the neuronal processing of vestibular signals remains relatively sparse. In this study, high-density electroencephalographic recordings were deployed to investigate the neural processes associated with vestibular detection of changes in heading. To this end, a self-motion oddball paradigm was designed. Participants were translated linearly 7.8 cm on a motion platform using a one second motion profile, at a 45A degrees angle leftward or rightward of straight ahead. These headings were presented with a stimulus probability of 80-20 %. Participants responded when they detected the infrequent direction change via button-press. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated in response to the standard (80 %) and target (20 %) movement directions. Statistical parametric mapping showed that ERPs to standard and target movements differed significantly from 490 to 950 ms post-stimulus. Topographic analysis showed that this difference had a typical P3 topography. Individual participant bootstrap analysis revealed that 93.3 % of participants exhibited a clear P3 component. These results indicate that a perceived change in vestibular heading can readily elicit a P3 response, wholly similar to that evoked by oddball stimuli presented in other sensory modalities. This vestibular-evoked P3 response may provide a readily and robustly detectable objective measure for the evaluation of vestibular integrity in various disease models.	[Butler, J. S.; Foxe, J.

It is applied both in high-performance sports and in rehabilitation to optimize movements. One explanation of the training effects is offered by simulation theory with its central postulate that motor imagery and movement execution activate similar neuronal structures (functional equivalence). Several neurophysiological methods have been used to prove this assumption, but the results are still inconclusive. In our opinion, electroencephalography (EEG) is conducive to the improvement of the theoretical process of understanding. This review surveys current findings concerning mental practice by means of EEG. We present three main benefits of using EEG: (a) it offers measurements of neuropsychological activity with high time resolution, (b) technical developments (wireless hardware, portable equipment) provide the mobility necessary for its application in the domain of sports, and (c) within rehabilitation, the imagination of movements can serve as a mental strategy to control neural prosthesis through brain activity.

Studies in the auditory domain have recently shown a similar component. Little source localization has been done on the visual EPN, and no source localization has been done on the auditory EPN. The aim of the current study was to identify the neural generators of the auditory EPN using EEG-fMRI single-trial coupling. Data were recorded from 19 subjects who completed three auditory choice reaction tasks: (1) a control task using neutral tones; (2) a prosodic emotion task involving the categorization of syllables; and (3) a semantic emotion task involving the categorization of words. The waveforms of the emotion tasks diverged from the neutral task over parietal scalp during a very early time window (132-156 ms) and later during a more traditional EPN time window (252-392 ms). In the EEG-fMRI analyses, the variance of the voltage in the earlier time window was correlated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, but only in the word task. In the EEG-fMRI analyses of the traditional EPN time window both emotional tasks co-varied with activity in the left superior parietal lobule. Our results support previous parietal cortex source localization findings for the visual EPN, and suggest enhanced selective attention to emotional stimuli during the EPN time window.

A novel method that aims at identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The results show that, the target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i.e., a theta band (4.3 Hz) power boost 300-700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) power repression 500-1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) power boost after 500 ms. The discriminate time-frequency features are mostly power boost and relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. These features are visualized for later analysis. For classification of target and non-target images, our LDA classifier was based on the uncorrelated features, which was constructed from original correlated features using clustering method. With feature clustering, the performance (area under ROC) was improved from 0.85 to 0.89 for within-session tests, and from 0.76 to 0.84 for cross-subject tests. Meanwhile, the constructed uncorrelated features were shown more robust than the original discriminant features, and corresponding to a local region in time-frequency.

Musical training facilitates the neural discrimination of major versus minor chords in 13-year-old children	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing; Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Music; Musical training; Major chord; Minor chord	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; MUSICIANS; BRAIN; EXPERIENCE; LATERALIZATION; INTELLIGENCE; NONMUSICIANS; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION	Music practice since childhood affects the development of hearing skills. An important classification in Western music is the chords major-minor dichotomy. Its preattentive auditory discrimination was studied here using a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm in 13-year-olds with active hobbies, music-related (music group) or other (control group). In a context of root major chords, root minor chords and inverted major chords were presented infrequently. The interval structure of inverted majors differs more from root majors than the interval structure of root minors. However, the identity of the chords is the same in inverted and root majors (major), but different in root minors. The deviant chords introduced no new frequencies to the paradigm. Hence, an MMN caused by physical deviance was prevented. An MMN was elicited by the minor chords but not by the inverted majors. The MMN amplitude in the music group was larger than in the control group. Thus, the conceptual discrimination skills are present already in the preattentive processing level of the auditory cortex, and musical training can advance these skills.

To address this question we performed Event Related Potential (ERP) (128 channels) study by using the Wavelet Transform (WT), a time frequency representation in 9 healthy volunteers in the same culture during the presentation of bared head face and hijab wearing face with randomly presented cross and house picture as two other neutral stimuli within the face presentation. There had two experiments, Face-target and Hijab-face target experiment. In Face-target experiment, subjects pressed '1' button when saw bared head face and in Hijab-target experiment, subjects pressed the same button when saw Hijab wearing face. The stimuli were presented for 1 s with 1.5 s interstimulus interval (ISI). Upon the stimulus types, event-related responses in the 0 Hz-30 Hz range were distributed mainly in the Fz, Cz, Pz, O1 and O2 locations. Data formed visual ERPs. The cue stimuli evoked posterior N170 ERP components both in the face-target and hijab-target experiments at O1 and O2 locations. Both face and hijab-picture stimuli were analyzed in both face and hijab-target experiments. Amplitude was higher of N170 at face-picture stimuli in both experiments. But significantly higher (P=0.03) in hijab-target experiment. Latency had no significant change in both experiments in all areas. In the face-target experiment, face-picture gave significantly (P=0.03) higher beta power at O1 area comparing the hijab-picture, where as remarkable decreased (P=0.03) theta power was found in the same stimuli at O2 area. Results suggest that in the same culture, hijab did not give any special neural stimulants. Increased Beta activity and decreased theta waveform indicate that similar society facial picture give the face-picture impression at O1 and O2, respectively and subjects give more attention to face-picture than hijab-picture where O1 and O2 locations are the crucial for this case.

[Subjects] Fifteen ADHD children with a mean age of 8.6 +/- 2.1 years and 14 healthy children with a mean age of 8.7 +/- 2.0 years were used as subjects in this study. [Methods] All subjects were asked to sit on a chair or therapy ball and perform simultaneously the auditory oddball task. A portable 40-channel EEG system and a sound operating system were employed to record and analyze the EEG and button reaction time signals. [Results] When seated on the chair, the ADHD group had a significantly longer reaction time than the control group. ADHD children seated on a therapy ball showed a significant improvement in reaction time compared with when seated on the chair. In the parietal lobe, the ADHD group had a significantly delayed P300 latency during chair seating compared with the control group. The ADHD group showed a significantly shorter P300 latency time when seated on a therapy ball.

However, the brain mechanisms for differentiating one face from another are not well understood. In the present study, using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the brain responses to faces that varied in identity strength as a result of morphing individual faces to an "average" face in steps of 10%. Participants performed a face identification task. Behavioral results showed categorical boundaries of face identification at 30% and 70%. Face identity strength related to initial brain responses occurring shortly after 200 ms in the ventral P2 and the N250 components: stronger identity strength was associated with a smaller P2 and a larger N250. In contrast, the brain responses within 200 ms, as reflected by the P1, the N170, and the dorsal P2 component, were not affected by face identity strength. Consistent with recent imaging studies and animal research, our results provide the ERP evidence for brain responses to variations in face identity strength relative to an "average" face. Furthermore, with the high temporal resolution of ERPs, our results help to clarify the timing of neural events that are associated with the different stages involved in recognizing individual faces, thus providing a timeline for the classical face recognition model in the brain.

Toward an electrocortical biomarker of cognition for newborn infants	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY CHANGE DETECTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG; DISCRIMINATION; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYSFUNCTION	The event-related potential (ERP) effect of mismatch negativity (MMN) was the first electrophysiological probe to evaluate cognitive processing (change detection) in newborn infants. Initial studies of MMN predicted clinical utility for this measure in identification of infants at risk for developmental cognitive deficits. These predictions have not been realized. We hypothesized that in sleeping newborn infants, measures derived from wavelet assessment of power in the MMN paradigm would be more robust markers of the brains response to stimulus change than the ERP-derived MMN. Consistent with this premise, we found increased power in response to unpredictable and infrequent tones compared to frequent tones. These increases were present at multiple locations on the scalp over a range of latencies and frequencies and occurred even in the absence of an ERP-derived MMN. There were two predominant effects. First, theta band power was elevated at middle and late latencies (200 to 600 ms), suggesting that neocortical theta rhythms that subserve working memory in adults are present at birth. Second, late latency (500 ms) increased power to the unpredictable and infrequent tones was observed in the beta and gamma bands, suggesting that oscillations involved in adult cognition are also present in the neonate. These findings support the expectation that frequency dependent measures, such as wavelet power, will improve the prospects for a clinically useful test of cortical function early in the postnatal period.

Latency Correction of Error Potentials Between Different Experiments Reduces Calibration Time for Single-Trial Classification	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			P300	One fundamental limitation of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces is the time needed to calibrate the system prior to the detection of signals, due to the wide variety of issues affecting the EEG measurements. For event-related potentials (ERP), one of these sources of variability is the application performed: Protocols with different cognitive workloads might yield to different latencies of the ERPs. In this sense, it is still not clear the effect that these latency variations have on the single-trial classification. This work studies the differences in the latencies of error potentials across three experiments with increasing cognitive workloads. A delay-correction algorithm based on the cross-correlation of the averaged signals is presented, and tested with a single-trial classification of the signals. The results showed that latency variations exist between different protocols, and that it is feasible to re-use data from previous experiments to calibrate a classifier able to detect the signals of a new experiment, thus reducing the calibration time.				iturrate@unizar.es; ricardo.chavarriaga@epfl.ch; montesano@unizar.es; jminguez@unizar.es; jose.millan@epfl.ch	Iturrate, Inaki/B-2396-2018; Chavarriaga, Ricardo/F-8952-2013; del R.

However, little is known about predictors of non-response associated with rTMS treatment. Objective: This study examined neurophysiological parameters (EEG and ERP) in 90 depressed patients treated with rTMS and psychotherapy and sought to identify predictors of non-response. Methods: This study is a multi-site open-label study assessing pre-treatment EEG and ERP measures associated with non-response to rTMS treatment. Results: Non-responders were characterized by 1) Increased fronto-central theta EEG power, 2) a slower anterior individual alpha peak frequency, 3) a larger P300 amplitude, and 4) decreased pre-frontal delta and beta cordance. A discriminant analysis yielded a significant model, and subsequent ROC curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.814. Conclusions: Several EEG variables demonstrated clear differences between R and NR such as the anterior iAPF, fronto-central Theta and pre-frontal cordance in the Delta and Beta band (representative of increased relative pre-frontal perfusion). The increased P300 amplitude as a predictor for non-response requires further study, since this was the opposite as hypothesized and there were no correlations of this measure with clinical improvement for the whole sample. Combining these biomarkers in a discriminant analysis resulted in a reliable identification of non-responders with low false positive rates. Future studies should prospectively replicate these findings and also further investigate appropriate treatments for the sub-groups of non-responders identified in this study, given that most of these biomarkers have also been found in antidepressant medication studies.

Neural correlates of auditory distraction revealed in theta-band EEG	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						attention; auditory perception; distraction; EEG; EEG phase desynchronization; event-related potentials; N1; phase locking; power; theta	TRANSIENT SPATIAL ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; COMPONENTS; COHERENCE; MECHANISM; CORTEX; BRAIN	Selective attention involves the exclusion of irrelevant information in order to optimize perception of a single source of sensory input; failure to do so often results in the familiar phenomenon of distraction. The term 'distraction' broadly refers to a perceptual phenomenon. In the present study we attempted to find the electrophysiological correlates of distraction using an auditory discrimination task. EEG and event-related potential responses to identical stimuli were compared under two levels of distraction (continuous broad-band noise or continuous speech). Relative to broad-band noise, the presence of a continuous speech signal in the unattended ear impaired task performance and also attenuated the N1 peak evoked by nontarget stimuli in the attended ear. As the magnitude of a peak in the event-related potential waveform can be modulated by differences in intertrial power but also by differences in the stability of EEG phase across trials, we sought to characterize the effect of distraction on intertrial power and intertrial phase locking around the latency of the N1. The presence of continuous speech resulted in a prominent reduction of theta EEG band intertrial phase locking around the latency of the N1. This suggests that distraction may act not only to disrupt a sensory gain mechanism but also to disrupt the temporal fidelity with which the brain responds to stimulus events.

Several reports indicate that children with ASD show reduced error processing and deficient behavioral correction after an error is committed. Error sensitivity can be readily examined by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) associated with responses to errors, the fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), and the error-related positivity (Pe). The goal of our study was to investigate whether reaction time (RT), error rate, post-error RT change, ERN, and Pe will show positive changes following 12-week long slow frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in high functioning children with ASD. We hypothesized that 12 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS bilaterally applied over the DLPFC will result in improvements reflected in both behavioral and ERP measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either active rTMS treatment or wait-list (WTL) groups. Baseline and post-TMS/or WTL EEG was collected using 128 channel EEG system. The task involved the recognition of a specific illusory shape, in this case a square or triangle, created by three or four inducer disks. ERN in TMS treatment group became significantly more negative. The number of omission errors decreased post-TMS. The RT did not change, but post-error RT became slower. There were no changes in RT, error rate, post-error RT slowing, nor in ERN/Pe measures in the wait-list group. Our results show significant post-TMS differences in the response-locked ERP such as ERN, as well as behavioral response monitoring measures indicative of improved error monitoring and correction function. The ERN and Pe, along with behavioral performance measures, can be used as functional outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of neuromodulation (e.g., rTMS) in children with autism and thus may have important practical implications.

In this overview article, we summarize the process and products of the sixth meeting in this series, which focused on the identification of promising imaging paradigms, based on the measurement of cognitive evoked potentials (event-related potential) of cognition-related time-frequency analyses of the electroencephalography as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 23 well-specified paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that measure cognitive functions previously identified as targets for treatment development were identified at the meeting as being recommended for the further developmental work needed in order to validate and optimize them as biomarker measures. Individual paradigms are discussed in detail in 6 domain-based articles in this volume. Ongoing issues related to the development of these and other measures as valid, sensitive and reliable measurement, and assessment tools, as well as the steps necessary for the development of specific measures for use as biomarkers for treatment development and personalized medicine, are discussed.

However, previous studies typically did not include a paradigm-independent measure of either stimulus or response conflict. Here we have combined electro-myography (EMG) with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in order to determine whether a particularly robust marker of conflict processing, the N450 ERP effect usually related to the activity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), is related to stimulus- or to response-conflict processing. EMG provided paradigm-independent measure of response conflict. In a numerical Stroop paradigm participants compared pairs of digits and pressed a button on the side where they saw the larger digit. 50% of digit-pairs were preceded by an effective cue which provided accurate information about the required response. 50% of trials were preceded by a neutral cue which did not communicate the side of response. Results: EMG showed that response conflict was significantly larger in neutrally than in effectively cued trials. The N450 was similar when response conflict was high and when it was low. Conclusions: We conclude that the N450 is related to stimulus or abstract, rather than to response conflict detection/resolution. Findings may enable timing ACC conflict effects.

SRC effects were eliminated in mixed tasks and reversed following incompatible trials. In mixed tasks, early preferential response activation was present in stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) but reduced following incompatible trials. In event-related potentials (ERPs), stimulus-locked N2 was enhanced in all mixed trials but was not significantly influenced by the preceding trial. A response-locked fronto-central negative component (N-120), peaking just before the response, was largest for mixed compatible trials preceded by incompatible trials. This N-120 was paired with an enhancement to the peak of the response-locked LRP. Proactive control is involved in selection of an S-R mapping via the indirect route of a dual-route model. Reactive control corrects the S-R mapping, particularly when alternating between S-R mappings.	[Mansfield, Karen L.; Van Boxtel, Geert J.

Time course of ERP generators to syllables in infants: A source localization study using age-appropriate brain templates	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Anterior cingulate cortex; Auditory cortex; Event-related potentials; Infants; MRI; Source localization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; EARLY LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; CORTICAL SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; NON-SPEECH STIMULI; SELF-REGULATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION	Event-related potentials (ERPs) have become an important tool in the quest to understand how infants process perceptual information. Identification of the activation loci of the ERP generators is a technique that provides an opportunity to explore the neural substrates that underlie auditory processing. Nevertheless, as infant brain templates from healthy, non-clinical samples have not been available, the majority of source localization studies in infants have used non-realistic head models, or brain templates derived from older children or adults. Given the dramatic structural changes seen across infancy, all of which profoundly affect the electrical fields measured with EEG, it is important to use individual MRIs or age-appropriate brain templates and parameters to explore the localization and time course of auditory ERP sources. In this study 6-month-old infants were presented with a passive oddball paradigm using consonant-vowel (CV) syllables that differed in voice onset time. Dense-array EEG/ERPs were collected while the infants were awake and alert. In addition, MRIs were acquired during natural non-sedated sleep for a subset of the sample. Discrete dipole and distributed source models were mapped onto individual and averaged infant MRIs. The CV syllables elicited a positive deflection at about 200 ms followed by a negative deflection that peaked around 400 ms. The source models generated placed the dipoles at temporal areas close to auditory cortex for both positive and negative responses. Notably, an additional dipole for the positive peak was localized at the frontal area, at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) level. ACC activation has been reported in adults, but has not, to date, been reported in infants during processing of speech-related signals. The frontal ACC activation was earlier but smaller in amplitude than the left and right auditory temporal activations. These results demonstrate that in infancy the ERP generators to CV syllables are localized in cortical areas similar to that reported in adults, but exhibit a notably different temporal course. Specifically, ACC activation in infants significantly precedes auditory temporal activation, whereas in adults ACC activation follows that of temporal cortex. We suggest that these timing differences could be related to current maturational changes, to the ongoing construction of language-specific phonetic maps, and/or to more sensitive attentional switching as a response to speech signals in infancy.

However, the N1 has not consistently been shown to be sensitive to the difficulty of stimulus discrimination. Here, we manipulated the difficulty of stimulus discrimination by modulating the similarity between serially presented targets and nontargets. The same target stimulus was employed in both easy and difficult discrimination contexts, and these physically identical target stimuli elicited a larger N1 and smaller P3b in the difficult task context. Moreover, when targets were incorrectly categorized, N1 amplitude was diminished and a P3b was not elicited. These findings provide evidence that the N1 component reflects a sensory discrimination process that is modulated by executive control, and that this component can index discrimination errors when stimulus discrimination is difficult.

Subjects were presented with SON, subject's parent's name, and unfamiliar persons' names while they played a video game and ignored the auditory stimuli. A P3a-like frontal positivity (P440, 440?ms) indexing OR was elicited by SON only when it was the rare stimulus and its amplitude decreased with the repeated presentation of SON. Preceding the P440, SON consistently elicited an early frontal negativity (SON negativity, 170270?ms), including when SON was the high-probability stimulus, and unlike the P440, this negativity did not habituate. These results conform to the hypothesis that early preattentive processing of speech sounds distinguishes SON from other names irrespective of short-term stimulus context, and that this culminates in an OR only when SON is evaluated as being contextually meaningful.

Early Behavioral Intervention Is Associated With Normalized Brain Activity in Young Children With Autism	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism; early behavioral intervention; Early Start Denver Model; event-related potentials; brain activity	FACE; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; INFANTS	Objective: A previously published randomized clinical trial indicated that a developmental behavioral intervention, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), resulted in gains in IQ, language, and adaptive behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder. This report describes a secondary outcome measurement from this trial, EEG activity. Method: Forty-eight 18- to 30-month-old children with autism spectrum disorder were randomized to receive the ESDM or referral to community intervention for 2 years. After the intervention (age 48 to 77 months), EEG activity (event-related potentials and spectral power) was measured during the presentation of faces versus objects. Age-matched typical children were also assessed. Results: The ESDM group exhibited greater improvements in autism symptoms, IQ language, and adaptive and social behaviors than the community intervention group. The ESDM group and typical children showed a shorter Nc latency and increased cortical activation (decreased a power and increased 0 power) when viewing faces, whereas the community intervention group showed the opposite pattern (shorter latency event-related potential [ERP] and greater cortical activation when viewing objects). Greater cortical activation while viewing faces was associated with improved social behavior. Conclusions: This was the first trial to demonstrate that early behavioral intervention is associated with normalized patterns of brain activity, which is associated with improvements in social behavior, in young children with autism spectrum disorder.

The error-related negativity (ERN) is a response-locked event-related potential (ERP) that is sensitive to response conflict. The present study examines whether response conflict is detected in production by exploring a situation where multiple outputs are activated: the bilingual naming of form-related equivalents (i.e. cognates). ERPs were recorded while German-Dutch bilinguals named pictures in their first and second languages. Although cognates were named faster than non-cognates, response conflict was evident in the form of a larger ERN-like response for cognates and adaptation effects on naming, as the magnitude of cognate facilitation was smaller following the naming of cognates. Given that signals of response conflict are present during correct naming, the present results suggest that such conflict may serve as a reliable signal for monitoring in speech production.

ERPs associated with both first and second movements replicated a recent finding that Cz is more positive before hand than foot responses. Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) associated with the first movement replicated patterns observed previously with single movements, but LRPs leading up to the second movement depended strongly on the side of the first movement, possibly because of residual lateralization from it. Overall, the results suggest that the motor processes associated with limb system selection can be fully reset prior to a switch between hand and foot movements, but the processes associated with side selection may not be.

Single-trial P3 amplitude and latency informed event-related fMRI models yield different BOLD response patterns to a target detection task. Neuroimage, 47, 1532-1544, 2009]. Given that P3 is modulated by nicotine, including P3 parameters in the fMRI analysis might provide additional information about nicotine effects on brain function. A 1-mg nasal nicotine spray (0.5 mg each nostril) or placebo (pepper) spray was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, randomized, cross-over design. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI and behavioral data were recorded from 19 current smokers in response to an oddball-type visual choice RT task. Conventional general linear model analysis and single-trial P3 amplitude informed general linear model analysis of the fMRI data were performed. Comparing the nicotine with the placebo condition, reduced RTs in the nicotine condition were related to decreased BOLD responses in the conventional analysis encompassing the superior parietal lobule, the precuneus, and the lateral occipital cortex. On the other hand, reduced RTs were related to increased BOLD responses in the precentral and postcentral gyri, and ACC in the EEG-informed fMRI analysis. Our results show how integrated analyses of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data can be used to detect nicotine effects that would not have been revealed through conventional analysis of either measure in isolation. This emphasizes the significance of applying multi-modal imaging methods to pharmacoimaging.	[Warbrick, Tracy; Brinkmeyer, Juergen; Stoecker, Tony; Shah, N.

Improving the sensitivity of EEG-fMRI studies of epileptic activity by modelling eye blinks, swallowing and other video-EEG detected physiological confounds	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						IED; Modelling; Physiological	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; CORTICAL ACTIVATION PATTERNS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FOCAL EPILEPSY; PROCESSING STRATEGIES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; MOTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DISCHARGES	Rationale: To improve the sensitivity and specificity of simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) it is prudent to devise modelling strategies explaining the residual variance. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential value of including additional regressors for physiological activities, derived from video-EEG, in the modelling of haemodynamic patterns linked to interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) using simultaneously recorded video-EEG-fMRI. Methods: Ten patients with IED (focal epilepsy: 6, idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE):4) were studied. BOLD-sensitive fMRI images were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. 64-channel EEG was recorded using MR-compatible system. A custom made, dual-video-camera system synchronised with EEG was used to record video simultaneously. IEDs and physiological activities were identified and labelled on video-EEG using Brain Analyzer2. fMRI time-series data were pre-processed and analysed using SPM5 software. Two general linear models (GLM) were created; GLM1: IEDs were convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function and its derivatives. Realignment parameters and pulse regressors were included in the design matrix as confounds, GLM2: GLM1 and additional regressors identified on video-EEG including: eye blinks, hand or foot movement, chewing and swallowing were also included in the design matrix. SPM [F] maps (p<0.05, corrected for family wise error and p<0.001, uncorrected) were generated for both models. We compared the resulting blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) maps for cluster size, statistical significance and degree of concordance with the irritative zone. Results: BOLD changes relating to physiological activities were generally seen in expected brain areas. In patients with focal epilepsy, the extent and Z-score of the IED-related global maximum BOLD clusters increased in 4/6 patients and additional IED-related BOLD clusters were observed in 3/6 patients for GLM2. Also, the degree of concordance of IED-related maps with irritative zone improved for one patient for GLM2 and was unchanged for the other cases. In patients with ICE, the size and statistical significance for global maximum and other BOLD clusters increased in 2/4 patients. We conclude that the inclusion of additional regressors, derived from video based information, in the design matrix explains a greater amount of variance and can reveal additional IED-related BOLD clusters which may be part of the epileptic networks.

DCM for ERP is a recently developed advanced method for studying neuronal effective connectivity and making inference about the brain functions. DCM utilizes an iterative procedure, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, to find the optimal parameters given a set of observed events (data) and the underlying probability model, such that the likelihood function is maximized. As the EM algorithm is computationally demanding, time consuming and largely data dependent, we propose a parallel computing scheme using GPUs to achieve a fast estimation of neural effective connectivity in DCM. The computational loading of EM was partitioned and dynamically distributed to either the threads or blocks according to the DCM model complex (i.e. the number of parameters to be estimated). The performance of this dynamic loading arrangement in terms of execution time and accuracy loss were evaluated using synthetic data. The results show that our method can accelerate a computation task by about 30 times as fast as the MATLAB version.

P300 latency of event-related potential (ERP) was used to evaluate the effects of low-frequency and short-term rTMS by stimulating the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which is considered to be the related area of P300 origin. In addition, the prolonged stimulation effects on P300 latency were analyzed after applying rTMS. A figure-eight coil was used to stimulate left-right SMG, and intensity of magnetic stimulation was 80% of motor threshold. A total of 100 magnetic pulses were applied for rTMS. The effects of stimulus frequency at 0.5 or 1 Hz were determined. Following rTMS, an odd-ball task was performed and P300 latency of ERP was measured. The odd-ball task was performed at 5, 10, and 15 min post-rTMS. ERP was measured prior to magnetic stimulation as a control. Electroencephalograph (EEG) was measured at Fz, Cz, and Pz that were indicated by the international 10-20 electrode system. Results demonstrated that different effects on P300 latency occurred between 0.5-1 Hz rTMS. With 1 Hz low-frequency magnetic stimulation to the left SMG, P300 latency decreased. Compared to the control, the latency time difference was approximately 15 ms at Cz. This decrease continued for approximately 10 min post-rTMS. In contrast, 0.5 Hz rTMS resulted in delayed P300 latency. Compared to the control, the latency time difference was approximately 20 ms at Fz, and this delayed effect continued for approximately 15 min post-rTMS. Results demonstrated that P300 latency varied according to rTMS frequency. Furthermore, the duration of the effect was not similar for stimulus frequency of low-frequency rTMS.

Current systems based on the detection of ERPs only consider a single type of response to detect. Hence, the classification methods that are considered for ERP detection are binary classifiers (target vs. non target). Here we investigated multiclass classification of single-trial evoked responses during a rapid serial visual presentation task in which short video clips were presented to fifteen observers. Each trial contained potential targets that were human or non-human, stationary or moving. The goal of the classification analysis was to discriminate between three classes: moving human targets, moving non-human targets, and non-moving human targets. The analysis revealed that the mean volume under the ROC surface of 0.878. These results suggest that it is possible to efficiently discriminate between more than two types of evoked responses using single-trial detection.

To investigate whether different brain mechanisms subserve the processing of commission vs. accuracy errors, we recorded EEG in adult participants while they performed a novel speeded GO-NOGO aiming task ("the Shoot-NoShoot paradigm"). Our ERP results show that commission errors (responding during NOGO Mats) elicited a classical error-related negativity (ERN) component, followed by an error-related positivity (Pe), as well as a negativity peaking before response onset (pre-ERN). By contrast, spatial accuracy errors elicited a feedback-related negativity (ERN), which correlated with the spatial discrepancy between response ant. target position across subjects. Fast hits also elicited a pre-ERN but no ERN, suggesting that this pre-response monitoring component might be related to the detection of error likelihood. Although source analysis revealed similar generators in ACC for these different error-related negativities, the respective timing differed, suggesting that commission errors are detected rapidly based on internal motor representations, whereas the detection of accuracy errors in ACC relies on the additional and swift processing of external visual information.

LEXICAL DECISION MAKING IN ADULTS WITH DYSLEXIA: AN EVENT RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY	ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH AND CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						developmental dyslexia; English; bilingual; electrophysiology; oscillation; theta; gamma; coherence; EEG; ErP; reading; cerebral laterality	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; EEG COHERENCE; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; PROFICIENCY; MECHANISMS; LATERALITY; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS	Performance on a lexical decision task was investigated in 12 English speaking adults with dyslexia. two age-matched comparison groups of unimpaired readers were included: 14 monolingual adults and 15 late proficient bilinguals. The aim of the study was to determine the timing of neural events with event-related potentials (ErPs) during lexical decisionmaking between individuals with dyslexia and unimpaired readers (both unilingual and bilingual). ErPs were calculated for posterior sites in the left and right hemispheres and the P1 and n170 components were compared between groups. Eventrelated EEG coherence (measuring the synchrony of neural events during lexical tasks both between and within cerebral hemispheres) was also calculated for seven electrode pairs (three pairs at symmetrical locations between hemispheres, and two pairs within each hemisphere). We chose to recruit two comparison groups of unimpaired readers to better clarify the findings resulting from the right hemisphere (EEG) coherence analysis. That is, both late-proficient bilinguals and adults with dyslexia are thought to rely on right hemisphere resources during reading. We hypothesized that those with dyslexia would show less within-hemisphere coherence and more betweenhemisphere coherence than bilingual individuals. dyslexics had both lower amplitude and longer latency n170 activation than unimpaired readers, suggesting asynchronous neural activity. dyslexics showed greater synchrony between hemispheres in gamma range frequencies whereas the bilingual group showed greater synchrony in the theta frequency band (both within and between hemispheres). This study demonstrates that individuals with developmental dyslexia have reduced amplitudes in the n170 and higher synchrony between hemispheres during a reading task. The differences may be due to an asynchrony of neuronal activity at the point where word form features are distinguished.

This study aims to investigate the potential effect of a Shaolin-medicine-based dietary modification on improving executive functions and behavioral symptoms of ASD and exploring the possible underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Twenty-four children with ASD were randomly assigned into the experimental (receiving dietary modification for one month) and the control (no modification) groups. Each child was assessed on his/her executive functions, behavioral problems based on parental ratings, and event-related electroencephalography (EEG) activity during a response-monitoring task before and after the one month. The experimental group demonstrated significantly improved mental flexibility and inhibitory control after the diet modification, which continued to have a large effect size within the low-functioning subgroup. Such improvements coincided with positive evaluations by their parents on social communication abilities and flexible inhibitory control of daily behaviors and significantly enhanced event-related EEG activity at the rostral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, the control group did not show any significant improvements. These positive outcomes of a one-month dietary modification on children with ASD have implicated its potential clinical applicability for patients with executive function deficits.

Emerging evidence, however, suggests that right frontal EEG asymmetry might be linked to empathic responding. EEG was used to assess baseline asymmetries in frontal brain activity. Participants viewed images associated with a charity and then rated their sadness, personal distress, perspective-taking, and empathic concern towards the images. We found that baseline measures of right frontal asymmetry were a significant predictor of empathic concern, a relationship that was mediated by feelings of sadness. These results provide a more complex view of right frontal asymmetry and suggest that this pattern of brain activity might facilitate sensitivity towards the suffering of others.

COGNITIVE EVOKED RESPONSE POTENTIALS IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS WITHOUT DIAGNOSIS OF MINIMAL OR OVERT HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. A PILOT STUDY	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive symptoms; event-related potentials; liver cirrhosis; minimal hepatic encephalopathy; working memory; electroencephalography	WORKING-MEMORY; RAT MODEL; P300; PARTY; TASK	Liver cirrhosis is often accompanied by cognitive deficits called minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) when it is observed to a moderate extent. In the present study, brain activity and cognitive functioning were examined in patients with liver cirrhosis without MHE or overt clinical hepatic encephalopathy. A battery of neuropsychological tests and event related potentials (ERPs) were used. Moreover, an additional n-back task was administered with two difficulty levels (1- and 2-back). This task was designed to engage cognitive processes of storage and manipulation of information in working memory. The participants have to decide whether the letter shown was the same as a target (congruence condition). No significant differences were found in the performance of either the neuropsychological tests or the n-back task. However, the expected effects of decreased performance as well as a decrease in P3 amplitude with difficulty level were identified. The interaction of group x congruence condition was also observed in the P2 component time window. These results may indicate group differences manifesting in early stages of information processing in working memory. It confirms that the patients whose neuropsychological performance is within the normal range can still reveal subtle changes in CNS functioning visible in ERP research. The study confirms the usability of the ERP method in diagnosis of neurocognitive functions in patients with liver cirrhosis, which seems to be more sensitive than neuropsychological tests.

In recent decades, analysis of this activity has been not only the focus of interest for description of sensory-cognitive processes, but has also led to trials for establishing new hypotheses. The present review and the companion review aim to constitute an ensemble of "reasonings and suggestions" to understand alpha oscillations based on a wide range of accumulated findings rather than a trial to launch a new "alpha theory". Surveyed descriptions related to physiology and brain function: The review starts with descriptions of earlier extracellular recordings, field potentials and also considers earlier alpha hypotheses. Analytical descriptions of evoked and event-related responses, event-related desynchronization, the relationship between spontaneous activity and evoked potentials, aging brain, pathology and alpha response in cognitive impairment are in the content of this review. In essence, the gamut of the survey includes a multiplicity of evidence on functional correlates in sensory processing, cognition, memory and vegetative system, including the spinal cord and heart.

Online detection of error-related potentials boosts the performance of mental typewriters	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; ERP-Speller; Error-related potentials; Information transfer rate	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ERP COMPONENTS; SPELLER; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Background: Increasing the communication speed of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a major aim of current BCI research. The idea to automatically detect error-related potentials (ErrPs) in order to veto erroneous decisions of a BCI has been existing for more than one decade, but this approach was so far little investigated in online mode. Methods: In our study with eleven participants, an ErrP detection mechanism was implemented in an electroencephalography (EEG) based gaze-independent visual speller. Results: Single-trial ErrPs were detected with a mean accuracy of 89.1% (AUC 0.90). The spelling speed was increased on average by 49.0% using ErrP detection. The improvement in spelling speed due to error detection was largest for participants with low spelling accuracy. Conclusion: The performance of BCIs can be increased by using an automatic error detection mechanism. The benefit for patients with motor disorders is potentially high since they often have rather low spelling accuracies compared to healthy people.

Several studies have also discovered the response inhibition ability impairment in alexithymia. However, few studies on alexithymic individuals have specifically examined how emotional context modulates response inhibition procedure. In order to investigate emotion cognition interaction in alexithymia, we analyzed the spatiao-temporal features of such emotional response inhibition by the approaches of event-related potentials and neural source-localization. Method: The study participants included 15 subjects with high alexithymia scores on the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (alexithymic group) and 15 matched subjects with low alexithymia scores (control group). Subjects were instructed to perform a modified emotional Go/Nogo task while their continuous electroencephalography activities were synchronously recorded. The task includes 3 categories of emotional contexts (positive, negative and neutral) and 2 letters ("M'' and "W'') centered in the screen. Participants were told to complete go and nogo actions based on the letters. We tested the influence of alexithymia in this emotional Go/Nogo task both in behavioral level and related neural activities of N2 and P3 ERP components. Results: We found that negatively valenced context elicited larger central P3 amplitudes of the Nogo-Go difference wave in the alexithymic group than in the control group. Furthermore, source-localization analyses implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as the neural generator of the Nogo-P3. Conclusion: These findings suggest that difficulties in identifying feelings, particularly in negative emotions, is a major feature of alexithymia, and the ACC plays a critical role in emotion-modulated response inhibition related to alexithymia.

Feasibility and test-retest reliability of an electroencephalography-based brain mapping system in children with cerebral palsy: a preliminary investigation. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:882-8. Objective: To investigate the feasibility and test-retest reliability of a novel electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain mapping system in healthy children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). Design: Correlation statistics. Setting: University brain mapping and neurorehabilitation laboratory. Participants: A convenience sample of children (N=12; 5 healthy children, mean +/- SD, 12.6 +/- 0.89y; 7 children with CP, mean +/- SD, 9.71 +/- 1.1y) participated in the study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Mu band (8-12Hz) power values in event-related spectral perturbation maps during reach and grasp hand movements were repeatedly measured on 2 separate occasions (2h apart). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC1,2) tests were computed to determine test-retest reliability at the standard level of significance (P<.004). In addition, the feasibility of the system was determined by evaluating potential differences in the cortical activation areas obtained from topographical maps during actual reach and grasp motor tasks between healthy children and children with CP. Results: The test-retest reliability results showed excellent reliability between the repeated measures, ranging from .93 (P=.000) to .99 (P=.000). Our EEG brain mapping system was capable of distinguishing differences in the cortical activity power (mu band power spectra) between healthy children and children with CP. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first evidence demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the EEG brain mapping system. Clinically, this system provides important insights into neuroplasticity associated with motor recovery after treatment and can also be used as real-time neuro-feedback or noninvasive neuromodulation in the course of neurologic rehabilitation.

This paradigm might serve as a translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected, LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that the predictability of the occurence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component. Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing.

Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI): High-density electrical mapping of inhibitory processes during walking.	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			ATTENTION; GAIT	The present study investigated the feasibility of acquiring high-density event-related brain potential (ERP) recordings during treadmill walking in human subjects. The work builds upon recent studies testing the applicability of real-world tasks while obtaining electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Participants performed a response inhibition GO/NOGO task designed to evoke a P3 component for correct response inhibitions and an error-related negativity (ERN) for incorrect commission errors - while speed of walking was experimentally manipulated. Robust P3 and ERN components were obtained under all experimental conditions - while participants were sitting, walking at moderate speed (2.4 km/hour), or walking rapidly (5 km/hour). Signal-to-noise ratios were remarkably similar across conditions, pointing to the feasibility of high-fidelity ERP recordings under relatively vigorous activity regimens. There is considerable research and clinical motivation to obtain high quality neurophysiological measures under more naturalistic environmental settings such as these. Strong links between cognitive load and gait abnormalities are seen in a number of clinical populations and these MoBI technologies provide highly promising methods for gaining insights into the underlying pathophysiology.

Motion-related artefacts in EEG predict neuronally plausible patterns of activation in fMRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/fMRI; Artefacts; Motion; Attention; Network	WORKING-MEMORY; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; SIMULTANEOUS EEG/FMRI; IMAGING-ARTIFACT; PULSE ARTIFACT; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN BRAIN; RECORDINGS; REMOVAL; MRI	The simultaneous acquisition and subsequent analysis of EEG and fMRI data is challenging owing to increased noise levels in the EEG data. A common method to integrate data from these two modalities is to use aspects of the EEG data, such as the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERP) or oscillatory EEG activity, to predict fluctuations in the fMRI data. However, this relies on the acquisition of high quality datasets to ensure that only the correlates of neuronal activity are being studied. In this study, we investigate the effects of head-motion-related artefacts in the EEG signal on the predicted T2*-weighted signal variation. We apply our analyses to two independent datasets: 1) four participants were asked to move their feet in the scanner to generate small head movements, and 2) four participants performed an episodic memory task. We created T2*-weighted signal predictors from indicators of abrupt head motion using derivatives of the realignment parameters, from visually detected artefacts in the EEG as well as from three EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha and beta). In both datasets, we found little correlation between the T2*-weighted signal and EEG predictors that were not convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (cHRF). However, all convolved EEG predictors strongly correlated with the T2*-weighted signal variation in various regions including the bilateral superior temporal cortex, supplementary motor area, medial parietal cortex and cerebellum. The finding that movement onset spikes in the EEG predict T2*-weighted signal intensity only when the time course of movements is convolved with the cHRF, suggests that the correlated signal might reflect a BOLD response to neural activity associated with head movement. Furthermore, the observation that broad-spectral EEG spikes tend to occur at the same time as abrupt head movements, together with the finding that abrupt movements and EEG spikes show similar correlations with the T2*-weighted signal, indicates that the EEG spikes are produced by abrupt movement and that continuous regressors of EEG oscillations contain motion-related noise even after stringent correction of the EEG data. If not properly removed, these artefacts complicate the use of EEG data as a predictor of T2*-weighted signal variation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Towards the detection of error-related potentials and its integration in the context of a P300 speller brain-computer interface	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Brain-computer interface; Error related potential; Machine learning; P300	ACQUISITION	A P300 Speller is a brain-computer interface (BCI) that enables subjects to spell text on a computer screen by detecting P300 Event-Related Potentials in their electroencephalograms (EEG). This BCI application is of particular interest to disabled patients who have lost all means of verbal and motor communication. Error-related Potentials (ErrPs) in the EEG are generated by the subject's perception of an error. We report on the possibility of using these ErrPs for improving the performance of a P300 Speller. Overall nine subjects were tested, allowing us to study their EEG responses to correct and incorrect performances of the BCI, compare our findings to previous studies, explore the possibility of detecting ErrPs and discuss the integration of ErrP classifiers into the P300 Speller system.

Single trial time-frequency domain analysis of error processing in post-traumatic stress disorder	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						PTSD; Event-related potentials; Error-related negativity (ERN); Error-related positivity (Pe); Theta band; Continuous wavelet transform	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FMRI; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; AWARENESS; TUTORIAL; DYNAMICS; ERP	Error processing studies in psychology and psychiatry are relatively common. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used as measures of error processing, two such response-locked ERPs being the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error-related positivity (Pe). The ERN and Pe occur following committed error in reaction time tasks as low frequency (4-8 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations registered at the midline fronto-central sites. We created an alternative method for analyzing error processing using time-frequency analysis in the form of a wavelet transform. A study was conducted in which subjects with PTSD and healthy control completed a forced-choice task. Single trial EEG data from errors in the task were processed using a continuous wavelet transform. Coefficients from the transform that corresponded to the theta range were averaged to isolate a theta waveform in the time-frequency domain. Measures called the time-frequency ERN and Pe were obtained from these waveforms for five different channels and then averaged to obtain a single time-frequency ERN and Pe for each error trial. A comparison of the amplitude and latency for the time-frequency ERN and Pe between the PTSD and control group was performed. A significant group effect was found on the amplitude of both measures. These results indicate that the developed single trial time-frequency error analysis method is suitable for examining error processing in PTSD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.

J	Henry, MJ; Obleser, J				Henry, Molly J.; Obleser, Jonas			Frequency modulation entrains slow neural oscillations and optimizes human listening behavior	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						pre-stimulus phase; auditory processing; EEG; FM	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-PHASE; TERM-MEMORY; EEG; SPEECH; DYNAMICS; TIME; EXCITABILITY	The human ability to continuously track dynamic environmental stimuli, in particular speech, is proposed to profit from "entrainment" of endogenous neural oscillations, which involves phase reorganization such that "optimal" phase comes into line with temporally expected critical events, resulting in improved processing. The current experiment goes beyond previous work in this domain by addressing two thus far unanswered questions. First, how general is neural entrainment to environmental rhythms: Can neural oscillations be entrained by temporal dynamics of ongoing rhythmic stimuli with-out abrupt onsets? Second, does neural entrainment optimize performance of the perceptual system: Does human auditory perception benefit from neural phase reorganization? In a human electroencephalography study, listeners detected short gaps distributed uniformly with respect to the phase angle of a 3-Hz frequency-modulated stimulus. Listeners' ability to detect gaps in the frequency-modulated sound was not uniformly distributed in time, but clustered in certain preferred phases of the modulation. Moreover, the optimal stimulus phase was individually determined by the neural delta oscillation entrained by the stimulus. Finally, delta phase predicted behavior better than stimulus phase or the event-related potential after the gap. This study demonstrates behavioral benefits of phase realignment in response to frequency-modulated auditory stimuli, overall suggesting that frequency fluctuations in natural environmental input provide a pacing signal for endogenous neural oscillations, thereby influencing perceptual processing.

In the current study we investigate how a core cognitive network of the human brain, the perceptual decision system, can be characterized regarding its spatiotemporal representation of task-relevant information. We capitalize on a recently developed information theoretic framework for the analysis of simultaneously acquired electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging data (fMRI) (Ostwald et al. (2010), NeuroImage 49: 498-516). We show how this framework naturally extends from previous validations in the sensory to the cognitive domain and how it enables the economic description of neural spatiotemporal information encoding. Specifically, based on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data features from n=13 observers performing a visual perceptual decision task, we demonstrate how the information theoretic framework is able to reproduce earlier findings on the neurobiological underpinnings of perceptual decisions from the response signal features' marginal distributions. Furthermore, using the joint EEG-fMRI feature distribution, we provide novel evidence for a highly distributed and dynamic encoding of task-relevant information in the human brain.

In this perspective, several functional brain imaging tools are currently under development. Bedside cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from the EEG signal are a good candidate to explore consciousness in these patients because: (1) they have an optimal time resolution within the millisecond range able to monitor the stream of consciousness, (2) they are fully non-invasive and relatively cheap, (3) they can be recorded continuously on dedicated individual systems to monitor consciousness and to communicate with patients, (4) and they can be used to enrich patients' autonomy through brain-computer interfaces. We recently designed an original auditory rule extraction ERP test that evaluates cerebral responses to violations of temporal regularities that are either local in time or global across several seconds. Local violations led to an early response in auditory cortex, independent of attention or the presence of a concurrent visual task, while global violations led to a late and spatially distributed response that was only present when subjects were attentive and aware of the violations. In the present work, we report the results of this test in 65 successive recordings obtained at bedside from 49 non-communicating patients affected with various acute or chronic neurological disorders. At the individual level, we confirm the high specificity of the 'global effect': only conscious patients presented this proposed neural signature of conscious processing. Here, we also describe in details the respective neural responses elicited by violations of local and global auditory regularities, and we report two additional ERP effects related to stimuli expectancy and to task learning, and we discuss their relations to consciousness.

Box for interaction with objects (BIO): A new device to synchronize the presentation of objects with electrophysiological recordings	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Device; Emotion; Movement; Event-related potentials; Stimulus onset	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULI; EMOTION; REPETITION; MODULATION; VALENCE; AROUSAL; P300	Brain event-related potentials are a useful tool for investigating visual processing and action planning. This technique requires extremely accurate synchronization of stimulus delivery with recordings. The precision of the onset time of visual stimulus delivery is a major challenge when attempting to use real, three-dimensional objects as stimuli. Here, we present an innovative device, the "box for interaction with objects" (BIO), that is designed to synchronize the presentation of objects with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. To reach the required resolution of stimulus-onset timing, the BIO system features an interface with reflective glass and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). When the LEDs inside the BIO are turned on, the object inside becomes visible, and a synchronizing pulse is sent to the recording systems. The BIO was tested in a motivational study that focused on visual and motor event-related potentials. EEG signals were recorded during the presentation of an emotion-laden object that could be grasped and brought close to the participant's chest. BIO successfully synchronized the appearance of a three-dimensional object with EEG recordings, which would allow for an analysis of visual and motor event-related potentials in the same experiment. The BIO device, through a high-quality psychophysiological approach, offers a new perspective for the study of the motivational factors that drive actions toward relevant stimuli.

The N400 effects of ON (260500?ms) were larger and showed a different scalp distribution for low than for high frequency words, which is consistent with proposals that suggest lateral inhibitory mechanisms at a lexical level. The ERP ON effects had a shorter duration and different scalp distribution than the effects of word frequency (mainly observed between 380600?ms) suggesting a transient activation of the subset of orthographically similar words in the lexical network compared to the impact of properties of the single words.

The present report is a review of the significant role of alpha activity in memory and cognitive processes in healthy subjects, and in cognitive impairment. The role of neurotransmitters is also described, briefly, in this context. Towards an understanding of brain alpha: Despite numerous experimental studies, it is indicated that the presented results are only appropriate to establish an ensemble of reasonings and suggestions for analyzing "alphas" in the whole brain. In turn, in the near future, these reasonings and suggestions may serve (or are indispensable to serve) as fundaments of more general and tenable hypotheses on the genesis and function of "alphas".

Early ERPs to faces and objects are driven by phase, not amplitude spectrum information: Evidence from parametric, test-retest, single-subject analyses	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						phase spectrum; amplitude spectrum; object categorization; face categorization; event-related potentials; general linear model	TIME-COURSE; DECISION-MAKING; CATEGORIZATION; SCENE; REPRESENTATION; ECCENTRICITY; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; FEATURES; NOISE	One major challenge in determining how the brain categorizes objects is to tease apart the contribution of low-level and high-level visual properties to behavioral and brain imaging data. So far, studies using stimuli with equated amplitude spectra have shown that the visual system relies mostly on localized information, such as edges and contours, carried by phase information. However, some researchers have argued that some event-related potentials (ERP) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) categorical differences could be driven by nonlocalized information contained in the amplitude spectrum. The goal of this study was to provide the first systematic quantification of the contribution of phase and amplitude spectra to early ERPs to faces and objects. We conducted two experiments in which we recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) from eight subjects, in two sessions each. In the first experiment, participants viewed images of faces and houses containing original or scrambled phase spectra combined with original, averaged, or swapped amplitude spectra. In the second experiment, we parametrically manipulated image phase and amplitude in 10% intervals. We performed a range of analyses including detailed single-subject general linear modeling of ERP data, test-retest reliability, and unique variance analyses. Our results suggest that early ERPs to faces and objects are due to phase information, with almost no contribution from the amplitude spectrum. Importantly, our results should not be used to justify uncontrolled stimuli; to the contrary, our results emphasize the need for stimulus control (including the amplitude spectrum), parametric designs, and systematic data analyses, of which we have seen far too little in ERP vision research.

This paper presents a novel P300-based speller called lateral single-character (LSC). The LSC performance is compared to that of the standard row-column (RC) speller. Methods: We developed LSC, a single-character paradigm comprising all letters of the alphabet following an event strategy that significantly reduces the time for symbol selection, and explores the intrinsic hemispheric asymmetries in visual perception to improve the performance of the BCI. RC and LSC paradigms were tested by 10 able-bodied participants, seven participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), five participants with cerebral palsy (CP), one participant with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and one participant with spinal cord injury (SCI). Results: The averaged results, taking into account all participants who were able to control the BCI online, were significantly higher for LSC, 26.11 bit/min and 89.90% accuracy, than for RC, 21.91 bit/min and 88.36% accuracy. The two paradigms produced different waveforms and the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly higher for LSC. Finally, the novel LSC also showed new discriminative features. Conclusions: The results suggest that LSC is an effective alternative to RC, and that LSC still has a margin for potential improvement in bit rate and accuracy. Significance: The high bit rates and accuracy of LSC are a step forward for the effective use of BCI in clinical applications. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants were given short stories describing an initial situation ("Marta wanted to plant flowers in her garden ...."), followed by a critical sentence describing a new situation in either a factual ("Since she found a spade, she started to dig a hole") or counterfactual format ("If she had found a spade, she would have started to dig a hole"), and then a continuation sentence that was either related to the initial situation ("she bought a spade") or to the new one ("she planted roses"). The ERPs recorded for the continuation sentences related to the initial situation showed larger negativity after factuals than after counterfactuals, suggesting that the counterfactual's presupposition - the events did not occur prevents updating the here-and-now of discourse. By contrast, continuation sentences related to the new situation elicited similar ERPs under both factual and counterfactual contexts, suggesting that counterfactuals also activate momentarily an alternative "as if" meaning. However, the reduction of gamma power following counterfactuals, suggests that the "as if" meaning is not integrated into the discourse, nor does it contribute to semantic unification processes.

First published August 1, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00391.2012.-High-frequency conditioning electrical stimulation (HFS) of human skin induces an increased pain sensitivity to mechanical stimuli in the surrounding nonconditioned skin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HFS on reported pain sensitivity to single electrical stimuli applied within the area of conditioning stimulation. We also investigated the central nervous system responsiveness to these electrical stimuli by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs). Single electrical test stimuli were applied in the conditioned area before and 30 min after HFS. During electrical test stimulation, the reported pain intensity (numerical rating scale) and EEG (ERPs) were measured. Thirty minutes after conditioning stimulation, we observed a decrease of reported pain intensity at both the conditioned and control (opposite arm) skin site in response to the single electrical test stimuli. In contrast, we observed enhanced ERP amplitudes after HFS at the conditioned skin site, compared with control site, in response to the single electrical test stimuli. Recently, it has been proposed that ERPs, at least partly, reflect a saliency detection system. Therefore, the enhanced ERPs might reflect enhanced saliency to potentially threatening stimuli.

Most research investigating BCI in humans have used scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). We have recently demonstrated that signals from intracranial electrocorticogiaphy (ECoG) and stereotactic depth electrodes (SDE) in the hippocampus can be used to control a BCI P300 Speller paradigm. We report a case in which stereotactic depth electrodes positioned in the ventricle were able to obtain viable signals for a BCI. Our results demonstrate that event-related potentials from intraventricular electrodes can be used to reliably control the P300 Speller BCI paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under challenging perceptual conditions, such as when pictures are briefly presented, color might facilitate scene segmentation and/or function as a semantic cue via association with scene-relevant concepts (e.g., red and blood/injury). To clarify the influence of color on affective picture perception, we compared the late positive potentials (LPP) to color versus grayscale pictures, presented for very brief (24?ms) and longer (6?s) exposure durations. Results indicated that removing color information had no effect on the affective modulation of the LPP, regardless of exposure duration. These findings imply that the recognition of the emotional content of scenes, even when presented very briefly, does not critically rely on color information.

This tendency is stronger for meaningful noise such as music and conversation than for meaningless noise such as road traffic noise. This paper describes the psychophysiological effects of meaningful noise. Specifically, we first focus on the degree of meaningfulness of noise, then discuss how the brain responds during auditory cognitive tasks. Transient event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by internal or external stimuli, can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG). P300 ERPs are related to the operation of selective attention. The present experiment was designed to determine the effects of meaningfulness of the noise on a odd-ball paradigm. To this end, we examined differences in the P300 ERPs of these components. In addition, we considered the psychological impression of annoyance in response to the noise, and a performance, such as reaction time.

Case history: The patient described here was an Olympic athlete who placed much lower than expected in the games. His mental state was measured in three respects: neuronal (using event-related potentials), social, and cognitive (using standardized tests). He then went through a program of neurotherapy; HRV biofeedback was used for ten minutes over two days, along with EEG feedback (neurofeedback) for 20 minutes. Before neurotherapy, the amplitudes of the ERPs under a NOGO stimulus (motor inhibition) were in the normal range. Results: A high score for the control of aggression was accompanied by auto-aggression, which corresponds to cortical inhibition, and can cause negative emotions towards others to be suppressed and directed towards oneself, and thus may contribution to the creation of contusions, along with low scores for external and general aggression. After Alpha Training, the subject was quicker in reaction than the norm. The differences in the ERPs for NOGO conditions were statistically significant. These results may be an essential indicator of a high level of behavior control (not intention), including aggressive behaviors.

Dissociable Components of Cognitive Control: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Study of Response Inhibition and Interference Suppression	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; STOP-SIGNAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STROOP; TASK; FLANKER; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS	Background: Cognitive control refers to the ability to selectively attend and respond to task-relevant events while resisting interference from distracting stimuli or prepotent automatic responses. The current study aimed to determine whether interference suppression and response inhibition are separable component processes of cognitive control. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fourteen young adults completed a hybrid Go/Nogo flanker task and continuous EEG data were recorded concurrently. The incongruous flanker condition (that required interference suppression) elicited a more centrally distributed topography with a later N2 peak than the Nogo condition (that required response inhibition). Conclusions/Significance: These results provide evidence for the dissociability of interference suppression and response inhibition, indicating that taxonomy of inhibition is warranted with the integration of research evidence from neuroscience.

In the first series of the experiments, subjects had to read the presented verbal stimuli, in the second series they had to press a button when seeing a word, and in the third series they were instructed to press the button when seeing a pseudo-word. We studied components N170, P300 and N400. In the group of healthy subjects, the amplitude of N170 increased to words in the situation of their relevance, which corresponds to the "recognition potential", whereas in the group of patients, the amplitude of N170 increased to pseudo-words when they were relevant. So it was a paradoxical response. The amplitude of the ER P later waves (P300 and N400) in the group of schizophrenic patients was smaller and the relevance effect was impaired when the target stimuli were pseudo-words. However, the incongruity effect consisting in an increase in N400 amplitude to a non-target stimulus remained intact in patients.	[Maryina, I. V.; Strelets, V.

Its underlying pathophysiology is defined by deficient functioning of neural pathways at different levels of the central nervous system. However, a few studies have examined the brain responses associated with executive functions such as error monitoring in MD. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) in professional pianists during the performance of memorized music sequences at fast tempi. Event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to pitch errors were investigated in MD and a control group. In MD patients, significantly larger error-related brain responses before and following errors were observed as compared with healthy pianists. Our results suggest that in MD, the generalized degraded neural activity at all levels of the central nervous system is manifested in specific neural correlates of the executive functions that monitor an overlearned sensorimotor performance.

VISUAL CORTICAL RESPONSES TO THE INPUT FROM THE AMBLYOPIC EYE ARE SUPPRESSED DURING BINOCULAR VIEWING	ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Amblyopia; interocular suppression; visual cortex; EEG; functional magnetic resonance imaging	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; RIVALRY; FACE; ACTIVATION; HUMANS; ADAPTATION; INVARIANT; AWARENESS	Amblyopia is a visual disorder caused by an anomalous early visual experience. It has been suggested that suppression of the visual input from the weaker eye might be a primary underlying mechanism of the amblyopic syndrome. However, it is still an unresolved question to what extent neural responses to the visual information coming from the amblyopic eye are suppressed during binocular viewing. To address this question we measured event-related potentials (ERP) to foveal face stimuli in amblyopic patients, both in monocular and binocular viewing conditions. The results revealed no difference in the amplitude and latency of early components of the ERP responses between the binocular and fellow eye stimulation. On the other hand, early ERP components were reduced and delayed in the case of monocular stimulation of the amblyopic eye as compared to the fellow eye stimulation or to binocular viewing. The magnitude of the amblyopic effect measured on the ERP amplitudes was comparable to that found on the fMRI responses in the fusiform face area using the same face stimuli and task conditions. Our findings showing that the amblyopic effects present on the early ERP components in the case of monocular stimulation are not manifested in the ERP responses during binocular viewing suggest that input from the amblyopic eye is completely suppressed already at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing when stimuli are viewed by both eyes.

Effects of magnitude and magnitude predictability of postural perturbations on preparatory cortical activity in older adults with and without Parkinson's disease	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Electroencephalography; Contingent negative variation; Event-related desynchronization; Posture; Preparation	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CENTRAL SET; ALPHA-BAND; MOTOR; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISSOCIATION	The goal of this study was to identify whether impaired cortical preparation may relate to impaired scaling of postural responses of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that impaired scaling of postural responses in participants with PD would be associated with impaired set-dependent cortical activity in preparation for perturbations of predictable magnitudes. Participants performed postural responses to backward surface translations. We examined the effects of perturbation magnitude (predictable small vs. predictable large) and predictability of magnitude (predictable vs. unpredictable-in-magnitude) on postural responses (center-of-pressure (CoP) displacements) and on preparatory electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of contingent negative variation (CNV) and alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD). Our results showed that unpredictability of perturbation magnitude, but not the magnitude of the perturbation itself, was associated with increased CNV amplitude at the CZ electrode in both groups. While control participants scaled their postural responses to the predicted magnitude of the perturbation, their condition-related changes in CoP displacements were not correlated with condition-related changes in EEG preparatory activity (CNV or ERD). In contrast, participants with PD did not scale their postural responses to the predicted magnitude of the perturbation, but they did demonstrate greater beta ERD in the condition of predictably small-magnitude perturbations and greater beta ERD than the control participants at the CZ electrode. In addition, increased beta ERD in PD was associated with decreased adaptability of postural responses, suggesting that preparatory cortical activity may have a more direct influence on postural response scaling for people with PD than for control participants.

J	Miller, J				Miller, Jeff			Selection and preparation of hand and foot movements: Cz activity as a marker of limb system preparation	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Motor processes; Hand and foot responses; Response preparation	CHOICE-REACTION TIME; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; RESPONSE FORCE; LRP ONSET; READINESS; DIRECTION; TASK; FEET	Event-related potentials were used to examine the preparation of hand and foot responses in tasks using both limb systems. As in tasks using only one system, opposite lateralized readiness potentials were observed for hand and foot responses (Experiment 1). Furthermore, movement-related activity at Cz was more positive prior to hand than foot responses, revealing that Cz activity can be used to index selective movement preparation by one limb system. In Experiment 2, two responses were cued prior to stimulus onset. Cue-related activity at Cz was more positive with hand than foot cuing, reinforcing the conclusion that Cz activity is sensitive to selective preparation for one of these limb systems. Overall, the results show that it is possible to carry out motor preparation of two responses within the same limb system and that differential Cz activity is a useful index of this preparation in tasks with hand versus foot movements.

J	Cason, N; Schon, D				Cason, Nia; Schoen, Daniele			Rhythmic priming enhances the phonological processing of speech	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Speech and Music; Rhythm; Temporal Expectation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; PHONEME TARGETS; REACTION-TIME; REGULARITY; METER; EXPECTANCY; MODULATION; RESPONSES; FRENCH	While natural speech does not possess the same degree of temporal regularity found in music, there is recent evidence to suggest that temporal regularity enhances speech processing. The aim of this experiment was to examine whether speech processing would be enhanced by the prior presentation of a rhythmical prime. We recorded electrophysiological (EEG) and behavioural (reaction time) data while participants listened to nonsense words preceded by a simple rhythm. Results showed that speech processing was enhanced by the temporal expectations generated by the prime. Interestingly, beat and metrical structure of the prime had an effect on different ERP components elicited by the following word (N100, P300). These results indicate that using a musical-like rhythmic prime matched to the prosodic features of speech enhances phonological processing of spoken words and thus reveal a cross-domain effect of musical rhythm on the processing of speech rhythm.

Late Divergence of Target and Nontarget ERPs in a Visual Oddball Task	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Intracerebral recording; Oddball task; Visual evoked potentials; Mental counting; Memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; RARE TARGET; INTRACRANIAL ERPS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; STIMULI; MOTOR; P300; PARIETAL; HUMANS	Different mental operations were expected in the late phase of intracerebral ERPs obtained in the visual oddball task with mental counting. Therefore we searched for late divergences of target and nontarget ERPs followed by components exceeding the temporal window of the P300 wave. Electrical activity from 152 brain regions of 14 epileptic patients was recorded by means of depth electrodes. Average target and nontarget records from 1800 ms long EEG periods free of epileptic activity were compared. Late divergence preceded by almost identical course of the target and nontarget ERPs was found in 16 brain regions of 6 patients. The mean latency of the divergence point was 570+/-93 ms after the stimulus onset. The target post-divergence section of the ERP differed from the nontarget one by opposite polarity, different latency of the components, or even different number of the components. Generators of post-divergence ERP components were found in the parahippocampal gyrus, superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri, amygdala, and fronto-orbital cortex. Finding of late divergence indicates that functional differences exist even not sooner than during the final phase of the task.

However, the neural correlates of these deficits have remained elusive. The current study examined the acute, dose-related effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) on psychophysiological indices of information processing in humans. Healthy subjects (n = 26) completed three test days during which they received intravenous Delta(9)-THC (placebo, 0.015 and 0.03 mg/kg) in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized, cross-over, and counterbalanced design. Psychophysiological data (electroencephalography) were collected before and after drug administration while subjects engaged in an event-related potential (ERP) task known to be a valid index of attention and cognition (a three-stimulus auditory 'oddball' P300 task). Delta(9)-THC dose-dependently reduced the amplitude of both the target P300b and the novelty P300a. Delta(9)-THC did not have any effect on the latency of either the P300a or P300b, or on early sensory-evoked ERP components preceding the P300 (the N100). Concomitantly, Delta(9)-THC induced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective 'high' in a dose-dependent manner. Delta(9)-THC -induced reductions in P3b amplitude correlated with Delta(9)-THC-induced perceptual alterations. Lastly, exploratory analyses examining cannabis use status showed that whereas recent cannabis users had blunted behavioral effects to Delta(9)-THC, there were no dose-related effects of Delta(9)-THC on P300a/b amplitude between cannabis-free and recent cannabis users. Overall, these data suggest that at doses that produce behavioral and subjective effects consistent with the known properties of cannabis, Delta(9)-THC reduced P300a and P300b amplitudes without altering the latency of these ERPs. Cannabinoid agonists may therefore disrupt cortical processes responsible for context updating and the automatic orientation of attention, while leaving processing speed and earlier sensory ERP components intact. Collectively, the findings suggest that CB1R systems modulate top-down and bottom-up processing.

The application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to a substantial number of individual multi-channel ERPs in two variants of the cued GO/NOGO task enabled us to decompose the sensory-related ERP waves into four functionally distinct components. In the first variant of the cued GO/NOGO task images of plants were compared with images of animals (Animal-Animal pairs corresponded to GO trails, whereas Animal-Plant pairs corresponded to NOGO trials), in the second variant faces of the same person with different emotional expressions were compared. According to sLORETA the extracted components were generated in the occipital, left and right temporal and right parietal cortical areas. Each of the components was characterized by two sequential activation patterns in the GO condition. Each activation pattern included a positive fluctuation followed by a negative fluctuation. In the NOGO condition an additional mismatch positivity followed the GO-like positive fluctuation. At the early stage (around 160 ms after stimulus) the mismatch positivity at the left temporal component was associated with the hypothetical operation of comparing the physical features of the stimuli with working memory. At the late stage (around 260 ms) the mismatch positivity at the left temporal component was associated with the operation of comparing semantic features of the stimuli with working memory.

A novel method that aims to identify single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The results show that the target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i.e., a theta band (4.3 Hz) power boosting 300-700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) power boosting 500-1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) power boosting after 500 ms. The most discriminant time-frequency features are power boosting and are relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. Since the original discriminant time-frequency features are highly correlated, we constructed the uncorrelated features using hierarchical clustering for better classification of target and non-target images. With feature clustering, performance (area under ROC) improved from 0.85 to 0.89 on within-session tests, and from 0.76 to 0.84 on cross-subject tests. The constructed uncorrelated features were more robust than the original discriminant features and corresponded to a number of local regions on the time-frequency plane.

Research on this phenomenon so far suffered from the difficulty to determine the instant of the endogenous reversals with sufficient temporal precision. A novel experimental paradigm with discontinuous stimulus presentation improved on previous temporal estimates of the reversal event by a factor of three. It revealed that disambiguation of ambiguous visual information takes roughly 50 ms or two loops of recurrent neural activity. Further, the decision about the perceptual outcome has taken place at least 340 ms before the observer is able to indicate the consciously perceived reversal manually. We provide a short review about physiological studies on multistable perception with a focus on electrophysiological data. We further present a new perspective on multistable perception that can easily integrate previous apparently contradicting explanatory approaches. Finally we propose possible extensions toward other research fields where ambiguous figure perception may be useful as an investigative tool.

During a simple mindful breathing practice, sustained attention is required to maintain focus on the breath while cognitive control is required to detect mind wandering. We thus hypothesized that regular, brief mindfulness training would result in improvements in the self-regulation of attention and foster changes in neuronal activity related to attentional control. A longitudinal randomized control group EEG study was conducted. At baseline (T1), 40 meditation naive participants were randomized into a wait list group and a meditation group, who received three hours mindfulness meditation training. Twenty-eight participants remained in the final analysis. At T1, after eight weeks (T2) and after 16 weeks (T3), all participants performed a computerized Stroop task (a measure of attentional control) while the 64-channel EEG was recorded. Between T1 and T3 the meditators were requested to meditate daily for 10 min. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis highlighted two between group effects that developed over the course of the 16-week mindfulness training. An early effect at left and right posterior sites 160-240 ms post-stimulus indicated that meditation practice improved the focusing of attentional resources. A second effect at central posterior sites 310-380 ms post-stimulus reflects that meditation practice reduced the recruitment of resources during object recognition processes, especially for incongruent stimuli. Scalp topographies and source analyses (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography, VARETA) indicate relevant changes in neural sources, pertaining to left medial and lateral occipitotemporal areas for the early effect and right lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal areas for the later effect. The results suggest that mindfulness meditation may alter the efficiency of allocating cognitive resources, leading to improved self-regulation of attention.

Mapping Cortical Dynamics Using Simultaneous MEG/EEG and Anatomically-constrained Minimum-norm Estimates: an Auditory Attention Example	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 68; Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Electroencephalography; EEG; audition; attention; inverse imaging	MEG; EEG; LOCALIZATION; CORTEX; FMRI	Magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) are neuroimaging techniques that provide a high temporal resolution particularly suitable to investigate the cortical networks involved in dynamical perceptual and cognitive tasks, such as attending to different sounds in a cocktail party. Many past studies have employed data recorded at the sensor level only, i.e., the magnetic fields or the electric potentials recorded outside and on the scalp, and have usually focused on activity that is time-locked to the stimulus presentation. This type of event-related field / potential analysis is particularly useful when there are only a small number of distinct dipolar patterns that can be isolated and identified in space and time. Alternatively, by utilizing anatomical information, these distinct field patterns can be localized as current sources on the cortex. However, for a more sustained response that may not be time-locked to a specific stimulus (e. g., in preparation for listening to one of the two simultaneously presented spoken digits based on the cued auditory feature) or may be distributed across multiple spatial locations unknown a priori, the recruitment of a distributed cortical network may not be adequately captured by using a limited number of focal sources. Here, we describe a procedure that employs individual anatomical MRI data to establish a relationship between the sensor information and the dipole activation on the cortex through the use of minimum-norm estimates (MNE). This inverse imaging approach provides us a tool for distributed source analysis. For illustrative purposes, we will describe all procedures using FreeSurfer and MNE software, both freely available. We will summarize the MRI sequences and analysis steps required to produce a forward model that enables us to relate the expected field pattern caused by the dipoles distributed on the cortex onto the M/EEG sensors. Next, we will step through the necessary processes that facilitate us in denoising the sensor data from environmental and physiological contaminants. We will then outline the procedure for combining and mapping MEG/EEG sensor data onto the cortical space, thereby producing a family of time-series of cortical dipole activation on the brain surface (or "brain movies") related to each experimental condition. Finally, we will highlight a few statistical techniques that enable us to make scientific inference across a subject population (i.e., perform group-level analysis) based on a common cortical coordinate space.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) dissociate these processes, with an early (approximately 300-500 ms) frontal effect relating to familiarity (the FN400) and a later (500-800 ms) parietal old/new effect relating to recollection. It has been debated whether source information for a studied item (i.e., contextual associations from when the item was previously encountered) is only accessible through recollection, or whether familiarity can contribute to successful source recognition. It has been shown that familiarity can assist in perceptual source monitoring when the source attribute is an intrinsic property of the item (e.g., an object's surface color), but few studies have examined its contribution to recognizing extrinsic source associations. Extrinsic source associations were examined in three experiments involving memory judgments for pictures of common objects. In Experiment 1, source information was spatial and results suggested that familiarity contributed to accurate source recognition: the FN400 ERP component showed a source accuracy effect, and source accuracy was above chance for items judged to only feel familiar. Source information in Experiment 2 was an extrinsic color association; source accuracy was at chance for familiar items and the FN400 did not differ between correct and incorrect source judgments. Experiment 3 replicated the results using a within-subjects manipulation of spatial vs. color source. Overall, the results suggest that familiarity's contribution to extrinsic source monitoring depends on the type of source information being remembered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compare their ability to estimate workload level in a well-controlled task. In addition, we combine both types of measures in a single classification model to examine whether this results in higher classification accuracy than either one alone. Participants watched a sequence of visually presented letters and indicated whether or not the current letter was the same as the one (n instances) before. Workload was varied by varying n. We developed different classification models using ERP features, frequency power features or a combination (fusion). Training and testing of the models simulated an online workload estimation situation. All our ERP, power and fusion models provide classification accuracies between 80% and 90% when distinguishing between the highest and the lowest workload condition after 2 min. For 32 out of 35 participants, classification was significantly higher than chance level after 2.5 s (or one letter) as estimated by the fusion model. Differences between the models are rather small, though the fusion model performs better than the other models when only short data segments are available for estimating workload.

Exploiting the differences between standard and deviant ERP responses, these multi-class paradigms are suitable for communication and control. Methods: The present study investigates the effect of giving up the randomness of stimulation sequences in favor of a repeated, predictable pattern. Data of healthy subjects (n=10) who performed a single session with a 6-class spatial auditory ERP paradigm were analyzed offline. Their auditory evoked potentials (AEP) resulting from the potentially simpler task (using fixed sequences) are compared with the AEP evoked by pseudo-randomized stimulation sequences. Results: Class-discriminative EEG responses between target and non-target stimuli were observed for both conditions. The binary classification error estimated for standard epochs of was comparable for both conditions (random: 24%, fixed: 25%). Expanding the standard epochs to include pre-stimulus intervals, we found that the regular structure of the fixed sequence can be exploited. Compared to the standard epoch, the MSE improves by 7%, while in the random condition an improvement could not be observed.

First, the independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate single-trial ERPs into a set of independent components (ICs), which were then clustered into three groups (symmetrically distributed ICs, non-symmetrically distributed ICs, and noise-related ICs). Second, the time-frequency distributions of each clustered group were calculated using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Third, the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to extract time-frequency features from all single-trial time-frequency distributions across all channels. Altogether, the developed approach would help effectively extracting nociceptive-related time-frequency features, thus yielding to an important: contribution to the study of nociceptive-specific neural activities.

In the neuroscience laboratory, classical fear conditioning has been extensively used as a model to study learning-related changes in neural structure and function. Here, we review the effects of classical fear conditioning on electromagnetic brain activity in humans, focusing on how sensory systems adapt to changing fear-related contingencies. By considering spatiotemporal patterns of mass neuronal activity, we illustrate a range of cortical changes related to a retuning of neuronal sensitivity to amplify signals consistent with fear-associated stimuli at the cost of other sensory information. Putative mechanisms that may underlie fear-associated plasticity at the level of the sensory cortices are briefly considered, and several avenues for future work are outlined.

Task A corresponded to maximally fast pushing on the button after a signal with warning; the time of the sensorimotor reaction was measured. Task B included internal counting of a definite time interval limited by two pushings on the button. Under these conditions, we recorded the contingent negative variation (CNV), the P300 potential, and, in task B, the readiness potential (RP). EEG leads C3 and C4, according to the 10-20 system, were used. Internals (estimates by the questionnaire, 6 stens or higher) were characterized by higher amplitudes of the terminal CNV (CNV-T), integral CNV, and P300 in task A, by greater RP and CNV amplitudes in task B, and also by shorter reaction times and their smaller dispersion. It should be supposed that the corresponding peculiarities of the neurodynamic constitution of an individual are determined, to a considerable extent, by the specificity of organization and functioning of a few neurotransmitter (aminergic in particular) and neurohumoral systems.

In these studies it is usually assumed that the loci of feature selective neural responses and adaptation coincide. We used an adaptation paradigm to investigate the relationship between response and adaptation selectivity in event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs were evoked by the presentation of colored Glass patterns in a form discrimination task. Response selectivities to form and, to some extent, color of the patterns were reflected in the C1 and N1 ERP components. Adaptation selectivity to color was reflected in N1 and was followed by a late (300-500 ms after stimulus onset) effect of form adaptation. Thus for form, response and adaptation selectivity were manifested in non-overlapping intervals. These results indicate that adaptation and response selectivity can be associated with different processes. Therefore, inferring selectivity from an adaptation paradigm requires analysis of both adaptation and neural response data.

Unbalanced homonymous ("pen"), balanced homonymous ("panel"), metaphorically polysemous ("lip"), and metonymically polysemous words ("rabbit") were used in a visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task. The theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy was reflected in the N400 component. Homonymous words (balanced and unbalanced) showed effects of dominance/frequency with reduced N400 effects predominantly observed for dominant meanings. Polysemous words (metaphors and metonymies) showed effects of core meaning representation with both dominant and subordinate meanings showing reduced N400 effects. Furthermore, the division within polysemy, into metaphor and metonymy, was supported. Differences emerged in meaning activation patterns with the subordinate meanings of metaphor inducing differentially reduced N400 effects moving from left hemisphere electrode sites to right hemisphere electrode sites, potentially suggesting increased involvement of the right hemisphere in the processing of figurative meaning.

To investigate this, non-informative tactile cues were followed after 800 ms by tactile targets and participants either detected targets or discriminated their location. Responses were slowed for targets at cued compared to uncued locations (i.e. inhibition of return (10R)) only in the detection task. Concurrently recorded ERPs showed enhanced negativity for targets at uncued compared to cued locations at the N80 component and this modulation overlapped with the P100 component but only for the detection task indicating IOR may, if anything, be linked to attentional modulations at the P100. Further, cue-target interval analysis showed an enhanced anterior negativity contralateral to the cue side in both tasks, analogous to the anterior directed attention negativity (ADAN) previously only reported during endogenous orienting.

In this paper, we investigate the cortical connectivity under different levels of AAE. Multichannel EEG signals were recorded from nine subjects (male/female=6/3) in an auditory discrimination task under low or high AAE. Behavioral results showed that subjects paid more attention under high AAE and detected the probe stimuli better than low AAE. Partial directed coherence (PDC) was used to study the cortical functional connectivity within the first 300 ms post-stimulus period which includes the N100 and P200 components in the event-related potential (ERP). Majority of the cortical connections were strengthened with the increase of AAE. The right hemispheric dominance of connectivity in maintaining auditory attention was found under low AAE, which disappeared when the AAE was increased, indicating that the right hemispheric dominance previously reported might be due to a relatively lower AAE. Besides, most cortical connections under high AAE were found to be from the parietal cortex to the prefrontal cortex, which suggested the initiative role of parietal cortex in maintaining a high AAE.

The effects of nicotine on brain activity elicited by attention-requiring oddball-type tasks have not been studied in schizophrenia patients. In this study we sought to investigate the impact of nicotine on the p300 evoked potential component and corresponding fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) activation measures in schizophrenia patients and controls. Applying a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, the effects of 1 mg nasal nicotine on brain activity elicited by a visual oddball-type task in N=14 schizophrenia and N=15 control smokers were studied with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. EEG single trial amplitudes were used to inform the fMRI analysis. We found a nicotine-associated increase in P300-informed fMRI activation in schizophrenia patients and controls, mainly in the anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex. No group differences in the response to nicotine were found. Remarkably, averaged EEG and fMRI activation measures considered in isolation were largely unaffected by nicotine. Taken together, the effects of nicotine on P300 amplitude-associated brain activation do not seem to be fundamentally different in schizophrenic smokers and healthy controls.

J	Burgess, AP				Burgess, Adrian P.			Towards a Unified Understanding of Event-Related Changes in the EEG: The Firefly Model of Synchronization through Cross-Frequency Phase Modulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; WAVES; GAMMA; DECOMPOSITION; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISM	Although event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used to study sensory, perceptual and cognitive processes, it remains unknown whether they are phase-locked signals superimposed upon the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) or result from phase-alignment of the EEG. Previous attempts to discriminate between these hypotheses have been unsuccessful but here a new test is presented based on the prediction that ERPs generated by phase-alignment will be associated with event-related changes in frequency whereas evoked-ERPs will not. Using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which allows measurement of narrow-band changes in the EEG without predefining frequency bands, evidence was found for transient frequency slowing in recognition memory ERPs but not in simulated data derived from the evoked model. Furthermore, the timing of phase-alignment was frequency dependent with the earliest alignment occurring at high frequencies. Based on these findings, the Firefly model was developed, which proposes that both evoked and induced power changes derive from frequency-dependent phase-alignment of the ongoing EEG. Simulated data derived from the Firefly model provided a close match with empirical data and the model was able to account for i) the shape and timing of ERPs at different scalp sites, ii) the event-related desynchronization in alpha and synchronization in theta, and iii) changes in the power density spectrum from the pre-stimulus baseline to the post-stimulus period. The Firefly Model, therefore, provides not only a unifying account of event-related changes in the EEG but also a possible mechanism for cross-frequency information processing.

Methods Five patients with cervical dystonia who underwent bilateral GPi deep brain stimulation (DBS) were studied. Local field potentials from the GPi DBS electrodes and EEG were recorded while the patients performed externally triggered and self-initiated right wrist movements. Results Movement related potentials were recorded at the GPi bilaterally before the onset of self-initiated but not externally triggered movements. In all movements studied, frequency analysis revealed a similar to 10-24 Hz beta event related desynchronisation at bilateral GPi and with EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz) and the bilateral sensorimotor cortical regions (C3/C4-Cz). A similar to 64-68 Hz, gamma event related synchronisation was found with EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz), the sensorimotor cortices (C3-Cz) and the GPi contralateral to movements. Both beta event related desynchronisation and gamma event related synchronisation occurred before the onset of self-initiated movements and at the onset of externally triggered movements. There was a resting similar to 5-18 Hz coherence between the bilateral GPi, which attenuated for similar to 1 s during movements. Gamma coherences were observed between EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz), contralateral sensorimotor cortices (C3-Cz) and the GPi from 0 to 0.5 s after movement onset for externally triggered movements and from 0.5 s before to 0.5 s after movement onset for self-initiated movements. Conclusions The beta and gamma frequency bands in the GPi are modulated by the preparation of self-initiated movements and the execution of self-initiated and externally triggered movements. The 5-18 Hz coherence at the bilateral GPi may be related to dystonia and its attenuation may facilitate voluntary movements.

Electrophysiological and behavioral measures of phonological processing of auditory nonsense V-CV-VCV stimuli	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERP); Evoked potentials; Phonological processing; Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN); Priming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPOKEN-WORD RECOGNITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; SPEECH; SENTENCES; N400; COMPONENT; ERP	An event-related potential, the Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN), has been reported to reflect recognition of phonological mismatches in speech stimuli. The purpose of the present study was to explore how the PMN response to the auditory nonsense syllable reflects phonological processing in isolation without the letter prime or lexical/semantic context. Sixty-four nonsense syllable stimuli were composed for each of three stimulus conditions: phonological match (PM), phonological mismatch with similar sound (PMMS), and phonological mismatch with different sound (PMMD), making a total of 192 stimuli. The PMN was measured from fourteen normal-hearing listeners. Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded while subjects were listening to the stimuli and responding behaviorally. Subjects were asked to determine what vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) (e.g. /apa/) would be formed from the combination of the preceding vowel (V) (e.g. /a/) and consonant-vowel (CV) (e.g. /pa/), and press a 'correct' or 'incorrect' response button as soon as they decided whether the target VCV stimulus matched their expectation. In this way, along with the PMN, behavioral response accuracy and reaction times were obtained. The results were as follows: (1) PMN amplitude was not different by stimulus condition, (2) PMN amplitude was larger over frontal and central than posterior regions, but not different between the left versus right hemisphere, (3) PMN was detected in the absence of N400, and (4) behavioral responses were more accurate and faster in PMMD than PM and PMMS. Results indicate that the PMN can reflect phonological processing of auditory nonsense syllables in isolation. The scalp distribution of PMN is most dominant in the fronto-central regions without lateralization. Lastly, behavioral response accuracy and reaction times appear to be influenced by the extent of the task difficulty or processing demand rather than by the extent of phonological violation.

The acute effects of d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine on ERP components in humans	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						d-amphetamine; d-methamphetamine; Event-related potentials; Working memory; Information processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AUDITORY SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PREPULSE INHIBITION; LATENT INHIBITION; STARTLE REFLEX; METHYLPHENIDATE; PERFORMANCE; CHILDREN; P300	While a number of behavioural studies have been conducted to investigate the acute effects of amphetamines on tasks of attention and information processing, there is currently a scarcity of research concerning their electrophysiological effects in healthy adults. It is also unclear as to whether amphetamines exert effects on stimulus evaluation or response selection. In two studies, independent groups of twenty healthy illicit stimulant users aged between 21 and 32 years were administered 0.42 mg/kg d-amphetamine versus placebo, and 0.42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine versus placebo respectively, and completed an auditory oddball task on two separate testing days. A 62-channel EEG was recorded during the completion of the task, and the effects of amphetamines on N200 and P300 ERP components were analysed. d-amphetamine significantly decreased reaction time, improved accuracy, and reduced the latency of the P300 component relative to placebo, while having no effect on the N200 component. d-methamphetamine had no effect on reaction time, accuracy or the P300 component, but reduced the amplitude of the N200 component, relative to placebo. It was concluded that there is tentative support to suggest that d-amphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may enhance speed of information processing while d-methamphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may reflect changes to stimulus evaluation.

Here, we used EEG to record cortical responses evoked by single letters to directly test if their visual processing is actually influenced by their motor content. We manipulated the "motor familiarity" of letters that we considered high for letters written by the observers themselves, medium for letters written by other individuals, and low for printed, machine designed letters. In order to relate the effects of motor familiarity to the activation of the primary motor cortex, we also directly manipulated its availability during the visual task: we computed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) over the posterior cortex during a dual task where participants had to observe the letters while performing unrelated self-paced brief movements of the right hand approximately every 5 s (allowing the primary motor cortex to successively activate and "idle"). At 300-350 ms and 500-600 ms after stimulus onset, the amplitude of the ERP components markedly reflected the level of motor familiarity of the observed letter. Nonetheless, this was true only when the primary motor cortex was in an "idling" state: when the motor cortex was in an activation state, this motor familiarity effect was dropped. This clearly indicates that, at these latencies, the motor information embedded in letters is processed in the brain and that this processing depends on the activation state of the left primary motor cortex.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether the event-related dynamics of EEG differ between genders during the performance of Navon letter identification tasks (NLITs). To this end, the EEG patterns of 40 subjects were recorded during the NLIT performance. We compared behavioral outcomes, event-related temporo-spectral dynamics, and source distribution of neural oscillations within cortical regions of male and female subjects. We found that male subjects exhibited greater induced neural activities than female subjects in right temporo-parietal areas at theta and alpha frequency bands. Source imaging for the time ranges at which maximal gender differences were observed revealed gender-dependent estimated current densities in the right posterior temporal regions. These gender differences can be explained by the existence of distinct, gender-specific hemispheric specialization. Thus, gender differences should be considered during behavioral tasks and electrophysiological measurements.

One aspect of behavioral adjustment commonly observed in reaction time tasks is an increase in response time in trials following an error, referred to as post-error slowing (PES). Using a stop-signal task with a four-on-two stimulus-response mapping, we here investigated the neural aftereffects of stop-errors. We examined oscillatory activity in the inter-trial interval as well as event-related potentials (ERP) in the next trial. Behavioral results speak against general adjustments after stop-errors as post-error behavioral changes could be attributed to stimulus or response repetitions. This corresponded with ERP effects in the next trial with only the visual N1 showing an effect of previous trial type and both N2 and P3 showing an effect of stimulus repetition. During the inter-trial interval, we observed stronger and later occipital alpha power increase after stop-errors compared to go- or inhibited trials. Errors also elicited enhanced frontal beta power relative to stop-trials and by trend to correct go-trials, which largely returned to baseline before the onset of the next trial. These transient changes in the neural aftereffects of stop-errors might be related to previous behavioral observations of PES after short, but not long response-stimulus intervals.

We included a healthy control group for comparison purposes, and employed a modified version of the emotional oddball paradigm, consisting of frequent distracters (scrambled pictures), infrequent distracters (sad, fearful, and neutral pictures), and infrequent targets (circles). Participants were instructed to make a right hand button press to targets and a left hand button press to all other stimuli. EEG/ERP recordings were taken using a high-density 256-channel recording system. Behavioral data showed that for both clinical and non-clinical adolescents, reaction time (RI) was slowest in response to the fearful images. Electrophysiological data differentiated emotion and target processing between clinical and non-clinical adolescents. In the clinical group we observed a larger P100 and late positive potential (LPP) in response to fearful compared to sad or neutral pictures. There were no differences in these ERPs in the healthy sample. Emotional modulation of target processing was also identified in the clinical sample, where we observed an increase in P300 amplitude, and a larger sustained LPP in response to targets that followed emotional pictures (fear and sad) compared to targets that followed neutral pictures or other targets. There were no differences in these target ERPs for the healthy participants. Taken together, we suggest that these data provide important and novel evidence of affective and attention dysfunction in this clinical population of adolescents, and offer an example of the disruptive effects of emotional reactivity on basic cognition.

J	Wang, D; Miao, DQ; Blohm, G				Wang, Deng; Miao, Duoqian; Blohm, Gunnar			Multi-class motor imagery EEG decoding for brain-computer interfaces	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; brain-computer interface; multi-class motor imagery; artifact processing; EEG channel selection	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; EOG ARTIFACTS; EYE-MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Recent studies show that scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a non-invasive interface has great potential for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, one factor that has limited practical applications for EEG-based BCI so far is the difficulty to decode brain signals in a reliable and efficient way. This paper proposes a new robust processing framework for decoding of multi-class motor imagery (MI) that is based on five main processing steps. (i) Raw EEG segmentation without the need of visual artifact inspection. (ii) Considering that EEG recordings are often contaminated not just by electrooculography (EOG) but also other types of artifacts, we propose to first implement an automatic artifact correction method that combines regression analysis with independent component analysis for recovering the original source signals. (iii) The significant difference between frequency components based on event-related (de-) synchronization and sample entropy is then used to find noncontiguous discriminating rhythms. After spectral filtering using the discriminating rhythms, a channel selection algorithm is used to select only relevant channels. (iv) Feature vectors are extracted based on the inter-class diversity and time-varying dynamic characteristics of the signals. (v) Finally, a support vector machine is employed for four-class classification. We tested our proposed algorithm on experimental data that was obtained from dataset 2a of BCI competition IV (2008). The overall four-class kappa values (between 0.41 and 0.80) were comparable to other models but without requiring any artifact-contaminated trial removal. The performance showed that multi-class MI tasks can be reliably discriminated using artifact-contaminated EEG recordings from a few channels. This may be a promising avenue for online robust EEG-based BCI applications.

Methods: Resting-state eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 18 naive HIV subjects (15 males; mean age 39 years +/- 2.0 standard error of mean, SEM) and in 18 age-matched cognitively normal subjects (15 males; 38.7 years +/- 2.2 SEM). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10-12 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz) and beta2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical EEG sources were estimated by normalised, low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) score was lower in HIV (26.5 +/- 0.7 SEM) than in healthy (29.2 +/- 0.5 SEM) subjects (p < 0.05). Central and parietal delta sources showed higher amplitude in the HIV than in control subjects. Furthermore, topographically widespread, cortical sources of resting-state alpha rhythms were lower in amplitude in HIV subjects than in control subjects. Conclusions: The present results suggest that topography and frequency of the cortical sources of resting-state EEG rhythms can distinguish groups of HIV and control subjects. Significance: These results encourage future studies in an enlarged cohort of HIV subjects to test the hypothesis that the present methodological approach provides clinically useful information for an early detection of the effect of HIV infection on brain and cognitive functions.

J	Mustafa, M; Guthe, S; Magnor, M				Mustafa, Maryam; Guthe, Stefan; Magnor, Marcus			Single-Trial EEG Classification of Artifacts in Videos	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION			English	Article						Human Factors; Perception; rendering; perception of rendering artifacts; EEG; SVM; wavelets; human visual system	COMPLEX WAVELET TRANSFORM; VISUAL-PERCEPTION	In this article we use an ElectroEncephaloGraph (EEG) to explore the perception of artifacts that typically appear during rendering and determine the perceptual quality of a sequence of images. Although there is an emerging interest in using an EEG for image quality assessment, one of the main impediments to the use of an EEG is the very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) which makes it exceedingly difficult to distinguish neural responses from noise. Traditionally, event-related potentials have been used for analysis of EEG data. However, they rely on averaging and so require a large number of participants and trials to get meaningful data. Also, due the the low SNR ERP's are not suited for single-trial classification. We propose a novel wavelet-based approach for evaluating EEG signals which allows us to predict the perceived image quality from only a single trial. Our wavelet-based algorithm is able to filter the EEG data and remove noise, eliminating the need for many participants or many trials. With this approach it is possible to use data from only 10 electrode channels for single-trial classification and predict the presence of an artifact with an accuracy of 85%. We also show that it is possible to differentiate and classify a trial based on the exact type of artifact viewed. Our work is particularly useful for understanding how the human visual system responds to different types of degradations in images and videos. An understanding of the perception of typical image-based rendering artifacts forms the basis for the optimization of rendering and masking algorithms.

Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system consists of three procedures, including enhanced active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. Firstly, combined with the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the active-segment selection. Multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. Compared with other approaches on motor imagery data, the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in BCI applications.

Although many N170 experiments have been performed with multi-channel EEG recordings, most of the N170 analyses are still based on trial-averaged signals from one or a few selected electrodes. Not only does this method under utilise the information from all available electrodes, it inhibits a trial-to-trial analysis of N170. We address this issue by proposing a single-trial multi-channel N170 estimation method that estimates the latency, amplitude and scalp projection of N170 using a linear classifier-based approach.

However, an objective evaluation of different approaches is lacking. The present study therefore compared four frequently-used single-trial data filtering procedures: raw sensor amplitudes, regression-based estimation, bandpass filtering, and independent component analysis (ICA). High-density EEG data were recorded from 20 healthy participants in a face recognition task and were analyzed with a focus on the face-selective N170 single-trial event-related potential. Linear discriminant analysis revealed significantly better single-trial estimation for ICA compared to raw sensor amplitudes, whereas the other two approaches did not improve classification accuracy. Further analyses suggested that ICA enabled extraction of a face-sensitive independent component in each participant, which led to the superior performance in single trial estimation. Additionally, we show that the face-sensitive component does not directly represent activity from a neuronal population exclusively involved in face-processing, but rather the activity of a network involved in general visual processing. We conclude that ICA effectively facilitates the separation of physiological trial-by-trial fluctuations from measurement noise, in particular when the process of interest is reliably reflected in components representing the neural signature of interest.

It is useful for therapeutic and mental health monitoring, learning disability biofeedback, handicap interfaces, and war gaming. Its spec is adequate for a biomedical laboratory, without the cables hanging over the head and tethered to a fixed computer terminal. Our improved the intrinsic signal to noise ratio (SNR) by using the non-uniform placement of the measuring electrodes to create the proximity of measurement to the source effect. We computing a spatiotemporal average the larger magnitude of EEG data centers in 0.3 second taking on tethered laboratory data, using fuzzy logic, and computing the inside brainwave sources, by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Consequently, we can overlay them together by non-uniform electrode distribution enhancing the signal noise ratio and therefore the degree of sparseness by threshold. We overcame the conflicting requirements between a high spatial electrode density and precise temporal resolution (beyond Event Related Potential (ERP) P300 brainwave at 0.3 sec), and Smartphone wireless bottleneck of spatiotemporal throughput rate. Our main contribution in this paper is the quality and the speed of iterative compressed image recovery algorithm based on a Block Sparse Code (Baranuick et al, IEEE/IT 2008). As a result, we achieved real-time wireless dynamic measurement of EEG brainwaves, matching well with traditionally tethered high density EEG.

There is limited understanding of the neural dynamics supporting recognition of intention-related events, with little known about how pre-event brain state varies as a function of intention specificity. Prior to recognized events (that cued planned behavior) occurring during an unrelated activity, we found increased steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) and intrinsic gamma synchronization for ill- compared to well-specified events, as measured by EEG. Enhanced fronto-temporo-parietal ssVEP synchrony emerged preceding ill compared to well-specified events, and the degree of synchrony predicted the completion of ill-specified intentions but predicted failure to complete well-specified intentions. Distinct executive processing and neural states are therefore optimal for anticipating and fulfilling future intentions varying in event specificity.

Memory signals are temporally dissociated in and across human hippocampus and perirhinal cortex	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECOGNITION MEMORY; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; LOBE ACTIVITY; FAMILIARITY; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL; RECOLLECTION; INFORMATION; NEURONS; NOVELTY	In the endeavor to understand how our brains enable our multifaceted memories, much controversy surrounds the contributions of the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PrC). We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy controls and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) in patients during a recognition memory task. Although conventional fMRI analysis showed indistinguishable roles of the hippocampus and PrC in familiarity-based item recognition and recollection-based source retrieval, event-related fMRI and EEG time courses revealed a clear temporal dissociation of memory signals in and across these regions. An early source retrieval effect was followed by a late, post-decision item novelty effect in hippocampus, whereas an early item novelty effect was followed by a sustained source retrieval effect in PrC. Although factors such as memory strength were not experimentally controlled, the temporal pattern across regions suggests that a rapid item recognition signal in PrC triggers a source retrieval process in the hippocampus, which in turn recruits PrC representations and/or mechanisms, evidenced here by increased hippocampal-PrC coupling during source recognition.

This control deficit could be due to primarily reduced attentional capacities or, e. g., to overshooting orienting to unexpected events. Here, we aimed at identifying disease-related abnormalities of novelty processing and, therefore, studied event-related potentials (ERP) to respective stimuli in adult ADHD patients compared to healthy subjects. Methods: Fifteen unmedicated subjects with ADHD and fifteen matched controls engaged in a visual oddball task (OT) under simultaneous EEG recordings. A target stimulus, upon which a motor response was required, and non-target stimuli, which did not demand a specific reaction, were presented in random order. Target and most non-target stimuli were presented repeatedly, but some non-target stimuli occurred only once ('novels'). These unique stimuli were either 'relative novels' with which a meaning could be associated, or 'complete novels', if no association was available. Results: In frontal recordings, a positive component with a peak latency of some 400 ms became maximal after novels. In healthy subjects, this novelty-P3 (or 'orienting response') was of higher magnitude after complete than after relative novels, in contrast to the patients with an undifferentially high frontal responsivity. Instead, ADHD patients tended to smaller centro-parietal P3 responses after target signals and, on a behavioural level, responded slower than controls. Conclusion: The results demonstrate abnormal novelty processing in adult subjects with ADHD. In controls, the ERP pattern indicates that allocation of meaning modulates the processing of new stimuli. However, in ADHD such a modulation was not prevalent. Instead, also familiar, only context-wise new stimuli were treated as complete novels. We propose that disturbed semantic processing of new stimuli resembles a mechanism for excessive orienting to commonly negligible stimuli in ADHD.

The mechanisms underlying the onset of migraine attacks are not yet fully understood. Neuroimaging studies have shown changes in the cortical excitability of migraine patients. Here, we investigated cortical activation related to processing of emotional stimuli in individuals with migraine. Method: Twenty-four participants suffering from migraine attacks and 25 healthy volunteers had to passively observe pictures of emotional facial expressions (angry, happy and neutral). Electro-cortical activity was continuously recorded by means of an electroencephalogram (EEG), and ratings of valence (unpleasant vs. pleasant) and arousal (calm vs. exciting) were collected. Results: The migraine and control group did not differ in their ratings of valence and arousal of the visual stimuli. However, participants with migraine, in contrast to healthy controls, showed larger N170 amplitudes toward angry facial expressions compared to neutral ones. Discussion: Individuals with migraine may have an altered cortical activity linked to the processing of emotional information. Thus, these individuals may process high arousing and threatening events preferentially, and this facilitated processing may be related to their already high cortical excitability.

However, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for these abnormalities are unknown. This study investigated auditory sensory processing in a mouse model of RTT with a heterozygous loss of MeCP2 function. Cortical abnormalities in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD are reflected in auditory evoked potentials and fields measured by EEG and MEG. One of these abnormalities, increased latency of cortically sourced components, is associated with language and developmental delay in autism. Additionally, gamma-band abnormalities have recently been identified as an endophenotype of idiopathic autism. Both of these cortical abnormalities are potential clinical endpoints for assessing treatment. While ascribing similar mechanisms of idiopathic ASD to Rett syndrome (RTT) has been controversial, we sought to determine if mouse models of RTT replicate these intermediate phenotypes. Mice heterozygous for the null mutations of the gene MeCP2, were implanted for EEG. In response to auditory stimulation, these mice recapitulated specific latency differences as well as select gamma and beta band abnormalities associated with ASD. MeCP2 disruption is the predominant cause of RTT, and reductions in MeCP2 expression predominate in ASD. This work further suggests a common cortical pathophysiology for RTT and ASD, and indicates that the MeCP2+/- model may be useful for preclinical development targeting specific cortical processing abnormalities in RTT with potential relevance to ASD.

Interhemispheric transfer time in patients with auditory hallucinations: An auditory event-related potential study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory hallucinations; Schizophrenia; Auditory N1 event-related potential (ERP); Interhemispheric transfer; Auditory cortex	SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; HESCHLS GYRUS; ASYMMETRY; LANGUAGE; LATERALIZATION; TRANSMISSION; DOMINANCE; FAILURE; CORTEX	Central auditory processing in schizophrenia patients with a history of auditory hallucinations has been reported to be impaired, and abnormalities of interhemispheric transfer have been implicated in these patients. This study examined interhemispheric functional connectivity between auditory cortical regions, using temporal information obtained from latency measures of the auditory N1 evoked potential. Interhemispheric Transfer Times (IHTTs) were compared across 3 subject groups: schizophrenia patients who had experienced auditory hallucinations, schizophrenia patients without a history of auditory hallucinations, and normal controls. Pure tones and single-syllable words were presented monaurally to each ear, while EEG was recorded continuously. IHTT was calculated for each stimulus type by comparing the latencies of the auditory N1 evoked potential recorded contralaterally and ipsilaterally to the ear of stimulation. The IHTTs for pure tones did not differ between groups. For word stimuli, the IHTT was significantly different across the 3 groups: the IHTT was close to zero in normal controls, was highest in the AH group, and was negative (shorter latencies ipsilaterally) in the nonAH group. Differences in IHTTs may be attributed to transcallosal dysfunction in the AH group, but altered or reversed cerebral lateralization in nonAH participants is also possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Sequencing the cortical processing of pitch-evoking stimuli using EEG analysis and source estimation	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						pitch; EEG; mismatch negativity; iterated rippled noise	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPLEX TONES; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION; PERCEPTION	Cues to pitch include spectral cues that arise from tonotopic organization and temporal cues that arise from firing patterns of auditory neurons. fMRI studies suggest a common pitch center is located just beyond primary auditory cortex along the lateral aspect of Heschl's gyrus, but little work has examined the stages of processing for the integration of pitch cues. Using electroencephalography, we recorded cortical responses to high-pass filtered iterated rippled noise (IRN) and high-pass filtered complex harmonic stimuli, which differ in temporal and spectral content. The two stimulus types were matched for pitch saliency, and a mismatch negativity (MMN) response was elicited by infrequent pitch changes. The P1 and N1 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) are thought to arise from primary and secondary auditory areas, respectively, and to result from simple feature extraction. MMN is generated in secondary auditory cortex and is thought to act on feature-integrated auditory objects. We found that peak latencies of both P1 and N1 occur later in response to IRN stimuli than to complex harmonic stimuli, but found no latency differences between stimulus types for MMN. The location of each ERP component was estimated based on iterative fitting of regional sources in the auditory cortices. The sources of both the P1 and N1 components elicited by IRN stimuli were located dorsal to those elicited by complex harmonic stimuli, whereas no differences were observed for MMN sources across stimuli. Furthermore, the MMN component was located between the P1 and N1 components, consistent with fMRI studies indicating a common pitch region in lateral Heschl's gyrus. These results suggest that while the spectral and temporal processing of different pitch-evoking stimuli involves different cortical areas during early processing, by the time the object-related MMN response is formed, these cues have been integrated into a common representation of pitch.

In two experiments, 14 spider-phobic patients (and controls), and 14 dentophobic patients (and controls) were confronted with disorder-relevant and affectively neutral pictures while an electroencephalogram was recorded. Mean ERP amplitudes were extracted in the time windows of 300-450 ms (P300) and 450-800 ms (late positive potential, LPP). Analyses revealed that both spider phobics and dental phobics showed enhanced current density in parietal regions (i.e., cuneus, precuneus) for the P300 time frame when exposed to disorder-specific contents. This result can be interpreted to reflect automatic attention allocation. Spider phobics additionally displayed greater current density in the insula and the anterior/posterior cingulate cortex in the LPP time window relative to controls. Most likely, the phylogentically based spider phobia is characterized by a deeper and more prolonged attention engagement than dental phobia. Our findings are in good accordance with existing brain imaging studies and underline that source localization is a useful alternative for identifying relevant cortical regions in subtypes of specific phobia.

The faces you remember: Caricaturing shape facilitates brain processes reflecting the acquisition of new face representations	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Face learning; Face perception; Face recognition; Caricatures; EEG; N250; P200; N170; LPC; ERPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; UNFAMILIAR FACES; UNIFIED ACCOUNT; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; FACIAL DISTINCTIVENESS; STIMULUS REPETITIONS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; FAMILIAR FACES; INVERTED FACES; ERP EVIDENCE	We report two experiments on the influence of spatial caricaturing on face learning and recognition. In the learning phase of Experiment 1, participants learned unfamiliar faces, half of which were caricatured at an exaggeration level of 30%. During learning we found increased N170, N250 and LPC and decreased P200 for caricatures. At test we observed better generalization to non-identical exemplars for faces learned as caricatures. At test, N250 was larger for caricatures. In Experiment 2, using more and stronger levels of caricaturing (0% = veridical, 35% and 70%), we replicated and extended main findings of Experiment 1 and found a clear learning advantage for caricatures. ERP and performance effects were directly related to the level of caricaturing. Overall, the present results suggest that (i) distinctive shape information is particularly informative to form new face representations for unfamiliar faces, and (ii) this formation of new representations is reflected by an increase in occipito-temporal negativity that is most prominent in the time range of the P200 and N250 components.

In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. This literature review describes the morphology, clinical meaning, and pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs. To record HFOs, the intracranial EEG needs to be sampled at least at 2,000Hz. The oscillatory events can be visualized by applying a high-pass filter and increasing the time and amplitude scales, or EEG time-frequency maps can show the amount of high-frequency activity. HFOs appear excellent markers for the epileptogenic zone. In patients with focal epilepsy who can benefit from surgery, invasive EEG is often required to identify the epileptic cortex, but current information is sometimes inadequate. Removal of brain tissue generating HFOs has been related to better postsurgical outcome than removing the seizure onset zone, indicating that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs is challenging, probably involving populations of neurons firing asynchronously. They differ from physiological HFOs in not being paced by rhythmic inhibitory activity and in their possible origin from population spikes. Their link to the epileptogenic zone argues that their study will teach us much about the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. HFOs show promise for improving surgical outcome and accelerating intracranial EEG investigations. Their potential needs to be assessed by future research.

The present study investigated the pre-stimulus oscillatory EEG signatures of selective attention and motor preparation that predicted failures of overt response inhibition. We employed a trial-by-trial spatial cueing task using a go/no-go response paradigm with bilateral target stimuli. Subjects were required to covertly attend to the spatial location cued on each trial and respond to most of the number targets (go trials) at that location while withholding responses for one designated number (no-go trials). We analyzed the post-cue/pre-target spectral patterns comparing no-go trials in which a response occurred in error (False Alarms, FA) with trials in which participants correctly withheld a response (Correct Rejections, CR). We found that cue-induced occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) lateralization and inter-frequency anti-correlations between the motor beta (18-24 Hz) and pre-frontal theta (3-5 Hz) bands each independently predicted subsequent failures of response inhibition. Based on these findings, we infer that independent perceptual and motor mechanisms operate in parallel to contribute to failures of response inhibition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In visual, auditory and vibrotactile modalities, studies have shown that SS-EP reflect mainly activity originating from early, modality-specific sensory cortices. Furthermore, it has been shown that SS-EP have several advantages over the recording of transient event-related brain potentials (ERP), such as a high signal-to-noise ratio, a shorter time to obtain reliable signals, and the capacity to frequency-tag the cortical activity elicited by concurrently presented sensory stimuli. Recently, we showed that SS-EP can be elicited by the selective activation of skin nociceptors and that nociceptive SS-EP reflect the activity of a population of neurons that is spatially distinct from the somatotopically-organized population of neurons underlying vibrotactile SS-EP. Hence, the recording of SS-EP offers a unique opportunity to study the cortical representation of nociception and touch in humans, and to explore their potential crossmodal interactions. Here, (1) we review available methods to achieve the rapid periodic stimulation of somatosensory afferents required to elicit SS-EP, (2) review previous studies that have characterized vibrotactile and nociceptive SS-EP, (3) discuss the nature of the recorded signals and their relationship with transient event-related potentials and (4) outline future perspectives and potential clinical applications of this technique.

The aim of this study was to provide a complete description of the cortical dynamics induced by unpleasant and neutral pictures viewing, from the ERP averages to gamma rhythm modulation, and its phase synchronization. Gamma rhythm modulation was estimated by the event-related synchronization (ERS) approach, and phase synchrony between trials and between cortical regions was studied by extending the phase-locking statistics (PLS) approach. Consistent with previous literature, an increase in P300 and late positive potential and an increase in gamma activity during viewing of unpleasant pictures as compared to neutral ones were found. No inter-trial synchronization was evoked by the stimuli, whereas widespread phase locking between sites was identified. In particular, differences in gamma synchronization between unpleasant and neutral stimuli were found. Specifically, at early (0-250 ms) lags from stimulus onset, in the 38-45 Hz gamma interval, stronger intersite synchronizations for the unpleasant stimuli, even though quite widespread across the scalp, mainly involved the interhemispheric synchronization between temporal and frontal regions. In contrast, in the 30-37 Hz gamma interval, stronger synchronizations for the responses to neutral trials were found in the 500-750 time interval, mainly involving the temporo-parietal regions. These findings suggest that the full elaboration of unpleasant stimuli requires a tight interhemispheric communication between temporal and frontal regions that is realized by means of phase synchronization at about 40 Hz. In addition, in contrast with the idea of a broadband modulation of high-frequency activity by cognitive/emotional stimuli, the present findings i.e. stronger BRS responses to either emotional or neutral trials at specific frequency and time range, indicate that specific intervals of gamma activity could be each primarily involved in a specific aspect of stimulus processing.

Synchrony of phase (phase locking) of event-related oscillations (EROs) within and between different brain areas has been suggested to reflect communication exchange between neural networks and as such may be a sensitive and translational measure of ethanol's effects. Using a similar auditory event-related potential paradigm in both rats and humans we investigated the phase variability of EROs collected from 38 young men who had participated in an ethanol/placebo challenge protocol, and 46 adult male rats given intraperitoneal injections of ethanol/saline. Phase locking was significantly higher in the delta frequencies in humans than in rats. Phase locking was also higher for the rare (target) tone than the frequent (non-target) tone in both species. Significant reductions in phase locking to the rare (target) tone in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies, within and between brain sites, was found at 1 h following ethanol as compared to placebo/saline administration in both rats and humans. Reductions in phase locking in the alpha frequencies in the parietal cortex were found to be correlated with blood ethanol concentrations. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol's intoxicating actions in the brain include reducing synchrony within and between neuronal networks, perhaps by increasing the level of noise in key neuromolecular interactions.

A simultaneous ERP/fMRI investigation of the P300 aging effect	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						P300; Aging; EEG; fMRI; Frontal; Target processing; Distractor processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BOLD HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TARGET DETECTION TASK; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; OLDER-ADULTS; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; NOVELTY ODDBALL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FMRI SIGNAL	One of the most reliable psychophysiological markers of aging is a linear decrease in the amplitude of the P300 potential, accompanied by a more frontal topographical orientation, but the precise neural origins of these differences have yet to be explored. We acquired simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from 14 older and 15 younger adults who performed a 3-stimulus visual oddball task designed to elicit P3a and P3b components. As in previous reports, older adults had significantly reduced P3a/P3b amplitudes over parietal electrodes but larger amplitudes over frontal scalp with no between-group differences in accuracy or reaction time. Electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging fusion revealed that the P3a age effects were driven by increased activation of left inferior frontal and cingulate cortex and decreased activation of inferior parietal cortex in the older group. P3b differences were driven by increased activation of left temporal regions, right hippocampus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the older group. Our results support the proposal that the age-related P300 anterior shift arises from an increased reliance on prefrontal structures to support target and distractor processing.

However, little is known about how these visual social cues are integrated over time in the brain and, notably, whether this binding occurs in the emotional or the motor system. By coupling magnetic resonance and electroencephalography imaging in humans, we were able to show that, 200 ms after stimulus onset, the premotor cortex integrated gaze, gesture, and emotion displayed by a congener. At earlier stages, emotional content was processed independently in the amygdala (170 ms), whereas directional cues (gaze direction with pointing gesture) were combined at similar to 190 ms in the parietal and supplementary motor cortices. These results demonstrate that the early binding of visual social signals displayed by an agent engaged the dorsal pathway and the premotor cortex, possibly to facilitate the preparation of an adaptive response to another person's immediate intention.

The time-course of single-word reading: Evidence from fast behavioral and brain responses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual word recognition; EEG; MEG; Lexical decision task; Semantic decision task; Go/NoGo paradigm	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDS; DIFFUSION-MODEL ACCOUNT; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LEXICAL DECISION; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; ERP EVIDENCE; RECOGNITION	We usually feel that we understand a familiar word "immediately". However, even basic aspects of the time-line of word recognition are still controversial. Different domains of research have still not converged on a coherent account. An integration of multiple sources of information would lead to more strongly constrained theoretical models, and help finding optimal measures when monitoring specific aspects of word recognition impairments in patient groups. In our multimodal approach - combining fast behavioral measures, ERPs and EEG/MEG source estimation - we provide converging evidence for the latencies of earliest lexical and semantic information retrieval in visual word recognition. Participants performed lexical and semantic decisions (LD, SD) in a Go/NoGo paradigm. We introduced eye-blink latencies as a dependent variable, in order to measure behavioral responses that are faster and less variable than traditional button presses. We found that the earliest behavioral responses distinguishing stimulus categories can occur around 310 ms. Ex-Gaussian analysis of behavioral responses did not reveal reliable differences between LD and SD. The earliest ERP differences between Go and NoGo conditions occurred around 160 ms for both LD and SD. Distributed source analysis of combined EEG/MEG data estimated neuronal generators for the lexicality effect around 200 ms in the left anterior middle temporal lobe. Thus, behavior and brain responses provide coherent evidence that the brain starts retrieving lexical and semantic information near-simultaneously within 200 ms of word onset. Our results support models of word recognition that assume a continuous accumulation of task-related information from the stimulus, which might be described by Bayesian principles.

J	Gwin, JT; Ferris, DP				Gwin, Joseph T.; Ferris, Daniel P.			An EEG-based study of discrete isometric and isotonic human lower limb muscle contractions	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ARTIFACTS; FOOT; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with independent component analysis enables functional neuroimaging in dynamic environments including during human locomotion. This type of functional neuroimaging could be a powerful tool for neurological rehabilitation. It could enable clinicians to monitor changes in motor control related cortical dynamics associated with a therapeutic intervention, and it could facilitate noninvasive electrocortical control of devices for assisting limb movement to stimulate activity dependent plasticity. Understanding the relationship between electrocortical dynamics and muscle activity will be helpful for incorporating EEG-based functional neuroimaging into clinical practice. The goal of this study was to use independent component analysis of high-density EEG to test whether we could relate electrocortical dynamics to lower limb muscle activation in a constrained motor task. A secondary goal was to assess the trial-by-trial consistency of the electrocortical dynamics by decoding the type of muscle action. Methods: We recorded 264-channel EEG while 8 neurologically intact subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee and ankle exercises at two different effort levels. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We generated spectrograms for all electrocortical source signals and used a nave Bayesian classifier to decode exercise type from trial-by-trial time-frequency data. Results: AMICA captured different electrocortical source distributions for ankle and knee tasks. The fit of single-trial EEG to these models distinguished knee from ankle tasks with 80% accuracy. Electrocortical spectral modulations in the supplementary motor area were significantly different for isometric and isotonic tasks (p < 0.05). Isometric contractions elicited an event related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (12-30 Hz) at joint torque onset and offset. Isotonic contractions elicited a sustained alpha- and beta-band ERD throughout the trial. Classifiers based on supplementary motor area sources achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 69% while classifiers based on electrocortical sources in multiple brain regions achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 87%. Conclusions: Independent component analysis of EEG reveals unique spatial and spectro-temporal electrocortical properties for different lower limb motor tasks. Using a broad distribution of electrocortical signals may improve classification of human lower limb movements from single-trial EEG.

This paper compares Neural Networks and Supported Vector Machines as classifiers to be integrated to an automated detection algorithm. EEG recordings of 5 subjects (3 female, 2 male) were made, while auditory stimulus was provided. The recordings were filtered with a 2nd order Butterworth lowpass filter with cutoff frequency at 40 Hz. A free database provided by California Institute of Technology with several auditory evoked potential (EP) events was used to train the models used to identify de N100-P200 complex. Once a model was achieved, it was first validated with new data, and then incorporated to an algorithm that identified the complex in a non segmented EEG recording. An average sensitivity of 93.26% was achieved with only 136 false positives in over 25 minutes of 6 channel EEG recording. These results prove that individual detection of EPs is possible, thus enabling future studies in variability.

This deficit might contribute to their problems in social interactions. We conducted the present event-related potential study with 15 men suffering from ADHD and 15 healthy controls in order to investigate whether similar dysfunctions are present in adult ADHD. The participants underwent an emotional version of a Go/NoGo task while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. They were instructed to inhibit a motor response to one of four facial emotional expressions: anger, fear, sadness, or happiness. There were no behavioral differences in inhibitory control between the ADHD and the control group. However, the patients showed a reduced right parietal late positivity when instructed to inhibit a response to negative emotions. Obviously, the patients have learned to compensate for their deficit on a behavioral level, while it is still visible on the electrocortical level in this relatively simple task. Interestingly, the reduced positivity correlated with lowered self-reported emotional intelligence in the ADHD group. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cortical sources of resting state EEG rhythms are abnormal in dyslexic children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dyslexic subjects; Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG); Low-resolution brain electromagnetic source tomography (LORETA); Brain rhythms; Alpha; Individual alpha frequency (IAF)	BRAIN POTENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS; ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VOXEL BASED MORPHOMETRY; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; READING-DISABILITY; WHITE-MATTER; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA	Objective: Previous studies have been inconclusive whether dominant resting state alpha rhythms differ in amplitude in dyslexic subjects when compared to control subjects, being these rhythms considered as a reflection of effective cortical neural synchronization and cognition. Here we used a validated EEG source estimation to test the hypothesis that resting state alpha rhythms are abnormal in dyslexic subjects and are related to reading deficits. Methods: Eyes-closed resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 26 dyslexics (12 males, mean age of 11 years +/- 0.5 standard error of mean, SEM) and 11 age-matched normal control subjects (8 males, mean age of 11 years +/- 0.7 SEM). EEG rhythms of interest, based on individual alpha frequency peak, were the following: about 2-4 Hz (delta), 4-6 Hz (theta), 6-8 Hz (alpha 1), 8-10 Hz (alpha 2), and 10-12 Hz (alpha 3). For the higher frequencies, we selected beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz). Cortical EEG sources were estimated by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). LORETA solutions were normalized across all voxels and frequencies. Results: Compared to the control children, the dyslexics showed lower amplitude of parietal, occipital, and temporal alpha 2 and alpha 3 sources. In the dyslexics, some of these sources were correlated to reading time of pseudo-words (parietal alpha 2, r = -0.56, p = 0.02; parietal alpha 3, r = -0.58, p = 0.02; temporal alpha 3, r = -0.57, p = 0.02); the higher the alpha power, the shorter the reading time. Conclusions: Dyslexic children are characterized by limited abnormalities of resting state EEG rhythms as to topography (posterior regions) and frequency (alpha), which were related to phonological encoding (pseudo-words reading). Significance: Dyslexia may be associated to some functional impairment of cortical neuronal synchronization mechanisms involved in the resting state condition.

Humor perception with and without expressive suppression	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion regulation; Expressive suppression; Humor; EEG; EMG	FACIAL FEEDBACK HYPOTHESIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMOTION REGULATION; NEGATIVE AFFECT; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; VOLUNTARY SUPPRESSION; COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL; UNPLEASANT PICTURES; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES	The neurophysiological study of emotion regulation focused on the strategy of reappraisal-i.e., the cognitive reinterpretation of a stimulus. Reappraisal reduces emotional expression, the experience of both negative and positive feelings, and the amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP)-the late positive potential (LPP). In contrast, the strategy of expressive suppression (ES), being the inhibition of emotional expression, has been reported to reduce subjective feelings of positive, but not negative emotion, and has not yet been investigated with ERPs. We focused on the LPP to assess the correlates of ES in the context of humor perception. Twenty-two female participants rated sequences of humorous (H) and non-humorous (NH) pictures, while their zygomaticus muscle was recorded. A spontaneous (SP) condition, in which participants attended naturally to the pictures, resulted in higher ratings of funniness, increased smiling, and increased LPP amplitude for H compared to NH stimuli. An ES condition, in which participants suppressed their facial reactions, resulted in reduced smiling, without affecting subjective ratings. LPP amplitude did not differ between H and NH stimuli during ES, suggesting equal allocation of processing resources to both stimuli. These results suggest that, similarly to reappraisal, ES modifies the way the brain processes positive emotional stimuli.

The electroencephalography (EEG) is the best candidate for the continuous use in the environment of patients' houses, due to its portability and ease of use. For this reason, the present paper will focus on this kind of BCI. Moreover, it is our aim to focus more on the patients, regarding their active role in the modulation of the brain activity. This leads to a differentiation between studies that use an active regulation and studies that use a non-active regulation. Method: Relevant articles in the BCIs field were selected using MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Results: Research through data banks produced 980 results, which were reduced to 127 after exclusion criteria selection. These references were divided in four categories, based on the use of active or non-active regulation, and on the event related potential used. Conclusions: In most of the examined works, the focus was on the development of systems and algorithms able to recognise and classify brain events. Although this kind of research is fundamental, a user-centred point of view was rarely adopted.

It is not clear, however, whether music training also modulates rapid (within tens of minutes) neural plasticity for sound encoding. To study this phenomenon, we examined whether adult musicians display enhanced rapid neural plasticity compared to non-musicians. More specifically, we compared the modulation of P1, N1, and P2 responses to standard sounds between four unattended passive blocks. Among the standard sounds, infrequently presented deviant sounds were presented (the so-called odd ball paradigm). In the middle of the experiment (after two blocks), an active task was presented. Source analysis for event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that N1 and P2 source activation was selectively decreased in musicians after 15 min of passive exposure to sounds and that P2 source activation was found to be re-enhanced after the active task in musicians. Additionally, ERP analysis revealed that in both musicians and non-musicians, P2 ERP amplitude was enhanced after 15 min of passive exposure but only at the frontal electrodes. Furthermore, in musicians, the N1 ERP was enhanced after the active discrimination task but only at the parietal electrodes. Musical training modulates the rapid neural plasticity reflected in N1 and P2 source activation for unattended regular standard sounds. Enhanced rapid plasticity of N1 and P2 is likely to reflect faster auditory perceptual learning in musicians.

The latency of the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) was used to evaluate the effects of low-frequency rTMS following stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is an area considered to be related to the generation of the P300. In addition, prolonged stimulation effects on the P300 latency were analyzed after applying rTMS. A figure-eight coil was used to stimulate the left or right DLPFC, and the intensity of magnetic stimulation was 80% of the motor threshold. A total of 100 magnetic pulses were applied for the rTMS. The effects of stimulation at frequencies of 0.5 or 1 Hz were determined. An odd-ball task was performed before and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after rTMS to measure the effects of rTMS on the P300. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured at the Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes using the international 10-20 electrode system. We found that 0.5 and 1 Hz rTMS produced different effects on P300 latencies. 1 Hz stimulation of the left DLPFC lengthened P300 latencies by approximately 20 ms at the Cz, which lasted up to 15 minutes post-rTMS. In contrast, 0.5 Hz rTMS stimulation of the left DLPFC and 0.5 and 1 Hz rTMS stimulation to right DLPFC had no significant effects on P300 latencies. These results demonstrate that the effects of rTMS on the P300 latency depend on the frequency of stimulant and the area stimulated. Furthermore, we have determined the duration of this effect of low-frequency and short-term rTMS.

Until now, the responses have been characterized mainly using across-trial averaging in the time domain. Unfortunately, chemosensory ERPs, in particular, olfactory ERPs, exhibit a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, although the technique is increasingly used in basic research as well as in clinical practice to evaluate people suffering from olfactory disorders, its current clinical relevance remains very limited. Here, we used a time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform to reveal EEG responses that are not strictly phase-locked to onset of the chemosensory stimulus. We hypothesized that this approach would significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG responses to chemosensory stimulation because, as compared to conventional time-domain averaging, (1) it is less sensitive to temporal jitter and (2) it can reveal non phase-locked EEG responses such as event-related synchronization and desynchronization. Methodology/Principal Findings: EEG responses to selective trigeminal and olfactory stimulation were recorded in 11 normosmic subjects. A Morlet wavelet was used to characterize the elicited responses in the time-frequency domain. We found that this approach markedly improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the obtained EEG responses, in particular, following olfactory stimulation. Furthermore, the approach allowed characterizing non phase-locked components that could not be identified using conventional time-domain averaging. Conclusion/Significance: By providing a more robust and complete view of how odors are represented in the human brain, our approach could constitute the basis for a robust tool to study olfaction, both for basic research and clinicians.

For this purpose we analyzed the influence of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on electrophysiological markers of conflict and error monitoring, respectively. An EEG was recorded while 65 healthy subjects completed a response-conflict evoking task. In the event-related potential (ERP), both the conflict-N400 as well as the error-related negativity (ERN) were diminished in homozygous carriers of the Met allele. Moreover, the shared variance of both deflections was substantially explained by the COMT Val(158)Met genotype. These findings suggest that the relation between error- and conflict-related processes in the medial frontal cortex is mediated by a common molecular mechanism, namely the individual magnitude of phasic dopaminergic transmission.

Gender Impact on Electrophysiological Activity of the Brain	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Gender; Pattern-reversal VEPs; Motion VEPs; Event related potentials; Visual mismatch negativity	MOTION-ONSET VEPS; REVERSAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PATTERN-REVERSAL; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; AGE; EEG; SEX; P300; MATURATION; LATENCY	Gender is presumed to be one of the factors causing interindividual variability in the brain's electrophysiological parameters. Our aim was to characterize the role of gender in visual evoked potentials (VEPs), event-related potentials (ERPs), visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) and the spectral characteristics of the EEG. We examined 42 healthy volunteers (21 women and 21 men, aged 20-29 years). We measured VEPs in response to pattern-reversal and motion-onset stimulation, ERPs in an oddball paradigm and vMMN in response to a combination of motion directions presented in the visual periphery. P100 peak latency for 40' reversal VEPs was significantly shorter in women than in men as determined using a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, women showed higher relative EEG spectral power in the alpha band (p=0.023) and lower power in the theta band (p=0.004). Our results in this small but homogeneous group of subjects confirm previously reported gender influences on pattern-reversal VEPs and the EEG frequency spectrum. Gender should be taken into consideration in establishing norms on these measures. We found no statistically significant differences between women and men for any of the other stimuli presented.

Temporal variability of the N2pc during efficient and inefficient visual search	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attention; Visual search; Event related potentials; Theta; N2pc; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HUMAN PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; CAPTURE; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; POSTERIOR	Efficient and inefficient visual search are characterized by the difference in the time required to find the target. Efficient "popout" search time is relatively unaffected by increases in the number of search items, whereas inefficient "non-popout" search time requires more time increases in duration. Electrophysiological investigations of the neural correlates of visual search have revealed a component of the event-related potential (ERP) known as the N2pc. The N2pc is thought to reflect the orienting of attention to the target during visual search. If the N2pc is more closely associated in time with the moment of target selection than the onset of the search display, it may be predicted that the N2pc would be delayed or more temporally variable during inefficient compared to efficient visual search. In the present study, we contrasted efficient "popout" search with inefficient "non-popout" search to investigate the hypothesis that the N2pc is temporally associated with the moment of search completion, and this would be reflected as a delayed or attenuated N2pc during non-popout search compared to popout In Experiment 1, we observed a robust N2pc during popout search, but not during non-popout search. However, sorting trials by the N2pc latency recovered the N2pc during non-popout search. In Experiment 2 we replicated this observation and demonstrated that popout and non-popout search reflected differences in the temporal variability of the N2pc latency. Further investigation using time-spectral analysis suggests that evoked posterior-contralateral theta (4-6 Hz) underlies the N2pc during both popout and non-popout search. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Seizure Detection Algorithms Based on Analysis of EEG and ECG Signals: a Survey	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						epilepsy; seizure detection algorithm; EEG; ECG; feature extraction; classification	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; ABNORMALITIES; STIMULATION; PERFORMANCE	Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the CNS that predisposes individuals to recurrent seizures. Computerized seizure detection algorithms will enable alerting systems that may decrease the harm of the seizures. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of different types of seizure detection algorithms and their potential role in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Major recent algorithms use electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to detect the seizure onset and seizure event. In these algorithms, various features are extracted from the EEG signal alone or in concert with the ECG signal until the patients are classified into two classes, seizure and non-seizure. We identify three major categories for seizure detectors; EEG-based seizure-event detectors, EEG based seizure-onset detectors, and EEG/ECG-based seizure-onset detectors. In addition, some other related issues, such as dataset and evaluation measures, are also discussed. Finally, the performance of algorithms is evaluated, and their capabilities and limitations are described.

Because contamination from eye movements and eye blinks is a problem, a method for removing eye movement artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by applying an independent component analysis un-mixing matrix was proposed and implemented. Input character decisions were executed using a support vector machine (SVM) for judging the P3 existence of a single stimulus. The performances were compared while varying the number of channels of EEG signals, the types of feature vectors, and the ratio of the number of data used for training the SVM. The results indicated that three EEG signal channels (Fz, Cz, Pz) were enough to remove artifacts related to eye blinks and vertical eye movements and could be used to make a decision about input characters. The number of trials necessary to decide the input characters was ten on average. The best ratio achieved for the number of training data of targets and non-targets was 1:2. These results should be confirmed using a larger number of data sets.

Spatial Localization of Auditory Stimuli in Human Auditory Cortex is Based on Both Head-Independent and Head-Centered Coordinate Systems	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; SOUND LATERALIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SENSORY MEMORY; NECK MUSCLE; GAZE SHIFTS; REPRESENTATION; POSITION; LOCATION	In humans, whose ears are fixed on the head, auditory stimuli are initially registered in space relative to the head. Eventually, locations of sound sources need to be encoded also relative to the body, or in absolute allocentric space, to allow orientation toward the sounds sources and consequent action. We can therefore distinguish between two spatial representation systems: a basic head-centered coordinate system and a more complex head-independent system. In an ERP experiment, we attempted to reveal which of these two coordinate systems is represented in the human auditory cortex. We dissociated the two systems using the mismatch negativity (MMN), a well studied EEG effect evoked by acoustic deviations. Contrary to previous findings suggesting that only primary head-related information is present at this early stage of processing, we observed significant MMN effects for both head-independent and head-centered deviant stimuli. Our findings thus reveal that both primary head-related and secondary body- or world-related reference frames are represented at this stage of auditory processing.

Mental Fatigue Affects Visual Selective Attention	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RECURRENT NETWORK ARCHITECTURE; FIGURE-GROUND SEGREGATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; CORTEX; STRIATE; MODEL; MODULATION; SPOTLIGHT	Mental fatigue is a form of fatigue, induced by continuous task performance. Mentally fatigued people often report having a hard time keeping their attention focussed and being easily distracted. In this study, we examined the relation between mental fatigue, as induced by time on task, and attention-related changes in event-related potentials (ERPs). EEG, reaction times and response accuracies were obtained from 17 healthy volunteers during two hours of task performance on an adapted Eriksen flanker task. In this task, the size of targets and flankers was manipulated to discern neuronal processes that are related to processing of relevant information from processes related to the processing of irrelevant information. The ERP data showed that effects induced by target size manipulation were not affected by time on task, while an initial effect of flanker size manipulation decreased gradually with increasing time on task. We conclude that attention was affected by mental fatigue, in the form of a decrease in the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In behavioural results, this was reflected by a tendency of participants to increasingly base their response decision on irrelevant information, resulting in decreased response accuracies.

Neural Activations During Auditory Oddball Processing Discriminating Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory oddball; ERP; P300; PCA; psychosis; time-frequency	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; EVOKED-RESPONSE; CANDIDATE GENE; GAMMA; ABNORMALITIES; DISC1; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ENDOPHENOTYPES	Background: Reduced amplitude of the P300 event-related potential in auditory oddball tasks may characterize schizophrenia (SZ) but is also reported in bipolar disorder. Similarity of auditory processing abnormalities between these diagnoses is uncertain, given the frequent combination of both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients in bipolar samples; abnormalities may be restricted to psychosis. In addition, typically only latency and amplitude of brain responses at selected sensors and singular time points are used to characterize neural responses. Comprehensive quantification of brain activations involving both spatiotemporal and time-frequency analyses could better identify unique auditory oddball responses among patients with different psychotic disorders. Methods: Sixty SZ, 60 bipolar I with psychosis (BPP), and 60 healthy subjects (H) were compared on neural responses during an auditory oddball task using multisensor electroencephalography. Principal components analysis was used to reduce multisensor data before evaluating group differences on voltage and frequency of neural responses over time. Results: Linear discriminant analysis revealed five variables that best differentiated groups: 1) late beta activity to standard stimuli; 2) late beta/gamma activity to targets discriminated BPP from other groups; 3) midlatency theta/alpha activity to standards; 4) target-related voltage at the late N2 response discriminated both psychosis groups from H; and 5) target-related voltage during early N2 discriminated BPP from H. Conclusions: Although the P300 significantly differentiated psychotic groups from H, it did not uniquely discriminate groups beyond the above variables. No variable uniquely discriminated SZ, perhaps indicating utility of this task for studying psychosis-associated neurophysiology generally and BPP specifically.

However, they refer to different ways of regulation stimulation, by content (emotional and social) and by the formal (energetic and temporal) characteristics of activity, respectively. Thus, by indexing behavioral and cortical patterns of response, it was predicted that PEN- and RTT-relevant pairs of temperaments would be associated with specific attentional mechanisms. One week after administration of the FCB-TI and EPQ-R, subjects (260) performed the Emotional Go/No Go task while a 32-channel EEG was being recorded. They were instructed to respond to threatening, sad, or friendly faces, respectively, but not to any other facial expression. A range of ERP components responsive to facial stimuli were investigated. According to behavioral and cortical patterns of response, it was shown that PEN- and RTT-related pairs of temperament types were connected with effective functioning of the anterior and posterior attentional system, respectively. On the behavioral level, significant differences in attentional processing of facial affect were registered in PEN sanguines versus RTT sanguines and PEN melancholics versus RTT melancholics, while on the cortical level significant differences were registered in PEN melancholics versus RTT melancholics and PEN phlegmatics versus RTT phlegmatics. Given these results, the theoretical relations between the PEN and RTT - with particular respect to cognitive and cortical mechanisms underlying temperament types - are discussed.

In this work we study these correlates in a realistic situation simulated in a virtual reality environment. We focus on cortical potentials linked to the anticipation of future events (i.e. the contingent negative variation, CNV) and error-related potentials elicited by both visual and tactile feedback. Experiments with 6 subjects show brain activity consistent with previous studies using simpler stimuli, both at the level of ERPs and single trial classification. Moreover, we observe comparable signals irrespective of whether the subject was required to perform motor actions. Altogether, these results support the possibility of using these signals for practical brain machine interaction.

Methods Two auditory tones of different probabilities (oddball paradigm) and the same probability (control paradigm) were used. The average dynamic changes in amplitude were evaluated, and the in-phase consistency of the EEG spectrum at each frequency and time window across trials, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were computed. Results Subtraction of the ERPs of standard stimuli from the ERPs of deviant stimuli revealed a clear MMN component in the oddball paradigm. However, no discernible MMN component was observed in the control paradigm. Statistical tests showed that in the oddball paradigm, deviant tones produced significant increases of theta ERSPs and ITC at around 250 ms as compared with the standard tone, while no significant difference between the two stimuli was observed in the control paradigm. Conclusions Our results confirm that the auditory discriminatory process reflected in MMN is accompanied by phase resetting and power modulation at the theta frequency.

Data on brain activity was recorded through an EEG during this task to further estimate ERPs. When compared to non-smokers, smokers showed higher frontal activation when watching smoking related images.

We investigate whether temporal auditory processing is compromised in young children at-risk for dyslexia and whether it is associated with later language and reading skills. We recorded EEG from 17 months-old children with or without familial risk for dyslexia to investigate whether their auditory system was able to detect a temporal change in a tone pattern. The children were followed longitudinally and performed an intelligence- and language development test at ages 4 and 4.5 years. Literacy related skills were measured at the beginning of second grade, and word- and pseudo-word reading fluency were measured at the end of second grade. The EEG responses showed that control children could detect the temporal change as indicated by a mismatch response (MMR). The MMR was not observed in at-risk children. Furthermore, the fronto-central MMR amplitude correlated with preliterate language comprehension and with later word reading fluency, but not with phonological awareness. We conclude that temporal auditory processing differentiates young children at risk for dyslexia from controls and is a precursor of preliterate language comprehension and reading fluency.

Current methods for assessing concussions and basing return-to-play decisions rely on symptom resolution, rating scales, and neuropsychological testing, all of which are indirect measures of injury severity and detect functional capabilities but do not directly measure injury location or severity. In addition, these downstream measures are susceptible to false negatives because compensatory mechanism, such as unmasking and redundancies in brain circuitry can return functional capabilities before injury resolution. The multifactorial nature of concussion necessitates rapid, inexpensive, and easily applied multimodal analysis methods that can offer greater sensitivity and specificity. This article discusses how new approaches utilizing electrophysiology (e.g., QEEG, ERP, ECG, HRV), quantified balance measures, and biochemistry are necessary to advance the science of concussion assessment, treatment, recovery projections, and return-to-play decisions. These additional assessment tools offer a more direct window into the severity and location of the injury, real-time measures of brain function, and the ability to measure the multiple body systems negatively affected by concussion.

We found the comparison among studies to be difficult, as the information regarding the effects of TMS on P300 is both scarce and heterogeneous with respect to the parameters used in TMS stimulation and the elicitation of P300. However, 7 of 9 studies found positive results. New studies need to be carried out in order to understand the contribution of these variables and others to the alteration in the latency and amplitude of the P300 wave.	[Rego, Samuel R.

A virtual reality environment was set up, allowing aimed throws at distant targets, with participants standing upright and moving relatively unrestrained. After a separate practice session, the contingent negative variation (CNV) was measured during preparation for a simple button release, unaimed throws, and aimed throws at targets of two levels of difficulty. Consistent with expectations, CNV amplitude was larger for all throwing conditions compared to button release. It further increased with task difficulty in the aimed throwing conditions, reflecting the increasing motor programming demands for more difficult goal-directed actions. Therefore, investigating throwing as an instance of complex goal-directed action with ERPs is feasible, opening interesting perspectives for future research.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired simultaneously. The aims of the study were: to determine (i) the sensitivity and (ii) the repeatability of NIRS to detect the hemodynamic response, (iii) the sensitivity and (iv) the repeatability of EEG to detect a visual evoked potential (VEP), (v) to analyze optical data for the optical neuronal signal, and (vi) to test whether inadequate stimulation could be reason for absent hemodynamic responses. The results of the study were as follows. (i) Sensitivity of NIRS was 61.5% to detect hemodynamic responses; (ii) their reproducibility was 41.7%. A VEP was detected (iii) in 96.3% of all subjects with (iv) a reproducibility of 92.3%. (v) In two measurements data met the criteria for an optical neuronal signal. The noise level was 9.6 . 10(-5)% change in optical density. (vi) Insufficient stimulation was excluded as reason for absent hemodynamic responses. We conclude that NIRS is an promising tool to study cognitive activation and development of the brain. For clinical application, however, the sensitivity and reproducibility on an individual level needs to be improved.

Visual attention also modulates the LPP. In the present study, we sought to determine whether working memory load might exert its influence on ERPs by reducing fixations to arousing picture regions. We simultaneously recorded eye-tracking and EEG while participants performed a working memory task interspersed with the presentation of task-irrelevant fearful and neutral faces. As expected, fearful compared to neutral faces elicited larger N170 and LPP amplitudes; in addition, working memory load reduced the N170 and the LPP. Participants made more fixations to arousing regions of neutral faces and faces presented under high working memory load. Therefore, working memory load did not induce avoidance of arousing picture regions and visual attention cannot explain load effects on the N170 and LPP. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Variable-Weight Adaptive Filtering as an ERP Pre-Processing Technique	5TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, PTS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	5th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering	SEP 14-18, 2011	Budapest, HUNGARY			ERP; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Adaptive Filter; Stroop Test		Motivated by studies about the electrophysiological interference effect due to distinct informative elements of stimulus in response to a simplified variation of the Stroop Test, a previous study proposed a procedure for eye-blink artefact reduction based on adaptive filtering when no eletrooculogram data is available. In that occasion its performance was preliminarily assessed by applying it to real EEG. The present work aims at proceeding with this assessment by means of simulation. The generated signal was supposed to reproduce both EEG, ERP and eye-blink characteristics in four derivations (Fp(1), Fp(2), Cz and Oz). Results show that satisfactory artefact reduction is achieved even when its time occurrence superposes that of the desired ERP. The lowest general RMS error has been achieved using a 6th order filter and a low adaptation factor. Furthermore, the weight thresholds have minor influence on filter performance when using plausible values. In conclusion, the proposed approach resulted in a considerable reduction of eye-blink artefact, preserving ERP morphology and allowing easy component identification.

As the neural activity elicited by a transient nociceptive stimulus largely reflects non nociceptive-specific, multimodal neural processes, here we tested, for the first time, whether the observation of other's pain preferentially affects the brain responses elicited by nociceptive stimulation, or instead similarly modulates those elicited by stimuli belonging to a different sensory modality. Using 58-channel electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded the cortical responses elicited by laser and auditory stimulation during the observation of videoclips showing either noxious or non-noxious stimulation of a stranger's hand. We found that the observation of other's pain modulated the cortical activity consisting in an event-related desynchronization in the beta band (beta ERD), and elicited by nociceptive laser stimuli, but not by auditory stimuli. Using three different source analysis approaches, we provide converging evidence that such modulation affected neural activity in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex. The magnitude of this modulation correlated well with a subjective measure of similarity between the model's hand and the onlooker's representation of the hand. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the observation of other's pain modulates, in a somatosensory-specific fashion, the cortical responses elicited by nociceptive stimuli in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the stimulated hand.

Integrating the picture viewing and threat-of-shock paradigm, the present study examined the processing of emotional pictures while they were explicitly instructed to cue threat of real world danger (i.e. electric shocks). Toward this end, 60 pleasant, neutral and unpleasant IAPS-pictures were presented (1s) as a continuous random stream while high-density EEG and self-reported threat were assessed. In three experimental runs, each picture category was used once as a threat-cue, whereas in the other conditions the same category served as safety-cue. An additional passive viewing run served as a no-threat condition, thus, establishing a threat-safety continuum (threat-cue-safety-cue-no-threat) for each picture category. Threat-of-shock modulated P1, P2 and parieto-occipital LPP amplitudes. While the P1 component differentiated among threat-and no-threat conditions, the P2 and LPP effects were specific to pictures signaling threat-of-shock. Thus, stimulus processing progressively gained more accurate information about environmental threat conditions. Interestingly, the finding of increased EPN and centro-parietal LPP amplitudes to emotional pictures was independent from threat-of-shock manipulation. Accordingly, the results indicate distinct effects associated with the intrinsic significance of emotional pictures and explicitly instructed threat contingencies.

The ability to deploy and maintain attention on a particular focus is considered as a prerequisite for 'mindful', 'metacognitive' awareness, and hence crucial for therapy success. Accordingly, sustained concentration is the skill most extensively taught in MBCT. The goal of the present study was to test whether this ability increases after MBCT, as assumed. The late component of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an event-related brain potential (ERP), known to reflect the allocation of attentional resources, was used as the measure of concentration ability. In the main phase of the study, 91 recurrently depressed patients in remission were randomly assigned to eight-week treatment by either MBCT or waiting (WAIT for delayed MBCT). The CNV response to an auditory test stimulus was measured pre- and post-treatment in a 'mindfulness task', in which patients were instructed to focus on their breath, as taught in MBCT. The late CNV (LCNV) was increased only after MBCT (and not after WAIT). This result reflects patients' improved ability to shift their attention toward current moment experience and away from potentially depressogenic thinking or rumination during mild dysphoric states-a known risk factor for depressive relapse/recurrence.

However, the effects of TBS on neuronal oscillations remain unclear. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate changes of neuronal oscillations after continuous TBS (cTBS), the protocol that emulates long-term depression (LTD) form of synaptic plasticity. We randomly divided 26 healthy humans into two groups receiving either Active or Sham cTBS as control over the left primary motor cortex (M1). Post-cTBS aftereffects were assessed with behavioural measurements at rest using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and at active state during the execution of a choice reaction time (RT) task in combination with continuous electrophysiological recordings. The cTBS-induced EEG oscillations were assessed using event-related power (ERPow), which reflected regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies of theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-9.5 Hz), mu (10-12.5 Hz), low beta (13-19.5 Hz), and high beta (20-30 Hz) brain rhythms. Results revealed 20-min suppression of MEPs and at least 30-min increase of ERPow modulation, suggesting that besides MEPs, EEG has the potential to provide an accurate cortical readout to assess cortical excitability and to investigate the interference of cortical oscillations in the human brain post-cTBS. We also observed a predominant modulation of beta frequency band, supporting the hypothesis that cTBS acts more on cortical level. Theta oscillations were also modulated during rest implying the involvement of independent cortical theta generators over the motor network post cTBS.

Though hearing one's own name well has been studied, the relationship between hearing one's own name and self-awareness is not understood. In this study, we focused on brain responses to hearing one's own name. In order to assess the pattern of ERP and the power of EEG frequency during hearing one's own name, we used a passive oddball paradigm that included the subject's own name (SON). The grand average ERP showed that mismatch negativity and novelty p300 were elicited by SON. Time frequency analysis revealed that theta power and beta power were increased around 400-600 ms after stimulus by SON.

J	Jin, J; Allison, BZ; Wang, XY; Neuper, C				Jin, Jing; Allison, Brendan Z.; Wang, Xingyu; Neuper, Christa			A combined brain-computer interface based on P300 potentials and motion-onset visual evoked potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related potential; P300 potential; Motion-onset visual evoked potentials; Brain-computer interface; Changing stimuli; Adaptive	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; COMPONENTS; STIMULI; EEG	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to communicate via brain activity alone. Many BCIs rely on the P300 and other event-related potentials (ERPs) that are elicited when target stimuli flash. Although there have been considerable research exploring ways to improve P300 BCIs, surprisingly little work has focused on new ways to change visual stimuli to elicit more recognizable ERPs. In this paper, we introduce a "combined" BCI based on P300 potentials and motion-onset visual evoked potentials (M-VEPs) and compare it with BCIs based on each simple approach (P300 and M-VEP). Offline data suggested that performance would be best in the combined paradigm. Online tests with adaptive BCIs confirmed that our combined approach is practical in an online BCI, and yielded better performance than the other two approaches P < 0.05) without annoying or overburdening the subject. The highest mean classification accuracy (96%) and practical bit rate (26.7 bit/s) were obtained from the combined condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the anticipation phase, differential activity was most prominent over midline electrodes and parieto-occipital sensors. Differences between non-reward- and reward-predicting cues were localized in the cuneus and later in the dorsal PCC, suggesting a modulation by potential reward information during early visual processing, followed by a coarse emotional evaluation of the cues. Oscillatory analysis revealed increased theta power after non-reward cues over fronto-central sites. In the beta range, power decreased with the magnitude of the potential reward and increased with reaction time, probably reflecting the influence of the striatal response to potential reward on the sensorimotor cortex. At reward delivery, negative prediction errors led to a larger mediofrontal negativity. The spatiotemporal evolution of reward processing was modulated by prediction error: whereas differences were located in PCC and putamen in the prediction error comparison, in the case of expected outcomes they were located in PCC, ACC and parahippocampal gyrus. In the oscillatory realm, theta power was largest following rewards and, in the case of non-rewards, was largest when these were unexpected. Higher beta activity following rewards was also observed in both modalities, but MEG additionally showed a significant power decrease for this condition over parieto-occipital sensors. Our results show how visual, limbic and striatal structures are involved in the different stages of reward anticipation and delivery, and how theta and beta oscillations have a prominent role in the processing of these stimuli.

To examine the physiological differences underlying these differences in perception, we compared the brain activity during an apparent motion task for the High and the Low groups using electroencephalography. We initially screened 60 potential participants using the VVIQ. On the basis of their scores, we invited 20 people from the lower and the higher ends of the VVIQ distribution to participate in our event-related potential study. Our results showed that individuals in both the High and the Low groups were sensitive to the apparent motion content of the task. Perception of apparent motion evoked a negative potential starting around 90 ms, followed by a positive potential beginning at 150-170 ms after the second stimulus. The scalp distributions of both negative and positive potentials for the High group were broader than those for the Low group. Moreover, the onset of positivity in the High group (150 ms) was earlier than that in the Low group (170 ms). We believe that these results may be mechanistically associated with the differences in the perception of apparent motion between individuals with high and low vividness of visual imagery.

Temporal expectancies were manipulated by substituting standard masculine cadences at metrically strong positions with deviant, metrically unaccented, feminine cadences. Experts detected metrically deviant cadences better than laymen. Analyses of event-related potentials demonstrated that an early P3a-like component (similar to 150300 ms), elicited by musical closure, was significantly enhanced at frontal and parietal electrodes in response to deviant endings in experts, whereas a reduced response to deviance occurred in laymen. Putative neuronal sources contributing to the modulation of this component were localized in a network of brain regions including bilateral supplementary motor areas, middle and posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, associative visual areas, as well as in the right amygdala and insula. In all these regions, experts showed enhanced responses to metric deviance. Later effects demonstrated enhanced activations within the same brain network, as well as higher processing speed for experts. These results suggest that early brain responses to metric deviance in experts may rely on motor representations mediated by the supplementary motor area and motor cingulate regions, in addition to areas involved in self-referential imagery and relevance detection. Such motor representations could play a role in temporal sensory prediction evolved from musical training and suggests that rhythm evokes action more strongly in highly trained instrumentalists.

P300 occurs at a relatively well defined time in relation to a stimulus and it represents a signal with a specified band frequency. Method: The electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded with 4 wet electrodes by means of g.MOBIlab+ module, a g.tec acquisition system. The multiresolution wavelet transform was chosen to extract the P300 potential from the EEG signal because it provides information on both time and frequency domains. Results: The multiresolution wavelet transform decomposes the signal in sub-bands and it helps to highlight the P300 potential. The spectrum of the P300 potential is around 3Hz. For the multiresolution wavelet decomposition this corresponds to coefficients of approximation of order 4 according to 0 to 60 Hz band of the original EEG signal. The representation of these coefficients emphasizes a better detection of P300 potential then in the original signal. Conclusion: It is shown to be a more appropriate method than the direct analysis of the signal because it works with lower dimensional signals. This method of detection of the P300 potential can be used successfully in the implementation of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

Methods: Electrical stimuli, a single pulse or five pulses, were presented at the index fingers of the left or right hand. The to-be-attended hand and stimulated finger varied randomly from trial to trial. Participants had to press a foot pedal only when the relevant stimulus, varied between participants, occurred at the attended hand. EEG was measured to extract relevant ERP components. Results: The N100 and N150 were enhanced for attended as compared to unattended stimuli. The N100, N150, P260, and the P500 were enlarged for five pulse as compared to single pulse stimuli. The P260, which is thought to reflect a call for attention, was enhanced for unattended as compared to attended stimuli. Source analyses indicate that attentional effects on the N100, N150, and P260 may be related to changes in activity in secondary somatosensory areas and the anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: A transient manipulation of spatial attention increases cortical activity induced by attended relative to unattended intracutaneous electrical stimuli, but initially unattended stimuli appear to induce an enhanced orienting effect. Significance: Initially unattended intracutaneous electrical stimuli seem to induce a call for attention. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A brief overview is given of the hardware development followed by a discussion of EEG-fMRI applications. The technique's development was clinically motivated in the context of epilepsy. Accordingly, the evolution of studies trying to identify with EEG-fMRI the origin of individual epileptiform discharges up to those revealing general mechanisms of epilepsy syndromes is sketched. In epilepsy centers experienced with the methodology, EEG-fMRI has found its place in the presurgical evaluation of patients. In cognitive neuroscience, the multimodal technique has significantly contributed to the understanding of phenomena of the resting state and neuronal oscillations. While most of the studies discussed relate EEG to fMRI by means of prediction, the development of forward models facilitating the symmetrical 'fusion' of EEG and fMRI data is the subject of current neuro-computational research. Recently, intracranial EEG has been safely recorded during (functional) MRI broadly extending the perspectives for epilepsy and research into neurovascular coupling. EEG-fMRI has evolved into a mature, generally accessible and in principle easily applicable technique, which is a great achievement. Because this at the same time bears the risk of unreflected use. EEG-fMRI safety issues are also highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rauss, K; Pourtois, G; Vuilleumier, P; Schwartz, S				Rauss, Karsten; Pourtois, Gilles; Vuilleumier, Patrik; Schwartz, Sophie			Effects of attentional load on early visual processing depend on stimulus timing	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						C1; early vision; EEG; V1	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; AREAS; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; MULTIPLE; STRIATE; TASK; MODULATION	A growing number of studies suggest that early visual processing is not only affected by low-level perceptual attributes but also by higher order cognitive factors such as attention or emotion. Using high-density electroencephalography, we recently demonstrated that attentional load of a task at fixation reduces the response of primary visual cortex to irrelevant peripheral stimuli, as indexed by the C1 component. In the latter study, peripheral stimuli were always presented during intervals without task-relevant stimuli. Here, we use a similar paradigm but present central task stimuli and irrelevant peripheral stimuli simultaneously while keeping all other stimulus characteristics constant. Results show that rather than to suppress responses to peripheral stimulation, high attentional load elicits higher C1 amplitudes under these conditions. These findings suggest that stimulus timing can profoundly alter the effects of attentional load on the earliest stages of processing in human visual cortex. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

The interpretation of these studies is complicated by the fact that, in a majority of studies, the CNV signal was obtained at a time when subjects were not only registering stimulus duration but also making decisions and preparing to act. Previously, we demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) in humans lengthened the perceived duration of a visual stimulus (Wiener et al., 2010a), suggesting the rSMG is involved in basic encoding processes. Here, we report a replication of this effect with simultaneous EEG recordings during the encoding of stimulus duration. Stimulation of the rSMG led to an increase in perceived duration and the amplitude of N1 and CNV components recorded from frontocentral sites. Furthermore, the size of the CNV amplitude, but not N1, positively correlated with the size of the rTMS effect but negatively correlated with bias (the baseline tendency to report a comparison stimulus as shorter), suggesting that the CNV indexes stimulus duration. These results suggest that a feedforward mechanism from parietal to prefrontal regions mediates temporal encoding and demonstrate a dissociation between early and late phases of encoding processes.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity during the transition from visually guided to memory-guided force control. J Neurophysiol 108: 1335-1348, 2012. First published June 13, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00972.2011.-It is well established that the prefrontal cortex is involved during memory-guided tasks whereas visually guided tasks are controlled in part by a frontal-parietal network. However, the nature of the transition from visually guided to memory-guided force control is not as well established. As such, this study examines the spatiotemporal pattern of brain activity that occurs during the transition from visually guided to memory-guided force control. We measured 128-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy individuals while they performed a grip force task. After visual feedback was removed, the first significant change in event-related activity occurred in the left central region by 300 ms, followed by changes in prefrontal cortex by 400 ms. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to localize the strongest activity to the left ventral premotor cortex and ventral prefrontal cortex. A second experiment altered visual feedback gain but did not require memory. In contrast to memory-guided force control, altering visual feedback gain did not lead to early changes in the left central and midline prefrontal regions. Decreasing the spatial amplitude of visual feedback did lead to changes in the midline central region by 300 ms, followed by changes in occipital activity by 400 ms. The findings show that subjects rely on sensorimotor memory processes involving left ventral premotor cortex and ventral prefrontal cortex after the immediate transition from visually guided to memory-guided force control.

J	Lange, K				Lange, Kathrin			The N1 effect of temporal attention is independent of sound location and intensity: Implications for possible mechanisms of temporal attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Sensation; perception; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SHORT-TERM PLASTICITY; DOWN GAIN-CONTROL; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SCALP DISTRIBUTIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; STIMULUS-INTENSITY	It has been repeatedly shown that the auditory N1 is enhanced for sounds presented at an attended time point. The present study investigated the underlying mechanisms using a temporal cuing paradigm. In each trial, an auditory cue indicated at which time point a second sound could be relevant for response selection. Crucially, in addition to temporal attention, two physical sound features with known effects on the sensory N1 were manipulated: location and intensity. Positive evidence for conjoint effects of attention and location or attention and intensity would corroborate the notion that the sensory N1 was modulated by temporal attention, thus supporting a gain mechanism. However, the N1 effect of temporal attention was not similarly lateralized as the sensory N1, and, moreover, it was independent of sound intensity. Thus, the present results do not provide compelling evidence that temporal attention involves an increase in sensory gain.

Recent results have shown that much of this performance reduction can be compensated for if contrast relationships in the neighborhood of the eyes are restored. Chimeric faces that contain positive eyes on negative faces are almost as well recognized as fully positive faces. Here we examine the neural correlates of this behavioral finding. Given that positive and chimeric faces lead to similar behavioral performance, do they also elicit similar neural responses? Specifically, we investigate early event-related potential components in response to these two kinds of images. Past studies have shown that the N170 is significantly affected by contrast negation. However, we find that the simple chimeric transformation has a profound effect on this and two other event-related potential components associated with face perception. Consistent with our behavioral results, we find that the N170, P100 and P250 components for positive and chimeric faces are statistically indistinguishable, but differ er significantly from those corresponding to the fully negative faces. We discuss the implications of these results regarding the nature of facial representation underlying behavior as well as the event-related potential components.

The mechanisms by which regularly (walked, birds) and irregularly (gave, geese) inflected forms are processed are less well established. We combine the masked priming paradigm with EEG recording to directly compare the ERPs evoked by regularly and irregularly inflected forms. We find equivalent N250 priming effects for both types of morphological complexity, which argues for rapid, form based morphological parsing of all morphologically complex word forms.

To investigate the specificity of the treatment, outcomes were related to learning during tNF. Methods: Thirteen children with ADHD trained over 36 lessons to regulate their brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using both theta-beta frequency and slow cortical potential (SCP) protocols. Thirty-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to calculate low-resolution electromagnetic tNF and to assess the course of the training. Pre- and post-assessments included questionnaires, tests of attention, EEG recordings, and cognitive event-related potentials. Results: Despite behavioural improvement and EEG artefact reduction, only partial learning was found for ACC parameters. Successful regulation was observed only for a simple feedback variant of SCP training, but with ACC-specific effects. Over training, resting EEG analysis indicated individual frequency normalisation rather than unidirectional changes across subjects. Conclusions: These results indicate that clinical improvement after ACC-tNF training can parallel artefact reduction without substantial learning of improved cortical control. However, individual normalisation of resting EEG activity and partial SCP control proved possible in this specific brain region affected in ADHD using tNF. Further studies are needed to clarify which critical aspects mediate region-specific learning in neurofeedback. Significance: This study is the first to systematically investigate tNF in children suffering from a psychiatric disorder. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The aim of the current study was to investigate electrophysiologic evidence for deficits in emotional face processing in patients with BN. Methods: Event-related potentials were recorded from 13 women with BN and 13 matched healthy controls while viewing neutral, happy, fearful, and angry facial expressions. Participants' recognition performance for emotional faces was tested in a subsequent categorization task. In addition, the degree of alexithymia, depression, and anxiety were assessed via questionnaires. Results: Categorization of emotional faces was hampered in BN (p = .01). Amplitudes of event-related potentials differed during emotional face processing: face-specific N170 amplitudes were less pronounced for angry faces in patients with BN (mean [M] [standard deviation {SD}] = 1.46 [0.56] mu V versus M [SD] = -1.23 [0.61] mu V, p = .02). In contrast, P3 amplitudes were more pronounced in patients with BN as compared with controls (M [SD] = 2.64 [0.46] mu V versus M [SD] = 1.25 [0.39] mu V, p = .04), independent of emotional expression. Conclusions: The study provides novel electrophysiologic data showing that emotional faces are processed differently in patients with BN as compared with healthy controls. We suggest that deficits in early automatic emotion classification in BN are followed by an increased allocation of attentional resources to compensate for those deficits. These findings might contribute to a better understanding of the impaired social functioning in BN.

These algorithms exploit information contained in temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal patterns of independent variables (features) to detect subtle but reliable differences between brain responses to external stimuli or internal brain states. When applied to the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, a choice needs to be made on how the input features to the algorithm are obtained from the signal amplitudes measured at the various channels. In this article, we consider six types of pattern analyses deriving from the combination of three types of feature selection in the temporal domain (predefined windows, shifting window, whole trial) with two approaches to handle the channel dimension (channel wise, multi-channel). We combined these different types of analyses with a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and analyzed a multi-subject EEG data set from a study aimed at understanding the task dependence of the cortical mechanisms for encoding speaker's identity and speech content (vowels) from short speech utterances (Bonte, Valente, & Formisano, 2009). Outcomes of the analyses showed that different grouping of available features helps highlighting complementary (i.e. temporal, topographic) aspects of information content in the data. A shifting window/multi-channel approach proved especially valuable in tracing both the early build up of neural information reflecting speaker or vowel identity and the late and task-dependent maintenance of relevant information reflecting the performance of a working memory task. Because it exploits the high temporal resolution of EEG (and MEG), such a shifting window approach with sequential multi-channel classifications seems the most appropriate choice for tracing the temporal profile of neural information processing.

Rapid social perception is flexible: approach and avoidance motivational states shape P100 responses to other-race faces	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						race; ERP; P100; social perception; face perception; motivation; approach	INDIVIDUATING PROCESSES; IMPRESSION-FORMATION; AMYGDALA ACTIVITY; RACIAL-ATTITUDES; ATTENTION; PREJUDICE; EXTRASTRIATE; STEREOTYPES; IMPLICIT; BRAIN	Research on person categorization suggests that people automatically and inflexibly categorize others according to group memberships, such as race. Consistent with this view, research using electroencephalography (EEG) has found that White participants tend to show an early difference in processing Black versus White faces. Yet, new research has shown that these ostensibly automatic biases may not be as inevitable as once thought and that motivational influences may be able to eliminate these biases. It is unclear, however, whether motivational influences shape the initial biases or whether these biases can only be modulated by later, controlled processes. Using EEG to examine the time course of biased processing, we manipulated approach and avoidance motivational states by having participants pull or push a joystick, respectively, while viewing White or Black faces. Consistent with previous work on own-race bias, we observed a greater P100 response to White than Black faces; however, this racial bias was attenuated in the approach condition. These data suggest that rapid social perception may be flexible and can be modulated by motivational states.

MEG, iEEG) provide high temporal resolution data to study the dynamics of neurocognitive networks: large scale neural assemblies involved in task-specific information processing. How does a neurocognitive network reorganize spatiotemporally on the order of a few milliseconds to process specific aspects of the task? At what times do networks segregate for task processing, and at what time scales does integration of information occur via changes in functional connectivity? Here, we propose a data analysis framework-Temporal microstructure of cortical networks (TMCN)-that answers these questions for EEG/MEG recordings in the signal space. Method validation is established on simulated MEG data from a delayed-match to-sample (DMS) task. We then provide an example application on MEG recordings during a paired associate task (modified from the simpler DMS paradigm) designed to study modality specific long term memory recall. Our analysis identified the times at which network segregation occurs for processing the memory recall of an auditory object paired to a visual stimulus (visual-auditory) in comparison to an analogous visual-visual pair. Across all subjects, onset times for first network divergence appeared within a range of 0.08-0.47 s after initial visual stimulus onset. This indicates that visual-visual and visual auditory memory recollection involves equivalent network components without any additional recruitment during an initial period of the sensory processing stage which is then followed by recruitment of additional network components for modality specific memory recollection. Therefore, we propose TMCN as a viable computational tool for extracting network timing in various cognitive tasks. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This biophysical relationship is common to popular algorithms that infer neuronal generators via inverse solutions. It may be further simplified as Poisson's source equation, which identifies underlying current generators from estimates of the second spatial derivative of the field potential (Laplacian transformation). Intracranial current source density (CSD) studies have dissected the "cortical dipole" into intracortical sources and sinks, corresponding to physiologically-meaningful patterns of neuronal activity at a sublaminar resolution, much of which is locally cancelled (i.e., closed field). By virtue of the macroscopic scale of the scalp-recorded EEG, a surface Laplacian reflects the radial projections of these underlying currents, representing a unique, unambiguous measure of neuronal activity at scalp. Although the surface Laplacian requires minimal assumptions compared to complex, model-sensitive inverses, the resulting waveform topographies faithfully summarize and simplify essential constraints that must be placed on putative generators of a scalp potential topography, even if they arise from deep or partially-closed fields. CSD methods thereby provide a global empirical and biophysical context for generator localization, spanning scales from intracortical to scalp recordings.

It refers to that branch of Science aimed at exploring the Neurosciences through an ongoing process continuously renewed at each successive step of its advancement towards understanding the brain in its entirety. This chapter presents a neuroheuristic approach to the decision making process, firstly in an animal experiment, in an attempt to investigate the basic processes away from an anthropological perspective, and secondly in a classical neuroeconomic paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG). Multiple electrodes for multiple neuronal recordings were chronically implanted in cerebral cortical areas of freely-moving rats trained in a response choice task. Invariant preferred firing sequences appeared in association with the response predicted by the subject or in association with specific errors of decision. We recorded EEG and analyzed event-related potentials of subjects in a two conditions variant of UG where human players acted either as proposers with computer-controlled virtual partners or as responders to offers made by a virtual proposer. A proposer, in contrast to a responder, has to store the future proposed value in short-term memory and engage retrieval processes after getting the responder's reaction. Our EEG results support the hypothesis that while playing the role of proposers human subjects engage in a specific retrieval process while performing UG.	[Villa, Alessandro E.

Nicotine Normalizes Event Related Potentials in COMT-Val-tg Mice and Increases Gamma and Theta Spectral Density	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						catechol-O-methyltransferase; COMT; mouse; nicotine; event-related potential; EEG; gamma; theta	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS; VAL(158)MET POLYMORPHISM; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; PREPULSE INHIBITION	Regulation of dopamine neurotransmission is essential for cognitive processes. In humans and rodents, the relationship between dopamine signaling and cognitive performance is described as a dose-dependent, inverted-U curve whereby excess or insufficiency of dopamine in prefrontal cortex has detrimental effects. Previous studies have indicated that prefrontal dopamine levels are associated with genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a regulatory enzyme that controls dopamine availability. Furthermore, smokers who carry the high-activity COMT-Val allele are more prone to cognitive deficits and have an increased risk of smoking relapse. The present study employed transgenic mice expressing the human COMT-Val variant to determine the effects of the high-activity COMT allele on electrophysiological markers, including the P20, N40, and P80 components of the auditory event-related potential, as well as baseline and auditory event-related power and phase-synchrony in theta and gamma ranges. We also examined the effects of nicotine on these measures to investigate the potential effects of smoking on COMT-mediated electrophysiological activity. COMT-Val-tg mice displayed increased N40 latency and decreased P80 amplitude as well as reduced baseline theta and gamma power. Nicotine increased P20 and P80 amplitudes, decreased N40 amplitude, increased P20 and N40 latencies, and reduced P80 latency. Nicotine also increased the event-related power and phase synchrony, yielding an increase in signal-to-noise ratio across theta and gamma ranges. COMT activity specifically alters long-latency components of the event-related response. Nicotine restored normal event-related activity among COMT-Val-tg mice, suggesting one mechanism through which nicotine may normalize cognitive function among people with the high-activity allele.

However, little is known about the relationship between ERD and ERS patterns and the degree of stroke impairment. The aim of this work was to clarify this relationship. Methods-EEG during motor imagery and execution were measured in 29 patients with first-ever monolateral stroke causing any degree of motor deficit in the upper limb. The strength and laterality of the ERD or ERS patterns were correlated with the scores of the European Stroke Scale, the Medical Research Council, and the Modified Ashworth Scale. Results-Mean age of the patients was 58 +/- 15 years; mean time from the incident was 4 +/- 4 months. Stroke lesions were cortical (n = 8), subcortical (n = 11), or mixed (n = 10), attributable to either an ischemic event (n = 26) or a hemorrhage (n = 3), affecting the right (n = 16) or left (n = 13) hemisphere. Higher impairment was related to stronger ERD in the unaffected hemisphere and higher spasticity was related to stronger ERD in the affected hemisphere. Both were related to a relatively stronger ERS in the affected hemisphere. Conclusion-The results of this study may have implications for the design of potential poststroke rehabilitation interventions based on brain-computer interface technologies that use neurophysiological signals like ERD or ERS as neural substrates for the mutual interaction between brain and machine and, ultimately, help stroke patients to regain motor control.

Blind source separation, wavelet denoising and discriminant analysis for EEG artefacts and noise cancelling	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Artefact elimination; BSS; Supervised classification; Wavelet denoising; Medical validation	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAM BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; 2ND-ORDER STATISTICS; OCULAR ARTIFACT; AUTOMATIC CORRECTION; REMOVAL; SIGNALS; ICA	This paper proposes an automatic method for artefact removal and noise elimination from scalp electroencephalogram recordings (EEG). The method is based on blind source separation (BSS) and supervised classification and proposes a combination of classical and news features and classes to improve artefact elimination (ocular, high frequency muscle and ECG artefacts). The role of a supplementary step of wavelet denoising (WD) is explored and the interactions between BSS, denoising and classification are analyzed. The results are validated on simulated signals by quantitative evaluation criteria and on real EEG by medical expertise. The proposed methodology successfully rejected a good percentage of artefacts and noise, while preserving almost all the cerebral activity. The "denoised artefact-free" EEG presents a very good improvement compared with recorded raw EEG: 96% of the EEGs are easier to interpret. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is unknown whether this deficit is unique to schizophrenia or is common to psychotic disorders more broadly, and its associations with clinical characteristics of the illness are not well understood. Methods: The ERN and the error positivity (Pe) were recorded from 33 individuals with schizophrenia, 45 individuals with other psychotic disorders, and 33 healthy control subjects. Patients were drawn from a cohort with psychotic disorders followed since first hospitalization and diagnosed by consensus based on 10 years of observation. Results: The ERN was profoundly blunted in the patient group, regardless of diagnosis, indicating that this deficit is not unique to schizophrenia. The Pe, meanwhile, was blunted only among individuals with schizophrenia, indicating that the ERN and Pe are differentially related to psychotic illnesses. A blunted ERN was associated with more severe negative symptoms and poorer real-world functioning, as indicated by unemployment and re-hospitalization over 10 years of illness. Although reduced compared with control subjects, ERN amplitude was greater in patients with higher neuroticism, indicating that error processing is moderated by personality differences in the same manner as in healthy populations. Conclusions: The current study advances the literature by evaluating diagnostic specificity and functional correlates of impaired error processing in psychosis.

Movement preparation and cortical processing of afferent inputs in cortical tremor: An event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cortical myoclonus; Event-related desynchronization; Event-related synchronization; Sensorimotor interactions; Motor control	MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; SENSORIMOTOR AREAS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MYOCLONUS; RHYTHMS; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION; EXCITABILITY	Objective: We sought to characterize cortical activity related to motor control in patients presenting with isolated cortical tremor, in order to determine whether or not myoclonus-related impairments are a source of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) disruption. Methods: Nine patients presenting with isolated cortical tremor were compared with controls. Mu and beta ERD/ERS were computed over the scalp and brain surfaces using 128-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during voluntary and passive finger extensions. We recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation and performed myoclonic jerk-locked back-averaging of EEG activity. Results: Back-averaging revealed a cortical premyoclonic spike in all patients. Five of the nine patients had exaggerated SEPs. The amplitude of mu ERD was greater in patients. Beta ERD/ERS did not differ from that seen in controls. Localizations of mu and beta ERD/ERS did not differ from controls and were identified in pre- and post-central sensorimotor cortical areas. Conclusions: The present results suggest a hyperexcitability of the cortico-subcortical loops responsible for movement preparation and execution. Post-movement inhibition related to cortical processing of afferent input is unaffected in isolated cortical myoclonus. Significance: Intracortical abnormalities can differ in patients suffering from cortical myoclonus, according to whether or not the individuals have associated epileptic symptoms.

Striving for objectively characterizing clinical pain states using more natural, prolonged stimuli, tonic pain has been recently associated with the individual peak frequency of alpha oscillations. This finding encouraged us to explore whether alpha power, reflecting the magnitude of the synchronized activity within this frequency range, will demonstrate a corresponding relationship with subjective perception of tonic pain. Methods: Five-minute-long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with alpha-1 and alpha-2 power. Results: NPSs and alpha power remained stable throughout the recording conditions (Ps >= 0.381). In the noxious condition, alpha-1 power obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp was negatively correlated with NPSs (Ps <= 0.04). Additionally, resting-state alpha-1 power recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp was negatively correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps <= 0.038). Conclusions: Current findings suggest alpha-1 power may serve as a direct, objective and experimentally stable measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Furthermore, resting-state alpha-1 power might reflect individuals' inherent tonic pain responsiveness. Significance: The relevance of alpha-1 power to tonic pain perception may deepen the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the processing of prolonged noxious stimulation.

Mind wandering and motor control: off-task thinking disrupts the online adjustment of behaviour	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mind wandering; experience sampling; motor control; visuomotor tracking task; fERN; performance monitoring; time-estimation	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; DEFAULT NETWORK; NEURAL SYSTEM; ATTENTION; BRAIN; LAPSES; FLUCTUATIONS; AWARENESS; FAILURES; FEEDBACK	Mind wandering episodes have been construed as periods of "stimulus-independent" thought, where our minds are decoupled from the external sensory environment. In two experiments, we used behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to determine whether mind wandering episodes can also be considered as periods of "response-independent" thought, with our minds disengaged from adjusting our behavioral outputs. In the first experiment, participants performed a motor tracking task and were occasionally prompted to report whether their attention was "on-task" or "mind wandering." We found greater tracking error in periods prior to mind wandering vs. on-task reports. To ascertain whether this finding was due to attenuation in visual perception per se vs. a disruptive effect of mind wandering on performance monitoring, we conducted a second experiment in which participants completed a time-estimation task. They were given feedback on the accuracy of their estimations while we recorded their EEG, and were also occasionally asked to report their attention state. We found that the sensitivity of behavior and the P3 ERP component to feedback signals were significantly reduced just prior to mind wandering vs. on-task attentional reports. Moreover, these effects co-occurred with decreases in the error-related negativity elicited by feedback signals (fERN), a direct measure of behavioral feedback assessment in cortex. Our findings suggest that the functional consequences of mind wandering are not limited to just the processing of incoming stimulation per se, but extend as well to the control and adjustment of behavior.

To elucidate the mechanisms of the cognitive system underlying face recognition, we investigated cerebral oscillations related to encoding in 'person identity nodes'. Methods: EEG was measured in nine healthy adults during perception of their own face, familiar face and unfamiliar face images. Results: Event-related synchronization (ERS) in theta, alpha and beta bands was initially induced in occipito-temporal areas within 0-200 ms of the presentation of facial stimuli. In addition, delta ERS over parietal and left temporal areas was greater in response to familiar faces around 0-800 ms compared with unfamiliar faces. Beta ERS over the right prefrontal area was significantly greater in response to a participant's own face compared with a familiar face at 400-800 ms post-stimulus. Conclusions: ERS within 0-200 ms reflects structural encoding of faces (i.e., N170 of the event related potential). Delta ERS within 0-800 ms suggests an association with memory retrieval. Beta ERS within 400-800 ms is consistent with the cortical areas reported to be strongly related to self-face perception in previous fMRI studies. Significance: The delta and beta bands ERS might provide an index of familiarity and self-recognition, respectively. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Eimer, M; Gosling, A; Duchaine, B				Eimer, Martin; Gosling, Angela; Duchaine, Bradley			Electrophysiological markers of covert face recognition in developmental prosopagnosia	BRAIN			English	Article						face processing; face recognition; prosopagnosia; event-related brain potentials; visual cognition	FAMILIAR; PERCEPTION	To study the existence and neural basis of covert face recognition in individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, we tested a group of 12 participants with developmental prosopagnosia in a task that required them to judge the familiarity of successively presented famous or non-famous faces. Electroencephalography was recorded during task performance, and event-related brain potentials were computed for recognized famous faces, non-recognized famous faces and non-famous faces. In six individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, non-recognized famous faces triggered an occipito-temporal N250 component, which is thought to reflect the activation of stored visual memory traces of known individual faces. In contrast to the N250, the P600f component, which is linked to late semantic stages of face identity processing, was not triggered by non-recognized famous faces. Event-related potential correlates of explicit face recognition obtained on those few trials where participants with developmental prosopagnosia classified famous faces as known or familiar, were similar to the effects previously found in participants with intact face recognition abilities, suggesting that face recognition mechanisms in individuals with developmental prosopagnosia are not qualitatively different from that of unimpaired individuals. Overall, these event-related potential results provide the first neurophysiological evidence for covert face recognition in developmental prosopagnosia, and suggest this phenomenon results from disconnected links between intact identity-specific visual memory traces and later semantic face processing stages. They also imply that the activation of stored visual representations of familiar faces is not sufficient for conscious explicit face recognition.

Timing-dependent modulation of the posterior parietal cortex-primary motor cortex pathway by sensorimotor training. J Neurophysiol 107: 3190-3199, 2012. First published March 21, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.01049.2011.-Interplay between posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) is crucial during execution of movements. The purpose of the study was to determine whether functional PPC-M1 connectivity in humans can be modulated by sensorimotor training. Seventeen participants performed a sensorimotor training task that involved tapping the index finger in synchrony to a rhythmic sequence. To explore differences in training modality, one group (n = 8) learned by visual and the other (n = 9) by auditory stimuli. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess PPC-M1 connectivity before and after training, whereas electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess PPC-M1 connectivity during training. Facilitation from PPC to M1 was quantified using paired-pulse TMS at conditioning-test intervals of 2, 4, 6, and 8 ms by measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). TMS was applied at baseline and at four time points (0, 30, 60, and 180 min) after training. For EEG, task-related power and coherence were calculated for early and late training phases. The conditioned MEP was facilitated at a 2-ms conditioning-test interval before training. However, facilitation was abolished immediately following training, but returned to baseline at subsequent time points. Regional EEG activity and interregional connectivity between PPC and M1 showed an initial increase during early training followed by a significant decrease in the late phases. The findings indicate that parietal-motor interactions are activated during early sensorimotor training when sensory information has to be integrated into a coherent movement plan. Once the sequence is encoded and movements become automatized, PPC-M1 connectivity returns to baseline.

Previous studies have identified an increase in beta-gamma oscillatory activity after the processing of positive feedback stimuli but the functional role of this electroencephalographic (EEG) correlate remains unclear. In the present study, we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and trial-by-trial wavelet-based time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal to investigate the effects of expectancy and magnitude of positive and negative feedbacks associated with monetary gains and losses in a gambling task. Large increase of beta-gamma oscillatory activity only in unexpected monetary gains was observed, irrespective of its magnitude. Based on recent findings we propose that this increase in betagamma oscillatory activity might reflect a general cognitive mechanism in charge of monitoring unexpected positive events based on feedback processing.

A painful electric stimulus served as unconditioned stimulus and neutral faces as conditioned stimuli. Event-related potentials, startle response potentiation, skin conductance response, corrugator activity, and heart rate were assessed, along with valence, arousal, and contingency ratings of the CS and US. Compared to healthy controls, psychopathic subjects failed to differentiate between the CS+/CS- as shown by an absence of a conditioned response in startle potentiation and skin conductance measures. Through use of a fear-eliciting US, these data confirm previous findings of a deficient capacity to form associations between neutral and aversive events in psychopathy that appears unrelated to cognitive deficits and is consistent with hypothesized frontolimbic deficits in the disorder.

However, little is known about the experience-dependent mechanisms in the human brain that support our ability to make fine categorical judgments. Previous work has focused on identifying spatial brain patterns (i.e., areas) that change with learning. Here, we take advantage of the complementary high spatial and temporal resolution of simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics between cortical networks involved in flexible category learning. Observers were trained to use different decision criteria (i.e., category boundaries) when making fine categorical judgments on morphed stimuli (i.e., radial vs. concentric patterns). Our findings demonstrate that learning acts on a feedback-based circuit that supports fine categorical judgments. Experience-dependent changes in the behavioral decision criterion were associated with changes in later perceptual processes engaging higher occipitotemporal and frontoparietal circuits. In contrast, category learning did not modulate early processes in a medial frontotemporal network that are thought to support the coarse interpretation of visual scenes. These findings provide evidence that learning flexible criteria for fine categorical judgments acts on distinct spatiotemporal brain circuits and shapes the readout of sensory signals that provide evidence for categorical decisions.

Short latency activation of cortex during clinically effective subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						subthalamic nucleus; deep brain stimulation; event related potential; electroencephalography; Parkinson's disease	ACTION-POTENTIAL UPSTROKE; NUCLEUS STIMULATION; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; NETWORK MODULATION; STN-STIMULATION; MAXIMUM RATE; TIME-COURSE; NEURONS; IMPROVEMENT; CIRCUIT	Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is superior to medical therapy for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and additional evidence suggests that it improves refractory symptoms of essential tremor, primary generalized dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite this, its therapeutic mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that subthalamic stimulation activates the cerebral cortex at short latencies after stimulus onset during clinically effective stimulation for PD. In 5 subjects (six hemispheres), EEG measured the response of cortex to subthalamic stimulation across a range of stimulation voltages and frequencies. Novel analytical techniques reversed the anode and cathode electrode contacts and summed the resulting pair of event-related potentials to suppress the stimulation artifact. We found that subthalamic brain stimulation at 20 Hz activates the somatosensory cortex at discrete latencies (mean latencies: 1.0 +/- 0.4, 5.7 +/- 1.1, and 22.2 +/- 1.8 ms, denoted as R1, R2, and R3, respectively). The amplitude of the short latency peak (R1) during clinically effective high-frequency stimulation is nonlinearly dependent on stimulation voltage (P < 0.001; repeated-measures analysis of variance), and its latency is less variable than that of R3 (1.02 versus 19.46 ms; P < 0.001, Levene's test). We conclude that clinically effective subthalamic brain stimulation in humans with PD activates the cerebral cortex at 1 ms after stimulus onset, most likely by antidromic activation. These findings suggest that alteration of the precise timing of action potentials in cortical neurons with axonal projections to the subthalamic region may be an important component of the therapeutic mechanism of subthalamic brain stimulation.

Neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal in children: An ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion regulation; Reappraisal; ERPs; Late positive potential; Children; Anxiety	EMOTION REGULATION; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; NEGATIVE AFFECT; PICTURES; SUPPRESSION; POTENTIALS; FEELINGS; MODULATE	Cognitive emotion regulation strategies, such as reappraising the emotional meaning of events, are linked to positive adjustment and are disrupted in individuals showing emotional distress, like anxiety. The late positive potential (LPP) is sensitive to reappraisal: LPP amplitudes are reduced when unpleasant pictures are reappraised in a positive light, suggesting regulation of negative emotion. However, only one study has examined reappraisal in children using the LPP. The present study examined whether directed reappraisals reduce the LPP in a group of 5- to 7-year-olds, and correlate with individual differences in fear and anxiety. EEG was recorded from 32 typically developing children via 64 scalp electrodes during a directed reappraisal task. Mothers reported on child anxiety. Fearful behavior was observed. As predicted, LPP amplitudes were larger to unpleasant versus neutral pictures; counter to predictions, the LPP was not sensitive to reappraisal. The degree to which unpleasant versus neutral pictures elicited larger LPPs was correlated with greater anxiety and fear. Results suggest that reappraisal in young children is still developing, but that the LPP is sensitive to individual differences related to fear and anxiety. The utility of the LPP as a measure of cognitive emotion regulation and emotional processing biases in children is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is despite the greater than 80% prevalence of comorbidity under the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic definitions. Here we investigate the event related potential (ERP) and psychometric profiles of Controls, AD/HD, and comorbid AD/HD (particularly AD/HD+ODD/CD) groups on six neurocognitive tasks thought to probe the constructs of selective and sustained attention, response inhibition and executive function. Data from 29 parameters extracted from a child group (age range 6 to 12; 52 Controls and 64 AD/HD) and from an adolescent group (age range 13 to 17; 79 Controls and 88 AD/HD) were reduced via a Principal Components Analysis, the 6 significant eigenvectors then used as determinants of cluster membership via a Two-Step Cluster Analysis. Two clusters were found in the analysis of the adolescent age group -a cluster dominated by Control and AD/HD participants without comorbidity, while the second cluster was dominated by AD/HD participants with externalising comorbidity (largely oppositional defiant/conduct disorder ODD/CD). A similar segregation within the child age group was not found. Further analysis of these objectively determined clusters in terms of their clinical diagnoses indicates a significant effect of ODD/CD comorbidity on a concurrent AD/HD diagnosis. We conclude that comorbid externalising behaviour in AD/HD constitutes a distinct pathological entity in adolescence.

This study addresses a possible relationship between MEG power changes and the N400m component of the event-related field. Whole-head MEG was recorded while subjects listened to spoken sentences with incongruent (IC) or congruent (C) sentence endings. A clear N400m was observed over the left hemisphere, and was larger for the IC sentences than for the C sentences. A timefrequency analysis of power revealed a decrease in alpha and beta power over the left hemisphere in roughly the same time range as the N400m for the IC relative to the C condition. A linear regression analysis revealed a positive linear relationship between N400m and beta power for the IC condition, not for the C condition. No such linear relation was found between N400m and alpha power for either condition. The sources of the beta decrease were estimated in the LIFG, a region known to be involved in semantic unification operations. One source of the N400m was estimated in the left superior temporal region, which has been related to lexical retrieval. We interpret our data within a framework in which beta oscillations are inversely related to the engagement of task-relevant brain networks. The source reconstructions of the beta power suppression and the N400m effect support the notion of a dynamic communication between the LIFG and the left superior temporal region during language comprehension.

This work aims to improve the reliability of this diagnostic procedure by decoupling the effects of heat transfer and nerve fiber conduction. It is herein shown experimentally that the latency of the N2 contact heat evoked cortical potentials component is the most stable diagnostic parameter. The contribution of heat transfer to N2 contact heat evoked cortical potentials latency was modeled as a function of the subject's pain threshold, allowing for the separation of nerve fiber pathology from thermodynamic influences.

Recently, electrophysiological and neuroimaging approaches, employing simple sensory stimulations or verbal commands, have proven useful in detecting higher order processing and, in some cases, in establishing some degree of communication in brain-injured subjects with severe impairment of motor function. To complement these approaches, it would be useful to develop methods to detect recovery of consciousness in ways that do not depend on the integrity of sensory pathways or on the subject's ability to comprehend or carry out instructions. As suggested by theoretical and experimental work, a key requirement for consciousness is that multiple, specialized cortical areas can engage in rapid causal interactions (effective connectivity). Here, we employ transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography to evaluate effective connectivity at the bedside of severely brain injured, non-communicating subjects. In patients in a vegetative state, who were open-eyed, behaviourally awake but unresponsive, transcranial magnetic stimulation triggered a simple, local response indicating a breakdown of effective connectivity, similar to the one previously observed in unconscious sleeping or anaesthetized subjects. In contrast, in minimally conscious patients, who showed fluctuating signs of non-reflexive behaviour, transcranial magnetic stimulation invariably triggered complex activations that sequentially involved distant cortical areas ipsi- and contralateral to the site of stimulation, similar to activations we recorded in locked-in, conscious patients. Longitudinal measurements performed in patients who gradually recovered consciousness revealed that this clear-cut change in effective connectivity could occur at an early stage, before reliable communication was established with the subject and before the spontaneous electroencephalogram showed significant modifications. Measurements of effective connectivity by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography can be performed at the bedside while by-passing subcortical afferent and efferent pathways, and without requiring active participation of subjects or language comprehension; hence, they offer an effective way to detect and track recovery of consciousness in brain-injured patients who are unable to exchange information with the external environment.

In contrast, neurophysiological insights from ERPs have been limited, as several different mechanisms lead to ERPs. Apart from stereotypically repeated responses (additive evoked responses), these mechanisms are asymmetric amplitude modulations and phase-resetting of ongoing oscillatory activity. Therefore, a method is needed that differentiates between these mechanisms and moreover quantifies the stability of a response. We propose a constrained subspace independent component analysis that exploits the multivariate information present in the all-to-all relationship of recordings over trials. Our method identifies additive evoked activity and quantifies its stability over trials. We evaluate identification performance for biologically plausible simulation data and two neurophysiological test cases: Local field potential (LFP) recordings from a visuomotor-integration task in the awake behaving macaque and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of steady-state visual evoked fields (SSVEFs). In the LFPs we find additive evoked response contributions in visual areas V2/4 but not in primary motor cortex A4, although visually triggered ERPs were also observed in area A4. MEG-SSVEFs were mainly created by additive evoked response contributions. Our results demonstrate that the identification of additive evoked response contributions is possible both in invasive and in non-invasive electrophysiological recordings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The approach is based on multi-channel representation of the EEG signals using a parallel combination of HMMs, where each model represents a particular channel. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied using an artificial EEG database, and two real EEG databases: a database of two classes of EEGs elicited during a task of imagery of hand upward and downward movements of a computer screen cursor (db Ia), and a database of two classes of sensorimotor EEGs elicited during a feedback-regulated left-right motor imagery task (db III). The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other commonly used methods with classification rate improvement of 2 and 10% for db Ia and db III, respectively. In addition, the proposed method outperforms a support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel, when both classifiers utilize the same feature set. The results also show that a model architecture which includes a left-to-right scheme with no skips, five states and three Gaussians, outperforms the other tested architectures due to the fact that it allows a better modeling of the temporal sequencing of the EEG components.

Average reference, Laplacian transforms, and independent component (ICA) reconstruction of time series can distort physiologically generated phase differences and invalidate the computation of coherence and phase differences as well as in the computation of directed coherence and phase reset. Time domain measures of phase shift and phase lock are less prone to artifact and are independent of volume conduction.

Here we investigated whether emotional distractor words capture attention in an analogous way. Participants detected brief intervals of coherent motion in an array of otherwise randomly moving squares superimposed on words of positive, neutral or negative valence. Processing of the foreground task was assessed by behavioural responses and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by the squares flickering at 15 Hz. Although words were task-irrelevant, P2 and N400 deflections to negative words were enhanced, indicating that emotionally negative word content modulated lexico-semantic processing and that emotional significance was detected. In contrast, the time course of behavioural data and SSVEP amplitudes revealed no interference with the task regardless of the emotional connotation of distractor words. This dissociation of emotion effects on early perceptual versus lexical stages of processing suggests that written emotional words do not inevitably lead to attentional modulation in early visual areas. Prior studies have shown a distraction effect of emotional pictures on a similar task. Thus, our results indicate the specificity of emotion effects on sensory processing and semantic encoding dependent on the information channel that emotional significance is derived from.

However, the blur caused by volume conduction makes it difficult to identify the exact origin of the EEG rhythm in the brain using only the human scalp EEG. In this study, simultaneous fMRI and EEG measurements were performed during a visually guided motor execution task in order to investigate whether the mu rhythm in the scalp EEG is an indication of the activity in the sensorimotor cortex. In addition, a new method was proposed for reconstruction of the cortical EEG activity through the fusion of fMRI and EEG data. A suppression of mu rhythm appeared around the lateral central electrode sites, just above the sensorimotor cortex, in association with the activity in that region. During a visually guided motor execution task, the alpha rhythms at the occipital electrode sites and the alpha rhythm at the central electrode sites also showed a correlation with the fMRI signal in the occipital and the supplementary motor cortices, respectively. This method allows the investigation of the scalp EEG origin with the spatial precision of fMRI, while retaining dynamic properties of the cortex with the temporal precision of EEG.

Neural Synchrony during Response Production and Inhibition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; EEG; DYNAMICS; ERPS; ANTERIORIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; MEMORY	Inhibition of irrelevant information (conflict monitoring) and/or of prepotent actions is an essential component of adaptive self-organized behavior. Neural dynamics underlying these functions has been studied in humans using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited in Go/NoGo tasks that require a speeded motor response to the Go stimuli and withholding a prepotent response when a NoGo stimulus is presented. However, averaged ERP waveforms provide only limited information about the neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulus processing, motor preparation, and response production or inhibition. In this study, we examine the cortical representation of conflict monitoring and response inhibition using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during continuous performance Go/NoGo task in 50 young adult females. We hypothesized that response inhibition would be associated with a transient boost in both temporal and spatial synchronization of prefrontal cortical activity, consistent with the role of the anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices in cognitive control. Overall, phase synchronization across trials measured by Phase Locking Index and phase synchronization between electrode sites measured by Phase Coherence were the highest in the Go and NoGo conditions, intermediate in the Warning condition, and the lowest under Neutral condition. The NoGo condition was characterized by significantly higher fronto-central synchronization in the 300-600 ms window, whereas in the Go condition, delta-and theta-band synchronization was higher in centro-parietal regions in the first 300 ms after the stimulus onset. The present findings suggest that response production and inhibition is supported by dynamic functional networks characterized by distinct patterns of temporal and spatial synchronization of brain oscillations.

Our study aimed to examine mental fatigue effects among 10 neurologically normal, athletically active students undergoing typical concussion testing. It is our intention to ultimately address the question whether fatigue effects due to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may become confounded with fatigue effects due to testing effort. Methods: Fourteen athletically active and neurologically normal volunteers were initially recruited from Penn State University. Self-reported fatigue, neuropsychological performance, and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were measured throughout the whole testing duration. EEG measures in frequency domain (e. g., relative power of theta, alpha, and beta bands) were examined over the course of neuropsychological (NP) test administration. Results: Predicted fatigue effects over the course of testing included: (a) increased self-reported fatigue; (b) increased errors on the Stroop Interference Test; (c) significantly increased relative power of theta activity during the Stroop Interference Test in frontal-central and parietal regions; and (d) migration of alpha activation from the occipital to anterior (left parietal and pre-central) regions during the Stroop Interference task administered at the beginning compared with the end of testing. Conclusions: Results supported predictions related to subjective fatigue and cognitive performance and offered partial support for predictions related to EEG activation patterns over the course of administering the NP testing. Significance: Neurologically intact and athletically active college students demonstrate effects related to fatigue after undergoing a typical sports concussion assessment battery, including an increase in subjectively experienced fatigue, a decrease in cognitive task performance accuracy and associated modulations in EEG activity. This finding should be considered by clinical practitioners while evaluating the symptoms of concussion and making a decision regarding the return-to-sport participation.

Neural Correlates of Hypersensitivity to Immediate Reward in Hypomania	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						EEG; FRN; hypomania; impulsivity; N1; reward	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; DELAYED REWARDS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; IMPULSIVITY; SENSITIVITY; MAGNITUDE; ATTENTION; SPECTRUM; ALCOHOL	Background: Hypomania is associated with impulsive decision making and risk taking, characteristics that may arise from hypersensitivity to reward. To date, the neural dynamics underlying intertemporal reward processing have neither been characterized clinically nor in the general population. Taking vulnerability to hypomania as a surrogate model of impulsivity, we utilized event-related potentials to study the neural mechanisms of delay discounting. Methods: In the first experiment, 32 participants completed an established Two Choice Impulsivity Paradigm in which free choice between immediate and delayed rewards was used to quantify impulsivity behaviorally. In the second experiment, electroencephalography was recorded while 32 separately recruited participants completed a speeded response task involving gains and losses of monetary incentives to be paid at three different delays after the experiment. Results: In the first experiment, the hypomania-prone group made significantly more immediate choices than the control group. In the second experiment, the hypomania-prone group evidenced greater differentiation between delayed and immediate outcomes in early attention-sensitive (N1) and later reward-sensitive (feedback-related negativity) components. Proneness to hypomania was also associated with greater N1 amplitude to rewards per se. Conclusions: These results indicate steeper delay discounting in hypomania at multiple stages of information processing. The N1 modulation by valence and delay suggests an attentional bias to immediate rewards, which may drive subsequent cognitive appraisal of outcomes (feedback-related negativity). These results highlight the early influence of attention on reward processing and provide support for reward dysregulation accounts of bipolar disorder. Potential implications for mindfulness training and other therapeutic interventions are highlighted.

Naturally occurring sign languages, however, often appear to conflate form and meaning. In this paper we examine whether this close coupling has processing consequences for lexical access. We examine the electrophysiological correlates of on-line sentence processing in an attempt to clarify the time-course of lexical access in American Sign Language. EEG was recorded while 17 native signers watched ASL sentences for comprehension. Participants were presented with sentences in which semantic expectancy and phonological form were systematically manipulated to create four types of violations. These four conditions of interest are contrasted to a baseline sentence with a preferred semantic ending. Two different effects were observed in early time windows. Evidence for an early effect of semantic pre-activation of plausible candidates (150-250 ms) was found, followed by a negativity associated with lexical selection (350-450 ms) for only phonologically related (-S, +P) and for only semantically related (+S, -P) signs. These findings provide evidence for a novel mapping of signal form and meaning that may be a unique signature of sign language. In the 450 to 600 ms window, all conditions showed an increased N400 with respect to the expected ending, suggesting greater difficulty in semantic integration with the established context. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the on-line processing of visual-manual language. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This algorithm combines global sampling based on a Grassmannian dictionary of atomic signals with local search using natural gradient decent in the signal parameter space. Performance of the algorithm was demonstrated by analyzing Jung and Makig's ERP data sets. It can obtain unbiased sparse representations of EEG signals in far less iteration than its predecessor, the stochastic matching pursuit (SMP).

The present study aims to analyze the spontaneous alpha activity and visual evoked alpha response in drug free euthymic bipolar patients. Eighteen DSM-IV euthymic bipolar patients (bipolar I n = 15, bipolar II n = 3) and 18 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Patients needed to be euthymic at least for 4 weeks and psychotrop free for at least 2 weeks. Spontaneous EEG (4 min eyes closed, 4 min eyes open) and evoked alpha response upon application of simple visual stimuli were analyzed. EEG was recorded at 30 positions. The digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis was performed for spontaneous eyes closed and eyes open conditions and the response power spectrum was also analyzed for simple visual stimuli. In the analysis of spontaneous EEG, the ANOVA on alpha responses revealed significant results for groups (F(1,34) = 8.703; P < 0.007). Post-hoc comparisons showed that spontaneous EEG alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than the spontaneous EEG alpha power of euthymic patients. Furthermore, visual evoked alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than visual evoked alpha power of euthymic patients (F(1,34) = 4.981; P < 0.04). Decreased alpha activity in spontaneous EEG is an important pathological EEG finding in euthymic bipolar patients. Together with an evident decrease in evoked alpha responses, the findings may lead to a new pathway in search of biological correlates of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder.

Overnight changes in waking auditory evoked potential amplitude reflect altered sleep homeostasis in major depression	ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						major depressive disorder; auditory evoked potentials; sleep; homeostasis; slow-wave sleep	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; NREM SLEEP; EEG; DEPRIVATION; PLASTICITY; PREDICTION; 1ST; STIMULATION	Goldstein MR, Plante DT, Hulse BK, Sarasso S, Landsness EC, Tononi G, Benca RM. Overnight changes in waking auditory evoked potential amplitude reflect altered sleep homeostasis in major depression. Objective: Sleep homeostasis is altered in major depressive disorder (MDD). Pre- to postsleep decline in waking auditory evoked potential (AEP) amplitude has been correlated with sleep slow wave activity (SWA), suggesting that overnight changes in waking AEP amplitude are homeostatically regulated in healthy individuals. This study investigated whether the overnight change in waking AEP amplitude and its relation to SWA is altered in MDD. Method: Using 256-channel high-density electroencephalography, all-night sleep polysomnography and single-tone waking AEPs pre- and postsleep were collected in 15 healthy controls (HC) and 15 non-medicated individuals with MDD. Results: N1 and P2 amplitudes of the waking AEP declined after sleep in the HC group, but not in MDD. The reduction in N1 amplitude also correlated with fronto-central SWA in the HC group, but a comparable relationship was not found in MDD, despite equivalent SWA between groups. No pre- to postsleep differences were found for N1 or P2 latencies in either group. These findings were not confounded by varying levels of alertness or differences in sleep variables between groups. Conclusion: MDD involves altered sleep homeostasis as measured by the overnight change in waking AEP amplitude. Future research is required to determine the clinical implications of these findings.

Identifying temporal and causal contributions of neural processes underlying the Implicit Association Test (IAT)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; traumatic brain injuries; EEG coherence; implicit association test; automaticity; gender stereotypes; extra-striate visual cortex; prefrontal cortex	SOCIAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; EVENT-RELATED-POTENTIALS; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; ATTITUDES; BRAIN; RACE; STEREOTYPES; LESIONS; CORTEX; MALLEABILITY	The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a popular behavioral measure that assesses the associative strength between outgroup members and stereotypical and counterstereotypical traits. Less is known, however, about the degree to which the IAT reflects automatic processing. Two studies examined automatic processing contributions to a gender-IAT using a data driven, social neuroscience approach. Performance on congruent (e.g., categorizing male names with synonyms of strength) and incongruent (e.g., categorizing female names with synonyms of strength) IAT blocks were separately analyzed using EEG (event-related potentials, or ERPs, and coherence; Study 1) and lesion (Study 2) methodologies. Compared to incongruent blocks, performance on congruent IAT blocks was associated with more positive ERPs that manifested in frontal and occipital regions at automatic processing speeds, occipital regions at more controlled processing speeds and was compromised by volume loss in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), insula and medial PFC. Performance on incongruent blocks was associated with volume loss in supplementary motor areas, cingulate gyrus and a region in medial PFC similar to that found for congruent blocks. Greater coherence was found between frontal and occipital regions to the extent individuals exhibited more bias. This suggests there are separable neural contributions to congruent and incongruent blocks of the IAT but there is also a surprising amount of overlap. Given the temporal and regional neural distinctions, these results provide converging evidence that stereotypic associative strength assessed by the IAT indexes automatic processing to a degree.

Neural responses recorded over the posterior parietal cortex reflecting visual working memory activity increased in amplitude as a function of the number of faces that had to be maintained in memory. Critically, these memory-related neural responses varied as a function of participants' implicit racial prejudice toward black people. High-prejudiced participants encoded black people faces with a lower degree of precision compared to low-prejudiced participants, suggesting that the class of mental operations affected by implicit racial prejudice includes basic cognitive mechanisms underpinning the encoding and maintenance of faces' visual representations in visual working memory.

We used the stop-signal paradigm to determine whether deficient inhibitory control distinguishes children with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder combined type (ADHD-Com) from normally developing children, matched on age and sex. Participants performed a standard visual two-choice task with an auditory stop-signal stimulus, while an EEG was recorded. The behavioral results indicated that the ADHD group had significantly impaired inhibitory control compared to the performance of normal children. Relative to controls, the go stimulus reaction time (RI) and the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) were prolonged in children with ADHD. The amplitudes of P2 and P3 components to the auditory stop-signal were more pronounced for successful than for unsuccessful stop-signal trials in both groups. However, the successful-unsuccessful difference was larger in control subjects. In contrast, the amplitude of the N2 component to auditory stop-signal was more pronounced for unsuccessful than for successful stop-signal trials in both groups. The comparison of the N2 component between control and ADHD groups revealed a greater amplitude and longer latency in the latter group, in successful stop-signal trials only. Additionally, the amplitude of response-locked ERPs, containing the ERN-Pe complex related to error-detection, was smaller in ADHD children. These results support the hypothesis of a complex deficit of inhibitory control, conflict monitoring, and error recognition mechanisms in ADHD and corroborate the utility of the stop-signal task in distinguishing hyperactive from normal children.

J Neurophysiol 108: 2717-2724, 2012. First published July 5, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00196.2012.-Because acoustic landscapes are complex and rapidly changing, auditory systems have evolved mechanisms that permit rapid detection of novel sounds, sound source segregation, and perceptual restoration of sounds obscured by noise. Perceptual restoration is particularly important in noisy environments because it allows organisms to track sounds over time even when they are masked. The continuity illusion is a striking example of perceptual restoration with sounds perceived as intact even when parts of them have been replaced by gaps and rendered inaudible by being masked by an extraneous sound. The mechanisms of auditory filling-in are complex and are currently not well-understood. The present study used the high temporal resolution of EEG to examine brain activity related to continuity illusion perception. Masking noise loudness was adjusted individually for each subject so that physically identical sounds on some trials elicited a continuity illusion ( failure to detect a gap in a sound) and on other trials resulted in correct gap detection. This design ensured that any measurable differences in brain activity would be due to perceptual differences rather than physical differences among stimuli. We found that baseline activity recorded immediately before presentation of the stimulus significantly predicted the occurrence of the continuity illusion in 10 out of 14 participants based on power differences in gamma-band EEG (34-80 Hz). Across all participants, power in the beta and gamma (12-to 80-Hz range) was informative about the subsequent perceptual decision. These data suggest that a subject's baseline brain state influences the strength of continuity illusions.

Furthermore, while the evidence is strong that readers preprocess orthographic features of upcoming words, it is controversial whether word meaning can also be accessed parafoveally. We investigated the timing, scope, and electrophysiological correlates of parafoveal information use in reading by simultaneously recording eye movements and fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) while participants read word lists fluently from left to right. For one word the target (e.g., "blade") parafoveal information was manipulated by showing an identical ("blade"), semantically related ("knife"), or unrelated ("sugar") word as preview. In boundary trials, the preview was shown parafoveally but changed to the correct target word during the incoming saccade. Replicating classic findings, target words were fixated shorter after identical previews. In the EEG, this benefit was reflected in an occipitotemporal preview positivity between 200 and 280 ms. In contrast, there was no facilitation from related previews. In parafoveal-on-foveal trials, preview and target were embedded at neighboring list positions without a display change. Consecutive fixation of two related words produced N400 priming effects, but only shortly (160 ms) after the second word was directly fixated. Results demonstrate that neural responses to words are substantially altered by parafoveal preprocessing under normal reading conditions. We found no evidence that word meaning contributes to these effects. Saccade-contingent display manipulations can be combined with EEG recordings to study extrafoveal perception in vision.

Studies have shown that this N450 component is not solely sensitive to rhyme but also responds to other types of phonological overlap. In the present study, we examined whether the N450 component can be used to gain insight into the global similarity effect, indicating that rhyme judgment skills decrease when participants are presented with word pairs that share a phonological overlap but do not rhyme (e.g., bell-ball). We presented 20 adults with auditory rhyming, globally similar overlapping and unrelated word pairs. In addition to measuring behavioral responses by means of a yes/no button press, we also took EEG measures. The behavioral data showed a clear global similarity effect; participants judged overlapping pairs more slowly than unrelated pairs. However, the neural outcomes did not provide evidence that the N450 effect responds differentially to globally similar and unrelated word pairs, suggesting that globally similar and dissimilar non-rhyming pairs are processed in a similar fashion at the stage of early lexical access.

The articulation conveys speech information that helps detect and disambiguate the auditory speech. As important characteristic of EEG, oscillations and its synchronization have been applied to cognition research more and more. This study analyzed the EEG data acquired by unimodal and bimodal stimuli using time frequency and phase synchrony approach, investigated the oscillatory activities and its synchrony modes behind evoked potential during auditory-visual integration, in order to reveal the inherent neural integration mechanism under these modes. It was found that beta activity and its synchronization differences had relationship with gesture N1-P2, which happened in the earlier stage of speech coding to pronouncing action. Alpha oscillation and its synchronization related with auditory N1-P2 might be mainly responsible for auditory speech process caused by anticipation from gesture to sound feature. The visual gesture changing enhanced the interaction of auditory brain regions. These results provided explanations to the power and connectivity change of event-evoked oscillatory activities which matched ERPs during auditory-visual speech integration.

In this study, we attempted to specify the time course of common processes between the two modalities with event-related brain potentials (ERPs). High density EEG was recorded on twenty two healthy participants during a handwritten and an oral picture naming task on the same 120 stimuli. Waveform analyses and topographical pattern analyses were combined on stimulus- and response-aligned ERPs in order to cover the whole word encoding processing. Similar electrophysiological correlates between writing and speaking appeared until about 260 ms. According to previous estimations of the time course of spoken production, the time period of identical electrophysiological activity corresponds to visual (0-150 ms) semantic (150-190 ms) and lexical-semantic (190-275 ms) processes. Then, spoken and handwritten picture naming starts diverging and display different and modality specific topographical configurations from around 260 ms, i.e., at the beginning of the time-window associated to the encoding of the surface phonological form in spoken production. These results suggested shared conceptual and lexical-semantic processes between speaking and writing and different neurophysiological activity during word-form (phonological or orthographic) encoding.

Despite years of research, the brain structures that contribute to the generation and modulation of LPP are not well understood. Recording EEG and fMRI simultaneously, and applying a recently proposed single-trial ERP analysis method, we addressed the problem by correlating the single-trial LPP amplitude evoked by affective pictures with the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity. Three results were found. First, relative to neutral pictures, pleasant and unpleasant pictures elicited enhanced LPP, as well as heightened BOLD activity in both visual cortices and emotion-processing structures such as amygdala and prefrontal cortex, consistent with previous findings. Second, the LPP amplitude across three picture categories was significantly correlated with BOLD activity in visual cortices, temporal cortices, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. Third, within each picture category, LPP-BOLD coupling revealed category-specific differences. For pleasant pictures, the LPP amplitude was coupled with BOLD in occipitotemporal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and precuneus, whereas for unpleasant pictures significant LPP-BOLD correlation was observed in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that LPP is generated and modulated by an extensive brain network composed of both cortical and subcortical structures associated with visual and emotional processing and the degree of contribution by each of these structures to the LPP modulation is valence specific.

A Fast and Reliable Method for Simultaneous Waveform, Amplitude and Latency Estimation of Single-Trial EEG/MEG Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; P3 LATENCY; VARIABILITY; COMPONENTS; SIGNALS; BRAIN	The amplitude and latency of single-trial EEG/MEG signals may provide valuable information concerning human brain functioning. In this article we propose a new method to reliably estimate single-trial amplitude and latency of EEG/MEG signals. The advantages of the method are fourfold. First, no a-priori specified template function is required. Second, the method allows for multiple signals that may vary independently in amplitude and/or latency. Third, the method is less sensitive to noise as it models data with a parsimonious set of basis functions. Finally, the method is very fast since it is based on an iterative linear least squares algorithm. A simulation study shows that the method yields reliable estimates under different levels of latency variation and signal-to-noise ratioOs. Furthermore, it shows that the existence of multiple signals can be correctly determined. An application to empirical data from a choice reaction time study indicates that the method describes these data accurately.	[Weeda, Wouter D.; Grasman, Raoul P. P.

This pilot-study aimed at personalizing neurofeedback treatment to these specific sub-groups to investigate if such an approach leads to improved clinical outcomes. Furthermore, pre- and post-treatment EEG and ERP changes were investigated in a sub-group to study the neurophysiological effects of neurofeedback. Twenty-one patients with ADHD were treated with QEEG-informed neurofeedback and post-treatment effects on inattention (ATT), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) and comorbid depressive symptoms were investigated. There was a significant improvement for both ATT, HI and comorbid depressive complaints after QEEG-informed neurofeedback. The effect size for ATT was 1.78 and for HI was 1.22. Furthermore, anterior individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) demonstrated a strong relation to improvement on comorbid depressive complaints. Pre- and post-treatment effects for the SMR neurofeedback sub-group exhibited increased N200 and P300 amplitudes and decreased SMR EEG power post-treatment. This pilot study is the first study demonstrating that it is possible to select neurofeedback protocols based on individual EEG biomarkers and suggests this results in improved treatment outcome specifically for ATT, however these results should be replicated in further controlled studies. A slow anterior iAPF at baseline predicts poor treatment response on comorbid depressive complaints in line with studies in depression. The effects of SMR neurofeedback resulted in specific ERP and EEG changes.	[Arns, Martijn] Res Inst Brainclin, NL-6524 AD Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Arns, Martijn; Kenemans, J.

Behavioral and Electrophysiological Correlates of Speech Perception of Dichotically Presented Narratives in Young and Middle-Aged Listeners	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						spoken language understanding; aging; event-related potentials; frontal midline theta	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-POWER; LIFE-SPAN; TOP-DOWN; P300; LANGUAGE; EEG; ATTENTION	Older individuals often find it hard to communicate under difficult listening conditions, for example, in the presence of background noise or competing speakers. However, there is increasing evidence that this age-related decline in speech perception can be - at least in part compensated by an increased recruitment of more general cognitive functions. The interplay of age-related declines and compensatory mechanisms in spoken language understanding under naturalistic and demanding listening conditions was tested here in a word detection task. Pairs of different coherent stories were presented dichotically to 14 younger and 14 older listeners (age ranges 19-25 and 54-64 years, respectively). The listeners had to respond to target words in one story, while suppressing distracting information in the other. In addition, the listeners had to pay attention to the content of the attended story. Older listeners outperformed the younger listeners in target detection and produced less missing responses. However, high performance in target detection came along with low performance in text recall. The analyses of event-related potentials indicated a reduction in parietal P3b of older, relative to younger, listeners. In turn, older listeners showed a prominent frontal P3a that was absent in younger listeners. In line with the so-called decline-compensation hypothesis, these results support the idea that, in order to perform well, older listeners compensate a potential decline by extra allocation of mental resources. One potential mechanism of compensation could be a selective attentional orientation to the target stimuli.

Subchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in EEG, cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in mice	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						NMDA; GFAP; Schizophrenia; EAAT; Glt-1; Auditory evoked potential; Drug abuse; Glutamate	RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION MODEL; D-ASPARTATE-RECEPTOR; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; EPISODIC MEMORY; COCAINE; RAT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HIPPOCAMPUS; RETRIEVAL; EXPOSURE	Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic, dissociative, amnestic and euphoric effects. When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6 month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.

The P300-based BCI is among the most popular paradigms in the field and most current versions operate in synchronous mode and assume participant engagement throughout operation. In this study, we demonstrate a new approach for assessment of user engagement through a hybrid classification of ERP and band power features of EEG signals that could allow building asynchronous BCIs. EEG signals from nine electrode locations were recorded from nine participants during controlled engagement conditions when subjects were either engaged with the P3speller task or not attending. Statistical analysis of band power showed that there were significant contrasts of attending only for the delta and beta bands as indicators of features for user attendance classification. A hybrid classifier using ERP scores and band power features yielded the best overall performance of 0.98 in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results indicate that band powers can provide additional discriminant information to the ERP for user attention detection and this combined approach can be used to assess user engagement for each stimulus sequence during BCI use.

The present study aimed at finding support for the SSVEP's sensitivity to higher cognitive functions (e.g. memory). We tagged pictures of meaningless objects with 15 Hz within a combined subsequent-memory and recognition-memory design. The EEG was recorded from 128 electrodes. The subsequent-memory design revealed that SSVEPs are influenced by encoding-related processes. In particular, successful encoding was associated with higher SSVEP amplitudes at central-parietal scalp electrodes and reduced activity at left occipital sites. Recognition memory led to higher SSVEP amplitudes at right temporal scalp regions and to an amplitude reduction at midline electrodes. For the first time it was demonstrated that the SSVEP technique is a useful tool to study memory encoding and retrieval. SSVEPs might reflect the ongoing dynamics within an externally driven and widespread task-relevant network. This offers remarkable possibilities for future research on electrophysiological correlates of mnemonic functioning.

Neural correlates of changing intention in the human FEF and IPS. J Neurophysiol 107: 859-867, 2012. First published November 23, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00604.2011.-Previous research demonstrates that our apparent mental flexibility depends largely on the strength of our prior intention; changing our intention in advance enables a smooth transition from one task to another (e. g., Astle DE, Jackson GM, Swainson R. J Cogn Neurosci 20: 255-267, 2008; Duncan J, Emslie H, Williams P, Johnson R, Freer C. Cogn Psychol 30: 257-303, 1996; Husain M, Parton A, Hodgson TL, Mort D, Rees G. Nat Neurosci 6: 117-118, 2003). However, these necessarily rapid anticipatory mechanisms have been difficult to study in the human brain. We used EEG and magnetoencephalography, specifically event-related potentials and fields (ERPs and ERFs), respectively, to explore the neural correlates of this important aspect of mental flexibility. Subjects performed a manual version of a pro/antisaccade task using preparatory cues to switch between the pro- and antirules. When subjects switched their intention, we observed a positivity over central electrodes, which correlated significantly with our behavioral data; the greater the ERP effect, the stronger the subject's change of intention. ERFs, alongside subject-specific structural MRIs, were used to project into source space. When subjects switched their intention, they showed significantly elevated activity in the right frontal eye field and left intraparietal sulcus (IPS); the greater the left IPS activity on switch trials, the stronger the subject's change of intention. This network has previously been implicated in the top-down control of eye movements, but here we demonstrate its role in the top-down control of a task set, in particular, that it is recruited when we change the task that we intend to perform.

Two well-known conditional arguments are Modus Ponens (MP: If P then Q; P//therefore Q), which is logically valid and Affirmation of the Consequent (AC: If P then Q: Q//therefore P), which is not. The latter is often accepted as true on pragmatic grounds under the generally accepted assumption that the conditional premise is transformed so as to justify a biconditional reading (p if-and-only-if q). We present results from two experiments - one using self-paced measures and the other electroencephalography (EEG) - while comparing participants' evaluations of MP and AC arguments. Based on prior work, we anticipated finding two types of individuals as a function of their endorsing or rejecting AC arguments. The self-paced task (Experiment 1) shows that Rejecters of AC arguments are linked to especially long response times with respect to Endorsers and, critically, shows that AC argument's minor premise prompts slowdowns among all participants compared to MP's. The EEG study (Experiment 2) reveals that the minor premise in AC arguments prompts both Rejecters and Endorsers to produce an N200 wave, which the literature associates with a violation of expectations. These findings suggest that the second premise of AC arguments arrives unexpectedly even among those who are ultimately Endorsers. We describe how these findings impact the conditional reasoning literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Impact of Spatial Filters During Sensor Selection in a Visual P300 Brain-Computer Interface	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Brain-Computer interface; P300; EEG; BLDA; Sensor selection	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; CHANNEL SELECTION; PEOPLE	A challenge in designing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is the choice of the channels, e.g. the most relevant sensors. Although a setup with many sensors can be more efficient for the detection of Event-Related Potential (ERP) like the P300, it is relevant to consider only a low number of sensors for a commercial or clinical BCI application. Indeed, a reduced number of sensors can naturally increase the user comfort by reducing the time required for the installation of the EEG (electroencephalogram) cap and can decrease the price of the device. In this study, the influence of spatial filtering during the process of sensor selection is addressed. Two of them maximize the Signal to Signal-plus-Noise Ratio (SSNR) for the different sensor subsets while the third one maximizes the differences between the averaged P300 waveform and the non P300 waveform. We show that the locations of the most relevant sensors subsets for the detection of the P300 are highly dependent on the use of spatial filtering. Applied on data from 20 healthy subjects, this study proves that subsets obtained where sensors are suppressed in relation to their individual SSNR are less efficient than when sensors are suppressed in relation to their contribution once the different selected sensors are combined for enhancing the signal. In other words, it highlights the difference between estimating the P300 projection on the scalp and evaluating the more efficient sensor subsets for a P300-BCI. Finally, this study explores the issue of channel commonality across subjects. The results support the conclusion that spatial filters during the sensor selection procedure allow selecting better sensors for a visual P300 Brain-Computer Interface.

Neural saccadic response estimation during natural viewing	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						saccades; EEG; visual search; microsaccades; artifact removal	EYE-MOVEMENTS; POTENTIALS; EEG; MICROSACCADES; FIXATION; TASK; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; PARIETAL; VISION	Dandekar S, Privitera C, Carney T, Klein SA. Neural saccadic response estimation during natural viewing. J Neurophysiol 107: 1776-1790, 2012. First published December 14, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00237.2011.-Studying neural activity during natural viewing conditions is not often attempted. Isolating the neural response of a single saccade is necessary to study neural activity during natural viewing; however, the close temporal spacing of saccades that occurs during natural viewing makes it difficult to determine the response to a single saccade. Herein, a general linear model (GLM) approach is applied to estimate the EEG neural saccadic response for different segments of the saccadic main sequence separately. It is determined that, in visual search conditions, neural responses estimated by conventional event-related averaging are significantly and systematically distorted relative to GLM estimates due to the close temporal spacing of saccades during visual search. Before the GLM is applied, analyses are applied that demonstrate that saccades during visual search with intersaccadic spacings as low as 100-150 ms do not exhibit significant refractory effects. Therefore, saccades displaying different intersaccadic spacings during visual search can be modeled using the same regressor in a GLM. With the use of the GLM approach, neural responses were separately estimated for five different ranges of saccade amplitudes during visual search. Occipital responses time locked to the onsets of saccades during visual search were found to account for, on average, 79 percent of the variance of EEG activity in a window 90-200 ms after the onsets of saccades for all five saccade amplitude ranges that spanned a range of 0.2-6.0 degrees. A GLM approach was also used to examine the lateralized ocular artifacts associated with saccades. Possible extensions of the methods presented here to account for the superposition of microsaccades in event-related EEG studies conducted in nominal fixation conditions are discussed.

A specific EEG event-related potential, a P300-MERMER, is elicited by stimuli that are significant in the present context. BF detects P300-MERMER responses to words/ pictures relevant to a crime scene, terrorist training, bomb-making knowledge, etc. BF detects information by measuring cognitive information processing. BF does not detect lies, stress, or emotion. BF computes a determination of "information present" or "information absent" and a statistical confidence for each individual determination. Laboratory and field tests at the FBI, CIA, US Navy and elsewhere have resulted in 0% errors: no false positives and no false negatives. 100% of determinations made were correct. 3% of results have been "indeterminate." BF has been applied in criminal cases and ruled admissible in court. Scientific standards for BF tests are discussed. Meeting the BF scientific standards is necessary for accuracy and validity. Alternative techniques that failed to meet the BF scientific standards produced low accuracy and susceptibility to countermeasures. BF is highly resistant to countermeasures. No one has beaten a BF test with countermeasures, despite a $ 100,000 reward for doing so. Principles of applying BF in the laboratory and the field are discussed.

We evaluated the relation between GH secretion and cognition in elderly males by assessing correlations between GH secretion and performance on cognitive tests in conjunction with recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. GH secretion of 17 elderly male participants was assessed by a GHRH-GHRP-6 test. Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive function. EEG/ERPs were recorded to assess on-line electrocortical correlates of sensory-cortical processing and selective attention. GH secretion was significantly correlated with target detections and speed of responding in the selection-potential task. Furthermore, GH peak was significantly correlated with the performance letter-digit span test. The present data confirm that cognitive performance in elderly males is associated with GH secretion, with respect to target detection and speed of responding in conditions of selective attention, short-term memory, and basic processing speed.

A time-varying source connectivity approach to reveal human somatosensory information processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs); Dipolar source analysis; Time-varying effective connectivity; Kalman smoother; Granger causality	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEDIAN NERVE; GRANGER CAUSALITY; CORTICAL NETWORK; CORTEX; CINGULATE	Exploration of neural sources and their effective connectivity based on transient changes in electrophysiological activities to external stimuli is important for understanding brain mechanisms of sensory information processing. However, such cortical mechanisms have not yet been well characterized in electrophysiological studies since (1) it is difficult to estimate the stimulus-activated neural sources and their activities and (2) it is difficult to identify transient effective connectivity between neural sources in the order of milliseconds. To address these issues, we developed a time-varying source connectivity approach to effectively capture fast-changing information flows between neural sources from high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. This time-varying source connectivity approach was applied to somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), which were elicited by electrical stimulation of right hand and recorded using 64 channels from 16 subjects, to reveal human somatosensory information processing. First, SEP sources and their activities were estimated, both at single-subject and group level, using equivalent current dipolar source modeling. Then, the functional integration among SEP sources was explored using a Kalman smoother based time-varying effective connectivity inference method. The results showed that SEPs were mainly generated from the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI), bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and cingulate cortex (CC). Importantly, we observed a serial processing of somatosensory information in human somatosensory cortices (from SI to SII) at earlier latencies (<150 ms) and a reciprocal processing between SII and CC at later latencies (>200 ms).

EEG is typically recorded non-invasively with electrodes mounted on the human scalp using conductive electrode gel for optimal impedance and data quality. The use of electrode gel entails serious problems that are especially pronounced in real-world settings when experts are not available. Some recent work has introduced dry electrode systems that do not require gel, but often introduce new problems such as comfort and signal quality. The principal goal of this study was to assess a new dry electrode BCI system in a very common task: spelling with a P300 BCI. A total of 23 subjects used a P300 BCI to spell the word "LUCAS" while receiving real-time, closed-loop feedback. The dry system yielded classification accuracies that were similar to those obtained with gel systems. All subjects completed a questionnaire after data recording, and all subjects stated that the dry system was not uncomfortable. This is the first field validation of a dry electrode P300 BCI system, and paves the way for new research and development with EEG recording systems that are much more practical and convenient in field settings than conventional systems.

Sets of similar stimuli were presented in extended blocks, with stimulus conditions changing from block to block. While this method provided optimum statistical power, it also presented a variety of potential confounds, including changes in attention, alertness, expectancy, and practice effects within and between blocks. Event-related paradigms using unpredictable, randomized stimulus sequences had been used in EEG studies for over 50 years before the development of fMRI, and provided a means to overcome these issues. However, the temporal dispersion of BOLD fMRI activity resulted in responses to successive stimuli adding together, making it difficult to perform rapid event-related paradigms using fMRI.

Identification and Classification of Facial Familiarity in Directed Lying: An ERP Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; UPSIDE-DOWN FACES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL SYSTEMS; RECOGNITION; EXPRESSION; INVERSION; GENDER; WOMEN	Recognizing familiar faces is essential to social functioning, but little is known about how people identify human faces and classify them in terms of familiarity. Face identification involves discriminating familiar faces from unfamiliar faces, whereas face classification involves making an intentional decision to classify faces as "familiar'' or "unfamiliar.'' This study used a directed-lying task to explore the differentiation between identification and classification processes involved in the recognition of familiar faces. To explore this issue, the participants in this study were shown familiar and unfamiliar faces. They responded to these faces (i.e., as familiar or unfamiliar) in accordance with the instructions they were given (i.e., to lie or to tell the truth) while their EEG activity was recorded. Familiar faces (regardless of lying vs. truth) elicited significantly less negative-going N400f in the middle and right parietal and temporal regions than unfamiliar faces. Regardless of their actual familiarity, the faces that the participants classified as "familiar'' elicited more negative-going N400f in the central and right temporal regions than those classified as "unfamiliar.'' The P600 was related primarily with the facial identification process. Familiar faces (regardless of lying vs. truth) elicited more positive-going P600f in the middle parietal and middle occipital regions. The results suggest that N400f and P600f play different roles in the processes involved in facial recognition. The N400f appears to be associated with both the identification (judgment of familiarity) and classification of faces, while it is likely that the P600f is only associated with the identification process (recollection of facial information). Future studies should use different experimental paradigms to validate the generalizability of the results of this study.	[Sun, Delin; Lee, Tatia M.

Automatic artefact removal in a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface system	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENTS	Background: A novel artefact removal algorithm is proposed for a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This hybrid system combines a self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a virtual keyboard. To select a letter, the user must gaze at the target for at least a specific period of time (dwell time) and then activate the BCI by performing a mental task. Unfortunately, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often contaminated with artefacts. Artefacts change the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade the BCI's performance. Methods: To remove artefacts in EEG signals, the proposed algorithm uses the stationary wavelet transform combined with a new adaptive thresholding mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and other artefact handling/removal methods, semi-simulated EEG signals (i.e., real EEG signals mixed with simulated artefacts) and real EEG signals obtained from seven participants are used. For real EEG signals, the hybrid BCI system's performance is evaluated in an online-like manner, i.e., using the continuous data from the last session as in a real-time environment. Results: With semi-simulated EEG signals, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves lower signal distortion in both time and frequency domains. With real EEG signals, we demonstrate that for dwell time of 0.0s, the number of false-positives/minute is 2 and the true positive rate (TPR) achieved by the proposed algorithm is 44.7%, which is more than 15.0% higher compared to other state-of-the-art artefact handling methods. As dwell time increases to 1.0s, the TPR increases to 73.1%. Conclusions: The proposed artefact removal algorithm greatly improves the BCI's performance. It also has the following advantages: a) it does not require additional electrooculogram/electromyogram channels, long data segments or a large number of EEG channels, b) it allows real-time processing, and c) it reduces signal distortion.

The goal of these models is to accurately mimic the event-related potentials observed by EEG/MEG measurement systems, and are useful in understanding overall brain functionality. In this paper, we focus on a class of nonlinear dynamic causal models (DCM) that are described by a set of connectivity parameters. In practice, the DCM parameters are inferred using data obtained by an EEG or MEG sensor array in response to a certain event or stimulus, and the resulting estimates are used to analyze the strength and direction of the causal interactions between different brain regions. The usefulness of the parameter estimates will depend on how accurately they can be estimated, which in turn will depend on noise, the sampling rate, number of data samples collected, the accuracy of the source localization and reconstruction steps, etc. The goal of this paper is to derive Cramer-Rao performance bounds for DCM estimates, and examine the behavior of the bounds under different operating conditions.

Subjects injected with saline and midazolam during study, performed old/new recognition memory tests with EEG recording. Based on previous studies, as midazolam causes anterograde amnesia, we expected that midazolam would affect the EEG's degree of complexity. Recurrence quantification analysis, and approximate entropy were used in this assessment. These methods compare with other nonlinear techniques such as computation of the correlation dimension, are suitable for non-stationary EEG signals. Our findings suggest that EEG's complexity decreases during memory retrieval. Although this trend is observed in nonlinear curves related to the midazolam condition, the overall complexity were greater than in the saline condition. This result implies that impaired memory function caused by midazolam is associated with greater EEG's complexity compared to normal memory retrieval in saline injection.

BCI is one of the most recent fields in computer science which tries to help handicapped people; however, single trial EEG analysis is hard due to its low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Many BCI systems are based on the analysis of ERPs such as P300. P300 is a positive peak that occurs approximately 300ms after a visual stimulus. But electrical potentials produced by blinks and eye movements cause serious problems in analyzing of EEG data. In this paper, a two stage algorithm is presented to detect P300 waves in single trial conditions in the presence of noise and artifact. In the first stage, the raw EEG data are denoised. For this reason, an ICA-wavelet based denoising method is proposed to automatically remove ocular artifact and it is also compared to other denoising methods. In the second stage, a detection algorithm is applied on denoised EEG data in order to discover P300 waves. In this method, a set of new features are extracted by applying ICA on each unknown incoming signal and finally they are classified using a neural network. The proposed method has been tested on more than 10 runs and an average accuracy of 71.5% in these runs is achieved in detecting P300 waves.

Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Event related potentials, particularly the late positive potential (LPP), have been investigated as a marker for motivational salience of stimuli, for example in addictive disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the LPP as a possible indicator of motivated attention towards disease-specific pictures of underweight female bodies in adolescents with AN in comparison to typically developing (TD) adolescent girls. Method: 13 girls with AN and 18 TD adolescent girls (aged 12 to 18 years) viewed pictures of underweight, normal-weight and overweight women while EEG activity was recorded. An earlier (450-680 ms after stimulus onset) as well as a later time window (850-1250 ms after stimulus onset) of the LPP were examined for the different picture categories. Participants were also asked to rate subjective emotions (fear, disgust, happiness) elicited by the pictures. Results: Subjective ratings showed no differential experience of emotions for the two groups. For AN patients, highest LPP amplitudes were found for underweight women in the earlier as well as in the later time window. In TD girls, highest amplitudes for pictures of overweight women were observed in the earlier time window. Conclusion: A differential LPP pattern for girls with AN and TD girls when viewing pictures of women's bodies of different weight categories was obtained. Highest amplitudes in AN patients for pictures of underweight women may reflect motivational significance of strongly underweight body shapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mismatch magnetic fields (MMNms, equivalents of EEG mismatch negativity, MMN) were recorded in 10 healthy subjects under three audio-visual conditions, which consisted of auditory stimulation with a static visual stimulation (A-0), auditory + synchronous visual stimulation (AV-S), and auditory + asynchronous visual stimulation (AV-R). Clear MMNms were obtained from eight subjects. The amplitude of the root mean square (r.m.s.) value, as well as the global field power, under AV-S conditions were greater compared to those recorded under other conditions in the right hemisphere (P = 0.0087, ANOVA). The latency difference of the N1ms, equivalents of the N1 ERP component recorded in the right hemisphere 100 msec after stimulation and elicited by standard and deviant stimuli, was significantly smaller under AV-S conditions than under other conditions (P = 0.016). There was no difference in the dipole localization for MMNm among the conditions. The results indicate that simultaneous visual stimulation enhances auditory MMNm. The mismatch response can be determined not only by the physical amount of deviated stimulation but also by a deviated feature produced due to accompanying stimulation of a different modality.

Speech production involves multiple feedback loops. An audio-vocal monitoring system plays an important role in speech production, based on auditory feedback about the speaker's own voice. Here we investigated the mu-rhythm activity associated with speech production by examining event-related desynchronization and synchronization in conditions of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and noise feedback (Lombard). In Experiment 1, we confirmed that the mu-rhythms were detectable for a conventional finger-tapping task, and vocalization. In Experiment 2, we examined the mu-rhythms for imagined speech production. We tested whether the same motor-related mu-rhythm activity was exhibited while participants listened to their own voice, and while reading. The mu-rhythms were observed for overt vocalization and covert reading, while listening to simulated auditory feedback of the participants' own voice reading text. In addition, we found that the mu-rhythm associated with listening was boosted and attenuated under the DAF and Lombard conditions, respectively. This is consistent with the notion that auditory feedback is important for the audio-vocal monitoring system in speech production. This paradigm may help clarify the way in which auditory feedback supports motor planning, as indexed by the motor-related mu-rhythm.

Short latency activation of cortex by clinically effective thalamic brain stimulation for tremor	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						ventral intermediate nucleus; deep brain stimulation; essential tremor; thalamus; cerebral cortex; event-related potential	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MOTOR CORTEX; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; DEEP; NEURONS; FREQUENCY; DYSTONIA; SUPPRESSION	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves disabling symptoms of neurologic and psychiatric diseases when medical treatments fail, yet its therapeutic mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus stimulation for essential tremor activates the cortex at short latencies, and that this potential is related to the suppression of tremor in the contralateral arm. We measured cortical activity with electroencephalography in 5 subjects (seven brain hemispheres) across a range of stimulator settings, and reversal of the anode and cathode electrode contacts minimized the stimulus artifact, allowing visualization of brain activity. Regression quantified the relationship between stimulation parameters and both the peak of the short latency potential and tremor suppression. Stimulation generated a polyphasic event-related potential in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, with peaks at discrete latencies beginning less than 1 ms after stimulus onset (mean latencies 0.9 +/- 0.2, 5.6 +/- 0.7, and 13.9 +/- 1.4 ms, denoted R1, R2, and R3, respectively). R1 showed more fixed timing than the subsequent peaks in the response (P < 0.0001, Levene's test), and R1 amplitude and frequency were both closely associated with tremor suppression (P < 0.0001, respectively). These findings demonstrate that effective VIM thalamic stimulation for essential tremor activates the cerebral cortex at approximately 1 ms after the stimulus pulse. The association between this short latency potential and tremor suppression suggests that DBS may improve tremor by synchronizing the precise timing of discharges in nearby axons and, by extension, the distributed motor network to the stimulation frequency or one of its subharmonics.

The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally, the review provides an overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices.

However, much less is known about the reverse influence of pain on attentional and especially emotional processes. To this end, we employed painful vs. non-painful pressure stimulation to examine effects on the processing of simultaneously presented facial expressions (fearful, neutral, happy). Continuous EEG was recorded and participants had to rate each facial expression with regard to valence and arousal. Painful stimulation attenuated visual processing in general, as reduced P100 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes revealed, but did not interfere with structural encoding of faces (N170). In addition, early perceptual discrimination and sustained preferential processing of emotional facial expressions as well as affective ratings were not influenced by pain. Thus, tonic pain demonstrates strong attention-demanding properties, but this does not interfere with concurrently ongoing emotion discrimination processes. These effects point at partially independent effects of pain on emotion and attention, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wieser, Matthias J.; Gerdes, Antje B.

In this study, correct and incorrect basketball actions were visually presented to professional basketball players and naive viewers while their EEG was recorded. The participants had to respond to rare targets (unanimated scenes). No category or group differences were found at perceptual level, ruling out the possibility that correct actions might be more visually familiar. Large, anterior N400 responses of event-related brain potentials to incorrectly performed basketball actions were recorded in skilled brains only. The swLORETA inverse solution for incorrect-correct contrast showed that the automatic detection of action ineffectiveness/incorrectness involved the fronto/parietal MNS, the cerebellum, the extra-striate body area, and the superior temporal sulcus.

The process is regarded as a grey area of consciousness between attentive wakefulness and slow wave sleep. Although neurophysiological changes, as the emergence of EEG grapho-elements (spindles, K-complexes), changes in power spectra and coherence, thalamocortical connectivity in fMRI, and single neuron changes in firing patterns, have been well characterised during the falling asleep process, little attempt has been made to link these modifications to the cognitive and behavioural dynamics of the transition. We revise here the body and brain physiology, behaviour and phenomenology of these changes of consciousness and propose an experimental framework to integrate the two aspects of consciousness that interact in the transition, wakefulness and awareness.

We first rejected data of one subject in each group and produced 441 sub-datasets including 40 subjects in each. Regarding each sub-dataset, we extracted features through nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) from event-related potentials, and used the leave-one-out paradigm for classification. Averaged accuracies over 441 sub-datasets were 77.98% (linear discriminate analysis), 73.55% (support vector machine), and 76.97% (adaptive boosting). In summary, assuming K observations with known labels, for the new observation without the group information, the feature of the new observation can be extracted through performing NTD to extract features from data of all observations (K+1). Since the group information of the first K observations is known, their features can train the classifier, and then, the trained classifier recognizes new features to determine the group information of new observation.

Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain it: the adaptation hypothesis and the memory-based hypothesis. Critically, they differ in whether the MMN can be distinguished from the N1. In this study, we assessed the differential contribution of the N1 and the MMN using independent component analysis (ICA) combined with model-based clustering. Our results show that the neural responses associated with the standard and deviant tones are explained by three clusters of reliable ICs with frontocentral scalp distribution. Two of these clusters exhibited a common N1 for both the standard and deviant tones and one cluster showed an enhancement of the anterior N1 at the MMN time range. These results support the adaptation hypothesis, which proposes that MMN is generated by neural mechanisms similar to those associated with auditory N1.

Spectral decomposition of P50 suppression in schizophrenia during concurrent visual processing	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; EEG; P50; Spectral analysis	HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; EVOKED-RESPONSE; RECENT-ONSET; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; ABNORMALITIES; INFORMATION; DYSFUNCTION; BRAIN; MODEL	Reduced suppression of the auditory P50 event-related potential has long been associated with schizophrenia, but the mechanisms associated with the generation and suppression of the P50 are not well understood. Recent investigations have used spectral decomposition of the electroencephalograph (EEG) signal to gain additional insight into the ongoing electrophysiological activity that may be reflected by the P50 suppression deficit. The present investigation extended this line of study by examining how both a traditional measure of sensory gating and the ongoing EEG from which it is extracted might be modified by the presence of concurrent visual stimulation - perhaps better characterizing gating deficits as they occur in a real-world, complex sensory environment. The EEG was obtained from 18 patients with schizophrenia and 17 healthy control subjects during the P50 suppression paradigm and while identical auditory paired-stimuli were presented concurrently with affectively neutral pictures. Consistent with prior research, schizophrenia patients differed from healthy subjects in gating of power in the theta range; theta activity also was modulated by visual stimulation. In addition, schizophrenia patients showed intact gating but overall increased power in the gamma range, consistent with a model of NMDA receptor dysfunction in the disorder. These results are in line with a model of schizophrenia in which impairments in neural synchrony are related to sensory demands and the processing of multimodal information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is not well understood whether this compensatory reorganization induced by auditory deprivation recedes once the sensation of hearing is partially restored through a cochlear implant. The current study used electroencephalography source localization to examine cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex of post-lingually deafened cochlear implant users. We analysed visual-evoked potentials to parametrically modulated reversing chequerboard images between cochlear implant users (n = 11) and normal-hearing listeners (n = 11). The results revealed smaller P100 amplitudes and reduced visual cortex activation in cochlear implant users compared with normal-hearing listeners. At the P100 latency, cochlear implant users also showed activation in the right auditory cortex, which was inversely related to speech recognition ability with the cochlear implant. These results confirm a visual take-over in the auditory cortex of cochlear implant users. Incomplete reversal of this deafness-induced cortical reorganization might limit clinical benefit from a cochlear implant and help explain the high inter-subject variability in auditory speech comprehension.

Research with event-related potentials has demonstrated the so-called face inversion effect, in which the N170 component is enhanced in amplitude and latency to inverted, compared to upright, faces. The present study explored the extent to which repetitive lower-level visual cortical engagement, reflected in flicker steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), shows similar amplitude enhancement to face inversion. We also asked if inversion-related ssVEP modulation would be dependent on the stimulation rate at which upright and inverted faces were flickered. To this end, multiple tagging frequencies were used (5, 10, 15, and 20 Hz) across two studies (n=21, n=18). Results showed that amplitude enhancement of the ssVEP for inverted faces was found solely at higher stimulation frequencies (15 and 20 Hz). By contrast, lower frequency ssVEPs did not show this inversion effect. These findings suggest that stimulation frequency affects the sensitivity of ssVEPs to face inversion.	[Gruss, L.

To accurately detect all faces under all these conditions, the face detection system must be suitably generalized. However, in autism spectrum conditions (ASCs), the typical generalization of perceptual learning is narrower. Here, we tested the generalization of the face detection system in a sample of adults with ASCs and a matched control group without ASCs. We recorded electroencephalography while participants viewed images of actual faces, face-like objects and non-face-like objects. Analysis of the N170 event-related potential component, which is related to the early stages of face detection, showed that the two participant groups were comparable in the activation of the N170 to actual faces and face-like objects, but that the typical control group showed an increased N170 for non-face-like objects over the group with ASCs. This indicates that the face detection system is less generalized (narrower) in ASCs than in typical development We propose that the reduced social interest characteristic of ASCs is associated with a narrower face detection system that is less reliable in detecting all the faces in the environment.

Lying involves a relatively greater cognitive load, and should be indicated by an increase of alpha power ERD. This study aimed to examine whether ERD discriminates deceptive responses from truthful responses. In the deception task, subjects made their own decision or were instructed either to type the presented numbers on the dice or input different numbers. Based on a subject's response and rule of the task, the type of response was determined. There were four types of responses: spontaneous deceptive, spontaneous truth, instructed deceptive, instructed truth. The findings of this study suggest that spontaneous deceptions produced significantly greater ERD than spontaneous truths, whereas ERD did not distinguish instructed deception from instructed truth. Different patterns between spontaneous and instructed deceptions may be due to different levels of cognitive load. Spontaneous lies require a greater cognitive load than other types of deceptions. The results of this study suggest that ERD has the potential to detect spontaneous deceptive responses. That is, ERD can detect deceptions that require cognitive effort in natural situations.

J	van Leeuwen, S; Singer, W; Melloni, L				van Leeuwen, Sara; Singer, Wolf; Melloni, Lucia			Meditation increases the depth of information processing and improves the allocation of attention in space	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						meditation; hierarchical processing; EEG; ERP; source localization	VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TASK-PERFORMANCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LOCAL ASPECTS; PERCEPTION; LEVEL; ERP; PRECEDENCE; PLASTICITY	During meditation, practitioners are required to center their attention on a specific object for extended periods of time. When their thoughts get diverted, they learn to quickly disengage from the distracter. We hypothesized that learning to respond to the dual demand of engaging attention on specific objects and disengaging quickly from distracters enhances the efficiency by which meditation practitioners can allocate attention. We tested this hypothesis in a global-to-local task while measuring electroencephalographic activity from a group of eight highly trained Buddhist monks and nuns and a group of eight age and education matched controls with no previous meditation experience. Specifically, we investigated the effect of attentional training on the global precedence effect, i.e., faster detection of targets on a global than on a local level. We expected to find a reduced global precedence effect in meditation practitioners but not in controls, reflecting that meditators can more quickly disengage their attention from the dominant global level. Analysis of reaction times confirmed this prediction. To investigate the underlying changes in brain activity and their time course, we analyzed event-related potentials. Meditators showed an enhanced ability to select the respective target level, as reflected by enhanced processing of target level information. In contrast with control group, which showed a local target selection effect only in the P1 and a global targets election effect in the P3 component, meditators showed effects of local information processing in the P1, N2, and P3 and of global processing for the N1, N2, and P3. Thus, meditators seem to display enhanced depth of processing. In addition, meditation altered the uptake of information such that meditators selected target level information earlier in the processing sequence than controls. In a longitudinal experiment, we could replicate the behavioral effects, suggesting that meditation modulates attention already after a 4-day meditation retreat. Together, these results suggest that practicing meditation enhances the speed with which attention can be allocated and relocated, thus increasing the depth of information processing and reducing response latency.

Simultaneous intracranial EEG-fMRI in humans: Protocol considerations and data quality	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; Intracranial EEG; Functional MRI; fMRI; Data quality; icEEG-fMRI; Electrophysiology; BOLD; Simultaneous EEG and fMRI	BOLD SENSITIVITY LOSSES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ARTIFACT; SAFETY	We have recently performed simultaneous intracranial EEG and fMRI recordings (icEEG-fMRI) in patients with epilepsy. In this technical note, we examine limited thermometric data for potential electrode heating during our protocol and found that heating was <= 0.1 degrees C in-vitro at least 10 fold less than in-vivo limits. We quantify EEG quality, which can be degraded by MRI scanner-induced artefacts, and fMRI image (gradient echo echo-planar imaging: GE-EPI) signal quality around the electrodes, which can be degraded by electrode interactions with B1 (radiofrequency) and B0 (static) magnetic fields. We recorded EEG outside and within the MRI scanner with and without scanning. EEG quality was largely preserved during scanning and in particular heartbeat-related artefacts were small compared to epileptic events. To assess the GE-EPI signal reduction around the electrodes, we compared image signal intensity along paths into the brain normal to its surface originating from the individual platinum-iridium electrode contacts. GE-EPI images were obtained at 1.5 T with an echo time (TE) of 40 ms and repetition time (TR) of 3000 ms and a slice thickness of 2.5 mm. We found that GE-EPI signal intensity reduction was confined to a 10 mm radius and that it was reduced on average by less than 50% at 5 mm from the electrode contacts. The GE-EPI image signal reduction also varied with electrode orientation relative to the MRI scanner axes; in particular, cortical grid contacts with a normal along the scanner's main magnetic field (Be) axis have higher artefact levels relative to those with a normal perpendicular to the z-axis. This suggests that the artefacts were predominantly susceptibility-related rather than due to B1 interactions. This information can be used to guide interpretation of results of icEEG-fMRI experiments proximal to the electrodes, and to optimise artefact reduction strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Stimuli were two monaural pure tones having a frequency of 400 or 800 Hz and a duration of 500 ms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 14 volunteers during the presentation of the following stimulus sequences, lasting 12 s each: 1) evoked potentials (EP condition, control), 2) alternation of frequency and ear (FE condition), 3) alternation of frequency (F condition), and 4) alternation of ear (E condition). Main results showed that in the central area of the left hemisphere (around C3 site) the N100 response underwent adaptation in all patterns of alternation, whereas in the same area of the right hemisphere the tones presented at the right ear in the FE produced no adaptation. Moreover, the responses to right-ear stimuli showed a difference between hemispheres in the E condition, which produced less adaptation in the left hemisphere. These effects are discussed in terms of lateral symmetry as a product of hemispheric, pathway and ear asymmetries.

The latency of the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) was used to evaluate the effects of low-frequency and short-term rTMS on brain activity. We investigated the effects of rTMS on P300 latencies by stimulating the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which is considered to be the area of origin of the P300. As the frequency-dependence of low-frequency rTMS has not been previously investigated in detail, we evaluated the effects of rTMS at frequencies of 1, 0.75 or 0.5 Hz on P300 latencies. The odd-ball task was used to elicit P300s before and shortly after the scalp was stimulated by rTMS. Electroencephalography recordings were measured at the Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes, which were based on the international 10-20 electrode system. We found that 1, 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS affected P300 latencies. 1 Hz rTMS of the left SMG shortened P300 latencies by approximately 25 ms at the Cz compared with the P300 latencies before rTMS. 0.5 Hz rTMS of the left SMG lengthened P300 latencies by approximately 20 ms at the Cz compared with the P300 latencies before rTMS. In contrast, 0.75 Hz rTMS of the left SMG did not affect P300 latencies. These results demonstrate that P300 latencies vary according to the frequency of rTMS.

For healthy users, a BCI shall be used as a complement to other existing devices, which involve the response to other tasks. Those tasks may impair selective attention, particularly if the stimuli have the same modality e.g. visual. It is therefore critical to analyze how single-trial detection of brain evoked response is impaired by the addition of tasks concerning the same modality. We tested 10 healthy participants using an application that has two visual target detection tasks. The first one corresponds to a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm where target detection is achieved by brain-evoked single-trial detection in the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The second task is the detection of a visual event on a tactical map by a behavioral response. These tasks were tested individually (single task) and in parallel (dual-task). Whereas the performance of single-trial detection was not impaired between single and dual-task conditions, the behavioral performance decreased during the dual-task condition. These results quantify the performance drop that can occur in a dual-task system using both brain-evoked responses and behavioral responses.

Chris; Praamstra, Peter			Frontoparietal theta activity supports behavioral decisions in movement-target selection	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						movement preparation; reaching; motor cortex; parietal cortex; theta oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; CORTICAL MECHANISMS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EEG; PARIETAL; MOTOR; PREMOTOR; CORTEX; ALPHA	There is recent EEG evidence describing task-related changes of theta power in spatial attention and reaching/pointing tasks. Here, we aim to better characterize this theta activity and determine whether it is associated with visuospatial memory or with visuospatial selection functions of the frontoparietal cortex. We recorded EEG from 20 participants during a movement precuing task with center-out joystick movements. Precues displayed 1, 2, or 4 potential targets and were followed (stimulus onset asynchrony 1.2 s) by a central response cue indicating the movement-target. Remembering the precued target location(s) was mandatory in one and optional in a second version of the task. Analyses evaluated two slow brain potentials (CNV, contingent negative variation and CDA, contralateral delay activity) and task-related power changes. Results showed a differential modulation of frontal CNV and parietal CDA, consistent with earlier described set-size effects on motor preparation and visual short-term memory. Short-lived phases of theta event-related synchronization (ERS) were found 150500 ms after precue and response cue presentation, exhibiting parietal and frontal maxima. The increase of frontoparietal theta power following response cue presentation was strongly modulated by target load, i.e., absent for 1-target (when the movement-target could be selected in advance), contrasting with a robust 2050% ERS response in 2- and 4-target conditions. The scalp distribution, the timing, and the modulation by set-size suggest a role of theta activity in movement-target selection. The results support a recently proposed view of theta as emerging around behavioral decision points, linked to the evaluation of choice-relevant information.

Methods: Eleven healthy adults underwent two electroencephalographic (EEG) sessions separated by 1 week, following a cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind paradigm. In both sessions, they performed a visual go/no-go task before real exposure to GSM-EMFs or after a sham condition with no EMF exposure. In the GSM real session, temporal cortex was continuously exposed to GSM-EMFs for 45 min. In the sham session, the subjects were not aware that the EMFs had been switched off for the duration of the experiment. In the go/no-go task, a central fixation stimulus was followed by a green (50% of probability) or red visual stimulus. Subjects had to press the mouse button after the green stimuli (go trials). With reference to a baseline period, power decrease of low-(about 8-10 Hz) and high-frequency (about 10-12 Hz) alpha rhythms indexed the cortical activity. Results: It was found less power decrease of widely distributed high-frequency alpha rhythms and faster reaction time to go stimuli in the post-than pre-exposure period of the GSM session. No effect was found in the sham session. Conclusions: These results suggest that the peak amplitude of alpha ERD and the reaction time to the go stimuli are modulated by the effect of the GSM-EMFs on the cortical activity. Significance: Exposure to GSM-EMFs for 45 min may enhance human cortical neural efficiency and simple cognitive-motor processes in healthy adults.

EEG Current Source Density and the Phenomenology of the Default Network	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; sLORETA; neurocognitive assessment	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; MODE NETWORK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; CORTICAL RHYTHMS; WANDERING MINDS; ERP COMPONENTS; BASE-LINE	In recent years, there has been an increasing line of research dedicated to the investigation of the default mode network (DMN) of the brain and resting state networks. However, the mental activity of the DMN has not been rigorously assessed to date. The specific aims of the current study were 2-fold: First, we sought to determine whether the current source density (CSD) levels in the DMN would correspond to other neuroimaging techniques. Second, we sought to understand the subjective mental activity of the DMN during baseline recordings. This study was conducted with 63 nonclinical participants, 34 female and 29 males with a mean age of 19.2 years (standard deviation = 2.0). The participants were recorded in 8 conditions. First, 4-minute eyes-closed baseline (ECB) and eyes-opened baseline (EOB) were obtained. The participants then completed 3 assessment instruments and 3 image conditions while the electroencephalography (EEG) was continuously recorded. Participants completed subjective reports for baselines and image conditions. These were rated by 3 independent raters and compared for reliability using a random effects model with an absolute agreement definition. The mean CSD between all conditions differed significantly, in many but not all regions of interest in the DMN. Interestingly, as suggested by other studies, the DMN appears preferential to self-relevant, self-specific, or self-perceptive processes. The reliability analyses show alpha for interrater agreement for ECB at .95 and EOB at .96. The subjective reports obtained from the participants regarding the mental activities employed during baseline recordings correspond to attentional and self-regulatory processes, which may also implicate the resting state or DMN as playing a direct role in the maintenance of a complex behavior (eg, being still, attending, and self-regulating). Thus, attention and self-regulation constitute the phenomenology of the resting state (DMN) in this study. The results also demonstrate that EEG CSD is a useful method to examine the DMN during concept-specific tasks to elucidate the neural activity associated with these concepts. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) can localize to 5 mm(3), which is comparable to the findings in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, sLORETA can provide data about the difference in activity between groups, individuals, or populations which in many cases fMRI cannot provide.

Separating neural and vascular effects of caffeine using simultaneous EEG-FMRI: Differential effects of caffeine on cognitive and sensorimotor brain responses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-FMRI; Caffeine; BOLD; Auditory oddball	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; OXYGEN-METABOLISM; ADENOSINE; BOLD; LEVEL; P300; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION	The effects of caffeine are mediated through its non-selective antagonistic effects on adenosine A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors resulting in increased neuronal activity but also vasoconstriction in the brain. Caffeine, therefore, can modify BOLD FMRI signal responses through both its neural and its vascular effects depending on receptor distributions in different brain regions. In this study we aim to distinguish neural and vascular influences of a single dose of caffeine in measurements of task-related brain activity using simultaneous EEG-FMRI. We chose to compare low-level visual and motor (paced finger tapping) tasks with a cognitive (auditory oddball) task, with the expectation that caffeine would differentially affect brain responses in relation to these tasks. To avoid the influence of chronic caffeine intake, we examined the effect of 250 mg of oral caffeine on 14 non and infrequent caffeine consumers in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. Our results show that the task-related BOLD signal change in visual and primary motor cortex was significantly reduced by caffeine, while the amplitude and latency of visual evoked potentials over occipital cortex remained unaltered. However, during the auditory oddball task (target versus non-target stimuli) caffeine significantly increased the BOLD signal in frontal cortex. Correspondingly, there was also a significant effect of caffeine in reducing the target evoked response potential (P300) latency in the oddball task and this was associated with a positive potential over frontal cortex. Behavioural data showed that caffeine also improved performance in the oddball task with a significantly reduced number of missed responses. Our results are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating altered flow-metabolism coupling after caffeine administration in the context of our observation of a generalised caffeine-induced reduction in cerebral blood flow demonstrated by arterial spin labelling (19% reduction over grey matter). We were able to identify vascular effects and hence altered neurovascular coupling through the alteration of low-level task FMRI responses in the face of a preserved visual evoked potential. However, our data also suggest a cognitive effect of caffeine through its positive effect on the frontal BOLD signal consistent with the shortening of oddball EEG response latency. The combined use of EEG-FMRI is a promising methodology for investigating alterations in brain function in drug and disease studies where neurovascular coupling may be altered on a regional basis.

In 10 patients with extraoccipital lobe epilepsy, we compared the spectral-spatial characteristics of HFOs spontaneously arising from the nonepileptic occipital cortex with those of HFOs driven by a visual task as well as epileptogenic HFOs arising from the extraoccipital seizure focus. We identified spontaneous HFOs at =80 Hz with a mean duration of 330 ms intermittently emerging from the occipital cortex during interictal slow-wave sleep. The spectral frequency band of spontaneous occipital HFOs was similar to that of visually driven HFOs. Spontaneous occipital HFOs were spatially sparse and confined to smaller areas, whereas visually driven HFOs involved the larger areas including the more rostral sites. Neither spectral frequency band nor amplitude of spontaneous occipital HFOs significantly differed from those of epileptogenic HFOs. Spontaneous occipital HFOs were strongly locked to the phase of delta activity, but the strength of d-phase coupling decayed from 1 to 3 Hz. Conversely, epileptogenic extraoccipital HFOs were locked to the phase of delta activity about equally in the range from 1 to 3 Hz. The occipital cortex spontaneously generates physiological HFOs which may stand out on electrocorticography traces as prominently as pathological HFOs arising from elsewhere; this observation should be taken into consideration during presurgical evaluation. Coupling of spontaneous delta and HFOs may increase the understanding of significance of d-oscillations during slow-wave sleep. Further studies are warranted to determine whether d-phase coupling distinguishes physiological from pathological HFOs or simply differs across anatomical locations. Hum Brain Mapp , 2012.

First, we explain the classification of motor imagery. Many methods have been utilized to evaluate motor imagery ability. For example, questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks have been used in the psychological approach. Brain activity has been measured utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG). Brain regions working in motor execution show activation during motor imagery. This includes the supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor cortex (PM) and the parietal cortex: Although motor imagery is done without movement or muscle contraction, sensory input from the periphery interacts with motor imagery. Brain activation during imagery of an action, as assessed by TMS, is stronger when sensory inputs resemble to those present during the actual execution of the action. Many studies have provided evidence of the effects of motor imagery practice on basic motor skills and sport performance. Most elite athletes (70 - 90 %) report that they use motor imagery to improve performance, and professional players,as compared to amateurs, utilized imagery practice more often. Many studies have confirmed that motor imagery practice can also be useful not only in sports, but also for improving performance in patient rehabilitation programs.

The aim of this study was to use dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to study the mechanisms of these impairments in short sleepers. Eight normal sleepers (total sleep time (TST) = 7-8 h) and nine habitual short sleepers (TST <= 6 h) participated. The time in bed was increased from habitual (<= 6 h) to extended (similar to 8.5 h) for one week in the short sleep group. Event related potentials (ERPs) were collected using an auditory novelty task in "IGNORE" and "ATTEND" conditions. Fourteen DCM models were considered using different configurations of connections among the following six areas: left and right primary auditory cortices, superior temporal gyri (STG), and inferior temporal gyri (IFG). After fitting the ERPs to the 14 models (separately for the IGNORE and ATTEND conditions), the best model (across subjects) was chosen using the Bayesian model comparison. For both conditions, the connection from right-STG to right-IFG for normal sleepers was significantly greater than habitual short sleepers. This connection did not differ in habitual short sleepers before and after one week of extended sleep time. This connection for normal sleepers was not significantly greater than the habitual short sleepers after one week of extended sleep. These results show that the deficiency of novelty processing, seen in short sleepers, can be explained by the differences in connectivity of the pathway between frontal and temporal brain areas as compared to the normal sleepers. In addition, one week of extended time in bed was not enough to fully normalize this neuronal pathway between STG and IFG in short sleepers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A general P300 brain-computer interface presentation paradigm based on performance guided constraints	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG; P300; Event-related potential; Rehabilitation; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; BCI SYSTEM; PATTERN; ERPS	An electroencephalographic-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can provide a non-muscular method of communication. A general model for P300-based BCI stimulus presentations is introduced - the "m choose n" or C(m (number of flashes per sequence), n (number of flashes per item)) paradigm, which is a universal extension of the previously reported checkerboard paradigm (CBP). C(m,n) captures all possible (unconstrained) ways to flash target items, and then applies constraints to enhance ERP's produced by attended matrix items. We explore a C(36,5) instance of C(m,n) called the "five flash paradigm" (FFP) and compare its performance to the CBP. Eight subjects were tested in each paradigm, counter-balanced. Twelve minutes of calibration data were used as input to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to derive classification coefficients used for online classification. Accuracy was consistently high for FFP (88%) and CBP (90%); information transfer rate was significantly higher for the FFP (63 bpm) than the CBP (48 bpm). The C(m,n) is a novel and effective general strategy for organizing stimulus groups. Appropriate choices for "m," "n," and specific constraints can improve presentation paradigms by adjusting the parameters in a subject specific manner. This may be especially important for people with neuromuscular disabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the neural implementation of object learning in the human brain remains largely unknown. Using combined psychophysics and electroencephalogram (EEG), we investigated the effects of perceptual learning on face processing. Human subjects were trained to discriminate face views at an in-depth face orientation (i.e. 30 degrees) over eight daily sessions, which resulted in a significant improvement in sensitivity to the trained face view. Psychophysical results showed that this improvement was highly specific to the trained view. Before and after training, we recorded subjects' EEG signals responding to the trained and the untrained face views. Analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that face view discrimination training led to a larger reduction of N170 latency at the left occipital-temporal area with the trained face view, compared with the untrained ones. These findings provide evidence for the facilitation model on neuronal plasticity from visual experience, suggesting a faster processing speed of face induced by perceptual learning.

To be reliable, these clues should ideally be invariant to common viewing variations such as changes in illumination and orientation. In a large image database of natural materials, we found textures with low-towel contrast statistics that varied substantially under viewing variations, as well as textures that remained relatively constant. This led us to ask whether textures with constant contrast statistics give rise to more invariant representations compared to other textures. To test this, we selected natural texture images with either high (HV) or low (LV) variance in contrast statistics and presented these to human observers. In two distinct behavioral categorization paradigms, participants more often judged HV Textures as "different" compared to LV textures, showing that separate electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments, evoked responses to single textures image (single-image ERPs) were collected. These results show that differences in contrast statistics correlated with both early and late differences in occipital ERP amplitude between individual images. Importantly, ERP differences between images of HV textures were mainly driven by illumination angle, which was not the case for LV images; there, differences were completely driven by texture membership. These converging neutral and behavioral results imply that some natural textures are surprisingly invariant to illumination changes and that low-level contrast statistics are diagnostic of the extent of this invariance	[Groen, Iris I.

One of the most widely used tasks to assess cognitive processing in this context is the auditory oddball paradigm, where an infrequent change in a sequence of sounds elicits, in awake subjects, a characteristic EEG event-related potential called the mismatch negativity, followed by the classic P300 wave. The latter is further separable into the slightly earlier, anterior P3a and the later, posterior P3b, thought to be linked to task-irrelevant "bottom-up" and task-oriented "top-down" attention, respectively. We discuss here the putative dissociations between attention and awareness in DoC, sedation and sleep, bearing in mind the recently emerging evidence from healthy volunteers and patients. These findings highlight the neurophysiological and cognitive parallels (and differences) across these three distinct variations in levels of consciousness, and inform the theoretical framework for interpreting the role of attention therein.

In this study, we investigated the development of the processing of case-marking and argument structures in children at 3, 4; 6 and 6 years of age, as well as its processing in adults. Using EEG, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to object-initial compared to subject-initial German sentences including transitive verbs and case-marked noun phrases referring to animate arguments. We also tested children's behavioral competence in a sentence-picture matching task. Word order and case-marking were manipulated in German main clauses. Adults' behavioral performance was close to perfect and their ERPs revealed a negativity for the processing of the topicalized accusative marked noun phrase (NP1) and no effect for the second NP (NP2) in the object-initial structure. Children's behavioral data showed a significant above-chance outcome in the subject-initial condition for all age groups, but not for the object-initial condition. In contrast to adults, the ERPs of 3-year-olds showed a positivity at NP1, indicating difficulties in processing the non-canonical object-initial structures. Children at the age of 4; 6 did not differ in the processing patterns of object-initial vs. subject-initial sentences at NP1 but showed a slight positivity at NP2. This positivity at NP2, which implies syntactic integration difficulties, is more pronounced in 6-year-olds but is absent in adults. At NP1, however, 6-year-olds show the same negativity as adults. In sum, the behavioral and electrophysiological findings demonstrate that children in each age group use different strategies, which are indicative of their developmental stage. While 3-year-olds merely detect differences in the two sentence structures without being able to use this information for sentence comprehension, 4; 6-year-olds proceed to use mainly a word-order strategy, processing NP1 in both conditions in the same manner, which leads to processing difficulties upon detecting case-marking cues at NP2. At the age of 6, children are able to use case-marking cues for comprehension but still show enhanced effort for correct thematic-role assignment.

Expectancy-related modulations of neural oscillations in continuous performance tasks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillations; Alpha; Beta; AX-CPT; Cognitive; Motor preparation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN CORTICOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CHANGING PLANS; MOTOR SYSTEMS; BETA-RHYTHM	Analysis of neural oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during cognitive tasks provides valuable information about underlying neuronal processing not accessible by other methods such as event-related potentials (ERPs) and the BOLD signal in fMRI. We investigated neural substrates of motor preparation and expectancy by analyzing neural oscillations of healthy subjects performing the AX continuous performance task (AX-CPT), a task widely used to evaluate processes such as cognitive control, motor preparation and anticipatory and sustained attention. The task consists of letters presented sequentially on a monitor, and subjects are required to respond only when they see the letter A (cue) followed by the letter X (target). In this study, to emphasize expectation and motor preparation, three versions of AX-CPT were used in which the overall propensity to respond was differentially modulated, by changing the probability of the letter sequences. Neural activity was investigated in three time windows following presentation of the cue: sensory, evaluation and preparation. Alpha power was reduced following cue onset similarly in all versions of the task in both the sensory and evaluation periods, but in the later preparation period there were task dependent modulations. Alpha was decreased when an infrequent cue increased the chance of a response, and increased when a propensity to respond had to be overcome, possibly reflecting an anticipatory attentional mechanism to gate visuo-motor processing. Beta power was modulated by task and cue in both evaluation and preparation periods. In the latter, beta power reflected the propensity to respond and correlated both with amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an ERP that reflects response preparation, and with reaction time. Some clinical populations such as patients with schizophrenia or attention-deficit disorder show specific deficits when performing the AX-CPT. These results provide a basis for investigating the differential neural underpinnings of oscillatory cognitive control deficits observed in various patient populations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition 'dipolarity' defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).

We used the ultimatum game to examine whether touch from a robot could inhibit a negative feeling to the robot. We set two experimental conditions: the one was "touch condition" in which unfair proposals were offered to a participant when a robot touched his/her arm and the other was "no touch condition" in which unfair proposals were offered when the same robot did not. We compared Medial Frontal Negativity (MFN) measured by EEG, whose amplitude is correlated with feeling of unfairness, between the two conditions. Result shows that MFN amplitude was larger in the no touch condition than in the touch condition. This indicates that touch from a robot may inhibit a sense of unfairness for the robot. Our finding suggests that touch from a robot could enhance positive feeling to the robot through human-robot interaction.

The current study examined the influence of seasonal and chronological variables on resting frontal asymmetry, and also assessed whether different reference montages or surface transformations were equally susceptible to these influences. In a direct replication attempt, contrary to previous findings, no simple time of year by time of day interaction was found. Time awake at recording, however, was an important moderating variable of the relationship between photoperiod and time of day. EEG asymmetry scores based on current-source density (CSD) transformed data, however, appeared less vulnerable to these influences, providing further evidence to suggest that the CSD transform may be advantageous for examining stable trait estimates of frontal EEG asymmetry.

It has been proposed that this is due to the availability of sway-relevant sensory feedback from the hand compensating for lost vision. Recently, we revealed modulation of cortical sensory transmission of information from the hand depending on the task (e.g. relevant or not relevant to balance control). Of interest in the present study is the potential origin of task-specific modulation of cortically evoked sensory potentials linked to balance control. We aimed to investigate the role of the prefrontal cortex by temporarily suppressing this region and observing differences in cortical events. Continuous theta-burst stimulation was applied to either the prefrontal cortex or a control stimulation site before balance testing. During balance testing, individuals stood in tandem on a force plate with their eyes closed while lightly touching a stable surface or a sway-referenced surface with the index finger. Throughout testing, the median nerve was stimulated and electroencephalography was used to measure somatosensory-evoked potentials. As expected, the availability of stable light touch reduced the medial-lateral centre of pressure sway. Importantly, in the present study, there was a loss of task-related P200 modulation at FCZ following stimulation of the prefrontal cortex. The present findings support the hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex may serve to regulate task-related sensory reweighting of haptic information that may be used during the control of standing balance.

From the last decades, different techniques have been used for their removal mainly based on adaptive filters. This work presents a new approach for removing peak and spike artifacts based on the analytic signal envelope, filtered with a low-pass filter. The proposed algorithm was tested on electroencephalogram signals containing peak and spike artifacts. Results showed that this method permitted to remove the peak and spike artifacts preserving both high correlation (rho > 0.9) and spectral coherence (<(C(f))over bar> >0.85) with the original signal.

Here, we explore how distinct sources of interference, i.e., distraction (stimuli to-be-ignored) and interruption (stimuli requiring attention), differentially influence WM in younger and older adults. EEG was recorded while participants engaged in three versions of a delayed-recognition task: no interference, a distracting stimulus, and an interrupting stimulus presented during WM maintenance. Behaviorally, both types of interference negatively impacted WM accuracy in older adults significantly more than younger adults (with a larger deficit for interruptions). N170 latency measures revealed that the degree of processing both distractors and interruptors predicted WM accuracy in both populations. However, while WM impairments could be explained by excessive attention to distractors by older adults (a suppression deficit), impairment induced by interruption were not clearly mediated by age-related increases in attention to interruptors. These results suggest that distinct underlying mechanisms mediate the impact of different types of external interference on WM in normal aging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Subjects either detected random targets or targets preceded by a predictive sequence of three distinct stimuli. The last stimulus in the three-stimulus sequence (decisive stimulus) did not require any motor response but 100% predicted a subsequent target event. We showed that predictive context optimises target processing via the deployment of distinct anticipatory mechanisms at different times of the predictive sequence. Prior to the occurrence of the decisive stimulus, enhanced attentional preparation was manifested by reductions in the alpha oscillatory activities over the visual cortices, resulting in facilitation of processing of the decisive stimulus. Conversely, the subsequent 100% predictable target event did not reveal the deployment of attentional preparation in the visual cortices, but elicited enhanced motor preparation mechanisms, indexed by an increased contingent negative variation and reduced mu oscillatory activities over the motor cortices before movement onset. The present results provide evidence that anticipation operates via different attentional and motor preparation mechanisms by selectively pre-activating task-dependent brain areas as the predictability gradually increases.

Previous brain-imaging studies have focused on identifying spatial patterns (i.e., brain areas) that change with learning, implicating occipitotemporal and frontoparietal areas. However, little is known about the interactions within this network that mediate learning-dependent improvement in complex perceptual tasks (i.e., discrimination of visual forms in clutter). Here we take advantage of the complementary high spatial and temporal resolution of simultaneous EEG-fMRI to identify the learning-dependent changes in spatiotemporal brain patterns that mediate enhanced behavioral sensitivity in the discrimination of global forms after training. We measured the observers' choices when discriminating between concentric and radial patterns presented in noise before and after training. Similarly, we measured the choices of a pattern classifier when predicting each stimulus from EEG-fMRI signals. By comparing the performance of human observers and classifiers, we demonstrated that learning alters sensitivity to visual forms and EEG-fMRI activation patterns related to distinct visual recognition processes. In particular, behavioral improvement after training was associated with changes in (1) early processes involved in the integration of global forms in higher occipitotemporal and parietal areas, and (2) later processes related to categorical judgments in frontal circuits. Thus, our findings provide evidence that learning acts on distinct visual recognition processes and shapes feedforward interactions across brain areas to support performance in complex perceptual tasks.

Case Report: The patient, E.Z., age 9.3, was suffering from neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially attention deficits, and behavioral changes, rendering him unable to function independently in school and in many situations of everyday life. He was treated for epilepsy, but only slight progress was made. The patient took part in 20 sessions of relative beta training combined with behavioral training. We used standardized neuropsychological testing, as well as ERPs before the experiment and after the completion of the neurotherapy program. Neuropsychological testing at baseline showed multiple cognitive deficits. Over the course of neurotherapy, E.Z.'s verbal and non-verbal IQ increased significantly. His cognitive functions also improved, including immediate and delayed logical and visual recall on the WMS-III, maintaining attention on the WMS-III, and executive functions, but remained below norms. Physiologically, the patient showed substantial changes after neurotherapy, including fewer spikes and an increased P300 NOGO component. Conclusions: The cognitive deficits characteristic for ADHD in a child with BPERS may be unresponsive to antiepileptic treatment, but are reversible after a carefully selected neurotherapy program, combined with antiepileptic treatment. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) in the GO/NOGO task can be used to assess functional brain changes induced by neurotherapeutical programs.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Unconscious processes; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	NEGATIVE ATTENTIONAL SET; INDUCED MOTION BLINDNESS; DUAL-STREAM RSVP; MOTOR-RESPONSES; BLINK; TASK; DISTRACTORS; ERP; DISTINCTIVENESS; PERCEPTION	In many rapid serial presentation tasks, two targets (T1 and T2) have to be distinguished from background stimuli. Here, digits (lures) were interspersed among the background letters, differing from the T2 digit by occurring before rather than after T1. The resulting inhibitory effects on T2 identification may either be evoked directly by the lures or be triggered by T1, interfering with positive priming of lures on T2. To distinguish between these two alternatives, lures, T1, and T2 were presented in two different simultaneously running streams, T2 was or was not the same digit as a lure, and EEG potentials related to lures, T1, and T2 were recorded. Effects on T2 identification better fit the view that lures exerted positive priming interrupted by T1. Recurrence of lures in the trial led to abridged duration of the lure-evoked N2pc, and T2-evoked N2pc was reduced after lures. Also these N2pc effects may reflect positive priming.

Previous work has suggested that the establishment of subject verb and object verb dependencies requires argument retrieval from working memory, and that dependency establishment in object-first sentences additionally necessitates argument reordering. We examine the spatiotemporal neuronal dynamics of the brain regions that subserve these sub-processes by crossing an argument reordering factor (i.e., subject-first versus object-first sentences) with an argument retrieval factor (i.e., short versus long argument verb dependencies) in German. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that reordering demands focally activate the left pars opercularis (Broca's area), while storage and retrieval demands activated left temporo-parietal (TP) regions. In addition, when analyzing the time course of fMRI-informed equivalent current dipole sources in the EEG at the subcategorizing verb, we found that activity in the TP-region occurs relatively early (40 180 ms), followed by activity in Broca's area (300-500 ms). These findings were matched by topographical correlation analyses of fMRI activations in EEG sensor space, showing that, in the scalp potential, TP-region activity surfaces as an early positivity and IFG activity as a later positivity in the scalp potential. These results provide fine-grained evidence for spatiotemporally separable sub-processes of argument retrieval and reordering in sentence processing.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ADHD symptoms are a major risk factor for criminal behaviour, or whether further deficits, mainly abnormalities in emotion-processing, have to be considered as important additional factors that promote delinquency in the presence of ADHD symptomatology. Event related potentials (ERPs) of 13 non-delinquent and 13 delinquent subjects with ADHD and 13 controls were compared using a modified visual Go/Nogo continuous performance task (VCPT) and a newly developed version of the visual CPT that additionally requires emotional evaluation (ECPT). ERPs were analyzed regarding their topographies and Global Field Power (GFP). Offenders with ADHD differed from non-delinquent subjects with ADHD in the ERPs representing higher-order visual processing of objects and faces (N170) and facial affect (P200), and in late monitoring and evaluative functions (LPC) of behavioural response inhibition. Concerning neural activity thought to reflect the allocation of neural resources and cognitive processing capability (P300 Go), response inhibition (P300 Nogo), and attention/expectancy (CNV), deviances were observable in both ADHD groups and may thus be attributed to ADHD rather than to delinquency. In conclusion, ADHD symptomatology may be a risk factor for delinquency, since some neural information processing deficits found in ADHD seemed to be even more pronounced in offenders with ADHD. However, our results suggest additional risk factors consisting of deviant higher-order visual processing, especially of facial affect, as well as abnormalities in monitoring and evaluative functions of response inhibition.

Family-based genome-wide association study of frontal theta oscillations identifies potassium channel gene KCNJ6	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alcoholism; EEG; GWAS; KCNJ6; oscillations	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; S-TRANSFORM; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; DELTA-OSCILLATION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; GIRK CHANNELS; NEURONS; MEMORY	Event-related oscillations (EROs) represent highly heritable neuroelectric correlates of cognitive processes that manifest deficits in alcoholics and in offspring at high risk to develop alcoholism. Theta ERO to targets in the visual oddball task has been shown to be an endophenotype for alcoholism. A family-based genome-wide association study was performed for the frontal theta ERO phenotype using 634 583 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 1560 family members from 117 families densely affected by alcohol use disorders, recruited in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism. Genome-wide significant association was found with several SNPs on chromosome 21 in KCNJ6 (a potassium inward rectifier channel; KIR3.2/GIRK2), with the most significant SNP at P = 4.7 x 10-10). The same SNPs were also associated with EROs from central and parietal electrodes, but with less significance, suggesting that the association is frontally focused. One imputed synonymous SNP in exon four, highly correlated with our top three SNPs, was significantly associated with the frontal theta ERO phenotype. These results suggest KCNJ6 or its product GIRK2 account for some of the variations in frontal theta band oscillations. GIRK2 receptor activation contributes to slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials that modulate neuronal excitability, and therefore influence neuronal networks.	[Kang, S.

Although symmetry is known to be an important determinant of aesthetic preference, previous studies have concluded that evaluation does not occur spontaneously. These studies also found that symmetrical and random patterns do not differ in terms of early sensory processing, within 200 ms of stimulus onset. We presented participants with symmetrical or random abstract patterns, which they had to classify correctly. Contrary to previous work, we found that N1 amplitude was sensitive to all types of regularity, and P1 was sensitive to rotational symmetry. We also found that activity in the Zygomaticus Major, the facial muscle responsible for smiling, was greater for reflection patterns. However, we were able to reverse this effect by changing the task so that participants had to treat random patterns as the target stimuli. We conclude that participants spontaneously select reflectional symmetry as the target, and positive affective responses automatically follow from successful target detection. This work provides a new account of the neural mechanisms involved in visual symmetry perception. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Makin, Alexis D.

Effects of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation on drug use and responses to cue-induced craving: a pilot study	CHINESE MEDICINE			English	Article							AURICULAR ACUPUNCTURE; COCAINE ADDICTION; NERVE-STIMULATION; TRIAL	Background: Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) avoids the use of needles, and instead delivers a mild electric current at traditional acupoints. This technique has been used for treating heroin addiction, but has not been systematically tested for other drugs of abuse. This study aims to investigate the effects of TEAS on drug addiction. Methods: Volunteers who were either cocaine-dependent (n = 9) or cannabis-dependent (n = 11) but were not seeking treatment for their dependence participated in a within-subject, single-blind study. Treatment consisted of twice daily 30-minute sessions of TEAS or sham stimulation for 3.5 days. The active TEAS levels were individually adjusted to produce a distinct twitching response in the fingers, while the sham stimulation involved 2 minutes of stimulation at threshold levels followed by 28 minutes of stimulation below the detection levels. The participants recorded their drug use and drug cravings daily. At 1 hour after the last morning session of TEAS or sham stimulation, a cue-induced craving EEG evaluation was conducted. Event-related P300 potentials (ERPs) were recorded, sorted, and analyzed for specific image types (neutral objects, non-drug-related arousing images, or drug-related images). Results: TEAS treatment did not significantly reduce the drug use or drug cravings, or significantly alter the ERP peak voltage or latency to peak response. However, the TEAS treatment did significantly modulate several self-reported measures of mood and anxiety. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study with a limited sample size suggest that the acupoint stimulation techniques and protocol used in this trial alone do not significantly reduce cravings for or use of cocaine or cannabis. The findings that TEAS modulates mood and anxiety suggest that TEAS could be used as an adjunct in a multimodal therapy program to treat cocaine and cannabis dependence if confirmed in a full randomized controlled clinical trial.

The neuroscience literature has devoted many studies to the semantic processing of words. However, the research remains specific to certain categories, studied separately, and does not address the lexicon as a system. In order to provide further insight into the neuronal organization of the lexicon, we conducted an EEG-based semantic decision experiment using words from eight categories (four living and four nonliving categories) as the material. A data-analysis method (correspondence analysis or CA) commonly used in computational linguistics was applied to the electrophysiological signals. The results revealed a two-factor structure: an ontological organization separating the living from the nonliving, and an organization with a human referential structured by proximity to the person. A comparison of the ERP-CA and the linguistic-CA data revealed organizational analogies. Lastly, a tomography software (Loreta (R)) was used to estimate the cerebral sources associated with the ERP signals.

The results of a visual-semantic categorization task show that three early ERP components including the P1-N1 complex had a dominant frequency characteristic in the alpha range and behaved like traveling waves do. They exhibited a traveling direction from midline occipital to right lateral parietal sites. Phase analyses revealed that this traveling behavior of ERP components could be explained by phase-delays in the alpha but not theta and beta frequency range. Most importantly, we found that the speed of the traveling alpha wave was significantly and negatively correlated with reaction time indicating that slow traveling speed was associated with fast picture-categorization. We conclude that evoked alpha oscillations are functionally associated with early access to visual-semantic information and generate - or at least modulate - the early waveforms of the visual ERP.

High-frequency neuronal network modulations encoded in scalp EEG precede the onset of focal seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epileptic seizures; Scalp EEG; Preictal dynamics; Network interactions; High frequency oscillations; Information theory; Seizure prediction	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; RESTING BRAIN; FAST RIPPLES; OSCILLATIONS; CONNECTIVITY; ANTICIPATION; GENERATION; PREDICTION; ENTROPY; MARKER	Modulations of neuronal network interactions by seizure precursors are only partially understood and difficult to measure, in part due to inherent intra- and inter-patient seizure heterogeneities and EEG variability. This study investigated preictal neuromodulations associated with seizures originating in the temporal and/or frontal lobes, using information theoretic parameters estimated from awake scalp EEGs in two frequency ranges, <= 100 Hz and >100 Hz, respectively. Seizure-related activity at high frequencies has not been extensively estimated in awake scalp EEGs. Based on the statistical similarity of preictal and ictal information parameters, preictal network interactions appeared to be specifically modulated at frequencies >100 Hz, but not at lower frequencies. The dynamics of these parameters varied distinctly according to the origin of seizure onset (temporal versus frontal). Although preliminary, and based on a small patient sample for which the potential heterogeneity of multiple anticonvulsive medications was difficult to control, these results suggest that preictal modulations may be estimated from high-frequency scalp EEGs using directional information measures with high specificity to ictal events, and may thus be promising for improving seizure prediction.

Examining the neural correlates associated with the moment a stimulus enters or exits conscious awareness is one way to potentially identify the neural mechanisms that give rise to consciousness. In the present study, we recorded neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants observed a bilateral shape-from-motion (SFM) display. While the display is in motion, the observer perceives an object that is immediately segregated from a noisy background. After the motion stops, the observer's experience of the object remains momentarily in awareness, before it eventually fades out of consciousness back into the noisy background. Consistent with subjective reports of perceptual experience, we observed a prominent sustained posterior contralateral negativity known as the (CDA). This activity was sustained only in conditions associated with sustained awareness. Interestingly, the amplitude of the CDA was correlated with individual differences in visual awareness, suggesting that this activity plays a significant role in the maintenance of objects in consciousness. The CDA is typically associated with visual short-term memory (VSTM), suggesting that conscious visual awareness may be mediated by the same neural and cognitive mechanisms that support VSTM. Our results demonstrate that the CDA may reflect the contents of conscious awareness, and therefore can provide a measure to track when information moves in and out of consciousness.

It is assumed to reflect an active inhibition process. Our aim was to investigate the differences in the beta rebound between movement termination and withholding of movement, and the withholding of overt and covert movement. Methods: Twenty healthy persons completed Go/NoGo experiments with real and imaginary foot movements (dorsiflexion of both feet). Only participants that presented a beta rebound were considered. Event-related (de) synchronization provided the time course of the beta rebound from a participant specific frequency band. Statistical analyses revealed the significant differences between pairs of conditions: motor execution Go vs. motor execution NoGo, and motor execution NoGo vs. motor imagery NoGo. Results: The beta rebound is stronger and lasts longer after termination of movement than during withholding of a motor response (9 participants). Withholding of overt movement generates a stronger, longer, and more widespread beta rebound than the withholding of imaginary movement (7 participants). The beta rebound is more common after termination (16/16) and withholding of real movement (12/16) than during withholding of imaginary movements (7/16). Conclusions: These phenomena share a common origin and a common frequency band. Their functional meaning is assumed to be the same, although there are differences in time span and intensity of the beta ERS. Significance: First direct comparison of the beta rebound between motor execution and motor withholding, as well as withholding of overt and covert foot movement. A beta rebound also occurs during withholding of a motor task, and it is more common and strong for overt movement than for covert movement.

We tested these possibilities by analyzing the phase-locked and non-phase-locked Mu response during the execution of a visual-motor task. Methods: EEG was recorded in 13 subjects during the visual presentation of an arrow which indicated the direction of the finger motion to be executed after the presentation of a second stimulus. The EEG activity in the alpha-range (Mu-alpha) and beta-range was evaluated by a method which segregated the phase-locked and the non-phase-locked response. The event-related Mu-response observed during this task was compared with that computed when the subjects saw the same arrow-stimuli but did not perform any task (passive test). Results: Visual stimuli induced a phase-locked alpha-oscillation which began approximate to 50 ms after the stimulus onset and persisted for about 150-200 ms. This response was much higher when stimuli were used for motion planning than when they were passively observed, and was more marked in the alpha-range than in the beta-range. The phase-locked response was followed by a persistent decrease of the non-phase-locked Mu-activity similar to that previously reported with the event-related desynchronization/synchronization method. Conclusions: The Mu-wave is not a single phenomenon. It was segregated here into two components, one with an early and short-lasting phase locked-response to visual stimuli, which increased during the task execution, and the other without phase-locked responses which persistently decreased during the task execution. Significance: Present data suggest that Mu-activity performs a double action, increasing the information processing of one task (according to the "processing hypothesis") and decreasing the computation of other potentially interfering tasks (according to the "idling hypothesis"), with task selection being achieved by choosing their phase-association to the Mu-wave.

Recently, there is evidence that facial expressions might elicit the visual mismatch negativity (MMN), expression MMN (EMMN), reflecting that facial expression could be processed under non-attentional condition. In the present study, using a cross modality task we attempted to investigate whether there is a memory-comparison-based EMMN. Methods: 12 normal adults were instructed to simultaneously listen to a story and pay attention to a non-patterned white circle as a visual target interspersed among face stimuli. In the oddball block, the sad face was the deviant with a probability of 20% and the neutral face was the standard with a probability of 80%; in the control block, the identical sad face was presented with other four kinds of face stimuli with equal probability (20% for each). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously recorded and ERPs (event-related potentials) in response to each kind of face stimuli were obtained. Oddball-EMMN in the oddball block was obtained by subtracting the ERPs elicited by the neutral faces (standard) from those by the sad faces (deviant), while controlled-EMMN was obtained by subtracting the ERPs elicited by the sad faces in the control block from those by the sad faces in the oddball block. Both EMMNs were measured and analyzed by ANOVAs (Analysis of Variance) with repeated measurements. sLORETA (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) was used to investigate the cortical generators of controlled-EMMN. Results: Both the oddball-EMMN in deviant-standard comparison and the controlled-EMMN in deviant-control comparison were observed at occipital-temporal regions with right hemisphere predominance. The oddball-EMMN was bigger and earlier than the controlled-EMMN because, besides the memory-based comparison, the former included a difference of refractoriness due to the distinction of presented probability between the deviant and standard face stimuli. The source analysis of controlled-EMMN indicated a current source primarily involved in posterior areas including superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule as well as the insula. Conclusions: The valid EMMN properly reflecting the memory-based comparison of facial expressions could be obtained, i.e., the controlled-EMMN.

This study tested whether language-specific cue weighting is reflected in preattentive processing. The mismatch negativity (MMN) of Dutch and Spanish participants was examined in response to spectral and duration cues in Dutch vowels. The MMN at frontal and mid sites was weaker and peaked later at Fz for Spanish than for Dutch listeners for the spectrally cued contrasts, whereas both groups responded similarly to the duration cue. In line with overt categorization behavior, these MMN data indicate that preattentive cue weighting depends on the listeners' language experience.

Ontogenetic Modifications of Evoked EEG Activity in 6-to 16-Year-Old Children and Teenagers	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						evoked potentials (EPs); P300 wave; contingent negative variation (CNV); ontogenetic changes; go/no go paradigm; children	MEMORY SPAN; POTENTIALS; STIMULUS; P300; AGE	We studied peculiarities of the age-related dynamics of amplitude/time characteristics of evoked EEG potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded within the framework of the go/no go paradigm in 6- to 16-year-old children and teenagers. We found a number of significant correlations between age of the tested persons and characteristics of EPs and ERPs. With age, latencies of the components D 1 (in the frontal and central regions), N1 (practically throughout the head surface), D 2 (in the frontal, temporal, and central leads of the left hemisphere, as well as in the temporal and occipital leads of the right hemisphere), and wave D 300 (in the central regions of both hemispheres) demonstrated clear trends toward shortening. On the whole, the amplitudes of D 2 (in the frontal, central, and parietal regions of both hemispheres and in the right temporal region), N1-D 2 (in the frontal, central, and parietal regions), and contingent negative variation (in the left central lead) increased with age; we also observed a decrease in the amplitude of the N2 component, which reached a significant value in the left occipital lead. In addition, the working efficiency increased, which was manifested in decreases in the mean delay of the sensorimotor reaction, number of errors of omission of significant stimuli, and number of erroneous pushes. Therefore, the amplitude/time characteristics of some components of EPs and ERPs in 6- to 16-year-old children and teenagers demonstrate obvious age-dependent modifications; these shifts reflect the processes of maturation of the brain and formation of cognitive functions.

A further specification of the functional role of gamma oscillations in language comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						language comprehension; prediction; semantic unification; neuronal oscillations; network dynamics; gamma; theta; EEG	THETA-POWER INCREASES; NEURONAL COMMUNICATION; EEG COHERENCE; MEMORY; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; UNIFICATION; MECHANISMS; RETRIEVAL	Gamma-band neuronal synchronization during sentence-level language comprehension has previously been linked with semantic unification. Here, we attempt to further narrow down the functional significance of gamma during language comprehension, by distinguishing between two aspects of semantic unification: successful integration of word meaning into the sentence context, and prediction of upcoming words. We computed event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency band-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) power changes while participants read sentences that contained a critical word (CW) that was (1) both semantically congruent and predictable (high doze, HC), (2) semantically congruent but unpredictable (low cloze, LC), or (3) semantically incongruent (and therefore also unpredictable; semantic violation, SV). The ERR analysis showed the expected parametric N400 modulation (HC < LC < SV). The time-frequency analysis showed qualitatively different results. In the gamma-frequency range, we observed a power increase in response to the CW in the HC condition, but not in the LC and the SV conditions. Additionally, in the theta frequency range we observed a power increase in the SV condition only. Our data provide evidence that gamma power increases are related to the predictability of an upcoming word based on the preceding sentence context, rather than to the integration of the incoming word's semantics into the preceding context. Further, our theta band data are compatible with the notion that theta band synchronization in sentence comprehension might be related to the detection of an error in the language input.

Neural Correlates of Reactivation and Retrieval-Induced Distortion	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; RECONSOLIDATION; SLEEP; CONSEQUENCES; RECOGNITION; RETENTION; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Reactivation of recently acquired information can strengthen memory storage and likely contributes to memory consolidation. Retrieval (generating information about prior events) may improve memory storage because it entails reactivation. Alternatively, retrieval may promote storage of retrieved information, and, if retrieval is inaccurate, subsequent recall could be distorted by the retrieved information. If retrieval modifies memory storage, as hypothesized, neural signals associated with accurate retrieval at that time may be distinct from neural signals associated with the degree of repeated retrieval error evident at some later time. We tested this prediction using a 3-session protocol. During session 1, people learned object-location associations to criterion and completed a cued-recall test in which locations were recalled upon viewing objects. During session 2, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during cued recall for a subset of the associations. During session 3, cued recall was tested for all associations. Retrieval improved storage, in that recall at session 3 was superior for objects tested in session 2 compared with those not tested. Retrieval-induced distortion was revealed in session 3 for those objects tested in session 2, in that those objects were generally placed closer to locations retrieved at session 2 relative to original study locations. EEG analyses revealed positive potentials (400-700 ms) associated with relatively accurate recall at session 2. Memory updating was reflected in positive potentials after 700 ms that differentially predicted the degree to which recall promoted storage of the session-2-retrieved location. These findings demonstrate unique neurocognitive processing whereby memories are updated with information produced during retrieval.

The current studies investigate if body odors also transmit information about individuals being potential partners in more general terms, namely in regards to gender and sexual orientation. In study 1, 14 gay and 14 heterosexual men were presented with body odors obtained from potential partners (gay male and heterosexual female body odors, respectively) and heterosexual male body odor as a control. In study 2.14 lesbian and 14 heterosexual women were presented with lesbian female and heterosexual male body odors representing body odors of potential partners, and heterosexual female body odor as a control. Central nervous processing was analyzed using chemosensory event-related potentials and current source density analysis (64-channel EEG recording). Gay and heterosexual men responded with shorter P2 latencies to the body odors of their preferred sexual partners, and lesbian women responded with shorter P2 latencies to body odors of their preferred gender. In response to heterosexual male body odors, lesbian women displayed the most pronounced P3 amplitude, and distinct neuronal activation in medial frontal and parietal neocortical areas. A similar pattern of neuronal activation was observed in gay men when presented with heterosexual male body odor. Both the early processing advantage (P2) for desirable partners' body odors as well as the enhanced evaluative processing (P3, CSD) of undesirable partners' body odors suggest that human body odors indeed carry information about individuals being potential partners in terms of gender and sexual orientation.

Fractal dimensional features were extracted in order to measure the complexity of temporal dynamics and response onset of auditory evoked potentials of normal hearing and abnormal hearing persons. This study identified a significant potential difference between fractal dimensional values of the normal hearing and abnormal hearing person. The extracted fractal features were then associated to the hearing threshold perception and a neural network model for left and right ears were developed. The classification results in discriminating the left and right ear of normal and abnormal person was reported as 90% and 95% with specificity of 90%, sensitivity of 100%. Since the results were promising, it can be safely adopted in screening the hearing threshold level of a person in clinics.	[Paulraj, M.

In contrast, here, we used the attentional blink paradigm in combination with event-related brain potentials to examine whether the ongoing state of the brain before a stimulus can determine both conscious access and the poststimulus neural events associated with consciousness. Participants were required to detect 2 target letters from digit distractors while their brain activity was being recorded. Trials were classified based on whether the secondcritical target (T2) was detected. We found that T2-detection was predetermined by brain activity prior to the onset of the stimulation stream. Specifically, T2-detected trials were predicated by a frontocentral positive going deflection that started more than 200 ms before the stream began. Accurate T2 detection was also accompanied by enhanced poststimulus neural activity, as reflected by a larger P3b component. Furthermore, prestimulus and poststimulus markers of T2-detection were highly correlated with one another. We therefore argue that conscious experiences are shaped by potentially random fluctuations in neural activity. Overall, the results reveal that conscious access is underpinned by an important relationship involving predictive prestimulus neural activity and responsive poststimulus brain activity.

Previous N200 speller was implemented at the scalp EEG level. Compared to scalp EEG, electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a broader frequency band that could be utilized in BCI. In this study, we investigated whether the high gamma brain activities recorded from human intracranial electrodes can enhance the performance of the subdural speller. The ERP and high gamma responses of one most task-related subdural electrode were used together for BCI classification and showed that high gamma responses did enhance the performance for the subdural visual motion speller resulted in an average increase of over 8% (p<0.05, paired t-test).

Recent studies show that observers can pay attention to an invisible stimulus ( unconscious), and that a stimulus can be clearly seen in the absence of attention. We used a novel psychophysics task to explore the neural correlates of top-down attention and consciousness. Method: The task is meant to confirm that these two processes are independent from one another. EEG were recorded during the task from 45 subjects in occipital, Parietal and frontal lobes. Target-locked ERPs for masked and unmasked condition were constructed. Time features corresponding to P100, 200 and P300 components (i.e. correlate candidates of consciousness and attention) were extracted for all eight channels separately. Results: The results indicate that some of the mentioned components are increased when attention or consciousness occurs. By comparing difference waves in each condition separably, we found that increase in positivity in P100 window is the only ERP correlate of consciousness and decrease in negativity in N100- N200 window and increase in positivity in P300 window are ERP correlates of attention in O1, O2, PO7 and PO8 which are relevant channels. Conclusions: Our task could separate attention and consciousness successfully through their neural correlates. Our results introduce new ERP correlates of attention and consciousness. The results also suggest that these ERP components are meaningful features for the distinction between these two concepts. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these correlates of consciousness and specially attention are introduced in separable method.

Normal control group (N = 14) was also examined. Two EEG examinations were done in each groups: at night and in the next morning. Global and regional (left vs. right, anterior vs. posterior) measures of spatial complexity (Omega complexity) were used to characterize the degree of spatial synchrony of EEG. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to localize generators of EEG activity in separate frequency bands. Before CPAP-treatment, a significantly lower Omega complexity was found globally and over the right hemisphere. Due to CPAP-treatment, these significant differences vanished. Significantly decreased Omega complexity was found in the anterior region after treatment. LORETA showed a decreased activity in all of the beta bands after therapy in the right hippocampus, premotor and temporo-parietal cortex, and bilaterally in the precuneus, paracentral and posterior cingulate cortex. No significant changes were seen in control group. Comparing controls and patients before sleep, an increased alpha2 band activity was seen bilaterally in the precuneus, paracentral and posterior cingulate cortex, while in the morning an increased beta3 band activity in the left precentral and bilateral premotor cortex and a decreased delta band activity in the right temporo-parietal cortex and insula were observed. These findings indicate that effect of sleep on EEG background activity is different in OSAS patients and normal controls. In OSAS patients, significant changes lead to a more normal EEG after a night under CPAP-treatment. Compensatory alterations of brain electrical activity in regions associated with influencing sympathetic outflow, visuospatial abilities, long-term memory and motor performances caused by chronic hypoxia could be reversed by CPAP-therapy.

Dishabituation of laser-evoked EEG responses: dissecting the effect of certain and uncertain changes in stimulus spatial location	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Pain; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Habituation; Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); Novelty	DEVIANT NOCICEPTIVE STIMULI; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CORTICAL NETWORK; PAIN MATRIX; HAIRY SKIN; ATTENTION; HUMANS; HABITUATION; ORIENTATION	The repetition of nociceptive stimuli of identical modality, intensity and location at short (1 s) and constant inter-stimulus interval (ISI) determines a strong habituation of the corresponding electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. To understand what determines this response habituation, we (1) examined the effect of introducing a selective change in the spatial location of the repeated stimulus (i.e., without altering its modality, intensity and timing), and (2) dissected the relative contribution of bottom-up, stimulus-driven spatial changes and top-down, cognitive expectations of such a change. Multichannel EEG was recorded while participants received a triplet of stimuli (S1-S2-S3) delivered to the hand dorsum at 1-s ISI. S3 was delivered either to the same hand as S1 and S2 or to the other hand, and participants were either explicitly informed or not informed of the location of S3. We found that, unlike the introduction of a change in the sensory modality of the repeated stimulus (Valentini et al. in J Cogn Neurosci 23:2822-2837, 2011), introducing a change in its spatial location did not produce a significant dishabituation of the laser-evoked N1, N2 and P2 peaks, but only a small amplitude increase following the P2 peak, maximal on the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated hand. Furthermore, the magnitude of the elicited responses was not significantly affected by cognitive expectations. Altogether, these results indicate that bottom-up, stimulus-driven novelty resulting from a change in stimulus spatial location does not revert the habituation caused by repetition suppression, but determines a small increase of neural activity over the contralateral central-parietal cortex, likely reflecting shifts in spatial attention.

Age effects on the P300 potential and the corresponding fMRI BOLD-signal	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TARGET DETECTION; TIME-COURSE; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; FUNCTIONAL MRI; VISUAL-STIMULI	Age has been reported to influence amplitude and latency of the P300 potential. Nevertheless, it is not yet fully understood which brain regions are responsible for these effects. The aim of this study was to investigate age-effects on the P300 potential and the simultaneously acquired BOLD signal of functional MRI. 32 healthy male subjects were investigated using an auditory oddball paradigm. The functional fMRI data were acquired in temporal synchrony to the task. The evoked potential data were recorded during the intervals in between MR image acquisitions in order to reduce the influence of the scanner noise on the presentation of the tones and to reduce gradient artifacts. The age-effects were calculated by means of regression analyses. In addition, brain regions modulated by the task-induced amplitude variation of the P300 were identified (single trial analysis). The results indicated an age effect on the P300 amplitude. Younger subjects demonstrated increased parietal P300 amplitudes and increased BOLD responses in a network of brain regions including the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, the insula, the temporo-parietal junction, the superior temporal gyrus, the caudate body, the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus. Single trial coupling of EEG and fMRI indicated that P300 amplitudes were predominantly associated with neural response:; in the anterior cingulate cortex, the putamen and temporal brain areas. Taken together, the results indicate diminished neural responses in older compared to younger subjects especially in frontal, temporo-parietal and subcortical brain regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The iFACE was applied to multivariate EEG registrations obtained with single dizygotic twin pairs. The results showed evidence for considerable subject-specificity in heritabilities and environmental effects. The assumption that the population is homogeneous (i.e., that each case in the population obeys the same parametric model), does not hold for these psychophysiological data, and its use should be critically reconsidered. We conclude that the iFACE provides a powerful new methodology to assess heterogeneity (subject-specificity) based on phenotypic observations.	[Smit, Dirk J.

Journal of Neuroscience, 29, 5863-5872, 2009]. Here we combine data from our previous studies to examine whether right parietal TMS during spatial orienting also impairs stimulus-driven reorienting or the ability to efficiently process unattended stimuli, that is, stimuli outside the current focus of attention. Healthy volunteers (n = 24) performed a Posner spatial cueing task while their EEG activity was being monitored. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied for 150 msec simultaneously to the presentation of a central arrow directing spatial attention to the location of an upcoming visual target. Right IPS-rTMS impaired target detection, especially for stimuli presented at unattended locations; it also caused a modulation of the amplitude of parieto-occipital positive ERPs peaking at about 480 msec (P3) post-target. The P3 significantly decreased for unattended targets and significantly increased for attended targets after right IPS-rTMS as compared with sham stimulation. Similar effects were obtained for left IPS stimulation albeit in a smaller group of volunteers. We conclude that disruption of anticipatory processes in right IPS has prolonged effects that persist during target processing. The P3 decrement may reflect interference with postdecision processes that are part of stimulus-driven reorienting. Right IPS is a node of functional interaction between endogenous spatial orienting and stimulus-driven reorienting processes in human vision.

Such motor predictions are critical for inhibitory gating of actions and their consequences. Therefore, it was hypothesized that OCD patients show compromised forward model mechanisms. Methods: To test whether inhibitory gating based on motor predictions is altered in OCD, we used electroencephalography to measure suppression of the N1 component of the event-related potential during active generation and passive observation of visual feedback in 18 OCD patients and 18 healthy control subjects. Predictability of action feedback was manipulated on the basis of action and external cues, and simultaneous agency judgments were assessed. Results: OCD patients showed significantly reduced N1 suppression to actively generated feedback as compared with passively observed feedback. Moreover, in OCD patients, the N1 was not modulated by additional predictive motor cues as observed in control subjects. Patients also reported enhanced estimations of agency experience, which correlated with the strength of incompleteness feelings. Conclusions: OCD patients fail to predict and suppress the sensory consequences of their own actions. The increased mismatch between expected and actual outcomes caused by this forward model dysfunction may explain persistent feelings of incompleteness even after properly executed actions and the augmented search for control in these patients.

The processing of this type of construction gives new insights into the understanding of agreement processes during language comprehension. Here, we contrasted oscillatory brain activity triggered by Unagreement in different EEG bands with those triggered by Standard Agreement and Person Mismatch sentences. In Spectral Power analysis, a similar pattern for Unagreement to that elicited by Person Mismatch was found in lower beta and alpha bands, approximately around 600 ms. This suggests that fast oscillations reflect the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality). In an equivalent time window, the Unagreement condition behaves similarly to the Standard Agreement condition in the theta band, but different from the Person Mismatch condition that shows an enhanced spectral power. In addition, an enhanced phase synchrony in lower beta frequency around 600 ms is associated to standard agreement patterns, while beta-high frequencies at 800 ms characterize processing of Unagreement sentences. These results support the functional dissociation between the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality in fast oscillatory bands) and integration of linguistic material in working memory (reflected by theta oscillations). Successful resolution of an agreement dependency is better reflected in phase synchronizations at beta band. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. EEG was recorded in 10 professional basketball players and 9 professional athletes of individual sports during three sessions. In each session, a different set of visual stimuli were presented: triangles facing left, up, right, or down; four images of a basketball player throwing a ball; four images of a baseball player pitching a baseball. Stimuli consisted of 15 % targets and 85 % of equal numbers of three types of standards. Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by randomized sequences of standards and by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. In all three sessions, reaction times and peak P3b latencies were shorter for predicted targets compared with random targets, the last most informative stimulus of the predictive sequence induced a robust P3b, and N2 amplitude was larger for random targets compared with predicted targets. P3b and N2 peak amplitudes were larger in the professional basketball group in comparison with professional athletes of individual sports, across the three sessions. The findings of this study suggest that local contextual information is processed similarly for abstract and for meaningful images and that professional basketball players seem to allocate more attentional resources in the processing of these visual stimuli.

In this paper, the influence of living environment on the human body was examined as a fundamental study. The elements that compose the living environment include sound, temperature, humidity and light. Among them, the influ-ence of environmental light on biological response was evaluated. Biological reactions stimulated by red, green and blue light were analysed using an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram ( EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). As a result, a significant difference was observed between green and red light in LF/HF, one of the indexes of autonomic nervous system obtained from ECG, in percentage of alpha wave rate ob-tained from EEG and in latent time of P300, one of the event-related potentials, and amplitude of P300 obtained from MEG. In addition, the possibility was suggested that green light induces a rest state whereas red light induces a concentrated state. Based on the results, automated control system of environmental light by biological signal was constructed.

Most often, these stimuli are well above detection threshold and allow the investigator to use self-report or behavioral techniques to evaluate odor effects. There are, however, considerable data demonstrating effects for odor stimuli that are below sensory thresholds or are undetected by subjects. In these cases, self-report is of little use, and brain imaging has been very effective in helping to explain these findings. This paper reviews the problem of low-intensity odors and the application of a wide variety of brain imaging techniques to research on this phenomenon. Finally, a model of undetected odor effects and brain imaging is presented to help simplify the variations in nomenclature that are used to describe this field.

Similar to successful retrieval (i.e., the Know state, K), a TOT commences with strong cue familiarity but involves only partial retrieval of related information. We sought to characterize the cognitive processes and temporal dynamics of these retrieval states and to extend the applicability of previous findings about TOT to the auditory modality. Participants heard 3-sec initial segments of popular songs and were asked to recall their names. EEG was recorded while participants indicated their retrieval state via button press. Stimulus-locked analyses revealed a significant early left fronto-central difference between TOT and K, at 300-550 msec postcue onset. Post hoc analysis revealed that, in this time window, TOT also differed from DK (Don't Know) responses, which themselves were similar to the K responses. This finding indicates that neural processes, which may reflect strategy selection, ease of semantic processing, familiarity-related processes, or conflict monitoring, are indicative of the fate of our knowledge judgments long before we actually execute them.

Temporal dynamics of face selection mechanism in the context of similar and dissimilar faces: ERP evidence for biased competition within the ventral occipito-temporal cortex using ICA	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Biased Competition; Face selection; Visual similarity; N170; N250; ICA	FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; DIRECTED ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUSIFORM GYRUS	This study was designed to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristic of face selection in the context of the Biased Competition (BC) model using electroencephalography (EEG). Pairs of similar (SIM) or dissimilar (DISS) faces were presented simultaneously. Subjects had to attend to one face (ATT) or ignore both faces (IGN). According to the BC account, simultaneously presented faces compete for representation. Spatial attention biases these competitive interactions towards neural processing of the attended face alone. A preceding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study confirmed the validity of BC as selection principle in the occipital face area (OFA) and in the fusiform face area (FFA) (IGN SIM<IGN DISS; ATT SIM = ATT DISS) (Gentile and Jansma, 2010). The directionality of the similarity modulation within the IGN condition was interpreted in line with the assumption that within FFA similar faces are more likely to be encoded by largely overlapping population of neurons, hence leading to a stronger competition. In the present EEG experiment we investigated when neural competition and the bias effect take place. Using independent component analysis (ICA), we focused on face-processing-related components N170 and N250. Whereas we could not find any context-dependent modulation of the N170, we observed a context x task interaction within the N250 time-window. Together, the fMRI and EEG results suggested that faces competed for representation (IGN SIM<IGN DISS) in the N250 time-window within FFA. In addition, at the same latency (250 ms post-stimulus onset) and region of interest (FFA) the data supported the idea that attention solved neural competition in favor of the relevant face (ATT SIM = ATT DISS). We also observed a main effect of attention frontally within the N2b time-window, i.e. about 50 ms later than the attentional bias that solved competitive interactions. Based on these findings, it is plausible to conclude that this frontal activity was not directly involved in the bias control during selection in FFA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Distraction Reduces Both Early and Late Electrocutaneous Stimulus Evoked Potentials	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; distraction; pulse train stimuli; electrocutaneous stimuli; ERPs	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PAIN; BRAIN; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION; MODULATION; RESPONSES; HUMANS; FMRI	Previous electroencephalography studies revealed mixed effects of sustained distraction on early negative and later positive event-related potential components evoked by electrocutaneous stimuli. In our study we further examined the influence of sustained distraction to clarify these discrepancies. Electrocutaneous stimuli of three intensities were delivered in pulse trains to the forearm either while participants attended the stimuli or while they performed a mental-arithmetic or a word-association distraction task. The amplitudes of the N1 and the late P2/P3a components were attenuated during both distraction tasks. These results seem to resolve the debate concerning the attentional modulation of the N1 component. Furthermore, we observed that the amplitude of the late P2/P3a component was strongly affected by stimulus change, in line with the opinion that this component is actually a P3a orienting response. Our study additionally revealed that habituation effects were reflected in lower intensity ratings and reduced amplitudes of the N1 and P3a components. The latter effects were independent of the type of task, which suggests that habituation is unaffected by attention.	[Blom, Jorian H.

In the present study, we examined the novel possibility that induced frontal alpha (i.e., 8-13 Hz), shown to reflect the inhibition and disengagement of task-relevant cortical regions, may be quantified to explore cortical activation that is specifically enhanced during cognitive reappraisal. For this purpose, 44 participants viewed unpleasant and neutral pictures followed by auditory instructions to either continue viewing the picture or reduce their emotional response to the picture by making the picture seem less emotional (i.e., cognitive reappraisal). In line with previous work, unpleasant pictures elicited a larger late positive potential (LPP) than did neutral pictures. Also corroborating previous work, the mid-latency LPP was reduced when pictures were cognitively reappraised. However, the present study showed for the first time that whereas unpleasant pictures elicited higher frontal alpha power bilaterally than did the neutral pictures, frontal alpha power was reduced (indicative of more activation and cognitive control) during cognitive reappraisal of both picture types over the left hemisphere.

Auditory steady state response in the schizophrenia, first-degree relatives, and schizotypal personality disorder	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Auditory steady state potentials; Schizophrenia; Schizotypal personality disorder; First-degree relatives	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GENETIC RISK; GYRUS VOLUME; ABNORMALITIES; P300; SYNCHRONIZATION; ENDOPHENOTYPE; OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; STIMULATION	The power and phase synchronization of the auditory steady state response (ASSR) at 40 Hz stimulation is usually reduced in schizophrenia (SZ). The sensitivity of the 40 Hz ASSR to schizophrenia spectrum phenotypes, such as schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), or to familial risk has been less well characterized. We compared the ASSR of patients with SZ, persons with schizotypal personality disorder, first degree relatives of patients with SZ, and healthy control participants. ASSRs were obtained to 20, 30, 40 and 50 Hz click trains, and assessed using measures of power (mean trial power or MTP) and phase consistency (phase locking factor or PLF). The MTP to 40 Hz stimulation was reduced in relatives, and there was a trend for MTP reduction in SZ. The 40 Hz ASSR was not reduced in SPD participants. PLF did not differ among groups. These data suggest the 40 Hz ASSR is sensitive to familial risk factors associated with schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Parallel to phonemic processing based on auditory signal, visemic processing constitutes a counterpart based on "visemes", the distinctive visual units of speech. Aiming at investigating the neural substrates of visemic processing in a disturbed environment, we carried out a simultaneous fMRI-EEG experiment based on discriminating syllabic minimal pairs involving three phonological contrasts, each bearing on a single phonetic feature characterised by different degrees of visual distinctiveness. The contrasts involved either labialisation of the vowels, or place of articulation or voicing of the consonants. Audiovisual consonant-vowel syllable pairs were presented either with a static facial configuration or with a dynamic display of articulatory movements related to speech production. In the sound-disturbed MRI environment, the significant improvement of syllabic discrimination achieved in the dynamic audiovisual modality, compared to the static audiovisual modality was associated with activation of the occipito-temporal cortex (MT + V5) bilaterally, and of the left premotor cortex. While the former was activated in response to facial movements independently of their relation to speech, the latter was specifically activated by phonological discrimination. During fMRI, significant evoked potential responses to syllabic discrimination were recorded around 150 and 250 ms following the onset of the second stimulus of the pairs, whose amplitude was greater in the dynamic compared to the static audiovisual modality. Our results provide arguments for the involvement of the speech motor cortex in phonological discrimination, and suggest a multimodal representation of speech units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Proverbio, AM				Proverbio, Alice Mado			Tool perception suppresses 10-12 Hz mu rhythm of EEG over the somatosensory area	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG; Object affordance; Mirror neurons; mu rhythm; Mu power	MOTOR IMAGERY; CORTEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; GENERATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; OBJECTS	The perception of tools vs. other objects has been shown to activate the premotor (BA6) and somatosensory cortex (BA3), which neurally represent object affordance related to tool manipulability (Proverbio et al., 2011). The earliest tool/non-tool discrimination is represented by increased anterior negativity (210-270 ms) in response to tools. In this study, we analyzed mu desynchronization with wavelet analysis based on EEG recordings in response to 300 familiar objects vs. tools in 11 participants. The results showed an early 140-175 ms mu desynchronization over centro-parietal sites at approximately 10-12 Hz during tool perception. The surface scalp distribution of mu power is compatible with neural generators located in the somatosensory cortex, but no source analysis was performed. These results support the hypothesis that there is a temporal and functional relationship between the rapid and transient p. suppression over the centro/parietal area and the successive increase in time-locked post-synaptic potentials (ERPs) in regions processing tool motor affordance.

The data is from fMRI, MEG and EEG activity observed about 200 ms after stimulus onset in various attention paradigms and in which the activity is mainly sited in parietal and extra-striate visual areas. Moreover the data arises from neural activity observed before report of a subject's experience occurs. The overall experimental support for the existence of a copy of the attention movement control signal generates, it is suggested, a viable route to explore the relation between this signal and human consciousness, as concluded in the paper.

Characteristics of Evoked Potential Multiple EEG Recordings in Patients with Chronic Pain by Means of Parallel Factor Analysis	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							CO2-LASER STIMULATION	This paper presents an alternative method, called as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) with a continuous wavelet transform, to analyze of brain activity in patients with chronic pain in the time-frequency-channel domain and quantifies differences between chronic pain patients and controls in these domains. The event related multiple EEG recordings of the chronic pain patients and non-pain controls with somatosensory stimuli (pain, random pain, touch, random touch) are analyzed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is applied to describe the effects of aging on the frequency response differences between patients and controls. The results show that the somatosensory cortical responses occurred around 250 ms in both groups. In the frequency domain, the neural response frequency in the pain group (around 4 Hz) was less than that in the control group (around 5.5 Hz) under the somatosensory stimuli. In the channel domain, cortical activation was predominant in the frontal region for the chronic pain group and in the central region for controls. The indices of active ratios were statistical significant between the two groups in the frontal and central regions. These findings demonstrate that the PARAFAC is an interesting method to understanding the pathophysiological characteristics of chronic pain.

Cortical activation to voluntary movement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is related to corticospinal damage: Electrophysiological evidence	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motor neuron disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; EEG; Neurophysiology; DWI; TMS; Cortico-spinal tract	DIFFUSION TENSOR MRI; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR CORTEX INHIBITION; D90A SOD1 ALS; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; BRAIN; PROGRESSION; EEG	Objectives: The time course of mu and beta sensorimotor rhythms, with event-related desynchronisation (ERD) to preparation and execution of voluntary movement followed by synchronisation (ERS) after movement, is considered to indicate cortical activation and idling, respectively. We investigated ERD and ERS in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and the relationship with anatomical and neurophysiological measures of corticospinal tract damage. Methods: Pre-movement mu and beta ERD, and post-movement beta ERS were analysed in 16 ALS patients and 15 healthy controls performing self-paced brisk right thumb extensions. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of corticospinal tract was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to the right abductor pollicis brevis were obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results: Movement-related electromyographic activity was similar in the two groups. Post-movement ERS was significantly reduced in ALS group and negatively correlated with the amount of corticospinal damage as from MRI and TMS measures. ERD did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusions: Alterations of cortical activity in ALS patients were limited to the post-movement phase, as indicated by reduced ERS, and could be linked to reduced cortical inhibition rather than to generalised hyperexcitability. Significance: The correlation between ERS and corticospinal damage severity might be interpreted as a functional compensation or dysfunction of inhibitory systems paralleling corticospinal damage.

Processing of prosodic changes in natural speech stimuli in school-age children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Children; Emotional prosody; Speech; Event-related potentials; Mismatch negativity; Facial electromyography	EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-STIMULI; ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC RESPONSES; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; EMG RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; GENERATORS	Speech prosody conveys information about important aspects of communication: the meaning of the sentence and the emotional state or intention of the speaker. The present study addressed processing of emotional prosodic changes in natural speech stimuli in school-age children (mean age 10 years) by recording the electroencephalogram, facial electromyography, and behavioral responses. The stimulus was a semantically neutral Finnish word uttered with four different emotional connotations: neutral, commanding, sad, and scornful. In the behavioral sound-discrimination task the reaction times were fastest for the commanding stimulus and longest for the scornful stimulus, and faster for the neutral than for the sad stimulus. EEG and EMG responses were measured during non-attentive oddball paradigm. Prosodic changes elicited a negative-going, fronto-centrally distributed neural response peaking at about 500 ms from the onset of the stimulus, followed by a fronto-central positive deflection, peaking at about 740 ms. For the commanding stimulus also a rapid negative deflection peaking at about 290 ms from stimulus onset was elicited. No reliable stimulus type specific rapid facial reactions were found. The results show that prosodic changes in natural speech stimuli activate pre-attentive neural change-detection mechanisms in school-age children. However, the results do not support the suggestion of automaticity of emotion specific facial muscle responses to non-attended emotional speech stimuli in children. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

MT + V5 was activated in response to facial movements independently of their relation to speech, the latter was specifically activated by phonological discrimination. Significant ERP's to syllabic discrimination were recorded around 150 and 250 ms. Our results provide arguments for the involvement of the speech motor cortex in phonological discrimination, and suggest a multimodal representation of speech units.

A late locus of selective attention to natural speech	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						AESPA; EEG; exogenous processing; multi-speaker environments	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SCENE ANALYSIS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; CORTEX; CUES; RESPONSES; MESSAGES; ENVELOPE	Distinguishing between speakers and focusing attention on one speaker in multi-speaker environments is extremely important in everyday life. Exactly how the brain accomplishes this feat and, in particular, the precise temporal dynamics of this attentional deployment are as yet unknown. A long history of behavioral research using dichotic listening paradigms has debated whether selective attention to speech operates at an early stage of processing based on the physical characteristics of the stimulus or at a later stage during semantic processing. With its poor temporal resolution fMRI has contributed little to the debate, while EEGERP paradigms have been hampered by the need to average the EEG in response to discrete stimuli which are superimposed onto ongoing speech. This presents a number of problems, foremost among which is that early attention effects in the form of endogenously generated potentials can be so temporally broad as to mask later attention effects based on the higher level processing of the speech stream. Here we overcome this issue by utilizing the AESPA (auditory evoked spread spectrum analysis) method which allows us to extract temporally detailed responses to two concurrently presented speech streams in natural cocktail-party-like attentional conditions without the need for superimposed probes. We show attentional effects on exogenous stimulus processing in the 200220 ms range in the left hemisphere. We discuss these effects within the context of research on auditory scene analysis and in terms of a flexible locus of attention that can be deployed at a particular processing stage depending on the task.

This contrasts findings of cognitive load compromising a secondary modality's processing. We manipulated cognitive load within one modality (visual) and studied the consequences of cognitive demands on secondary (auditory) processing. 15 healthy participants underwent a simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment. Data from 8 participants were obtained outside the scanner for validation purposes. The primary task (T1) was to respond to a visual working memory (WM) task with four conditions, while the secondary task (T2) consisted of an auditory oddball stream, which participants were asked to ignore. The fMRI results revealed fronto-parietal WM network activations in response to T1 task manipulation. This was accompanied by significantly higher reaction times and lower hit rates with increasing task difficulty which confirmed successful manipulation of WM load. Amplitudes of auditory evoked potentials, representing fundamental auditory processing showed a continuous augmentation which demonstrated a systematic relation to cross-modal cognitive load. With increasing WM load, primary auditory cortices were increasingly deactivated while psychophysiological interaction results suggested the emergence of auditory cortices connectivity with visual WM regions. These results suggest differential effects of crossmodal attention on fundamental auditory processing. We suggest a continuous allocation of resources to brain regions processing primary tasks when challenging the central executive under high cognitive load.

However, an explicit causal influence between the neural generators of P300 and alpha-ERD has not yet been investigated. In the present study, using an oddball task paradigm, we assessed the task effect (target vs. non-target) on P300 and alpha-ERD elicited by stimuli of four sensory modalities, i.e., audition, vision, somatosensory, and pain, estimated their respective neural generators, and investigated the information flow among their neural generators using time-varying effective connectivity in the target condition. Across sensory modalities, the scalp topographies of P300 and alpha-ERD were similar and respectively maximal at parietal and occipital regions in the target condition. Source analysis revealed that P300 and alpha-ERD were mainly generated from posterior cingulate cortex and occipital lobe respectively. As revealed by time-varying effective connectivity, the cortical information was consistently flowed from alpha-ERD sources to P300 sources in the target condition for all four sensory modalities. All these findings showed that P300 in the target condition is modulated by the changes of alpha-ERD, which would be useful to explore neural mechanism of cognitive information processing in the human brain.

Such a system is needed in cases where 24 x 7 monitoring is required, as in older adults with cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The passive monitoring systems used today are useful only in detecting events after they happen; the accuracy and speed of detection is questionable. The noninvasive nature of such systems does not bring trade off benefits to early detection and prevention of emergency incidents. We compare some existing sensor platforms and present our monitoring approach using minimally invasive wearable sensor device(s). With a Minimally Invasive Monitoring Sensor (MIMS), using advanced intelligent systems, we analyze the physiological signal data preceding potential emergency events in order to predict them quickly. The Virtual Hub is the core component of MIMS, which acts as a gateway between a monitored person and her/his caregivers, as well as a shared access point between active and passive sensing devices. Some preliminary results are presented here from our sleep-related fall study using two heterogeneous sensor systems.

Similarly, pictures of faces are likely to activate social affordances, that is, interactions that would be possible with the person whose face is being presented. Most interestingly, if it is the face of a real person that is shown, one particular type of social interactions can even be carried out while event-related potentials (ERPs) are recorded. Indeed, subtle eye movements can be made to achieve an eye contact with the person with minimal artefacts on the EEG. The present study thus used the face of a real person to explore the electrophysiological correlates of affordances in a situation where some of them (i.e., eye contacts) are actually performed. The ERPs this person elicited were compared to those evoked by another 3D stimulus: a real dummy, and thus by a stimulus that should also automatically activate eye contact affordances but with which such affordances could then be inhibited since they cannot be carried out with an object. The photos of the person and of the dummy were used as matching stimuli that should not activate social affordances as strongly as the two 3D stimuli and for which social affordances cannot be carried out. The fronto-central N300s to the real dummy were found of greater amplitudes than those to the photos and to the real person. We propose that these greater N300s index the greater inhibition needed after the stronger activations of affordances induced by this 3D stimulus than by the photos. Such an inhibition would not have occurred in the case of the real person because eye contacts were carried out.	[Debruille, J.

FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; brain-machine interface; steady-state visual evoked potential; SSVEP; motor imagery		Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are communication systems that allow people to send messages or commands without movement. BCIs rely on different types of signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG), typically P300s, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), or event-related desynchronization. Early BCI systems were often evaluated with a selected group of subjects. Also, many articles do not mention data from subjects who performed poorly. These and other factors have made it difficult to estimate how many people could use different BCIs. The present study explored how many subjects could use an SSVEP BCI. We recorded data from 53 subjects while they participated in 1-4 runs that were each 4 min long. During these runs, the subjects focused on one of four LEDs that each flickered at a different frequency. The eight channel EEG data were analyzed with a minimum energy parameter estimation algorithm and classified with linear discriminant analysis into one of the four classes. Online results showed that SSVEP BCIs could provide effective communication for all 53 subjects, resulting in a grand average accuracy of 95.5%. About 96.2% of the subjects reached an accuracy above 80%, and nobody was below 60%. This study showed that SSVEP based BCI systems can reach very high accuracies after only a very short training period. The SSVEP approach worked for all participating subjects, who attained accuracy well above chance level. This is important because it shows that SSVEP BCIs could provide communication for some users when other approaches might not work for them.

During wake-to-drowsy transition they change unevenly, depending on the brain region. To explore their dynamics, we recorded ten adult healthy individuals in these two states. Alpha waves were treated as stable frequency and variable amplitude signals with one carrier frequency (CF). A method for calculating their CF phase shifts (CFPS) and CF phase potentials (CFPP) was developed and verified on surrogate signals as more accurate than phase shifts of Fourier components. Probability density estimate (PDE) of CFPS, CFPP and CF phase locking showed that frontal and fronto-temporal areas of the cortex underwent more extensive changes than posterior regions. The greatest differences were found between pairs of channels involving F7, F8, F3 and F4 (PDE of CFPS); F7, F8. T3 and 14 (CFPP); F7, F8, F3, F4, C3, C4 and T3 (decrease in CF phase locking). A topographic distribution of channels with above the average phase locking in the wake state revealed two separate regions occupying anterior and posterior brain areas (with intra regional and inter hemispheric connections). These regions merged and became mutually phase locked longitudinally in the drowsy state. Changes occurring primarily in the frontal and fronto-temporal regions correlated with an early decrease of alertness. Areas of increased phase locking might be correlated with topography of synchronous neuronal assemblies conceptualized within neural correlates of consciousness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The behavioral significance of coherent resting-state oscillations after stroke	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural networks; Stroke; Neurological deficits; Alpha oscillations; Functional connectivity	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG; PERFORMANCE; AREAS; NETWORKS; MEG	Stroke lesions induce not only loss of local neural function, but disruptions in spatially distributed areas. However, it is unknown whether they affect the synchrony of electrical oscillations in neural networks and if changes in network coherence are associated with neurological deficits. This study assessed these questions in a population of patients with subacute, unilateral, ischemic stroke. Spontaneous cortical oscillations were reconstructed from high-resolution electroencephalograms (EEG) with adaptive spatial filters. Maps of functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas were created and correlated with patient performance in motor and cognitive scores. In comparison to age matched healthy controls, stroke patients showed a selective disruption of FC in the alpha frequency range. The spatial distribution of alpha band FC reflected the pattern of motor and cognitive deficits of the individual patient: network nodes that participate normally in the affected functions showed local decreases in FC with the rest of the brain. Interregional FC in the alpha band, but not in delta, theta, or beta frequencies, was highly correlated with motor and cognitive performance. In contrast, FC between contralesional areas and the rest of the brain was negatively associated with patient performance. Alpha oscillation synchrony at rest is a unique and specific marker of network function and linearly associated with behavioral performance. Maps of alpha synchrony computed from a single resting-state EEG recording provide a robust and convenient window into the functionality and organization of cortical networks with numerous potential applications.

Emergence of a seizure phenotype in aged apolipoprotein epsilon 4 targeted replacement mice	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Apolipoprotein E; Alzheimer; Epilepsy; Seizure; Amyloid beta	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE RELATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; E POLYMORPHISM; POSTTRAUMATIC SEIZURES; RECEPTOR-BINDING; EEG ALTERATIONS; ONSET SEIZURES	The apolipoprotein 64 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with earlier age of onset. The incidence of spontaneous seizures has been reported to be increased in sporadic AD as well as in the early onset autosomal dominant forms of AD. We now report the emergence of a seizure phenotype in aged apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) targeted replacement (TR) mice but not in age-matched apoE2 TR or apoE3-TR mice. Tonic-clonic seizures developed spontaneously after 5 months of age in apoE4 TR mice and are triggered by mild stress. Female mice had increased seizure penetrance compared to male mice, but had slightly reduced overall seizure severity. The majority of seizures were characterized by head and neck jerks, but 25% of aged apoE4 TR mice had more severe tonic-clonic seizures which occasionally progressed to tonic extension and death. Aged apoE4 TR mice progressed through pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure stages more rapidly than did apoE3 TR and apoE2 TR mice. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings revealed more frequent bursts of synchronous theta activity in the hippocampus of apoE4 TR mice than in apoE2 TR or apoE3 TR mice. Cortical EEG recordings also revealed sharp spikes and other abnormalities in apoE4 TR mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the emergence of an age-dependent seizure phenotype in old apoE4 TR mice in the absence of human amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) overexpression, suggesting increased central nervous system neural network excitability.

Spatiotemporal re-organization of large-scale neural assemblies underlies bimanual coordination	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Unimanual; Bimanual; Coordination; Recruitment; Temporal modulation; EEG; MEG; Mode level cognitive subtraction; Event related potentials	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN BRAIN; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PHASE-TRANSITION; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENT; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI	Bimanual coordination engages a distributed network of brain areas, the spatiotemporal organization of which has given rise to intense debates. Do bimanual movements require information processing in the same set of brain areas that are engaged by movements of the individual components (left and right hands)? Or is it necessary that other brain areas are recruited to help in the act of coordination? These two possibilities are often considered as mutually exclusive, with studies yielding support for one or the other depending on techniques and hypotheses. However, as yet there is no account of how the two views may work together dynamically. Using the method of Mode-Level Cognitive Subtraction (MLCS) on high density EEG recorded during unimanual and bimanual movements, we expose spatiotemporal reorganization of large-scale cortical networks during stable inphase and antiphase coordination and transitions between them. During execution of stable bimanual coordination patterns, neural dynamics were dominated by temporal modulation of unimanual networks. At instability and transition, there was evidence for recruitment of additional areas. Our study provides a framework to quantify large-scale network mechanisms underlying complex cognitive tasks often studied with macroscopic neurophysiological recordings. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These techniques encompass both classic and well-known tools (such as EEG and ERPs) as well as more recently developed methods (i.e., MEG, f-NIRS, MRI and f-MRI) which only in the last decade have been applied in infants to shed light on the early interaction between the "nature" and the "nurture," or in other words, between genetics and environment. The purpose of the present work is to review some of the literature regarding neurocognitive development in the light of the achievements reached thanks to recent technical and methodological advancements. In particular, it focuses on the early period of life, using preterm birth as a case that allows the study of the subtle interaction between genetically pre-programmed cortical development and early sensorial experience influence.

Two possible sources can be assumed to determine this alteration in information processing. Women might suffer from deficient top-down control, which makes attentional filters less efficient. On the other hand, higher integration of information presented in close temporal relationship might mimic a deficit in spatial cueing tasks. The latter should be restricted to conditions in which contradicting information is processed. In the present study, participants had to detect changes in luminance and to ignore orientation changes of stimuli that were presented in the fast succession of two visual frames. Women committed more errors when luminance and orientation changes were presented simultaneously at distinct spatial locations (perceptual conflict) compared to men. In no other condition a difference in performance between women and men was observed. Also sensory components of the electroencephalogram showed no sex differences at all. Only posterior components related to intentional allocation of attention in conflict trials appear to be altered in women compared to men. An enhanced N2pc was evoked in women when the perceptual conflict was high. The data provide evidence that neither very early sensory processing nor the top-down control in general is deficient in women. Enhanced distractibility rather arises from a stronger integration of information, which might be due to enhanced interhemispheric information integration in women compared to men.

Prospective control when responding to a looming virtual object approaching on a direct collision course was studied longitudinally in 10 infants aged 5/6 and 12/13 months. Different characteristics of the looming-related visual evoked potential (VEP) responses from infants' brain electrical recordings (EEG) were explored and compared between the infants at these different ages. The aim of this study was to find evidence for infant brain electrical responses coherent with a looming stimulus approaching the infant under three different accelerations. It was also investigated whether the use of different timing strategies to estimate the loom's time-to-collision would produce differences in the EEG recordings. The results showed that the timing and the duration of the VEP responses differed with age. At the age of 5/6 months, infants showed VEP peaks earlier in the looming sequence and VEP responses with longer duration than when they were 12/13 months old. Results from the timing-strategy analysis showed that with age,4 infants shifted from a less efficient timing strategy involving the loom's velocity to the more efficient strategy involving the loom's time-to-collision. Further, it was found that peak VEP activation in the investigated areas propagated across the cortex, showing the highest observed activation in the occipital area at the age of 5/6 months, whereas the parietal area showed the highest activation when the infants were 12/13 months. The decrease in processing time together with a peak VEP response closer to the loom's time-to-collision indicate a developmental trend in infants' prediction of an object's time-to-collision. This developmental trend is further substantiated by the shift from a less efficient to a more efficient timing strategy and by evidence of propagated peak VEP activation towards higher information processing areas in the visual pathway with age. As infants grow older and become more mobile, one of the underlying causes of the developmental trend found in our study could be due to an increase in locomotor experience. More follow-up research is needed to investigate the relation between behavioural development and changes in brain activity associated with infants' perception of looming motion.

These approaches are evaluated from the perspective of electrophysiological studies, which involve multivariate (i.e., spatiotemporal) observations in which source-level signals are picked up to a certain extent by all sensors. Besides formal statistical techniques, there are also techniques that do not involve probability calculations but are very useful in dealing with multivariate data (i.e., verification of data-based predictions, cross-validation, and localizers). Moreover, data-based decision making can also be informed by mechanistic evidence that is provided by the structure in the data.

Prediction errors are theoretical teaching signals which integrate two features of an outcome: its inherent value and prior expectation of its occurrence. To uncover the magnetic signature of prediction errors in the human brain we acquired magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data while participants performed a gambling task. Our primary objective was to use formal criteria, based upon an axiomatic model (Caplin and Dean, 2008a), to determine the presence and timing profile of MEG signals that express prediction errors. We report analyses at the sensor level, implemented in SPM8, time locked to outcome onset. We identified, for the first time, a MEG signature of prediction error, which emerged approximately 320 ms after an outcome and expressed as an interaction between outcome valence and probability. This signal followed earlier, separate signals for outcome valence and probability, which emerged approximately 200 ms after an outcome. Strikingly, the time course of the prediction error signal, as well as the early valence signal, resembled the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN). In simultaneously acquired EEG data we obtained a robust FRN, but the win and loss signals that comprised this difference wave did not comply with the axiomatic model. Our findings motivate an explicit examination of the critical issue of timing embodied in computational models of prediction errors as seen in human electrophysiological data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Electrophysiological correlates of morphosyntactic integration in German phrasal context	LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES			English	Article						Paradigm; Syntactic integration; Parsing; Information theory; Inflectional morphology	GRAMMATICAL GENDER; WORD RECOGNITION; INFLECTED NOUNS; EEG-DATA; AGREEMENT; BRAIN; ERP; NUMBER; ADJECTIVES; SENTENCES	The morphosyntactic paradigm of an inflected word can influence isolated word recognition, but its role in multiple-word phrasal integration is less clear. We examined the electrophysiological response to adjectives in short German prepositional phrases to evaluate whether strong and weak forms of the adjective show a differential response, and whether paradigm variables are related to this response. Twenty native German speakers classified serially presented phrases as grammatically correct or not while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. A functional mixed effects model of the response to grammatically correct trials revealed a differential response to strong and weak forms of the adjectives. This response difference depended on whether the preceding preposition imposed accusative or dative case. The lexically conditioned information content of the adjectives modulated a later interval of the response. The results indicate that grammatical context modulates the response to morphosyntactic information content, and lends support to the role of paradigm structure in integrative phrasal processing.

J	Massol, S				Massol, Stephanie			Orthographic neighborhood effects in masked priming: An ERP investigation	ANNEE PSYCHOLOGIQUE			French	Article							VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; INTERACTIVE-ACTIVATION MODEL; TIME-COURSE; LETTER PERCEPTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LEXICAL DECISION; REPETITION; FREQUENCY; PHONOLOGY; EEG	Two experiments combined masked priming with ERP recordings in order to examine the effects of primes that are orthographic neighbors of target words. Experiment 1 compared effects of repetition primes with effects of primes that were high-frequency orthographic neighbors of low-frequency targets (e.g., four - tour). The prime was presented during 78 ms in a semantic categorization task, and Experiment 2 compared the same word neighbor primes with nonword neighbor primes (e.g., lude - luge). The prime was presented during 48 ms in a lexical decision task. The first observed effect occurred around 250 ms post-target onset suggesting an orthographic sub-lexical processing. At this stage, only the degree of orthographic overlap seems to influence word recognition processing. The second observed effect took place around 300 ms highlighting the lateral inhibition mechanism at the lexical level. This effect continued to the N400 component, reflecting the interactions between levels of representation for whole-words and concepts. The results are discussed with respect to possible mechanisms of lexical competition during visual word recognition.

AN AUDITORY BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE WITH ACCURACY PREDICTION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; auditory; event-related potential; EEG; Bayesian classification; BPSK	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROSTHESIS; REGRESSION; IMAGERY; HUMANS; TASK; TOOL	Fully auditory Brain-computer interfaces based on the dichotic listening task (DL-BCIs) are suited for users unable to do any muscular movement, which includes gazing, exploration or coordination of their eyes looking for inputs in form of feedback, stimulation or visual support. However, one of their disadvantages, in contrast with the visual BCIs, is their lower performance that makes them not adequate in applications that require a high accuracy. To overcome this disadvantage, we employed a Bayesian approach in which the DL-BCI was modeled as a Binary phase shift keying receiver for which the accuracy can be estimated a priori as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The results showed the measured accuracy to match the predefined target accuracy, thus validating this model that made possible to estimate in advance the classification accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. This constitutes a novel methodology in the design of fully auditory DL-BCIs that let us first, define the target accuracy for a specific application and second, classify when the signal-to-noise ratio guarantees that target accuracy.

Theoretical accounts of cognitive control highlight anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central node in this network. However, a better understanding of the relative primacy and functional contributions of these areas to decision conflict requires insight into the neural dynamics of successive processing stages including conflict detection, response selection and execution. Moderate alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive control as it interferes with the ability to inhibit dominant, prepotent responses when they are no longer correct. To examine the effects of moderate intoxication on successive processing stages during cognitive control, spatio-temporal changes in total event-related theta power were measured during Stroop-induced conflict. Healthy social drinkers served as their own controls by participating in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) approach was applied to complex power spectra for theta (4-7 Hz) frequencies. The principal generator of event-related theta power to conflict was estimated to ACC, with contributions from fronto-parietal areas. The ACC was uniquely sensitive to conflict during both early conflict detection, and later response selection and execution stages. Alcohol attenuated theta power to conflict across successive processing stages, suggesting that alcohol-induced deficits in cognitive control may result from theta suppression in the executive network. Slower RTs were associated with attenuated theta power estimated to ACC, indicating that alcohol impairs motor preparation and execution subserved by the ACC. In addition to their relevance for the currently prevailing accounts of cognitive control, our results suggest that alcohol-induced impairment of top-down strategic processing underlies poor self-control and inability to refrain from drinking.

However, neural bases of this rapid learning, which may be an expression of a more general cognitive mechanism likely rooted in plasticity at cellular and synaptic levels, are not yet understood. In this update, the author highlights a selection of recent studies that attempted to trace word learning in the human brain noninvasively. A number of brain areas, most notably in hippocampus and neocortex, appear to take part in word acquisition. Critically, the currently available data not only demonstrate the hippocampal role in rapid encoding followed by slow-rate consolidation of cortical word memory traces but also suggest immediate neocortical involvement in the word memory trace formation. Echoing early behavioral studies in ultra-rapid word learning, the reviewed neuroimaging experiments can be taken to suggest that our brain may effectively form new cortical circuits online, as it gets exposed to novel linguistic patterns in the sensory input.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Changes in Reaction Time Based on Stimulus Intensity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CHOICE-REACTION TIME; SACCADIC REACTION-TIME; MEDIAN NERVE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LATENCY; MOVEMENTS; STIMULATION; TASK; AGE	Background: Although reaction time is commonly used as an indicator of central nervous system integrity, little is currently understood about the mechanisms that determine processing time. In the current study, we are interested in determining the differences in electrophysiological events associated with significant changes in reaction time that could be elicited by changes in stimulus intensity. The primary objective is to assess the effect of increasing stimulus intensity on the latency and amplitude of afferent inputs to the somatosensory cortex, and their relation to reaction time. Methods: Median nerve stimulation was applied to the non-dominant hand of 12 healthy young adults at two different stimulus intensities (HIGH & LOW). Participants were asked to either press a button as fast as possible with their dominant hand or remain quiet following the stimulus. Electroencephalography was used to measure somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and event related potentials (ERPs). Electromyography from the flexor digitorum superficialis of the button-pressing hand was used to assess reaction time. Response time was the time of button press. Results: Reaction time and response time were significantly shorter following the HIGH intensity stimulus compared to the LOW intensity stimulus. There were no differences in SEP (N20 & P24) peak latencies and peak-to-peak amplitude for the two stimulus intensities. ERPs, locked to response time, demonstrated a significantly larger pre-movement negativity to positivity following the HIGH intensity stimulus over the Cz electrode. Discussion: This work demonstrates that rapid reaction times are not attributable to the latency of afferent processing from the stimulated site to the somatosensory cortex, and those latency reductions occur further along the sensorimotor transformation pathway. Evidence from ERPs indicates that frontal planning areas such as the supplementary motor area may play a role in transforming the elevated sensory volley from the somatosensory cortex into a more rapid motor response.

Experiment 1 used a. balanced memory array, with one color stimulus in each hemifield, followed by a retention interval and a central probe, at the fixation point that designated the target stimulus in memory about which to make a determination of orientation. Retrieval of information from VSTM was associated with an event-related lateralization (ERL) with a contralateral negativity relative to the visual field from which the probed stimulus was originally encoded, suggesting a lateralized organization of VSTM. The scalp distribution of the retrieval ERL was more anterior than what is usually associated with simple maintenance activity, which is consistent with the involvement of different brain structures for these distinct visual memory mechanisms. Experiment 2 was like Experiment 1, but used an unbalanced memory array consisting of one lateral color stimulus in a hemifield and one color stimulus on the vertical mid-line. This design enabled us to separate lateralized activity related to target retrieval from distractor processing. Target retrieval was found to generate a negative-going ERL at electrode sites found in Experiment 1, and suggested representations were retrieved from anterior cortical structures. Distractor processing elicited a positive-going ERL at posterior electrodes sites, which could be indicative of a return to baseline of retention activity for the discarded memory of the now-irrelevant stimulus, or an active inhibition mechanism mediating distractor suppression.

By analyzing intracerebrally recorded BP we attempted to demonstrate that the components are electrophysiological correlates of separate operations. The BPs recorded in 42 epilepsy surgery candidates (28 men, 14 women; aged from 18 to 49 years) during self-paced clenching movements of the hand opposite to the explored hemisphere were investigated in the study. Microdeep intracerebral 5 to 15-contact electrodes were used. The averaged curves were calculated from approximately 30 trials in each case. All the records were taken with a binaural reference. The total number of explored brain regions was 235; the event-related premovement potentials were observed in 121 of them. Three types of premovement responses were observed: (i) the BP with both components; (ii) the BP with the early component only; and (iii) the BP with the late component only. The generators of the early one-component BP were demonstrated in two frontal cortical areas (precentral and middle frontal gyri) and in the parietal area known to be involved in action planning and decision making (precuneus). Some structures generating the early one-component BP were activated during movement; the others were without motor responsiveness.

The diagnosis of TBI must be considered in the larger context of neuropsychiatric diagnosis. A major reconceptualization of diagnosis is now underway in which the classical syndrome conceptualization is being discarded. We address the question, what are the implications of this revision of thinking in the specific context of TBI? METHODS: A recent literature on logical structures for neuropsychiatric disorders was reviewed. The symptom pattern of TBI was identified, and a literature survey determined the frequency of these symptom patterns in other disorders and in healthy control populations. RESULTS: The frequency of symptom endorsement in populations without a history of TBI can be equal to endorsement frequencies in populations with a history of mild TBI. In some studies, the frequency of symptom endorsement in healthy controls having no history of head injury actually exceeded the endorsement rates in a comparison group with a history mild TBI. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of this clinical population and their clinical presentations, the absence of a unitary etiology of postinjury deficits, and the complex idiosyncratic time course of the appearance of these deficits argue against the valid implementation of the classical model of diagnosis. In addition, the accepted criteria of diagnostic utility are not satisfied. TBI is not a disease; it is an event. More precisely, TBI is an event or a sequence of events that can, in some instances, lead to a diagnosable neurological or psychiatric disorder. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012;73:S13-S23.

Despite numerous and increasing studies that examine brain's modular organization based on various measures of neural synchrony, it is not known yet how to qualify the employed descriptors in terms of the resulting functional community structure. A methodology is introduced here that facilitates the selection of best synchronization measure based on the comparison between two experimental conditions. Our method is presented using data from a multi-trial ERP paradigm (where the same task is performed in an attentive/passive mode) and in a time-varying exploration set up. The functional interactions are quantified at the level of EEG sensors through descriptors that differ regarding the nature of functional dependencies sought (linear vs. nonlinear) and regarding the specific form of the measures employed (amplitude/phase covariation). The resulting functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) are analyzed with an iterative clustering algorithm, and the emerging modular structures enter an appropriate time-varying discriminant function. Our results show that phase synchrony plays a crucial role in the segregation into distinct functional domains during the attentive condition in the frequency range that includes theta and alpha(1) band (4 - 10 Hz). Finally, by adopting Participation Index (PI), task-specific hub regions can be recognized from the optimally detected functional communities.	[Dimitriadis, S.

The sound of size Crossmodal binding in pitch-size synesthesia: A combined TMS, EEG and psychophysics study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Crossmodal; Synesthesia spectrum; Parietal cortex; TMS; ERP	GRAPHEME-COLOR SYNESTHESIA; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MENTAL REPRESENTATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; SPEECH SOUNDS; HUMAN BRAIN; SYNAESTHESIA	Crossmodal binding usually relies on bottom-up stimulus characteristics such as spatial and temporal correspondence. However, in case of ambiguity the brain has to decide whether to combine or segregate sensory inputs. We hypothesise that widespread, subtle forms of synesthesia provide crossmodal mapping patterns which underlie and influence multisensory perception. Our aim was to investigate if such a mechanism plays a role in the case of pitch-size stimulus combinations. Using a combination of psychophysics and ERPs, we could show that despite violations of spatial correspondence, the brain specifically integrates certain stimulus combinations which are congruent with respect to our hypothesis of pitch-size synesthesia, thereby impairing performance on an auditory spatial localisation task (Ventriloquist effect). Subsequently, we perturbed this process by functionally disrupting a brain area known for its role in multisensory processes, the right intraparietal sulcus, and observed how the Ventriloquist effect was abolished, thereby increasing behavioural performance. Correlating behavioural, TMS and ERP results, we could retrace the origin of the synesthestic pitch-size mappings to a right intraparietal involvement around 250 ms. The results of this combined psychophysics, TMS and ERP study provide evidence for shifting the current viewpoint on synesthesia more towards synesthesia being at the extremity of a spectrum of normal, adaptive perceptual processes, entailing close interplay between the different sensory systems. Our results support this spectrum view of synesthesia by demonstrating that its neural basis crucially depends on normal multisensory processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With this purpose in mind, we noninvasively recorded electroencephalographic signals, using a modified version of the Wisconsin card sorting task, in which feedback processing and task switching could be studied separately. A similar late positive component was observed for the switch and correct feedback signals on the first trials of a series, but feedback-related negativity was observed only for incorrect feedback. Moreover, whereas theta power showed a significant increase after a switch cue and after the first positive feedback of a new series, a selective frontal beta-gamma increase was observed exclusively in the first positive feedback (i.e., after the selection of the new rule). Importantly, for the switch cue, beta-alpha activity was suppressed rather than increased. This clear dissociation between the cue and feedback stimuli in task switching emphasizes the need to accurately study brain oscillatory activity to disentangle the role of different cognitive control processes.

Modern brain computer interfaces provide an alternative to the natural neuronal pathways that are normally used to convey the brain signals/commands to different body parts. Brain computer interfaces use the captured brain signals to automate a particular user action. Before actually using the BCI, a subject needs to be trained accordingly. Training, though beneficial for system usage, appears quite tedious for the paralyzed/Locked-in subjects. Also, as the number of activities that can be automated using BCI increases, the amount of training that needs to be given also increases. Motivated by this fact, we propose a new intelligent BCI system, which require minimum amount of training, to be given to the subject. The proposed system uses P300 brainwaves for subject thought translation. The paper gives a brief study of these P300 waves. Finally, we discuss different factors involved in implementation of such system.

The present study used an electrophysiological approach to investigate whether, contrary to this view, there is integrative processing of consonants and pitch by measuring additivity of changes in the mismatch negativity (MMN) of evoked potentials. The MMN is elicited by discriminable variations occurring in a sequence of repetitive, homogeneous sounds. In the experiment, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants heard frequently sung consonant-vowel syllables and rare stimuli deviating in either consonant identity only, pitch only, or in both dimensions. Every type of deviation elicited a reliable MMN. As expected, the two single-deviant MMNs had similar amplitudes, but that of the double-deviant MMN was also not significantly different from them. This absence of additivity in the double-deviant MMN suggests that consonant and pitch variations are processed, at least at a pre-attentive level, in an integrated rather than independent way. Domain-specificity of consonants may depend on higher-level processes in the hierarchy of speech perception.

A growing body of research has revealed shared risk factors between individuals with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) from the general population and patients with schizophrenia. In particular, adolescents with PLEs have been shown to be at an increased risk for later psychosis. However, to date there has been little information published on electrophysiological correlates of language comprehension in this at-risk group. A 64 channel EEG recorded electrical activity while 37 (16 At-Risk; 21 Controls) participants completed the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS-II) receptive vocabulary task. The P300 component was examined as a function of language comprehension. The at-risk group were impaired behaviourally on receptive language and were characterised by a reduction in P300 amplitude relative to the control group. The results of this study reveal electrophysiological evidence for receptive language deficits in adolescents with PLEs, suggesting that the earliest neurobiological changes underlying psychosis may be apparent in the adolescent period.

The effects of low-frequency magnetic stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs). A figure eight-shaped flat coil was used to stimulate the region over the left or the right supramarginal gyrus, which is considered to be the origin of the P300 component. We examined the effect of rTMS on the latency of the P300 component in 14 healthy individuals by applying 100 magnetic pulses for each stimulus point. Stimulus frequencies were 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 Hz rTMS. The auditory oddball task was used to elicit the P300s before and shortly after rTMS. We found that P300 latencies varied according to the stimulation frequency and the hemisphere of rTMS application. A 1.00 Hz rTMS pulse train over the left supramarginal gyrus shortened the P300 latencies by similar to 15ms at Fz. A 0.5 Hz rTMS pulse train over the left supramarginal gyrus lengthened the P300 latencies by similar to 15ms at Fz. In contrast, 0.75 and 0.25 Hz rTMS pulse trains over the left supramarginal gyrus and 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 Hz rTMS pulse trains over the right supramarginal gyrus did not alter P300 latencies. These results indicate that rTMS frequency affects cognitive processing. We suggest that the effects of rTMS vary according to the activity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, the effects of rTMS over the left supramarginal gyrus are dependent on stimulus frequency. NeuroReport 23:1065-1070 (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health \ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The processing of facial expressions includes both specific neural activation and automatic congruent facial muscle reactions. While a considerable number of studies investigated the processing of emotional faces, few studies specifically focused on facial expressions of pain. Analyses of brain activity and facial responses elicited by the perception of facial pain expressions in contrast to other emotional expressions may unravel the processing specificities of pain-related information in healthy individuals and may contribute to explaining attentional biases in chronic pain patients. In the present study, 23 participants viewed short video clips of neutral, emotional (joy, fear), and painful facial expressions while affective ratings, event-related brain responses, and facial electromyography (Musculus corrugator supercilii, M. orbicularis oculi, M. zygomaticus major, M. levator labii) were recorded. An emotion recognition task indicated that participants accurately decoded all presented facial expressions. Electromyography analysis suggests a distinct pattern of facial response detected in response to happy faces only. However, emotion-modulated late positive potentials revealed a differential processing of pain expressions compared to the other facial expressions, including fear. Moreover, pain faces were rated as most negative and highly arousing. Results suggest a general processing bias in favor of pain expressions. Findings are discussed in light of attentional demands of pain-related information and communicative aspects of pain expressions. (c) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

To shed more light on cortical changes associated with decreases in pain during heightened level of motor preparedness in absence of movement, we decided to analyse the effects of motor readiness on EEG laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) by manipulating the expectancy of motor responses. Noxious laser stimuli were administered to the right hand in absence of any movements during periods associated with either high or no expectancy of motor response (HMRE or NMRE, respectively). Subjects reported greater pain intensity during NMRE than HMRE trials. The N1 component of LEPs, peaking at 141 ms and generated in the contralateral operculo-insular cortex, was larger during HMRE than NMRE periods. The amplitude of the N1 component during NMRE correlated with pain intensity. The P2 component peaked earlier during HMRE (336 +/- 30 ms) than NMRE (356 +/- 29 ms, P<0.05) condition and its amplitude showed statistically significant positive correlation with subjective pain intensity. Results suggest that pain reduction during high motor expectancy may be related to summation of effects of motor readiness and nociceptive processing in operculo-insular cortex. Subjective pain intensity appears to be formed at an early, sensory stage of processing of laser stimulus in the absence of motor task and only later, during the period in which multiple behavioural challenges are evaluated, if motor readiness is heightened.

However, their specific significance and the pathophysiological changes leading to either FRs or IESs remain elusive. The objective of this study was to analyze the conditions in which hyperexcitable networks can generate either IESs or FRs and to reveal shared or distinct mechanisms that underlie both types of events. Methods: This study is the first to comparatively analyze mechanisms that induce either IESs or FRs using an approach that combines computational modeling and experimental data ( in vivo and in vitro). A detailed CA1 hippocampal network model is introduced. A parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which model parameters ( cell related and network related) allow the most accurate simulation of FRs and IESs. Results: Our model indicates that although FRs and IESs share certain common mechanisms ( shifted gamma-aminobutyric acid [ GABA] A reversal potential, altered synaptic transmission), there are also critical differences in terms of number of pyramidal cells involved ( small vs large), spatial distribution of hyperexcitable pyramidal cells ( clustered vs uniform), and firing patterns ( weakly vs highly synchronized). In vitro experiments verified that subtle changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission favor either FRs or IESs, as predicted by the model. Interpretation: This study provides insights into the interpretation of 2 interictal markers observed in intracerebral electroencephalographic data. Depending on the degree and spatiotemporal features of hyperexcitability, not only IESs or FRs are generated but also transitions between both types of events.

Whereas there is a large consensus on the sources of the late part of the LEP waveform (N2 and P2 waves), the relative contribution of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to the early part of the LEP waveform (N1 wave) is still debated. To address this issue we recorded LEPs elicited by the stimulation of four limbs in a large population (n = 35). Early LEP generators were estimated both at single-subject and group level, using three different approaches: distributed source analysis, dipolar source modeling, and probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA). We show that the scalp distribution of the earliest LEP response to hand stimulation was maximal over the central-parietal electrodes contralateral to the stimulated side, while that of the earliest LEP response to foot stimulation was maximal over the central-parietal midline electrodes. Crucially, all three approaches indicated hand and foot Si areas as generators of the earliest LEP response. Altogether, these findings indicate that the earliest part of the scalp response elicited by a selective nociceptive stimulus is largely explained by activity in the contralateral Si, with negligible contribution from the secondary somatosensory cortex (S).

It is clear that patients with chronic pain do not become habituated to the pain; however, little is known about habituation to the inner experience of pain. We investigated the brain mechanisms underlying habituation to the inner experience of pain by using event-related potentials (ERPs), which provide superior temporal resolution, and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), which enables identification of regions of nervous activity. Fifteen healthy subjects participated in this study. The subjects were shown 4 sets of photographic images, with each set shown 30 times. The images included 15 images of a hand subjected to pain (painful condition). The subjects were instructed to imagine themselves in that condition and to imagine the pain they may experience in such a situation (inner experience of pain). Electroencephalography was continuously performed via 128 scalp electrodes mounted on an electrode cap. ERPs were recorded during the inner experience of pain; we also recorded N110 responses for emotional components and P3 responses for cognitive evaluation. To investigate habituation to the inner experience of pain, the mean amplitudes of P3 and NI10 recordings were calculated for the first 2 (early sets) and last 2 (late sets) sets of trials for each painful condition; next, early sets were compared with late sets. We also analyzed the change in nervous activity after habituation to the inner experience of pain by LORETA analysis. The amplitude of central P3 responses was significantly lower for the late image sets than the early image sets of the painful condition. However, the mean amplitude of N110 responses did not significantly change. LORETA analysis of P3 responses showed reduced activity in the left secondary somatosensory area and left posterior insular cortex, indicating that the sensory component of the inner experience of pain was lower in the late sets than in the early sets. During habituation to the inner experience of pain, the P3 response, which is related to cognitive evaluation of this experience, changed, and brain activity, which reveals the sensory component of the inner experience of pain, reduced. Our study suggests that habituation to the inner experience of pain occurs at the point of recognition of the sensory component of pain. We hypothesize that pain recognition necessary for habituation to the inner experience of pain.

Yet estimating functional networks from measured signals is not trivial, especially if the data is non-stationary and noisy as it is often the case with physiological recordings. In this article we propose a method that uses the local rank structure of the data to define functional links in terms of identical rank structures. The method yields temporal sequences of networks which permits to trace the evolution of the functional connectivity during the time course of the observation. We demonstrate the potentials of this approach with model data as well as with experimental data from an electrophysiological study on language processing.

In the present research, we explored the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in memory recognition processes for positive versus negative emotional stimuli when old (target) and new (distractor, either semantically related or unrelated to the target) stimuli were presented. The role of the DLPFC was analysed using an rTMS (repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation) paradigm that induced increased cortical activation of the left DLPFC. The subjects were required to perform a task that consisted of two experimental phases (i.e., an encoding and a recognition phase) in which the targets and the distractors were presented and recognition performance was measured. rTMS stimulation was provided over the left DLPFC during the recognition phase. We found that the rTMS stimulation affected the memory recognition of positive emotional material. Moreover, related and unrelated distractors were discarded better when they were positively valenced, and a more significant effect (i.e., increased performance) was produced in response to related distractors. This result suggests that the activation of the left DLPFC favours the memory recognition of positive emotional information, and that such activation is able to induce a more appropriate selective process to distinguish target from distractor stimuli in the presence of more complex processes (related distractors). The valence model of emotional cue processing may explain this increased performance by demonstrating the distinct role of the left hemisphere in the retrieval of positive emotional information.

Here we show that unattended images of right/left hands elicit a mismatch response when they violate a regularity established by repeated visual presentations of the other hand. In a visual oddball experiment we found mismatch responses to hands with unexpected laterality (e.g. left versus predicted right hand) in the periphery of the visual field. Unexpected left hands were processed predominantly in the contralateral superior parietal cortex, whereas unexpected right hands evoked differential activity in the contralateral superior parietal, ventral premotor, prefrontal and temporal areas, indicating a more elaborate automatic processing of the dominant hand. The amplitude of the differential activity to the right hand correlated with handedness test scores. Our results reveal the continuous monitoring of the left or right identity of hands, which is prerequisite to the ability to automatically transform observed actions into the observer's ego-centric spatial reference frame.

The aim of the present study was to determine how different risk levels are reflected in decision-related ERPs, namely the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300. Materials and Methods: Twenty participants conducted a probabilistic two-choice gambling task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Choices were provided between a low-risk option yielding low rewards and low losses and a high-risk option yielding high rewards and high losses. While options differed in expected risks, they were equal in expected values and in feedback probabilities. Results: At the behavioral level, participants were generally risk-averse but modulated their risk-taking behavior according to reward history. An early positivity (P200) was enhanced on negative feedbacks in high-risk compared to low-risk choices. With regard to the FRN, there were significant amplitude differences between positive and negative feedbacks on high-risk choices, but not on low-risk choices. While the FRN on negative feedbacks did not vary with decision riskiness, reduced amplitudes were found for positive feedbacks in high-risk relative to low-risk choices. P300 amplitudes were larger in high-risk decisions, and in an additive way, after negative compared to positive feedback. Discussion: The present study revealed significant influences of risk and valence processing on ERPs. FRN findings suggest that the reward prediction error signal is increased after high-risk decisions. The increased P200 on negative feedback in risky decisions suggests that large negative prediction errors are already processed in the P200 time range. The later P300 amplitude is sensitive to feedback valence as well as to the risk associated with a decision. Thus, the P300 carries additional information for reward processing, mainly the enhanced motivational significance of risky decisions.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the processing of abstract vs. concrete words differently affected the timing and topographical distribution of ERP components. Participants were engaged in a lexical decision task (word/non-word discrimination) while EEG was recorded from 128 scalp sites. Reaction times (RTs) to words were faster than RTs to pseudowords. Words were discriminated from pseudowords since larger N2 responses to words than to pseudowords were observed over the left occipito-temporal areas at 300 ms post-stimulus. Concrete words and abstract words were discriminated as early as 350 ms post-stimulus, with larger responses to concrete than to abstract words over the mesial occipital regions. Concreteness-related ERP differences were also observed in the amplitudes of the later anterior LP component (between 370 and 570 ms), with larger responses to abstract words than to concrete words. The LORETA source localization technique was also applied to identify the intra-cranial generators of surface potentials reflecting lexico-semantic processing. Results showed that words (both abstract and concrete) were associated with a stronger activation of the left fusiform gyrus and the left temporal cortex, as compared to pseudowords. Concrete word processing was associated with a stronger activation of the left extrastriate visual areas (namely BA 18 and BA 19) as compared to abstract word processing. By revealing the neural markers of the concreteness effect, our study contributes to the understanding of the neurogenesis of verbal semantic knowledge impairments and the incidence of these impairments in clinical populations.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of cognitive control processes in an auditory Stroop task	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Auditory; Stroop; Conflict; EEG; Incongruency	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; WORD INTERFERENCE; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CONTROL MECHANISMS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI	The electrophysiological correlates of conflict processing and cognitive control have been well characterized for the visual modality in paradigms such as the Stroop task. Much less is known about corresponding processes in the auditory modality. Here, electroencephalographic recordings of brain activity were measured during an auditory Stroop task, using three different forms of behavioral response (overt verbal, covert verbal, and manual), that closely paralleled our previous visual Stroop study. As was expected, behavioral responses were slower and less accurate for incongruent than for congruent trials. Neurally, incongruent trials showed an enhanced fronto-central negative polarity wave (N-inc), similar to the N450 in visual Stroop tasks, with similar variations as a function of behavioral response mode, but peaking similar to 150 ms earlier, followed by an enhanced positive posterior wave. In addition, sequential behavioral and neural effects were observed that supported the conflict-monitoring and cognitive adjustment hypothesis. Thus, while some aspects of the conflict detection processes, such as timing, may be modality dependent, the general mechanisms would appear to be supramodal.

High-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Electrocorticography; ECoG; High gamma; Functional mapping; Oscillations; Gamma	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC GAMMA ACTIVITY; DEPTH-RECORDED POTENTIALS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED CAUSALITY; OSCILLATIONS 100-500 HZ; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY	Human intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are primarily performed in epileptic patients for presurgical mapping. When patients perform cognitive tasks, iEEG signals reveal high-frequency neural activities (HFAs, between around 40 Hz and 150 Hz) with exquisite anatomical, functional and temporal specificity. Such HFAs were originally interpreted in the context of perceptual or motor binding, in line with animal studies on gamma-band ('40 Hz') neural synchronization. Today, our understanding of HFA has evolved into a more general index of cortical processing: task-induced HFA reveals, with excellent spatial and time resolution, the participation of local neural ensembles in the task-at-hand, and perhaps the neural communication mechanisms allowing them to do so. This review promotes the claim that studying HFA with iEEG provides insights into the neural bases of cognition that cannot be derived as easily from other approaches, such as fMRI. We provide a series of examples supporting that claim, drawn from studies on memory, language and default-mode networks, and successful attempts of real-time functional mapping. These examples are followed by several guidelines for HFA research, intended for new groups interested by this approach. Overall, iEEG research on HFA should play an increasing role in cognitive neuroscience in humans, because it can be explicitly linked to basic research in animals. We conclude by discussing the future evolution of this field, which might expand that role even further, for instance through the use of multi-scale electrodes and the fusion of iEEG with MEG and fMRI.

Here we demonstrate that processing in early visual areas goes beyond feature detection by showing that neural responses are greater when a feature deviates from its context compared to when it does not deviate from its context. Using psychophysics, fMRI, and electroencephalography methodologies, we measured neural responses to an oriented Gabor ("target") embedded in various visual patterns as defined by the relative orientation of flanking stimuli. We first show using psychophysical contrast adaptation and fMRI that a target that differs from its context results in more neural activity compared to a target that is contained within an alternating sequence, suggesting that neurons in early visual cortex are sensitive to large-scale orientation patterns. Next, we use event-related potentials to show that orientation deviations affect the earliest sensory components of the target response. Finally, we use forced-choice classification of "noise" stimuli to show that we are more likely to "see" orientations that deviate from the context. Our results suggest that early visual cortex is sensitive to global patterns in images in a way that is markedly different from the predictions of standard models of cortical visual processing.

K-complexes are not preferentially evoked to combat sounds in combat-exposed Vietnam veterans with and without post-traumatic stress disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						K-complex; PTSD	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; PTSD; EEG; TRANSITION; COMPONENTS; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	The primary objective was to compare the evoked K-complex response to salient versus non-salient auditory stimuli in combat-exposed Vietnam veterans with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Three categories of auditory stimuli (standard 1000 Hz tones, trauma-related combat sounds, and affectively neutral environmental sounds) were presented during stage 2 sleep utilizing an oddball paradigm with probabilities of occurrence of 60%, 20% and 20% respectively. Twenty-four combat-exposed Vietnam veterans, 14 with PTSD and 10 without PTSD were studied in a sleep laboratory at the National Center for PTSD in Menlo Park, CA. While significantly fewer K-complexes overall were elicited in patients, there were no differences in the proportion of K-complexes elicited by tones and combat stimuli within either group. Patients produced significantly more K-complexes to neutral stimuli than to tone or combat stimuli. Examination of the N550 component of the evoked K-complex revealed significantly longer latencies in the patient group. Across the entire sample, N550 latencies were longer for combat stimuli relative to tone neutral stimuli. There were no group or stimulus category differences for N550 amplitude. The results suggest that salient information, as defined by trauma-related combat sounds, did not preferentially elicit K-complexes in either the PTSD group or the control group, suggesting that K-complexes function to protect sleep more than to endogenously process meaningful stimuli.

Keeping focused: Sustained spatial selective visual attention is maintained in healthy old age	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustained selective attention; Spatial visual attention; Aging; EEG; SSVEP; Visual cortex	TOP-DOWN SUPPRESSION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STEADY-STATE; INHIBITORY CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; LOCATION; BRAIN; SPECIALIZATION; DISTRACTION; SPOTLIGHT	A better understanding of age-related change in the attentional modulation of perceptual processing may help elucidate cognitive change. For example, increased cognitive interference due to inappropriate processing of irrelevant information has been suggested to contribute to cognitive decline. However, it is not yet clear whether interference effects observed at later stages, such as executive function or response selection, are caused by leaky attentional selection at early, sensory stages of processing. Here, we investigated attentional control of sensory selection by comparing younger and older adults' ability to sustain spatial selective attention to one of two centrally presented, overlapping rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) letter sequences, one large and one small. These stimuli elicited separable steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), which provide an index of early visual processing for each stimulus separately and are known to be modulated by selective attention. The condition of most interest required participants to attend to the larger letters while ignoring the smaller letters, as these foveally presented irrelevant stimuli were expected to present the strongest interference. Although the rapid presentation rates made the task demanding, detection ability did not differ between young and older adults. Accordingly, attentional modulation of SSVEP amplitudes was found in both age groups. Neither the magnitude nor the cortical sources of these SSVEP attention effects differed between age groups. Our results thus suggest that in the current task, the effect of voluntary spatial attention on sustained sensory processing in early visual areas is maintained in healthy old age.

Navigated rTMS for the treatment of tinnitus: A pilot study with assessment by fMRI and AEPs	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Auditory evoked potentials; Electroencephalography; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Neuronavigation; Plasticity; Tinnitus; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INDUCED HEARING-LOSS; LOW-FREQUENCY RTMS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; LATERALIZED TINNITUS; INTRACTABLE TINNITUS; LIMBIC SYSTEM; DOUBLE-BLIND	Objective. - Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of auditory cortex has been proposed to treat refractory chronic tinnitus, but the involved mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of rTMS on auditory cortex activity in a series of tinnitus patients, using for the first time both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Method. - In six patients with chronic, lateralized refractory tinnitus, we performed five sessions of neuronavigated rTMS delivered at 1 Hz over the secondary auditory cortex (defined on morphological MRI), contralateral to tinnitus side. The effects of rTMS were assessed on clinical scales, fMRI, and AEPs (Ni and P2 components). Results. - The clinical impact of rTMS on tinnitus was good for three patients (25-50% improvement of tinnitus severity compared to baseline), moderate for two patients (15% improvement), and null for one patient who had the most severe tinnitus at baseline. The changes induced by rTMS on fMRI data varied with the baseline level of auditory cortex activation before rTMS. This baseline level of activation was itself related to the severity of tinnitus. Thus, cortical stimulation increased auditory cortex activation in patients who had less severe tinnitus and low level of activation before rTMS, whereas it decreased auditory cortex activation in patients who had more severe tinnitus and higher level of activation before rTMS. Regarding AEPs, rTMS decreased Ni amplitude in all patients, except in the patient who had the most severe tinnitus at baseline and showed no improvement after rTMS. Conversely, P2 amplitude decreased after rTMS only in patients with severe tinnitus, at least for auditory stimulation contralateral to tinnitus, but increased in patients with less severe tinnitus. Conclusions. - The changes produced by rTMS in auditory cortex activity, as assessed by fMRI and AEPs, appeared to depend on a process of disease-related homeostatic cortical plasticity, regardless of the therapeutic impact of rTMS on tinnitus.

Towards the Time Varying Estimation of Complex Brain Connectivity Networks by means of a General Linear Kalman Filter Approach	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MODELS	One of the main limitations of the brain functional connectivity estimation methods based on Autoregressive Modeling, like the Granger Causality family of estimators, is the hypothesis that only stationary signals can be included in the estimation process. This hypothesis precludes the analysis of transients which often contain important information about the neural processes of interest. On the other hand, previous techniques developed for overcoming this limitation are affected by problems linked to the dimension of the multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR), which prevents from analysing complex networks like those at the basis of most cognitive functions in the brain. The General Linear Kalman Filter (GLKF) approach to the estimation of adaptive MVARs was recently introduced to deal with a high number of time series (up to 60) in a full multivariate analysis. In this work we evaluated the performances of this new method in terms of estimation quality and adaptation speed, by means of a simulation study in which specific factors of interest were systematically varied in the signal generation to investigate their effect on the method performances. The method was then applied to high density EEG data related to an imaginative task. The results confirmed the possibility to use this approach to study complex connectivity networks in a full multivariate and adaptive fashion, thus opening the way to an effective estimation of complex brain connectivity networks.

They have recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from subjects viewing four types of arrows: "up arrow", "down arrow", "<-" and "->" that were presented on a CRT. The arrows denote direction for upward, downward, leftward and rightward, respectively. Subjects were asked to read them silently. EEGs were averaged for each stimulus type and direction, and event related potentials (ERPs) were obtained. The equivalent current dipole source localization (ECDL) method has been applied to these ERPs. In both cases, ECDs were localized to areas related to the working memory for spatial perception, i.e. the right upper or the right middle frontal areas. And the opposite directional arrows had opposite dipoles in these areas. Taking into account these facts, the authors investigated a single trial EEGs of the subject precisely after the latency at 400ms, and determined effective sampling latencies for the discriminant analysis to four types of arrows. We sampled EEG data at latencies from 400ms to 900ms at 25ms intervals by the four channels such as Fp2, F4, C4 and F8. Data were resampled -1ms and -2ms backward. Results of the discriminant analysis with jack knife method for four types objective variates, the mean discriminant rate for seven sample subjects was almost 85 %.

Perceptual Echoes at 10 Hz in the Human Brain	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; AUGMENTING RESPONSES; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN EEG; CORTEX; FLICKER; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; STATE	The occipital alpha rhythm (similar to 10 Hz) is the most prominent electrophysiological activity in the awake human brain [1], yet its functional role [2-4] and relation to visual perception [5] are little understood. Transient stimuli normally elicit a short series of positive and negative deflections lasting between 300 and 500 ms [6-8]: the visual-evoked potential (VEP). Alpha oscillations, on the other hand, are generally suppressed by transient visual input [1, 8]; they only augment in response to periodic ("steady-state") inputs around 10 Hz [9, 10]. Here, we applied reverse-correlation techniques to the visual presentation of random, nonperiodic dynamic stimulation sequences and found that the brain response to each stimulus transient was not merely a short-lived VEP but also included a strong similar to 10 Hz oscillation that lasted for more than 1 s. In other words, the alpha rhythm implements an "echo" or reverberation of the input sequence. These echoes are correlated in magnitude and frequency with the observer's occipital alpha rhythm, are enhanced by visual attention, and can be rendered perceptually apparent in the form of similar to 10 Hz flicker. These findings suggest a role for the alpha rhythm in the maintenance of sensory representations over time.

According to recent evidence (Rossion and Boremanse, 2011), this face-related SSVEP is largely reduced in amplitude when the exact same face is repeated at every stimulation cycle as compared to the presentation of different individual faces. Here this SSVEP individual face repetition effect was tested in 20 participants stimulated with faces at a 4 Hz rate for 84 s, in 4 conditions: faces upright or inverted, normal or contrast-reversed (2 x 2 design). To study the temporal dynamics of this effect, all stimulation sequences started with 15 s of identical faces, after which, in half of the sequences, different faces were introduced. A larger response to different than identical faces at the fundamental (4 Hz) and second harmonic (8 Hz) components was observed for upright faces over the right occipito-temporal cortex. Weaker effects were found for inverted and contrast-reversed faces, two stimulus manipulations that are known to greatly affect the perception of facial identity. Addition of the two manipulations further decreased the effect. The phase of the fundamental frequency SSVEP response was delayed for inverted and contrast-reversed faces, to the same extent as the latency delay observed at the peak of the face-sensitive N170 component observed at stimulation sequence onset. Time-course analysis of the entire sequence of stimulation showed an immediate increase of 4 Hz amplitude at the onset (16th second) of different face presentation, indicating a fast, large and frequency-specific release to individual face adaptation in the human brain. Altogether, these observations increase our understanding of the characteristics of the human steady-state face potential response and provide further support for the interest of this approach in the study of the neurofunctional mechanisms of face perception.

Nicotine and the hallucinating brain: Effects on mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizophrenia	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						MMN; Mismatch negativity; Schizophrenia; Auditory hallucinations; Nicotine; Tobacco; Auditory event-related potentials	AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; HEALTHY NONSMOKERS; WORKING-MEMORY; SMOKERS; GENERATION; DEPENDENCE; ATTENTION; INTENSITY	Elevated smoking rates have been noted in schizophrenia, and it has been hypothetically attributed to nicotine's ameliorating abnormal brain processes in this illness. There is some preliminary evidence that nicotine may alter pre-attentive auditory change detection, as indexed by the EEG-derived mismatch negativity (MMN), but no previous study has examined what role auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) may have on these effects. The objective of this study was to examine MMN-indexed acoustic change detection in schizophrenia (SZ) following nicotine administration and elucidate its association with AVH. Using a modified multi-feature paradigm, MMNs to duration, frequency and intensity deviants were recorded in 12 schizophrenia outpatients (SZ) with persistent AVHs following nicotine (6 mg) and placebo administration. Electrical activity was recorded from 32 scalp electrodes; MMN amplitudes and latencies for each deviant were compared between treatments and were correlated with trait (PSYRATS) and state measures of AVH severity and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ratings. Nicotine administration resulted in a shortened latency for intensity MMN. Additionally, nicotine-related change in MMN amplitude was correlated with nicotine-related change in subjective measures of hallucinatory state. In summary, nicotine did not affect MMN amplitudes in schizophrenia patients with persistent AVHs, however this study reports accelerated auditory change detection to intensity deviants with nicotine in this group. Additionally, nicotine appeared to induce a generalized activation of the auditory cortex in schizophrenia, resulting in a concurrent increase in intensity MMN amplitude and subjective clarity of AVHs.

However, by using classic oddball paradigms, differential responses to regularity violations of simple auditory features have been found at the level of the middle latency response (MLR) of the AEP occurring within the first 50 ms after stimulus (deviation) onset. These findings suggest the existence of fast deviance detection mechanisms for simple feature changes, but it is not clear whether deviance detection among more complex acoustic regularities could be observed at such early latencies. To test this, we examined the pre-attentive processing of rare stimulus repetitions in a sequence of tones alternating in frequency in both long and middle latency ranges. Additionally, we introduced occasional changes in the interaural time difference (ITD), so that a simple-feature regularity could be examined in the same paradigm. MMN was obtained for both repetition and ITD deviants, occurring at 150 ms and 100 ms after stimulus onset respectively. At the level of the MLR, a difference was observed between standards and ITD deviants at the Na component (20-30 ms after stimulus onset), for 800 Hz tones, but not for repetition deviants. These findings suggest that detection mechanisms for deviants to simple regularities, but not to more complex regularities, are already activated in the MLR range, supporting the view that the auditory deviance detection system is organized in a hierarchical manner.

In the oddball paradigm, the auditory system detects the sameness (or no-variability) rule when the same reference tone is consistently repeated. We used two oddball protocols, the classical one with a fixed reference and a modified one with a jittered reference, to determine whether the auditory system can detect subthreshold violations of sameness. We found that the response to the repeated standard was not modified by the small jitter. However, the response to the frequency oddball was smaller under the jittered protocol, indicating hypersensitivity to sameness. The sensitivity to jitter was largest when the oddball deviated by 8%, was smaller for 40%, and disappeared at 100% deviation, indicating that sensitivity to sameness is context dependent; namely, it is scaled with respect to the overall range of stimuli.

Response activation impairments in schizophrenia: Evidence from the lateralized readiness potential	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Response preparation; Lateralized readiness potential; LRP; Compatibility; EEG; ERP	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LATENCY DIFFERENCES; ATTENTION; MOTOR; RISK; DYSFUNCTION; DEFICITS; SEARCH; ONSET; TASK	Previous research has demonstrated deficits in preresponse motor activity in schizophrenia, as evidenced by a reduced lateralized readiness potential (LRP). The LRP deficit could be due to increased activation of the incorrect response (e.g., failure to suppress competition) or to reduced activation of the correct response (e.g., a low-level impairment in response preparation). To distinguish these possibilities, we asked whether the LRP impairment is increased under conditions of strong response competition. We manipulated the compatibility of stimulus-response mappings (Experiment 1) and the compatibility of the target with flankers (Experiment 2). In both experiments, the patient LRP was reduced as much under conditions of low response competition as under high competition. These results are incompatible with a failure of patients to suppress competition and are instead consistent with a deficit in activating the correct response.

The monitoring of errors as reflected in the error negativity (Ne) has been claimed to be an important source for behavioral adaptation. The corresponding process of controlling correct responses is less evaluated. Recent studies on post-behavior negativities implicate a common response monitoring system for both behavioral outcomes. Specifically, it has been suggested that negative potentials following correct responses may be a correlate of response expectancy, evaluating congruences in the absence of behavioral errors. This notion was tested in a simple spatial cueing task. An inhibition of return (IOR) paradigm was utilized and the response-related ERP (Ne-like) was tested in a task with hardly any response errors. The results show that the Ne-like is sensitive to already very basic cue-target relations and the IOR effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We also showed that correct objective performance in the absence of subjective awareness is associated with a spatially more restricted modulation of the P3. The relatively late occurrence of the P3 along with lack of control for post-perceptual processes suggests that this component might reflect processes related to stimulus evaluation or confidence rather than to visual awareness or objective performance. The main aim of the current study was to test this hypothesis. While EEG was recorded, participants performed a forced-choice localization task and reported their subjective perception of the target on a 3-level scale that also indexed their confidence. The results showed that our previous findings are replicated when confidence is controlled for. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates the electrophysiological correlates of action-related modulations of selection mechanisms in visual perception. A paradigm combining a visual search task for size and luminance targets with a movement task (grasping or pointing) was introduced, and the EEG was recorded while participants were performing the tasks. The results showed that the behavioral congruency effects, i.e., better performance in congruent (relative to incongruent) action-perception trials have been reflected by a modulation of the P1 component as well as the N2pc (an ERP marker of spatial attention). These results support the argumentation that action planning modulates already early perceptual processing and attention mechanisms.

The functional coupling of neural and cardiac responses following feedback (cortico-cardiac connectivity) is not well understood. While linear time-lagged within-subjects correlations of single-trial EEG and HP (cardio-electroencephalographic covariance tracing, CECT) indicate a robust negative coupling of EEG magnitude 300 ms after presentation of an external feedback stimulus with subsequent alterations of heart period (the so-called N300H phenomenon), the neurotransmitter systems underlying feedback-evoked cortico-cardiac connectivity are largely unknown. Because it has been shown that acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), attenuating brain serotonin (5-HT), decreases cardiac but not neural correlates of feedback processing, we hypothesized that 5-HT may be involved in feedback-evoked cortico-cardiac connectivity. In a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over design, 12 healthy male participants received a tryptophan-free amino-acid drink at one session (TRP-) and a balanced amino-acid control-drink (TRP+) on another and twice performed a time-estimation task with feedback presented after each trial. N300H magnitude and plasma tryptophan levels were assessed. Results indicated a robust N300H after TRP+, which was significantly attenuated following TRP-. Moreover, plasma tryptophan levels during TRP+ were correlated with N300H amplitude such that individuals with lower tryptophan levels showed reduced N300H. Together, these findings indicate that 5-HT is important for feedback-induced covariation of cortical and cardiac activity. Because individual differences in anxiety have previously been linked to 5-HT, cortico-cardiac coupling and feedback processing, the present findings may be particularly relevant for futures studies on the relationship between 5-HT and anxiety.

Electrophysiological markers of the motivational salience of delay imposition and escape	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Delay aversion; ADHD; Event-related potential; CNV; LPP	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DUAL PATHWAY MODEL; COGNITIVE CONTROL; REWARD ANTICIPATION; IMPULSIVE CHOICE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; MONETARY REWARD; IMMEDIATE	Background: The ubiquitous tendency to choose immediate over delayed rewards can, in extremis, lead to maladaptive preferences for smaller sooner over larger later rewards (i.e., impulsive choice) in certain pathological groups. The delay aversion hypothesis provides one possible account of impulsive choice and argues that this tendency is motivated by the avoidance of the negative affective states associated with delay imposed prior to the delivery of a large reward. This model also predicts that on non-choice tasks individuals will be motivated to work harder and more efficiently, when given the opportunity to avoid delay. In the current paper we studied the neural markers of the motivational salience of the imposition and escape from delay using a simple reaction time task under two conditions: First where fast responses were expected to lead to delay escape and second where delay was inescapable. Methods: Forty participants performed the Escape Delay Incentive (EDI) task during which they were asked to respond as quickly as they could to a target stimulus. The EDI task included two conditions: first, a Delay Escape condition where fast responses led to the avoidance of delay and a Delay No-Escape condition in which a delay was presented on every trial irrespective of response speed. EEG was recorded from 66 equidistant electrode sites across the scalp. The neural response in these two conditions was compared in terms of contingent negative variation (CNV; preparation of motivated responses) and late positive potential, LPP: evaluation of performance feedback). Results: As predicted individuals responded more quickly and showed enhanced CNV amplitude to Delay Escape compared with Delay No-Escape trials. Enhanced LPP amplitude was also observed when participants were not able to avoid the delay in the Delay Escape condition. ADHD symptoms were associated with larger CNV differences between Delay Escape and Delay No-Escape conditions. An association between ADHD symptoms and the LPP in the Delay Escape condition did not reach significance. Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that delay escape is a potent reinforcer at both behavioural and neural levels. Future research should extend this analysis to clinical samples using a broader range of delays and across imaging modalities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2pc is a negative EEG potential peaking 250 ms after stimulus onset, recorded from posterior sites contralateral to relevant stimuli. Additional deflections preceding or following N2pc have been obtained in previous studies, possibly produced by specific stimulus features or specific prime-target sequences. To clarify the entire time-course of the contralateral-ipsilateral (C-I) difference recorded from the scalp above visual cortex in response to left-right pairs of targets and distracters, C-I differences were here compared between two types of stimuli and between stimuli that were or were not preceded by masked neutral primes. The C-I difference waveform consisted of several peaks, termed here P1pc (60-100 ms after target onset), N1pc (120-160 ms), N2pc (220-280 ms), and N3pc (360-400 ms). Being markedly enhanced when stimuli were preceded by the neutral primes, P1pc may indicate a response to stimulus change. Also, when stimuli were primed, N2pc reached its peak earlier, thereby tending to merge with N1pc. N3pc seemed to increase when target discrimination was difficult. N1pc, N2pc, and N3pc appear as three periods of one process. N3pc probably corresponds to L400 or SPCN as described in other studies. These observations suggest that the neurophysiological basis of stimulus-driven focusing of attention on target stimuli is a process that lasts for hundreds of milliseconds, with the relevant hemisphere being activated in an oscillating manner as long as required by the task.

We examined whether mismatch negativity (MMN) could help to identify those who are particularly likely to make a transition to psychosis. Method: 41 cases meeting PACE criteria for the At Risk Mental State (ARMS) and 50 controls performed a duration-deviant passive auditory oddball task whilst their electroencephalogram was recorded. The amplitude of the MMN wave was compared between groups using linear regression. The ARMS subjects were then followed for 2 years to determine their clinical outcome. Results: The MMN amplitude was significantly reduced in the ARMS group compared to controls. Of the at-risk subjects who completed followed up (n=41), ten (24% of baseline sample) subsequently developed psychosis. The MMN amplitude in this subgroup was significantly smaller across all three recording sites (FZ, F3 and F4) than in the ARMS individuals who did not become psychotic. Conclusion: Among those with the ARMS, MMN amplitude reduction is associated with an increased likelihood of developing frank psychosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Basar, E				Basar, Erol			Multiple Oscillations and Phase Locking in Human Gamma Responses: An Essay in Search of Eigenvalues	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						oscillation; phase locking; human gamma responses; eigenvalues	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; ELECTRICAL SIGNALS; AUDITORY PATHWAY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; EEG-ACTIVITY; BRAIN; DYNAMICS	This report describes a new strategy to analyze and interpret the fine structure of the human brain's gamma oscillations between the frequency ranges of 28 to 48 Hz. There are at least 3-4 phase/time-locked gamma responses within the 28-45-Hz frequency window. Late responses starting around 300 ms are probably responses that are conveyed over reticular formation, hippocampus, etc., whereas the early response in the primary occipital cortex O1 starting at 100 ms is most probably the direct response over the short pathway over lateral geniculate nucleus. Eigenvalues or nodes: It is remarkable that nodes or Eigenvalues are observed, despite the complexity of the pathways and the superposition of several oscillations. It appears that the event-related oscillations in the gamma band undergo an increasing frequency modulation. The time course in the first 200 ms has lower frequencies of approximately 28-30 Hz. With increasing time, the frequencies of these oscillations reach values of up to 46 Hz. The brain reacts within three-to-four frequency bands, depending on the modality of stimulation. In the context of quantum dynamics, the results are tentatively explained via the concept of eigenvalues.

GABA(A) Agonist Reduces Visual Awareness: A Masking-EEG Experiment	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TEXTURE SEGREGATION; LORAZEPAM; BRAIN; CONSCIOUSNESS; INTEGRATION; CORTEX; BENZODIAZEPINE; ACETYLCHOLINE; SEGMENTATION; COMPETITION	Consciousness can be manipulated in many ways. Here, we seek to understand whether two such ways, visual masking and pharmacological intervention, share a common pathway in manipulating visual consciousness. We recorded EEG from human participants who performed a backward-masking task in which they had to detect a masked figure form its background (masking strength was varied across trials). In a within-subject design, participants received dextromethorphan (a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist), lorazepam (LZP; a GABA(A) receptor agonist), scopolamine (a muscarine receptor antagonist), or placebo. The behavioral results show that detection rate decreased with increasing masking strength and that of all the drugs, only LZP induced a further decrease in detection rate. Figure-related ERP signals showed three neural events of interest: (1) an early posterior occipital and temporal generator (94-121 msec) that was not influenced by any pharmacological manipulation nor by masking, (2) a later bilateral perioccipital generator (156-211 msec) that was reduced by masking as well as LZP (but not by any other drugs), and (3) a late bilateral occipital temporal generator (293-387 msec) that was mainly affected by masking. Crucially, only the intermediate neural event correlated with detection performance. In combination with previous findings, these results suggest that LZP and masking both reduce visual awareness by means of modulating late activity in the visual cortex but leave early activation intact. These findings provide the first evidence for a common mechanism for these two distinct ways of manipulating consciousness.

Insights from latent variable analysis of single-trial P3b latencies	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; P300; Reaction times; Inconsistency; Intra-subject variability	INTRA-SUBJECT VARIABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY; P300; ATTENTION; COMPETITION; AGE	Recent years have witnessed a steep increase in cognitive, differential and clinical neuroscience research on the neural basis of intra-subject variability of reaction times. Most theoretical accounts make the implicit assumption that individual differences in intra-subject variability are consistent across sensory modalities, but this remains largely untested. The present EEG study aims to fill this gap by analyzing, for the first time, stimulus- and response-locked single-trial P3bs across visual and auditory sensory modalities, and employing an innovative supra-task latent variables approach. We found unidimensionality of intra-subject variability variables across modalities as well as high correlations between the latency jitter of stimulus- and response-locked P3bs. These findings support the hypothesis that intra-subject variability represents a unitary construct, and that the processes underlying that generalises not only across different cognitive tasks, but also across different sensory modalities.

Behavioral dynamics and neural grounding of a dynamic field theory of multi-object tracking	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; working memory; object tracking; dynamical systems; neural networks; electroencephalography	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; MULTIPLE-OBJECT TRACKING; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ATTENTION; MODEL; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; FMRI; PARTICULARS; TARGETS	The ability to dynamically track moving objects in the environment is crucial for efficient interaction with the local surrounds. Here, we examined this ability in the context of the multi-object tracking (MOT) task. Several theories have been proposed to explain how people track moving objects; however, only one of these previous theories is implemented in a real-time process model, and there has been no direct contact between theories of object tracking and the growing neural literature using ERPs and fMRI. Here, we present a neural process model of object tracking that builds from a Dynamic Field Theory of spatial cognition. Simulations reveal that our dynamic field model captures recent behavioral data examining the impact of speed and tracking duration on MOT performance. Moreover, we show that the same model with the same trajectories and parameters can shed light on recent ERP results probing how people distribute attentional resources to targets vs. distractors. We conclude by comparing this new theory of object tracking to other recent accounts, and discuss how the neural grounding of the theory might be effectively explored in future work.	[Spencer, J.

Epicortical recording with subdural electrodes in epilepsy patients complemented the findings obtained by the non-invasive techniques. Before self-initiated simple movement, activation occurs first in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and SMA proper bilaterally with some somatotopic organisation, and the lateral premotor area (PMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) mainly contralateral to the movement with precise somatotopic organisation. Functional connectivity among cortical areas has been disclosed by cortico- cortical coherence, cortico-cortical evoked potential, and functional MRI. Cortical activities associated with involuntary movements have been studied by jerk-locked back averaging and cortico-muscular coherence. Application of transcranial magnetic stimulation helped clarifying the state of excitability and inhibition in M1. The sensorimotor cortex (S1-M1) was shown to play an important role in generation of cortical myoclonus, essential tremor, Parkinson tremor and focal dystonia. Cortical myoclonus is actively driven by S1-M1 while essential tremor and Parkinson tremor are mediated by S1-M1. 'Negative motor areas' at PMA and pre-SMA and 'inhibitory motor areas' at peri-rolandic cortex might be involved in the control of voluntary movement and generation of negative involuntary movements, respectively.

Emotional language processing: How mood affects integration processes during discourse comprehension	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Mood congruence; Negativity bias; Comprehension; Language; Discourse	SEMANTIC MEMORY; NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; N400; BIAS; SENTENCE; SPEECH; STATES; ERP	This research tests whether mood affects semantic processing during discourse comprehension by facilitating integration of information congruent with moods' valence. Participants in happy, sad, or neutral moods listened to stories with positive or negative endings during EEG recording. N400 peak amplitudes showed mood congruence for happy and sad participants: endings incongruent with participants' moods demonstrated larger peaks. Happy and neutral moods exhibited larger peaks for negative endings, thus showing a similarity between negativity bias (neutral mood) and mood congruence (happy mood). Mood congruence resulted in differential processing of negative information: happy mood showed larger mplitudes for negative endings than neutral mood, and sad mood showed smaller amplitudes. N400 peaks were also sensitive to whether ending valence was communicated directly or as a result of inference. This effect was moderately modulated by mood. In conclusion, the notion of context for discourse processing should include comprehenders' affective states preceding language processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sixteen healthy adults participated, and a total of 396 line drawings of living and non-living objects were used as stimuli. Of these stimuli, 274 were presented only once, and 122 were repeated after one to five intervening pictures. Participants were asked to categorize the objects as living or non-living things by pressing one of two buttons. Results: The old/new effect (i.e., a faster response time and more positive potentials in response to repeated stimuli than to stimuli initially presented) was observed at 350-550 ms post-stimulus. The distributions of cortical sources for the old and new stimuli were very similar at 250-650 ms after stimulus-onset. Activation in the right middle occipital gyrus/cuneus, right fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus was significantly reduced in response to old compared with new stimuli at 250-350, 350-450, 450-550, and 550-650 ms after stimulus-onset, respectively. Priming in response time was correlated with the electrophysiological priming at left parietal area and repetition suppression at left superior temporal gyrus in 450-550 ms. Conclusions: These results suggest processing of repeated objects is facilitated by sharpening perceptual representation and by efficient detection or attentional control of repeated objects.

Because the N1(m) is a correlate of auditory event detection, this N1 suppression effect is generally interpreted as a reflection of the workings of an internal forward model: The forward model captures the contingency (causal relationship) between the action and the sound, and this is used to cancel the predictable sensory reafference when the action is initiated. In this study, we demonstrated in three experiments using a novel coincidence paradigm that actual contingency between actions and sounds is not a necessary condition for N1 suppression. Participants performed time interval production tasks: They pressed a key to set the boundaries of time intervals. Concurrently, but independently of keypresses, a sequence of pure tones with random onset-to-onset intervals was presented. Tones coinciding with keypresses elicited suppressed N1(m) and P2(m), suggesting that action-stimulus contiguity (temporal proximity) is sufficient to suppress sensory processing related to the detection of auditory events.

Design: Participants awakened at 07:00 the morning of the experimental day, and performed a stimulus-response compatibility (arrow-orientation) task at 21:00, 02:00, and 03:00. Setting: A cognitive task with EEG data recording was performed in a laboratory setting. Participants: Twenty young adults (mean age 21.3 +/- 1.0 yr, 14 males) participated. Interventions: Half of the participants took a 1-hr nap, and the others had a 1-hr awake-rest period from 01:00-02:00. Measurements and Results: Behavioral performance and amplitude of the Pe declined after midnight (i.e., 02:00 and 03:00) compared with the 21:00 task period in both groups. During the task period starting at 03:00, the participants in the awake-rest condition reported less alertness and showed fewer correct responses than those who napped. However, there were no effects of a nap on the amplitude of the ERN/Ne or Pe. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a 1-hr nap can alleviate the decline in subjective alertness and response accuracy during nighttime; however, error-monitoring functions, especially emotional or motivational evaluation of the error, might remain impaired by extended wakefulness even after the nap. This phenomenon could imply that night-shift workers experiencing extended wakefulness should not overestimate the positive effects of a nighttime 1-hr nap during extended wakefulness.

Looming Signals Reveal Synergistic Principles of Multisensory Integration	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CORTICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; POTENTIAL ERP; VISUAL AREAS; PERCEPTION; STIMULUS; HUMANS	Multisensory interactions are a fundamental feature of brain organization. Principles governing multisensory processing have been established by varying stimulus location, timing and efficacy independently. Determining whether and how such principles operate when stimuli vary dynamically in their perceived distance (as when looming/receding) provides an assay for synergy among the above principles and also means for linking multisensory interactions between rudimentary stimuli with higher-order signals used for communication and motor planning. Human participants indicated movement of looming or receding versus static stimuli that were visual, auditory, or multisensory combinations while 160-channel EEG was recorded. Multivariate EEG analyses and distributed source estimations were performed. Nonlinear interactions between looming signals were observed at early poststimulus latencies (similar to 75 ms) in analyses of voltage waveforms, global field power, and source estimations. These looming-specific interactions positively correlated with reaction time facilitation, providing direct links between neural and performance metrics of multisensory integration. Statistical analyses of source estimations identified looming-specific interactions within the right claustrum/insula extending inferiorly into the amygdala and also within the bilateral cuneus extending into the inferior and lateral occipital cortices. Multisensory effects common to all conditions, regardless of perceived distance and congruity, followed (similar to 115 ms) and manifested as faster transition between temporally stable brain networks (vs summed responses to unisensory conditions). We demonstrate the early-latency, synergistic interplay between existing principles of multisensory interactions. Such findings change the manner in which to model multisensory interactions at neural and behavioral/perceptual levels. We also provide neurophysiologic backing for the notion that looming signals receive preferential treatment during perception.

Using these and other methods, complex gratings have been shown to activate the ventral visual stream, whereas moving stimuli preferentially activate the dorsal stream. In the current study, a first experiment assessed brain activations evoked by complex gratings using intracranial electroencephalography in 10 epileptic patients implanted with subdural electrodes. These stimuli of intermediate levels of complexity were presented in such a way that transformational apparent motion (TAM) was perceived. Responses from both the ventral and the dorsal pathways were obtained. The response characteristics of visual area 4 and the fusiform cortex were of similar amplitudes, suggesting that both ventral areas are recruited for the processing of complex gratings. On the other hand, TAM-induced responses of dorsal pathway areas were relatively noisier and of lower amplitudes, suggesting that TAM does not activate motion-specific structures to the same extent as does real motion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activity evoked by TAM in comparison to the one produced by real motion in a patient implanted with the same subdural electrodes. Findings demonstrated that neural response to real motion was much stronger than that evoked by TAM, in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and other motion-sensitive areas within the dorsal pathway. These results support the conclusion that apparent motion, even if perceptually similar to real motion, is not processed in a similar manner.

The neuroanatomical sources that contribute to these rapid training-induced adaptations were unclear. To address this, we compared cortical potentials associated with motor preparation for visually-cued (movement-related potential, MRP) and self-paced (Bereitschaftspotential, BP) movements and investigated adaptations of these following BMT. Methods: EEG recorded the cued MRP and self-paced BP during two experiments. In experiment one, pre and post self-paced unimanual trials were interspersed with cued inphase BMT. In experiment two, self-paced and visually-cued movement trials were performed to assess the differences between and the contributing neural sources to the cued MRP and self-paced BP. Results: Inphase BMT does not affect the early BP. Source localization analysis revealed that the preparatory portion of the cued MRP and self-paced BP are generated by the lateral premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, respectively. Conclusions: The early cued MRP and self-paced BP have unique cortical generators and are independently modulated by specific training types. Significance: These novel findings have implications for interpreting rapid, single-session, training adaptations previously observed. These cortical potentials may also be useful measurement tools to gauge within-session cortical modulations in response to specific modes of rehabilitative training in the stroke population.

An electrophysiological signal that precisely tracks the emergence of error awareness	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						error positivity; EEG; error awareness; error processing; performance monitoring	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL BASIS; DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION; POTENTIALS	Recent electrophysiological research has sought to elucidate the neural mechanisms necessary for the conscious awareness of action errors. Much of this work has focused on the error positivity (Pe), a neural signal that is specifically elicited by errors that have been consciously perceived. While awareness appears to be an essential prerequisite for eliciting the Pe, the precise functional role of this component has not been identified. Twenty-nine participants performed a novel variant of the Go/No-go Error Awareness Task (EAT) in which awareness of commission errors was indicated via a separate speeded manual response. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to isolate the Pe from other stimulus- and response-evoked signals. Single-trial analysis revealed that Pe peak latency was highly correlated with the latency at which awareness was indicated. Furthermore, the Pe was more closely related to the timing of awareness than it was to the initial erroneous response. This finding was confirmed in a separate study which derived IC weights from a control condition in which no indication of awareness was required, thus ruling out motor confounds. A receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the Pe could reliably predict whether an error would be consciously perceived up to 400 ms before the average awareness response. Finally, Pe latency and amplitude were found to be significantly correlated with overall error awareness levels between subjects. Our data show for the first time that the temporal dynamics of the Pe trace the emergence of error awareness. These findings have important implications for interpreting the results of clinical EEG studies of error processing.

J	Schneider, D; Beste, C; Wascher, E				Schneider, Daniel; Beste, Christian; Wascher, Edmund			Attentional capture by irrelevant transients leads to perceptual errors in a competitive change detection task	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						attention; awareness; N2pc; error negativity	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BIASED COMPETITION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; BRAIN MECHANISMS; CHANGE-BLINDNESS; CONFLICT; CORTEX; NEGATIVITY; AWARENESS	Theories on visual change detection imply that attention is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for aware perception. Misguidance of attention due to salient irrelevant distractors can therefore lead to severe deficits in change detection. The present study investigates the mechanisms behind such perceptual errors and their relation to error processing on higher cognitive levels. Participants had to detect a luminance change that occasionally occurred simultaneously with an irrelevant orientation change in the opposite hemi-field (conflict condition). By analyzing event-related potentials in the EEG separately in those error prone conflict trials for correct and erroneous change detection, we demonstrate that only correct change detection was associated with the allocation of attention to the relevant luminance change. Erroneous change detection was associated with an initial capture of attention toward the irrelevant orientation change in the N1 time window and a lack of subsequent target selection processes (N2pc). Errors were additionally accompanied by an increase of the fronto-central N2 and a kind of error negativity (Ne or ERN), which, however, peaked prior to the response. These results suggest that a strong perceptual conflict by salient distractors can disrupt the further processing of relevant information and thus affect its aware perception.

Deficient sustained attention to response task and P300 characteristics in early Huntington's disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Huntington's disease; Attention; Inhibition; SART; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE CHANGES; CARRIERS; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION; FAILURES; RISK	Evidence for the extent and nature of attentional impairment in premanifest and manifest Huntington's disease (HD) is inconsistent. Understanding such impairments may help to better understand early functional changes in HD and could have consequences concerning care for HD patients. We investigated attentional control in both early and premanifest HD. We studied 17 early HD subjects (mean age: 51 years), 12 premanifest HD subjects (mean age: 43 years), and 15 healthy controls (mean age: 51 years), using the sustained attention to response task (SART), a simple Go/No-go test reflecting attentional and inhibitory processes through reaction time (RT) and error rates. Simultaneously recorded EEG yielded P300 amplitudes and latencies. The early HD group made more Go errors (p < 0.001) and reacted slower (p < 0.005) than the other groups. The RT pattern during the SART was remarkably different for early HD subjects compared to the other two groups (p < 0.005), apparent as significant post-error slowing. P300 data showed that for early HD the No-go amplitude was lower than for the other two groups (p < 0.05). Subjects with early HD showed a reduced capacity to effectively control attention. They proved unable to resume the task directly after having made an error, and need more time to return to pre-error performance levels. No attentional control deficits were found for the premanifest HD group.	[Hart, E. P.; Dumas, E. M.; Reijntjes, R. H. A. M.; van den Bogaard, S. J. A.; Middelkoop, H. A. M.; Roos, R. A.

Targeted delivery of exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) has emerged as a potential AD therapy due to its regenerative effects on the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in AD animal models. Here we report the results of a first-in-man study of encapsulated cell (EC) biodelivery of NGF to the basal forebrain of AD patients with the primary objective to explore safety and tolerability. Methods: This was an open-label, 12-month study in 6 AD patients. Patients were implanted stereotactically with EC-NGF biodelivery devices targeting the basal forebrain. Patients were monitored with respect to safety, tolerability, disease progression and implant functionality. Results: All patients were implanted successfully with bilateral single or double implants without complications or signs of toxicity. No adverse events were related to NGF or the device. All patients completed the study, including removal of implants at 12 months. Positive findings in cognition, EEG and nicotinic receptor binding in 2 of 6 patients were detected. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that surgical implantation and removal of EC-NGF biodelivery to the basal forebrain in AD patients is safe, well tolerated and feasible. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of CAD106, a novel active A beta immunotherapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease, designed to induce N-terminal A beta-specific antibodies without an A beta-specific T-cell response. Methods We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study in two centres in Sweden. Participants, aged 50-80 years, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease were entered into one of two cohorts according to time of study entry and then randomly allocated (by use of a computer-generated randomisation sequence) to receive either CAD106 or placebo (4:1; cohort one received CAD106 50 mu g or placebo, cohort two received CAD106 150 mu g or placebo). Each patient received three subcutaneous injections. All patients, caregivers, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation throughout the study. Primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of CAD106 and to identify the A beta-specific antibody response. Safety assessment was done by recording of all adverse events, assessment of MRI scans, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiography, electroencephalography, and laboratory analysis of blood and CSF. Patients with A beta-IgG serum titres higher than 16 units at least once during the study were classified as responders. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00411580. Findings Between August, 2005, and March, 2007, we randomly allocated 31 patients into cohort one (24 patients to CAD106 treatment and seven to placebo) and 27 patients into cohort two (22 patients to CAD106 treatment and five to placebo). 56 of 58 patients reported adverse events. In cohort one, nasopharyngitis was the most commonly reported adverse event (10 of 24 CAD106-treated patients). In cohort two, injection site erythema was the most commonly reported adverse event (14 of 22 CAD106-treated patients). Overall, nine patients reported serious adverse events-none was thought to be related to the study drug. We recorded no clinical or subclinical cases of meningoencephalitis. 16 of 24 (67%) CAD106-treated patients in cohort one and 18 of 22 (82%) in cohort two developed A beta antibody response meeting pre-specified responder threshold. One of 12 placebo-treated patients (8%) had A beta-IgG concentrations that qualified them as a responder. Interpretation Our findings suggest that CAD106 has a favourable safety profile and acceptable antibody response in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Larger trials with additional dose investigations are needed to confirm the safety and establish the efficacy of CAD106. Funding Novartis Pharma AG.

Bandpass filter settings differentially affect measurement of P50 sensory gating in children and adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Children; Adults; Sensory gating; Event-related potentials; Signal-to-noise ratios	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; SUPPRESSION; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEFICIT; N100; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; HZ	Objective: This study investigated the effect of four different bandpass filter settings on measures of the P50 component and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of averaged ERPs obtained from a sensory gating paradigm employing paired-click stimuli. Methods: Participants were adults (n = 18) 20-55 years old and children (n = 25) 5-10 years old who were free of neurological disorders. Results: Results show that the filter settings (0.23-75 Hz, 10-50 Hz, 10-75 Hz, and 10-200 Hz) differentially affected the P50 amplitude, noise power and SNR measures of the conditioning and test clicks, and P50 T/C ratios. Conclusions: The 10-50 Hz filter setting may be optimal in studies that include only adults as these settings resulted in the smallest mean P50 T/C ratio, a reasonable standard deviation (SD) for the ratio, and the highest SNRs. The 10-200 Hz filter may be the best for studying young children as this setting had the smallest mean and SD of P50 T/C ratios for these participants. Significance: In studies that include both adults and children investigators are advised to use the 10-200 Hz filter setting because the smaller variability of sensory gating in the child group helps ensure better homogeneity of variance measures between the groups.

Twelve right-handed participants were asked to memorize and reproduce the duration of time intervals (600 or 800 ms) bounded by two flashes. Random trials contained auditory stimuli in the form of three 20 ms sounds between the flashes. In one session, the participants were asked to ignore the presence of the sounds, and in the other, they were instructed to pay attention to sounds. The behavioral results showed that duration reproduction was clearly affected by the presence of the sounds and the duration of time intervals. The filled-duration illusion occurred when there were sounds; the participants overestimated the interval in the 600-ms interval condition with sounds. On the other hand, the participants underestimated the 800-ms interval condition without sounds. During the presentation of the interval to be encoded, the contingent negative variation (CNV) appeared around the prefrontal scalp site, and P300 appeared around the parieto-central scalp site. The CNV grew larger when the intervals contained the sounds, whereas the P300 grew larger when the intervals were 800 ms and did not contain the sounds. During the reproduction of the interval to be presented, the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) appeared over the fronto-central scalp site from 1000 ms before the participants' response. The BP could refer to the decision making process associated with the duration reproduction. The occurrence of three event-related potentials (ERPs), the P300, CNV, and BP suggests that the fronto-parietal area, together with supplementary motor area (SMA), is associated with timing and time perception, and magnitude of these potentials is modulted by the "filled-duration illusion"	[Mitsudo, Takako; Gagnon, Caroline; Grondin, Simon] Univ Laval, Ecole Psychol, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Takeichi, Hiroshige] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Math Neurosci, Wako, Saitama, Japan		Grondin, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Ecole Psychol, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.	simon.grondin@psy.ulaval.ca		Mitsudo, Takako/0000-0002-4123-4247	Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC; Time In MEntaL activitY (TIMELY)	Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Time In MEntaL activitY (TIMELY)	This research was made possible by a research grant awarded to Simon Grondin by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC), and a Summer Scholarship from NSERC to Caroline Gagnon.

In order to examine the effects of encoding context and stimulus repetition, target pairs were presented on either detailed or white backgrounds and were repeatedly presented during both early and late phases of encoding. Results indicated an increase in P300 amplitude in the right parietal cortex from early to late stages of encoding in older declined adults, whereas both younger adults and older controls showed a reduction in P300 amplitude in this same area from early to late phase encoding. In the right hemisphere, stimuli encoded with a white background had larger P300 amplitudes than stimuli presented with a detailed background; however, in the left hemisphere, in the later stages of encoding, stimuli presented with a detailed background had larger amplitudes than stimuli presented with a white background. Behaviourally, there was better memory for congruent stimuli reinstated with a detailed background, but this finding was for older controls only. During recognition, there was a general trend for congruent stimuli to elicit a larger amplitude response than incongruent stimuli, suggesting a distinct effect of context reinstatement on underlying patterns of physiological responding. However, behavioural data suggest that older declined adults showed no memory benefits associated with context reinstatement. When compared with older declined adults, younger adults had larger P100 amplitude responses to stimuli presented during recognition, and overall, younger adults had faster recognition reaction times than older control and older declined adults. Further analysis of repetition effects and context-based hemispheric asymmetry may prove informative in identifying declining memory performance in the elderly, potentially before it becomes manifested behaviourally.

An electrophysiological study investigating the neural correlates of vocal inhibition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Vocal; Inhibition; Stop signal; EEG; P3	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; STOP-SIGNAL PROBABILITY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MOTOR INHIBITION; GO/NO-GO; CONFLICT; EXCITABILITY; TASK; ERP; COMPLEX	A neural biomarker that can be applied to studies of oral communication disorders would provide a boon to researchers. While there has been much research conducted on manual response inhibition, very few studies have examined vocal response inhibition. To date, no study has examined the temporal aspects of vocal inhibition. Therefore, the present study attempted to identify the neural correlates of vocal response inhibition by recording electroencephalographic activity during a modified version of the stop signal task. We included an ignore signal condition matched for frequency and visual stimulation to the stop signal which importantly, was included in the same block of trials as the typical go and stop trials. Behavioural results showed that participants were able to inhibit a vocal response within approximately 324 ms. Statistical analysis of ERPs revealed that a positive component around 324 ms was significantly larger in amplitude during successfully stopped trials compared to in an ignore condition, particularly over a cluster of fronto-central electrodes. These results support the notion that the P3 component is a reliable index of vocal inhibition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neural Correlates of True and False Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; OLDER-ADULTS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; HILBERT SPECTRUM	The goal of this research was to investigate the changes in neural processing in mild cognitive impairment. We measured phase synchrony, amplitudes, and event-related potentials in veridical and false memory to determine whether these differed in participants with mild cognitive impairment compared with typical, age-matched controls. Empirical mode decomposition phase locking analysis was used to assess synchrony, which is the first time this analysis technique has been applied in a complex cognitive task such as memory processing. The technique allowed assessment of changes in frontal and parietal cortex connectivity over time during a memory task, without a priori selection of frequency ranges, which has been shown previously to influence synchrony detection. Phase synchrony differed significantly in its timing and degree between participant groups in the theta and alpha frequency ranges. Timing differences suggested greater dependence on gist memory in the presence of mild cognitive impairment. The group with mild cognitive impairment had significantly more frontal theta phase locking than the controls in the absence of a significant behavioural difference in the task, providing new evidence for compensatory processing in the former group. Both groups showed greater frontal phase locking during false than true memory, suggesting increased searching when no actual memory trace was found. Significant inter-group differences in frontal alpha phase locking provided support for a role for lower and upper alpha oscillations in memory processing. Finally, fronto-parietal interaction was significantly reduced in the group with mild cognitive impairment, supporting the notion that mild cognitive impairment could represent an early stage in Alzheimer's disease, which has been described as a 'disconnection syndrome'.

The Simon effect modulates N2cc and LRP but not the N2pc component	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Simon effect; Event-related potential; Spatial attention; Premotor cortex; eLORETA	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; RESPONSE ACTIVATION; SPATIAL STIMULUS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ATTENTION; LOCATION; MOVEMENT; EEG; LOCALIZATION; INFORMATION	Previous studies have reported that the horizontal arrangement of the stimuli in Simon tasks elicits three different components: LRP, N2pc and N2cc. Although N2cc may play a key role in Simon tasks, as it is involved in preventing responses based on stimulus position, modulation of the N2cc component according to the experimental conditions has not previously been investigated because of N2cc/LRP overlap in similar regions and temporal window. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the Simon effect modulates N2pc, N2cc and LRP components. For this purpose, participants were asked to respond to an arrow according to its colour. Three conditions, which depended on the congruency between stimulus position and the required response, were analysed: compatible position (CP), incompatible position (IP), and neutral position (NP). The LRP peak latency was delayed in IP with respect to CP and NP conditions. Lateralized minus neutral position (L-NP) subtractions were carried out to remove the common motor activity and isolate the N2cc and N2pc components in the lateralized conditions. The N2cc amplitude in L NP waveforms was larger in IP than in CP, in accordance with the greater effort required to monitor selection of the correct response in the first condition. eLORETA analysis also revealed greater premotor activity at 150-200 ms in IP and CP, than in NP, which was attributed to the N2cc component present in IP/CP conditions. Evidence of functional dissociation between N2pc and N2cc components was obtained, because N2cc, but not N2pc, was affected by the experimental conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Error potential detection during continuous movement of an artificial arm controlled by brain-computer interface	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalogram; Error potential; Motor imagery	EEG-BASED COMMUNICATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; PATTERNS; ERP	Patients who benefit from Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) may have difficulties to generate more than one distinct brain pattern which can be used to control applications. Other BCI issues are low performance, accuracy, and, depending on the type of BCI, a long preparation and/or training time. This study aims to show possible solutions. First, we used time-coded motor imagery (MI) with only one pattern. Second, we reduced the training time by recording only 20 trials of active MI to set up a BCI classifier. Third, we investigated away to record error potentials (ErrPs) during continuous feedback. Ten subjects controlled an artificial arm by performing MI over target time periods between 1 and 4 s. The subsequent movement of this arm served as continuous feedback. Discrete events, which are required to elicit ErrPs, were added by mounting blinking LEDs on top of the continuously moving arm to indicate the future movements. Time epochs after these events were used to evaluate ErrPs offline. The achieved error rate for the arm movement was on average 26.9%. Obtained ErrPs looked similar to results from the previous studies dealing with error detection and the detection rate was above chance level which is a positive outcome and encourages further investigation.

Mechanisms of response adaptation during repeated food viewing are of particular interest for better understanding food intake beyond energetic needs. Here, we measured visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and conducted neural source estimations to initial and repeated presentations of high-energy and low-energy foods as well as non-food images. The results of our study show that the behavioral and neural responses to food and food-related objects are not uniformly affected by repetition. While the repetition of images displaying low-energy foods and non-food modulated VEPs as well as their underlying neural sources and increased behavioral categorization accuracy, the responses to high-energy images remained largely invariant between initial and repeated encounters. Brain mechanisms when viewing images of high-energy foods thus appear less susceptible to repetition effects than responses to low-energy and non-food images. This finding is likely related to the superior reward value of high-energy foods and might be one reason why in particular high-energetic foods are indulged although potentially leading to detrimental health consequences.

When T2 is presented consecutively from T1, T2 is likely to be detected despite the temporal proximity of both targets; this effect is called Lag-1 sparing. We studied how the Lag-1 sparing and AB effects change with practice. Observers repeated a typical dual-target-report task over separate days, while behavioral indices and EEG were recorded. Practice increased the Lag-1 sparing and reduced the AB effects, improving the sensitivity to T2 while leaving the response criterion unchanged. With improving sensitivity, T2-related amplitude of P3 and negative deflection (ND), an N2 subcomponent, increased. The latter, especially in the Lag-1 condition, could not fully be explained by changes in the ratio of the T2-hit and miss trials. ND usually indicates spatial target selectivity but here reflects the selection of temporally proximal targets. The effect, therefore, suggests common mechanisms for spatial and temporal selectivity. Relevance of these results for computational models of the AB is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study investigated whether people are also sensitive to a co-actor's attentional relation to jointly attended events. Two participants sat next to each other and performed a two-choice Navon task, responding to the identity of letters formed by identical (congruent) or different (incongruent) smaller letters while EEG was recorded. Crucially, participants either held the same focus of attention (e. g., both attending to local stimulus features) or different foci of attention (e. g., one attending to local and the other to global features). Results revealed a significant slow-down of responses when participants focused on different features. Amplitudes of the occipital P1 and parietal occipital P3 decreased when attentional foci differed. The amplitude of the fronto-central N2 increased when the other attended to local as compared to global features. These results suggest that representations of a co-actor's task can include a specification of his or her focus of attention. Taking into account the other's different attentional relation to stimuli likely induces a conflict at the level of task selection, impairing early allocation of attention (P1) and enhancing the need to monitor response initiation (P3).

We investigated whether there is a laterality effect in judging emotions from the eyes. In one task a pair of emotionally expressive eyes presented in central vision had to be physically matched to a subsequently presented set of eyes in one or other visual hemifield (eyes condition). In the second task a word was presented centrally followed by a set of eyes to left or right hemifield and the participant had to decide whether the word correctly described the emotion portrayed by the laterally presented set of eyes (word condition). Participants were a group of undergraduate students and a group of older volunteers (> 50). There was no visual hemifield difference in accuracy or raw response times in either task for either group, but log-transformed times showed an overall left hemifield advantage. Contrary to the right hemisphere ageing hypothesis, older participants showed no evidence of a relative right hemisphere decline in performance on the tasks. In the younger group mean peak amplitude of the N170 component of the EEG at lateral posterior electrode sites was significantly greater over the right hemisphere (T6/PO2) than the left (T5/PO1) in both the perceptual recognition task and the emotional judgement task.

In future it would be useful to combine electrophysiological techniques with lateralised visual input in studying lateralisation of emotion with older as well as younger participants.

Steven			Spatially Pooled Contrast Responses Predict Neural and Perceptual Similarity of Naturalistic Image Categories	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; STATISTICAL PROPERTIES; SHAPE SIMILARITY; DECISION-MAKING; GANGLION-CELLS; PHASE NOISE; SCENE; REPRESENTATION; SPEED	The visual world is complex and continuously changing. Yet, our brain transforms patterns of light falling on our retina into a coherent percept within a few hundred milliseconds. Possibly, low-level neural responses already carry substantial information to facilitate rapid characterization of the visual input. Here, we computationally estimated low-level contrast responses to computer-generated naturalistic images, and tested whether spatial pooling of these responses could predict image similarity at the neural and behavioral level. Using EEG, we show that statistics derived from pooled responses explain a large amount of variance between single-image evoked potentials (ERPs) in individual subjects. Dissimilarity analysis on multi-electrode ERPs demonstrated that large differences between images in pooled response statistics are predictive of more dissimilar patterns of evoked activity, whereas images with little difference in statistics give rise to highly similar evoked activity patterns. In a separate behavioral experiment, images with large differences in statistics were judged as different categories, whereas images with little differences were confused. These findings suggest that statistics derived from low-level contrast responses can be extracted in early visual processing and can be relevant for rapid judgment of visual similarity. We compared our results with two other, well-known contrast statistics: Fourier power spectra and higher-order properties of contrast distributions (skewness and kurtosis). Interestingly, whereas these statistics allow for accurate image categorization, they do not predict ERP response patterns or behavioral categorization confusions. These converging computational, neural and behavioral results suggest that statistics of pooled contrast responses contain information that corresponds with perceived visual similarity in a rapid, low-level categorization task.

NMDA antagonist MK801 recreates auditory electrophysiology disruption present in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism; Electrophysiology; Endophenotype; Animal models; NMDA receptor antagonist	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; MICE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MK-801; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS; LOCOMOTION; STEREOTYPY; BIOMARKER	Autism is a highly disabling neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, language impairment, and repetitive behaviors. There are few effective biological treatments for this disorder, partly due to the lack of translational biomarkers. However, recent data suggest that autism has reliable electrophysiological endophenotypes, along with evidence that some deficits may be caused by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Similarly, the NMDAR antagonist MK801 has been used in behavioral animal models of autism. Since MK801 has also been used as a model of schizophrenia, this paper examines the independent and overlapping ways in which MK801 recreates the electrophysiogical changes present in both diseases. Mouse EEG was recorded in response to auditory stimuli after either vehicle or MK801 and the dose-response relationship for each measure was determined. ERP component amplitude and latency analysis was performed along with time-frequency analysis of gamma frequency inter-trial coherence and evoked power. Evoked gamma power and ITC were decreased by MK801 at the highest dose. P1, Ni latency and gamma baseline power were increased in dose dependent fashion following MK801. There were no amplitude changes in P1 or NI. MK801 caused alterations in evoked gamma activity, gamma ITC, gamma baseline power, P1 and Ni latency similar to findings in autism. These data provide evidence indicating that NMDAR dysfunction may contribute to deficits specific to autism and some that overlap with other disorders such as schizophrenia. Such observations could be important for developing novel therapeutics, as electrophysiological endophenotypes associate with functional measures and may provide early biomarkers for efficacy in clinical trials.

This activity is commonly seen in the scalp-recorded readiness potential, and is an index of movement preparation involving both motor programming and non-motor or cognitive processes such as attention. The specific contribution of cognitive processes, thought to occur during the earliest stage of planning, remains somewhat unclear. We suggest that attention to the timing of movement is a key voluntary process contributing to early-stage cortical activity. As a novel approach to examining this, we recorded EEG throughout a time reproduction task in which participants replicated the interval between two tones with two button-press actions. The first action, i.e. the beginning of the reproduced interval, was somewhat incidental to the task of time reproduction and required minimal attention to the time of initiation, while the second action required explicit attention to the time of initiation. Pre-movement neural activity preceding the first, relatively unattended movement was greatly reduced in amplitude and almost absent in the early stage, in contrast with readiness potentials typically seen prior to voluntary movement. Neural activity preceding explicitly timed movements was significantly larger, with effects emerging in the early component of pre-movement activity over frontal and right frontal scalp regions. We propose that attention to movement timing, i.e. the process of orienting attention in time towards the moment of movement initiation, is a key component of voluntary action preparation that is reflected in the early-stage neural activity we typically see prior to voluntary movement.

The reading fluency deficit might be traced back to a scarce integration of orthographic and phonological representations. In order to address this question, the present study used EEG to investigate the N300, an ERP component which has been associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. Twenty children without DD and 18 children with DD performed a phonological (P)-orthographic (0) matching task (P-O condition), which tapped the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. A control task was applied which did not require the integration of orthographic and phonological representations and consisted only of orthographic information (O-O condition). The O-O condition revealed a similar N300 distribution between groups with a bilateral activity over fronto-temporal electrodes. However, in the P-O condition N300 differentiated the 2 groups of children. The control group revealed greater activity over left fronto-temporal electrodes, whereas the N300 was distributed bilaterally in the group of children with DD suggesting deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations. These findings might be related to the reading fluency deficit as it was also observed that better reading fluency was correlated with higher (r = -.36) and earlier peaking (r = -.33) N300 amplitudes in the left hemisphere and attenuated N300 amplitudes (r = .45) in the right hemisphere. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (sLORETA) revealed that children with DD rely more on right temporo-parietal brain areas compared to children without DD. Furthermore, in order to rule out that earlier deficient processes might influence the group differences found in the N300, we analyzed the N170 for group differences. We did not find significant differences between children without DD and children with DD. In conclusion the results suggest deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations in dyslexia, as indexed by the N300, and further highlight how this activity is relevant for fluent reading.

These differential responses could be used as a tool to trace linguistic processes in the brain and their interaction with attention. However, as previous studies relied on explicit instructions to attend or ignore the stimuli, a technique for automatic attention modulation (i.e., not dependent on explicit instruction) would be more advantageous, especially when cooperation with instructions may not be guaranteed (e.g., neurological patients, children etc). Here we present a novel paradigm in which the stimulus context automatically draws attention to speech. In a non-attend passive auditory oddball sequence, rare words and pseudowords were presented among frequent non-speech tones of variable frequency and length. The low percentage of spoken stimuli guarantees an involuntary attention switch to them. The speech stimuli, in turn, could be disambiguated as words or pseudowords only in their end, at the last phoneme, after the attention switch would have already occurred. Our results confirmed that this paradigm can indeed be used to induce automatic shifts of attention to spoken input. At similar to 250 ms after the stimulus onset, a P3a-like neuromagnetic deflection was registered to spoken (but not tone) stimuli indicating an involuntary attention shift. Later, after the word-pseudoword divergence point, we found a larger oddball response to pseudowords than words, best explained by neural processes of lexical search facilitated through increased attention. Furthermore, we demonstrate a breakdown of this orderly pattern of neurocognitive processes as a result of sleep deprivation. The new paradigm may thus be an efficient way to assess language comprehension processes and their dynamic interaction with those of attention allocation. It does it in an automatic and task-free fashion, indicating its potential benefit for assessing uncooperative clinical populations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Object attentional selection affects the early stages of visual sensory processing	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article						ERPs; C1; P1; N1; visual selective attention; visual striate cortex; V1; space and object parallel processing; shape processing time course; shape categorization	PERCEPTUAL LOAD INTERACTS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CORTICAL AREAS; CORTEX; CATEGORIZATION; V1; EXTRASTRIATE; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	Background: There is at present crescent empirical evidence deriving from different lines of ERPs research that, unlike previously observed, the earliest sensory visual response, known as C1 component or P/N80, generated within the striate cortex, might be modulated by selective attention to visual stimulus features. Up to now, evidence of this modulation has been related to space location, and simple features such as spatial frequency, luminance, and texture. Additionally, neurophysiological conditions, such as emotion, vigilance, the reflexive or voluntary nature of input attentional selection, and workload have also been related to C1 modulations, although at least the workload status has received controversial indications. No information is instead available, at present, for objects attentional selection. Methods: In this study object-and space-based attention mechanisms were conjointly investigated by presenting complex, familiar shapes of artefacts and animals, intermixed with distracters, in different tasks requiring the selection of a relevant target-category within a relevant spatial location, while ignoring the other shape categories within this location, and, overall, all the categories at an irrelevant location. EEG was recorded from 30 scalp electrode sites in 21 right-handed participants. Results and Conclusions: ERP findings showed that visual processing was modulated by both shape-and location-relevance per se, beginning separately at the latency of the early phase of a precocious negativity (60-80 ms) at mesial scalp sites consistent with the C1 component, and a positivity at more lateral sites. The data also showed that the attentional modulation progressed conjointly at the latency of the subsequent P1 (100-120 ms) and N1 (120-180 ms), as well as later-latency components. These findings support the views that (1) V1 may be precociously modulated by direct top-down influences, and participates to object, besides simple features, attentional selection; (2) object spatial and non-spatial features selection might begin with an early, parallel detection of a target object in the visual field, followed by the progressive focusing of spatial attention onto the location of an actual target for its identification, somehow in line with neural mechanisms reported in the literature as "object-based space selection", or with those proposed for visual search.
