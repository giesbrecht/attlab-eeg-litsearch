Our study aimed at evaluating if an association exists between the severity of ERP abnormalities and EEG slowing to better understand cerebral dysfunctions in OSA. Methods: Twelve OSA patients and 12 age-matched controls underwent an overnight polysomnographic recording, an EEG recording of 10 min of wakefulness, and an auditory ERP protocol known to specifically recruit attention. P300 and P3a ERP components were measured as well as the spectral power in each frequency band of the waking EEG. Pearson product moment correlations were used to measure associations between ERP characteristics and EEG spectral power in OSA patients and control subjects. Results: A positive correlation between the late P300 amplitude and theta power in the occipital region was observed in OSA subjects (P < .01). A positive correlation was also found between P3a amplitude and beta 1 power in central region in OSA subjects (P < .01). No correlation was observed for control subjects. Conclusions: ERP abnormalities observed in an attention task are associated with a slowing of the waking EEG recorded at rest in OSA. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we review ERP studies on single word production adopting an historical and methodological perspective. The first section of the paper presents a general overview of EEG recording and analysis methods. In a second section, we describe different paradigms used in language production studies and their evolution in the last years, focusing on EEG recording constrains. Finally, two studies are reported as examples of paradigms employing overt picture naming paradigms. Here the purpose is to show that, while EEG/ERP paradigms are not aimed at replacing other behavioral measures, they allow to explore hypotheses which are difficult to test with behavioral studies.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive, inexpensive and useful tool for investigating the neurobiology of schizophrenia and its subtypes. EEG studies elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying clinical symptomatology. In this review article recent advances in applying EEG to study pathophysiology, phenomenology, and treatment response in schizophrenia are discussed. Investigative strategies employed include: analyzing quantitative EEG (QEEG) spectral power during the resting state and cognitive tasks; applying machine learning methods to identify QEEG indicators of diagnosis and treatment response; and using the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique to characterize the neurocognitive processes underlying clinical symptoms. Studies attempting to validate potential EEG biomarkers of schizophrenia and its symptoms, which could be useful in assessing familial risk and treatment response, are also reviewed.

In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n?=?17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n?=?26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30?min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30?min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

The proposed BCI system implements decoding the brain state by using a non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, in combination with machine learning, artificial intelligence and automatic content and similarity analysis of images. The user can spell search queries using a mental typewriter (Hex-O-Speller), and the resulting images from the web search are shown to the user as a Rapid Serial Visual Presentations (RSVP). For each image shown, the EEG response is used by the system to recognize the user's interests and narrow down the search results. In addition, it also adds more descriptive terms to the search query, and retrieves more specific image search results and repeats the process. As a proof of concept, a prototype system was designed to test the navigation through the interface and the Hex-o-Speller using an event-related potential(ERP) detection and classification system.The results and challenges faced were noted and analyzed.

However, where and when the discrimination of symmetrical properties begins in the context of visual information processing is largely unclear. This study investigates event-related potential (ERP) patterns in humans when perceiving symmetry-varied complex object images. ERP responses were derived from electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from eight healthy subjects using 128-channel scalp electrodes. Visual stimulation was provided using gray-scaled photographs of a car with six different viewpoints, hence disrupting the vertical symmetry, where one of the stimuli was intentionally made symmetric by mirroring the image about its center vertical axis. The results show that discrimination of image symmetry is revealed by potential deflection in early ERP components recorded at occipito-temporal sites and can be significantly observed around 220 ms after stimulus onset.

First, we derrive the contour-selectivity measures from event related potential (ERP) and fMRI data, and explore the correlation between the two. In this way, we connect the spatial information from fMRI with the temporal information from ERPs.

Ruud			Combining findings from gaze and electroencephalography recordings to study timing in a visual tracking task	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						gaze; parietal lobe; prospective control; time-locking averaged electroencephalography; visual motion perception; visual occlusion	HUMAN PARIETAL CORTEX; MOVEMENT; INTERCEPTION; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and gaze data have traditionally been separated in neurocognitive studies because of the artefacts that even small controlled eye movements produce. Study of gaze control in a visual tracking task provides information about an individual's prospective control. By including gaze events in the EEG analysis, we studied prospective control and its neural correlates during deceleration in a visual tracking task. Adult participants followed with their gaze a small car moving horizontally on a large screen, where the final approach of the car was temporarily occluded, and pushed a button to stop the car at the reappearance point. Two gaze events, the behavioural push button response and the nonbehavioural stimulus onset, were used to time-lock the averaged event-related potential (ERP) waveform. A significant effect of deceleration on peak amplitude in parietal channel Pz (P<0.05) was found when ERP waveforms were time-locked to the prospective gaze shift over the occluder. The peak decreased in amplitude as car deceleration increased when participants successfully stopped the car, indicating successful deceleration discrimination. No such effect was found when ERP waveforms were time-locked to any of the other events. Thus, a traditional stimulus onset time-locking procedure is likely to distort the averaged signal and consequently hide important Pz-peak amplitude differences on the prospective timing of decelerating object motion during occlusion. This study shows the importance of including behavioural data when studying neural correlates of prospective control and proposes active incorporation of behavioural data into the EEG analysis.

Coupling of infraslow fluctuations in autonomic and central vigilance markers: Skin temperature, EEG beta power and ERP P300 latency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Skin temperature; Vigilance; Sustained attention; Event related potential; Electroencephalography; P300; Distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient; Beta oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOTAL SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; WAKING EEG; PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; CORE TEMPERATURE; TASK-PERFORMANCE; TIME-COURSE; BODY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Even under thermoneutral conditions, skin temperature fluctuates spontaneously, most prominently at distal parts of the body. These fluctuations were shown to be associated with fluctuations in vigilance: mild manipulation of skin temperature during nocturnal sleep affects sleep depth and the power spectral density of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and fluctuations in skin temperature during daytime wakefulness are related to sleep propensity and task performance. The association of daytime skin temperature fluctuations with EEG markers of vigilance has not previously been investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between daytime fluctuations in skin temperature with those in two quantitative EEG measures: the power spectral density of background EEG, and the event related potential (ERP) elicited by visual stimuli. High-density EEG and skin temperature were obtained in eight healthy adults five times a day while they performed a visual sustained-attention task. Assessments were made after a night of normal sleep and after the challenge of a night of total sleep deprivation. Fluctuations in the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient measured from the earlobe and mastoid were associated with fluctuations in parieto-occipital high beta band (20-40 Hz) power of the pre-stimulus background EEG, but only after sleep deprivation. The temperature fluctuations were moreover associated with fluctuations in the latency of the P300 elicited by the stimulus. The findings demonstrate close association between fluctuations in an autonomic correlate of the vigilance state (i.e. the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient), and fluctuations in central nervous system correlates of the vigilance state (i.e. background EEG and ERP). The findings are of theoretical and practical relevance for the assessment and manipulation of vigilance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals of 5 healthy subjects were recorded as they performed an auditory oddball and a visual modified oddball tasks. To capture the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity during the execution of each task, EEG signals are segmented into durations that correspond to the temporal windows of previously well-studied event-related potentials (ERPs). For each temporal window, DTW is employed to measure the functional similarities among channels. Unlike commonly used temporal similarity measures, such as cross correlation, DTW compares time series by taking into consideration that their alignment properties may vary in time. QT clustering analysis is then used to automatically identify the functionally connected regions in each temporal window. For each task, the proposed approach was able to establish a unique sequence of dynamic pattern (observed in all 5 subjects) for brain functional connectivity. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This paper tests the merits of a software tool employing the regression-based Gratton method that claims to remove the detrimental effects of the eye blink and leaves the activity of the brain. The efficacy of the correction tool was tested on five common stimulus-locked Event Related Potential (ERP) components used in a standard Go/Nogo task. Results suggested that the 'corrected' data could be predicted fromdata containing no eye blinks, suggesting the tool does not distort the data to great extent. This effect was found significant for all components, except for the P3. The conclusion is that this tool distorts the data at acceptable levels, yet caution should be taken when interpreting later components, like the P3.

A lot of car factories develop systems for fatigue prediction and microsleep detection. These systems are usually based on eye movement tracking or steering wheel movement analysis. But both these methods detect consequences of fatigue. From road safety point of view, it would be useful to be able to detect fatigue itself before it affects dedication to driving. We know there could be a correlation between cognitive event-related potential (ERP) waveform latency and the rate of attention - the longest the latency is, the more tired the measured subject is. This paper deals with determination of latency of a cognitive ERP waveform from outputs of two algorithms we use for its detection and which we have the best experience with.

Currently, the majority of BCI paradigms rely on a limited number of brain potentials; thus there remain many EEG signals to be explored for BCI applications. One such signal is the N2pc event-related potential (ERP). The N2pc is an ERP elicited 150ms to 350ms post-stimulus onset in response to target detection in visual search tasks. During this time window, target detection causes a negative deflection in the ERPs measured contralaterally to the target, allowing the lateralization of the target to be determined. Here we explore the feasibility of an N2pc-based BCI paradigm by analyzing the classification performance of participants based on data collected during an N2pc elicitation task. We quantify performance as a function of two variables; channel selection and the number of trials averaged together to obtain the ERP. Preliminary results indicate that with as few as three trials, the N2pc can be classified at nearly 90% accuracy in some individuals. These results could directly lead to the development of a new BCI paradigm, which we plan to realize in future work through the construction of a speller interface.

Count and No-task conditions were assessed, and we predicted broadly corresponding effects between Go and Count, and NoGo and No-task conditions. Single-trial data were obtained at the midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz). Prestimulus EEG in each of the traditional bands was quantified using a sliding FFT window, and five ERP components were manually identified. The corresponding EEG and ERP data were then correlated across subjects, sites, and trials, separately for each ERP component measure (amplitude, latency), task condition (Count, No-task), and EEG band (delta, theta, alpha, beta). Despite the substantial paradigm and methodological differences, 10 of the 17 expected prestimulus EEG-ERP directional relationships (i.e., direct or inverse effects) were confirmed across the traditional bands and ERP components, and only one was in the opposite direction. Importantly, 18 additional relationships reached significance here; these occurred across the EEG bands, and ER? components. Together these findings confirm the significant contributions of prestimulus EEG to subsequent ER? responses. These appear to be at least partially independent of the paradigm and EEG methodology employed, suggesting that there is merit in mapping these contributions further. Our findings also indicate the improved sensitivity of the statistical approach used here in detecting such EEC-ER? relationships. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Much electroencephalography (EEG) research has studied the N2/P3 complex over frontocentral electrodes during outright stopping. Here, we used differential reward of the stop and go processes in a stop signal task to study the sensitivity of these EEG components to preparation. We found that (a) stopping was faster when it was rewarded; (b) the P3 amplitude was larger for successful versus failed stopping, and this difference was greater when stopping was rewarded over going; (c) the N2 component was observed only on failed stop trials; and (d) there was greater EEG coherence between frontocentral and occipitoparietal electrodes at 12Hz during the initiation of a go response when stopping was rewarded over going. We propose that frontocentral cortical mechanisms active before and at the time of stopping are sensitive to preparation.

The ERP measured in a single trial often has a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because of the relatively large background due to the rhythmic electroencephalogram (EEG) noise. This paper proposes a novel method to enhance ERPs by combining principal component analysis (PCA) with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (M-EMD). EMD is a data-driven time-frequency analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary signals, and M-EMD is its multivariate extension. In the proposed method, PCA reduces the data dimensions, while M-EMD removes the relatively large background EEGs. The performance of the method is evaluated with simulated and measured P300 ERP components obtained from a visual oddball experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the background EEGs and improve the SNR of P300s. (c) 2013 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Event related potentials (ERP) corresponding to a stimulus in EEG can be used to detect the intended target of a person for BCI. This paradigm is widely utilized to build letter-by-letter BCI typing systems. Nevertheless currently available BCI typing systems still require improvement due to low typing speeds. This is mainly due to the reliance on multiple repetitions before making a decision to achieve higher typing accuracy. Another possible approach to increase the speed of typing while not significantly reducing the accuracy of typing is to use additional context information. In this paper, we study the effect of using a language model (LM) as additional evidence for intent detection. Bayesian fusion of an n-gram symbol model with EEG features is proposed, and a specifically regularized discriminant analysis ERP discriminant is used to obtain EEG-based features. The target detection accuracies are rigorously evaluated for varying LM orders, as well as the number of ERP-inducing repetitions. Main results. The results demonstrate that the LMs contribute significantly to letter classification accuracy. For instance, we find that a single-trial ERP detection supported by a 4-gram LM may achieve the same performance as using 3-trial ERP classification for the non-initial letters of words. Significance. Overall, the fusion of evidence from EEG and LMs yields a significant opportunity to increase the symbol rate of a BCI typing system.

We demonstrate what the brain status is before a voluntary movement and how it has been used in practical applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Usually, in BCI applications, the focus of study is on the after-movement or motor imagery potentials. However, this study shows that it is possible to develop BCIs based on the before-movement or motor imagery potentials such as the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). Using the pre-movement or pre-motor imagery potentials, we can correctly predict the onset of the upcoming movement, its direction and even the limb that is engaged in the performance. This information can help in designing a more efficient rehabilitation tool as well as BCIs with a shorter response time which appear more natural to the users.

Abnormal P600 word repetition effect in elderly persons with preclinical Alzheimer's disease	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mild cognitive impairment; EEG; Memory; Alzheimer's disease; Event-related potentials	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY; DEMENTIA; BRAIN; FMRI; ERP; N400	We sought cognitive event-related potential (ERP) biomarkers of Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (Pre-AD) using an incidental verbal learning paradigm with high sensitivity to prodromal AD. Seven elderly persons, with normal cognition at the time of ERP recordings, but who showed subsequent cognitive decline or AD pathology at autopsy (n=5, mean Braak stage=2.8), were compared to 12 robust normal elderly (RNE) persons who remained cognitively normal (Mfollow-up=9.0 years). EEG was recorded during a word repetition paradigm (semantically congruous (50%) and incongruous target words repeat similar to 10-140 seconds later). The RNE P600 congruous word repetition ERP effects (New minus Old congruous words) were significantly larger than in Pre-AD (mean amplitudes=3.28vs. 0.10V, p=.04). High group discrimination (84%) was achieved (by a P600 amplitude cutoff of similar to 1.5V). Abnormal P600 word repetition effects in cognitively normal elderly persons may be an important sign of synaptic dysfunction and Preclinical AD.

Various measures have been used to estimate emotional states, including self-report, startle response, behavioral response, autonomic measurement, and neurophysiologic measurement. Among them, inferring emotional states from electroencephalography (EEG) has received considerable attention as EEG could directly reflect emotional states with relatively low costs and simplicity. Yet, EEG-based emotional state estimation requires well-designed computational methods to extract information from complex and noisy multichannel EEG data. In this paper, we review the computational methods that have been developed to deduct EEG indices of emotion, to extract emotion-related features, or to classify EEG signals into one of many emotional states. We also propose using sequential Bayesian inference to estimate the continuous emotional state in real time. We present current challenges for building an EEG-based emotion recognition system and suggest some future directions.

It may be useful for investigating attention and working memory processes in specific populations, such as children and neuropsychiatric patients. Eleven children were investigated with simultaneous ERP-fMRI. To fulfill requirements of both BOLD and electroencephalographic signal registration, a modified oddball task was used. To verify the ERP-fMRI protocol we also performed a study outside the scanner using a typical two-stimuli oddball paradigm. Localization of the P300 component of ERPs partially corresponded with fMRI results in the frontal and parietal brain regions. FMRI activations were found in: middle frontal gyrus, insula, SMA, parietal lobule, thalamus, and cerebellum. Our modified oddball task provided ERP-fMRI results with high level of significance (EEG SNR = 35, fMRI p < 0.05-Bonf.). ERPs obtained in the scanner were comparable with those registered outside the scanner, although some differences in the amplitude were noticed, mainly in the N100 component. In our opinion the presented paradigm may be successfully applied for simultaneous ERP-fMRI registration of neural correlates of attention in vulnerable populations.

In this study, a specific decomposition known as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used, in order to retrieve the task-related activity from the raw signals. Using visual detection task data, acquired in normal circumstances and simultaneously with fMRI, differences between distinct task-related conditions can be captured in the trial signatures of specific PARAFAC components when applied to ERP data arranged in Channels?x?Time?x?Trials arrays, but the signatures did not correlate with the fMRI data. Despite the need for parameter tuning and careful preprocessing, the approach is shown to be successful, especially when prior knowledge about the expected ERPs is incorporated.

Interval feature extraction for classification of event-related potentials (ERP) in EEG data analysis	PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Pattern recognition; EEG; Feature extraction; Event-related potentials (ERP); Interval features; Fast correlation-based filter (FCBF)	ENSEMBLE	Event-related potential data can be used to index perceptual and cognitive operations. However, they are typically high-dimensional and noisy. This study examines the original raw data and six feature-extraction methods as a pre-processing step before classification. Four traditionally used feature-extraction methods were considered: principal component analysis, independent component analysis, auto-regression, and wavelets. We add to these a less well-known method called interval feature extraction. It overproduces features from the ERP signal and then eliminates irrelevant and redundant features by the fast correlation-based filter. To make the comparisons fair, the other feature-extraction methods were also run with the filter. An experiment on two EEG datasets (four classification scenarios) was carried out to examine the classification accuracy of four classifiers on the extracted features: support vector machines with linear and perceptron kernel, the nearest neighbour classifier and the random forest ensemble method. The interval features led to the best classification accuracy in most of the configurations, specifically when used with the Random Forest classifier ensemble.

COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND EXPERIENCE CORRELATES OF SPEECH QUALITY PERCEPTION IN COMPLEX LISTENING CONDITIONS	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAY 26-31, 2013	Vancouver, CANADA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Signal Proc Soc		Electroencephalography; reverberation; speech quality assessment; Quality-of-Experience; emotions		Subjective speech quality assessment depends on listener "quality" opinions after hearing a particular test speech stimulus. Subjective scores are given based on a perception and quality judgment process that is unique to a particular listener. These processes are postulated to be dependent on the listener's internal reference of what good and bad quality sounds like, as well as their mental and emotional states. To overcome this variability, subjective listening tests often average scores over several listeners. In this paper, we use electroencephalography (EEG) and self-assessment tools to investigate the neural and affective correlates of speech quality perception of reverberant speech, with the goal of obtaining new insights into human speech quality perception in complex listening environments. We show that EEG event related potentials (ERP) are a useful tool to monitor the conscious stages of neural-processing during a speech quality assessment task. Significant correlations were obtained between the so-called P300 ERP component and the reverberation time of the room, as well as between the P300 peak amplitude and emotional self-assessment ratings. These insights could lead to more effective ways of characterizing room acoustics for improved speech quality and intelligibility.

Brain imaging differences among single domain subgroups of MCI were recently reported supporting the idea that electroencephalography (EEG) functional hallmarks can be used to differentiate these subgroups. We performed event-related potential (ERP) measures and independent component analysis in 18 sd-aMCI, 13 sd-dMCI and 35 nnd-aMCI cases during the successful performance of the Attentional Network Test. Sensitivity and specificity analyses of ERP for the discrimination of MCI subgroups were also made. In center-cue and spatial-cue warning stimuli, contingent negative variation (CNV) was elicited in all MCI subgroups. Two independent components (ICA1 and 2) were superimposed in the time range on the CNV. The ICA2 was strongly reduced in sd-dMCI compared to sd-aMCI and nnd-aMCI (4.3 vs. 7.5% and 10.9% of the CNV component). The parietal P300 ERP latency increased significantly in sd-dMCI compared to md-aMCI and sd-aMCI for both congruent and incongruent conditions. This latency for incongruent targets allowed for a highly accurate separation of sd-dMCI from both sd-aMCI and nnd-aMCI with correct classification rates of 90 and 81%, respectively. This EEG parameter alone performed much better than neuropsychological testing in distinguishing sd-dMCI from md-aMCI. Our data reveal qualitative changes in the composition of the neural generators of CNV in sd-dMCI. In addition, they document an increased latency of the executive P300 component that may represent a highly accurate hallmark for the discrimination of this MCI subgroup in routine clinical settings.

As a result, researchers have turned to functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques with the goal of developing more effective methods of detecting awareness and assessing cognition in these patients. This article reviews functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroenchphalography (EEG)-based studies of cognition and consciousness in DOC, including assessment of basic sensory, perceptual, language, and emotional processing; studies for detection of conscious awareness; paradigms for the establishment of communication in the absence of behaviour; and functional connectivity studies. The advantages and limitations of fMRI and EEG-based measures are examined as research and clinical tools in this population and an explanation offered for the rediscovery of the unique advantages of EEG in the study of DOC.

A Study of Evoked Potentials From Ear-EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Auditory steady-state response (ASSR); ear-EEG; event-related potentials; evoked potentials (EP); steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)		A method for brain monitoring based on measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) from electrodes placed in-the-ear (ear-EEG) was recently proposed. The objective of this study is to further characterize the ear-EEG and perform a rigorous comparison against conventional on-scalp EEG. This is achieved for both auditory and visual evoked responses, over steady-state and transient paradigms, and across a population of subjects. The respective steady-state responses are evaluated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and statistical significance, while the qualitative analysis of the transient responses is performed by considering grand averaged event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. The outcomes of this study demonstrate conclusively that the ear-EEG signals, in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, are on par with conventional EEG recorded from electrodes placed over the temporal region.

Methods: Seventy medication-naive ADHD patients aged 7-16 years were tested with QEEG, including a go/no-go task condition (VCPT) from which behavior data and ERPs were extracted, followed by a systematic trial on stimulant medication lasting at least 4 weeks. Based on data from rating scales and interviews, two psychologists who were blind to the QEEG/ERP test results independently rated the patients as having no or small side effects (n = 37) or troublesome side effects (n = 33). We determined if the side effects were related to sex, age, IQ, ADHD subtype, comorbidities, clinical outcome, and variables in QEEG, ERPs, and VCPT. Results: There was a moderate negative correlation between clinical outcome and side effects. Three variables were significantly associated with side effects in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the ERP independent component - contingent negative variation - which reflected action preparation and time evaluation, patients with high amplitudes (close to normal values) experienced more side effects than patients with lower amplitudes. A faster-than-normal reaction time in VCPT was associated with side effects, as was a high amplitude in an early ERP component (early visual independent component), reported to be influenced by attention, perceptual sensitivity, and anxiety. Conclusion: The group with troublesome side effects had normal action-preparation electrical brain activity, a faster-than-normal reaction time, and an increased level of anxiety (measured by ERP) compared with the no side-effects group.

We focused on even-trelated potentials (ERPs) during the retention interval and revealed a sustained fronto-central ERP component (most likely a sustained anterior negativity; SAN) that became more negative as memory load increased. Our results are consistent with recent ERP studies on the retention of pitch and suggest that the SAN reflects brain activity mediating the low-level retention of basic acoustic features in ASTM. The present work shows that the retention of timbre shares common features with the retention of pitch, hence supporting the notion that the retention of basic sensory features is an active process that recruits modality-specific brain areas.

C145 as a Short-Latency Electrophysiological Index of Cognitive Compensation in Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; brain plasticity; C145; compensatory mechanisms; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; event-related potentials; principal components analysis; short-latency ERP component	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; NOVELTY; ABNORMALITIES; INFORMATION	Brain plasticity and cognitive compensation in the elderly are of increasing interest, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) offers an opportunity to elucidate how the brain may overcome damage. We provide neurophysiological evidence of a short-latency event-related potential (ERP) component (C145) linked to stimulus relevancy that may reflect cognitive compensation in early-stage AD. Thirty-six subjects with early-stage, mild AD and 36 like-aged normal elderly (controls) had their EEG recorded while performing our Number-Letter task, a cognitive/perceptual paradigm that manipulates stimulus relevancies. ERP components, including C145, were extracted from ERPs using principal components analysis. C145 amplitudes and spatial distributions were compared among controls, AD subjects with high performance on the Number-Letter task, and AD subjects with low performance. Compared to AD subjects, control subjects showed enhanced C145 processing of visual stimuli in the occipital region where differential processing of relevant stimuli occurred. AD high performers recruited central brain areas in processing task relevancy. Controls and AD low performers did not show a significant task relevancy effect in these areas. We conclude that short-latency ERP components can detect electrophysiological differences in early-stage AD that reflect altered cognition. Differences in C145 amplitudes between AD and normal elderly groups regarding brain locations and types of task effects suggest compensatory mechanisms can occur in the AD brain to overcome loss of normal functionality, and this early compensation may have a profound effect on the cognitive efficiency of AD individuals.

Previous work on neuro-driving has been shown that neural activity related with emergency situations while driving generates a different characteristic spatio-temporal event-related potential (ERP) pattern compared to normal state [1]. In this paper, on the basis of those study, three kinds of emergency situations are designed to discriminate ERP patterns between a variety of emergencies and normal driving situation. Based on comparison analysis based on KU and BBCI dataset, it is believed that the proposed framework can be considered as a novel EEG-based automatic perception technique for upcoming emergency situations.

Because of differing methodological constraints, the comparability of the observed effects remains unclear. To directly compare EEG and fMRI effects and neural sources of semantic priming, we conducted a semantic word-picture priming experiment while measuring EEG and fMRI simultaneously. The visually presented primes were pseudowords, words unrelated to the target, semantically related words and the identical names of the target. Distributed source analysis of the event-related potentials (ERPs) successfully revealed a large effect of semantic prime-target relatedness (the N400 effect), which was driven by activations in a left-temporal source region. However, no significantly differing activations between priming conditions were found in the fMRI data. Our results support the notion that, for joint interpretations of existing EEG and fMRI studies of semantic priming, we need to fully appreciate the respective methodological limitations. Second, they show that simultaneous EEG-fMRI, including ERP source localization, is a feasible and promising methodological advancement for the investigation of higher-cognitive processes. Third, they substantiate the finding that, compared to fMRI, ERPs are often more sensitive to subtle cognitive effects.

Interactions Between Pre-Processing and Classification Methods for Event-Related-Potential Classification	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; BCI; Decoding; LDA; Spatial filtering; Spectral filtering	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	Detecting event related potentials (ERPs) from single trials is critical to the operation of many stimulus-driven brain computer interface (BCI) systems. The low strength of the ERP signal compared to the noise (due to artifacts and BCI irrelevant brain processes) makes this a challenging signal detection problem. Previous work has tended to focus on how best to detect a single ERP type (such as the visual oddball response). However, the underlying ERP detection problem is essentially the same regardless of stimulus modality (e.g. visual or tactile), ERP component (e.g. P300 oddball response, or the error-potential), measurement system or electrode layout. To investigate whether a single ERP detection method might work for a wider range of ERP BCIs we compare detection performance over a large corpus of more than 50 ERP BCI datasets whilst systematically varying the electrode montage, spectral filter, spatial filter and classifier training methods. We identify an interesting interaction between spatial whitening and regularised classification which made detection performance independent of the choice of spectral filter low-pass frequency. Our results show that pipeline consisting of spectral filtering, spatial whitening, and regularised classification gives near maximal performance in all cases. Importantly, this pipeline is simple to implement and completely automatic with no expert feature selection or parameter tuning required. Thus, we recommend this combination as a "best-practice" method for ERP detection problems.

ERP is one of the electroencephalography (EEG), which is measured the change of brain waves after giving patients certain stimulations instead of resting state. However, with traditional statistical analysis method, both P50 and MMN showed significant difference between controls and patients but not in Gamma band. Gamma band is a 30-50 Hz auditory stimulation which had been suggested may be abnormal in schizophrenia patients. Our data are recruited from 5 schizophrenia patients and 5 controls in National Taiwan University Hospital have been tested with this platform. The results showed that detection rate is 88.24% and we also analyzed the importance of features, including Standard Deviation (SD) and Total Variation (TotalVar) in different stage of wavelet transform. Therefore, this proposed methodology could serve as a valuable clinical decision support for physiologists in evaluating schizophrenia.

The experiment was conducted on a high fidelity driving simulator. Three different scenarios were designed to investigate the driver's state during normally driving (braking and accelerating) and turning (left or right). In the daily-urban scenario, a deer collision occurred. During each driving trial, the EEG signal was recorded by a 32-lead system. The EEG dynamics were analyzed using power spectrum density (PSD), event-related potential (ERP), independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency analysis (TFA). In normally driving, the EEG responses are similar during the three different scenarios. The power concentrates on the frontal and back lobes. During turning, the EEG response is somehow different from that in normally driving (only braking and accelerating). In the deer-collision event, a rapid response is apparent in the ERP mapping.

Combined results of event-related lateralizations (ERLs) and a newly derived measure from wavelet analyses that we applied on the raw EEG and individual event-related potentials (ERPs), the lateralized power spectra (LPS) and the LPS-ERP, respectively, confirmed the common view that endogenous orienting operates by anterior processes, probably originating from the frontal eye fields, modulating processing in parietal and occipital areas. The LPS data indicated that modulation takes place by increased inhibition of the irrelevant visual field and/or disinhibition of the relevant to-be-attended visual field. Combined use of ERLs, the LPS, and the LPS-ERP indicated that most of the involved processes can be characterized as externally evoked, either or not with clear individual differences as some evoked effects were only visible in the LPS-ERP, whereas few processes seemed to have an internally induced nature. Use of the LPS and the LPS-ERP may be advantageous as it enables to determine the involvement of internally generated lateralized processes that are not strictly bound to an event like stimulus onset	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Some intracranial EEG studies demonstrated that the amplitude of this hippocampal potential was greater in response to stimuli requiring an overt motor response, in comparison with stimuli for which no motor response is required. These findings could indicate that hippocampal-evoked activity is related to movement execution as well as stimulus evaluation and associated memory processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal relationship between the hippocampal negative potential latency and motor responses. We analyzed ERPs recorded with 22 depth electrodes implanted into the hippocampi of 11 epileptic patients. Subjects were instructed to press a button after the presentation of a tone. All investigated hippocampi generated a prominent negative ERP peaking at approximate to 420 ms. In 16 from 22 cases, we found that the ERP latency did not correlate with the reaction time; in different subjects, this potential could either precede or follow the motor response. Our results indicate that the hippocampal negative ERP occurs independently of motor execution. We suggest that hippocampal-evoked activity, recorded in a simple sensorimotor task, is related to the evaluation of stimulus meaning within the context of situation. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We gathered baseline ERP data from two MCI groups (those taking AD medications and those not) and later determined which subjects developed AD (Convert-> AD) and which subjects remained cognitively stable (Stable). We utilized a previously developed and validated multivariate system of ERP components to measure medication effects among these four subgroups. Discriminant analysis produced classification scores for each individual as a measure of similarity to each clinical group (Convert-> AD, Stable), and we found a large significant main Group effect but no main AD Medications effect and no Group by Medications interaction. This suggested AD medications have negligible influence on this set of ERP components as weighted markers of disease progression. These results provide practical information to those using ERP measures as a biomarker to identify and track AD in individuals in a clinical or research setting.

However, the neural basis underlying the effects of musical training on rapid plasticity in auditory processing has not been systematically studied. Here, the rapid (one session) learning-related plastic changes in event-related potential (ERP) responses for pitch and duration deviants between passive blocks were compared between musicians and nonmusicians. Passive blocks were interleaved with an active discrimination task. In addition to musicians having faster and stronger overall source activation for deviating sounds, source analysis revealed rapid plastic changes in the left and right temporal and left frontal sources that were present only in musicians. Source activation decreased in these areas even without focused attention. Furthermore, deviant-related ERP responses above the parietal areas decreased after the active task in both musicians and nonmusicians. Taken together, the results indicate enhanced rapid plasticity in sound change discrimination and perceptual learning in musicians when compared with nonmusicians. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

EEG/ERP Adaptive Noise Canceller Design with Controlled Search Space (CSS) Approach in Cuckoo and Other Optimization Algorithms	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Adaptive noise canceler; EEG/ERP; COA; PSO; ABC; evolutionary techniques	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL; BRAIN; REDUCTION; FILTERS; ERP	This paper explores the migration of adaptive filtering with swarm intelligence/evolutionary techniques employed in the field of electroencephalogram/event-related potential noise cancellation or extraction. A new approach is proposed in the form of controlled search space to stabilize the randomness of swarm intelligence techniques especially for the EEG signal. Swarm-based algorithms such as Particles Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm with their variants are implemented to design optimized adaptive noise canceler. The proposed controlled search space technique is tested on each of the swarm intelligence techniques and is found to be more accurate and powerful. Adaptive noise canceler with traditional algorithms such as least-mean-square, normalized least-mean-square, and recursive least-mean-square algorithms are also implemented to compare the results. ERP signals such as simulated visual evoked potential, real visual evoked potential, and real sensorimotor evoked potential are used, due to their physiological importance in various EEG studies. Average computational time and shape measures of evolutionary techniques are observed 8.21E-01 sec and 1.73E-01, respectively. Though, traditional algorithms take negligible time consumption, but are unable to offer good shape preservation of ERP, noticed as average computational time and shape measure difference, 1.41E-02 sec and 2.60E+00, respectively.

Spatial and temporal features of superordinate semantic processing studied with fMRI and EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						semantic processing; modality independent; superordinate categorization; fMRI; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; OBJECT CATEGORIZATION; MULTIPLE SEMANTICS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; WORD REPETITION; ANGULAR GYRUS	The relationships between the anatomical representation of semantic knowledge in the human brain and the timing of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in manipulating such information remain unclear. This is the case for superordinate semantic categorization-the extraction of general features shared by broad classes of exemplars (e.g., living vs. non-living semantic categories). We proposed that, because of the abstract nature of this information, input from diverse input modalities (visual or auditory, lexical or non-lexical) should converge and be processed in the same regions of the brain, at similar time scales during superordinate categorization-specifically in a network of heteromodal regions, and late in the course of the categorization process. In order to test this hypothesis, we utilized electroencephalography and event related potentials (EEG/ERP) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize subjects' responses as they made superordinate categorical decisions (living vs. non-living) about objects presented as visual pictures or auditory words. Our results reveal that, consistent with our hypothesis, during the course of superordinate categorization, information provided by these diverse inputs appears to converge in both time and space: fMRI showed that heteromodal areas of the parietal and temporal cortices are active during categorization of both classes of stimuli. The ERP results suggest that superordinate categorization is reflected as a late positive component (LPC) with a parietal distribution and long latencies for both stimulus types. Within the areas and times in which modality independent responses were identified, some differences between living and non-living categories were observed, with a more widespread spatial extent and longer latency responses for categorization of non-living items.

Equally, there have been many reports of equivocal findings in this area. The current study sought to further investigate behavioural and electro-physiological measures of this executive function in ecstasy users. Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-na < ve controls were recruited. Participants completed background questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a semantic retrieval task whilst 64 channel Electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences in behavioural performance on the task. Mixed ANOVA on event-related potential (ERP) components P2, N2 and P3 revealed significant between-group differences in the N2 component. Subsequent exploratory univariate ANOVAs on the N2 component revealed marginally significant between-group differences, generally showing greater negativity at occipito-parietal electrodes in ecstasy users compared to drug-na < ve controls. Despite absence of behavioural differences, differences in N2 magnitude are evidence of abnormal executive functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users.	[Roberts, C. A.; Fairclough, S. H.; Fisk, J.

Assessment of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and associated event-related potentials (ERPs; derived from averaged EEG activity in response to a stimulus) in the context of MDD has provided insights into the electrocortical abnormalities associated with the disorder. Importantly, EEG and ERPs also have emerged as candidates for predicting and optimizing antidepressant (AD) treatment outcome. This is critical in light of relatively low remission rates or a limited response to initial AD interventions. In contrast to other neuroimaging approaches, EEG and ERPs may be superior for predicting and monitoring AD response, as electrocortical measures are relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and have excellent temporal (that is, millisecond) resolution, enabling fine-grained assessment of basic cognitive and emotive processes. This review aims to highlight the most consistently noted EEG and ERP features in MDD, which may one day assist with diagnostic confirmation, as well as the potential clinical utility of specific electrocortical measures in aiding with response prediction.

Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have proved useful in investigating the role of auditory processing in cognitive disorders such as developmental dyslexia, specific language impairment (SLI), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and autism. However, laboratory recordings of auditory ERPs can be lengthy, uncomfortable, or threatening for some participants-particularly children. Recently, a commercial gaming electroencephalography (EEG) system has been developed that is portable, inexpensive, and easy to set up. In this study we tested if auditory ERPs measured using a gaming EEG system(Emotiv EPOC (R), www.emotiv.com) were equivalent to those measured by a widely-used, laboratory-based, research EEG system(Neuroscan). Methods. We simultaneously recorded EEGs with the research and gaming EEG systems, whilst presenting 21 adults with 566 standard (1000 Hz) and 100 deviant (1200 Hz) tones under passive (non-attended) and active (attended) conditions. The onset of each tone was marked in the EEGs using a parallel port pulse (Neuroscan) or a stimulus-generated electrical pulse injected into the O1 and O2 channels (Emotiv EPOC (R)). These markers were used to calculate research and gaming EEG systemlate auditory ERPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 peaks) and the mismatch negativity (MMN) in active and passive listening conditions for each participant. Results. Analyses were restricted to frontal sites as these are most commonly reported in auditory ERP research. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) indicated that the morphology of the research and gaming EEG system late auditory ERP waveforms were similar across all participants, but that the research and gaming EEG system MMN waveforms were only similar for participants with non-noisy MMN waveforms (N = 11 out of 21). Peak amplitude and latency measures revealed no significant differences between the size or the timing of the auditory P1, N1, P2, N2, P3, and MMN peaks. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the gaming EEG system may prove a valid alternative to laboratory ERP systems for recording reliable late auditory ERPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, and the P3) over the frontal cortices. In the future, the gaming EEG system may also prove useful for measuring less reliable ERPs, such as the MMN, if the reliability of such ERPs can be boosted to the same level as late auditory ERPs.

Two subtypes of P3 potentials are well known, P3a and P3b. The P3a potential occurring in response to non-target, novels has a more centro-frontal topography in contrast to the parietal P3b of the target responses in the three-stimulus (novelty) paradigm. The P3a potential is assumed to reflect passive, involuntary switching of attention or orienting, while P3b potential is related to selective attention and memory updating processes. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of novel stimuli on the ERP responses to target stimuli, especially P3b component, in auditory three-stimulus paradigm. Material and Method: ERPs were recorded via 30 electrodes with auditory three-stimulus paradigm from fifteen healthy volunteers. Intervals between novel and target stimuli were randomly varying among 4, 6, and 10 s. Also, for each novel-to-target interval groups' target-to-target intervals were randomly varying among 14, 16, and 18 s with a mean value of 15.8 s. The amplitude and latency of ERP responses to target stimuli in each interval group were measured and analyzed by repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA). Results: The amplitudes of N1 and N2 potential were significantly different among the novel-to-target intervals (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in amplitudes and latencies of P3b among the intervals groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that time-based localization changes of novel stimuli between two target stimuli do not affect the P3b response.

So a common spatial filter can be applied to extract the component of interest in each condition and enhance its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, a spatial filter was employed to measure the latency shift of an ERP component across multi-experimental conditions. The latency shift can be meausred using cross-correlation function from the EEG data after spatial filtering. The simulation showed that the proposed method is more accurate than the conventional methods. Even when SNR of ERP decreased to -15dB, the mean error of the proposed method was 1.36ms. The latency difference of N170 under upright face and inverted face stimuli measured by the proposed method was 6.7 +/- 0.7ms, whose variance was much smaller than that in previous reports.

Recently, studies have suggested that there is alcohol-related information in the non-stimulus-phase-locked (induced) theta TF activity. We applied TF analysis to target stimulus event-related EEG recorded during an oddball task from 41 long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) and 74 nonalcoholic controls (NAC) to investigate the relationship between P3b, evoked theta, and induced theta activity. Results showed that an event-related synchronization (ERS) of induced theta (1) was larger in LTAA compared to NAC, and (2) was sensitive to differences between LTAA and NAC groups that was independent of the differences accounted for by P3b amplitude or evoked theta. These findings suggest that increased induced theta ERS may likely be a biomarker for a morbid effect of alcohol abuse on brain function.

However, how the two conditions are pathologically connected is not completely understood. Similar neurophysiological abnormalities have been reported in both DM and MDD, including elevated electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in low-frequency slow waves and increased latency and/or reduced amplitude of event-related potentials. It is possible that this association reflects some common underlying pathology, and it has been proposed that diabetes may place patients at risk for depression through a biological mechanism linking the metabolic changes of DM to changes in the central nervous system. In this review we will discuss EEG abnormalities in DM, as well as the biological mechanisms underlying various EEG parameters, in order to evaluate whether or not a common EEG biosignature exists between DM and MDD. Identifying such commonalities could significantly inform the current understanding of the mechanisms that subserve the development of the two conditions.

Electrophysiological and behavioral responses to ketamine in mice with reduced Akt1 expression	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; ERSP; ITC; P50; N100; Evoked-potential; Gamma; Theta; Ketamine; Drug abuse	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GAMMA; ABNORMALITIES; EEG; THETA; P50; INHIBITION	A number of studies have associated reduced Akt1 expression with vulnerability for schizophrenia. Although mice with deletion of a single copy of the Akt1 gene (Akt1(+/-)) show reduced Akt1 expression relative to wild-type (WT) animals, the extent to which these mice show schizophrenia-like phenotypic changes and/or increased susceptibility to epigenetic or non-genetic factors related to schizophrenia is unknown. Mutant mice were assessed on electroencephalographic/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) and behavioral (acoustic startle and pre-pulse inhibition) measures relevant to schizophrenia. Mice were also assessed following exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a potent psychotomimetic drug, in order to assess the role of reduced Akt1 expression as a vulnerability factor for schizophrenia. Methods Akt1(+/-), Akt1(-/-), and WT mice received a series of paired-click, white noise stimuli, following ketamine (50 mg/kg) and saline injections. EEG was analyzed for ERPs and event-related power. Akt1(+/-) and WT mice were also assessed on PPI following ketamine (50 mg/kg) or saline injection. Akt1(+/-) and Akt1(-/-) mice displayed reduced amplitude of the P20 component of the ERP to the first click of a paired-click stimulus, as well as reduced S1-S2 difference for P20 and N40 components, following ketamine. Mutant mice also showed increased reduction in gamma synchrony and theta suppression following ketamine. Akt1(+/-) mice displayed reduced pre-pulse inhibition. Reduced genetic expression of Akt1 facilitated ketamine-induced changes of EEG and behavior in mice, suggesting that reduced Akt1 expression can serve as a vulnerability factor for schizophrenia.

Cognitive electrophysiology, in particular, allows the identification of components in a mental processing architecture. The present chapter reviews findings in the neurocognitive psychology of aesthetics, or neuroaesthetics, that have been obtained with the method of event-related brain potentials, as derived from the human electroencephalogram. The cognitive-perceptual bases as well as affective substages of aesthetic processing have been investigated and those are described here. The event-related potential method allows for the identification of mental processing modes in cognitive and aesthetic processing. It also provides an assessment of the mental chronometry of cognitive and affective stages in aesthetic appreciation. As the work described here shows, distinct processes in the brain are engaged in aesthetic judgments.

A fast and reliable single-trial ERP detection method can be used to develop a BCI system with both high speed and high accuracy. However, most of single-trial ERP detection methods are developed for offline EEG analysis and thus have a high computational complexity and need manual operations. Therefore, they are not applicable to practical BCI systems, which require a low-complexity and automatic ERP detection method. This work presents a joint spatial-time-frequency filter that combines common spatial patterns (CSP) and wavelet filtering (WF) for improving the signal-to-noise (SNR) of visual evoked potentials (VEP), which can lead to a single-trial ERP-based BCI.

We used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to identify and delineate the temporal characteristics in the electrophysiological cascade related to fearful facial affect processing in patients with schizophrenia as compared to healthy controls. Methods: Twenty-four subjects with schizophrenia and 24 individually matched healthy controls participated in an emotion recognition task. Ekman faces displaying neutral and fearful facial expressions were used as stimuli. ERPs were recorded using a 128-channel EEG system. Results: Based on the analysis of Global Field Power (GFP) in the 150-190 ms time window both groups differentiated between fearful and neutral faces. Schizophrenia patients showed an additional differential processing of fearful vs. neutral faces in the 330-450 ms time window, and this ERP effect correlated with psychopathology. Conclusions: Both patients and healthy controls differentiate fearful and neutral faces in early phases of emotion processing. Our results also indicate that schizophrenia patients show increased responsivity to fearful faces at a later processing stage. This could be related to the overrating of negative emotions, and the symptomatology associated with fear processing in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper a multiple classifier approach to discover these events in the bioelectrical signal and with them whether or not a subject has recognized a particular pattern, is employed. Dealing with noisy data as well as heavily imbalanced target class distributions are among the difficulties encountered. Our approach utilizes partitions of electrodes to create robust and meaningful individual classifiers, which are then subsequently combined using decision fusion. Furthermore, a classifier selection approach using genetic algorithms is evaluated and used for optimization. The proposed approach utilizing information fusion shows promising results (over 0.8 area under the ROC curve).

Detection of concealed information by P3 and frontal EEG asymmetry	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Concealed Information Test (CIT); Frontal EEG asymmetry; Withdrawal motivation; Event-related potential (ERP); P3	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; CURVES; FMRI	Psychophysiological detection of deception has seen increased attention in both research and applied settings. In this field, the most scientifically validated paradigm is the Concealed Information Test (CIT). The CIT does not directly deal with whether a participant is lying, but examines whether a participant recognizes a critical relevant detail, inferred by differences in physiological responses between critical and non-critical items. Although event-related potential (ERP) approaches to the CIT have shown high accuracy, a combination of measures might improve the test's performance. We thus assessed whether a new CIT index, frontal EEG asymmetry that is supposed to reflect differences in approach/withdrawal motivation, would prove useful. Nineteen participants were asked to steal one item in a mock crime, and were then administered two CITs while concealing the stolen item. One CIT included the stolen item (i.e., guilty condition), whereas the other CIT did not (i.e., innocent condition). In the guilty condition, the concealed stolen item elicited greater relative left frontal alpha activity (indicative of relative right frontal cortical activity) as compared to the other items, suggesting that the recognition of the concealed item might have induced withdrawal motivation. Although the discrimination between guilty and innocent conditions by the asymmetry score alone was not as good as that by the ERP P3 index, combining the asymmetry score and P3 improved the detection performance significantly. The results suggest that the frontal EEG asymmetry can be used as a new measure in the CIT that provides additional information beyond that captured by the traditional ERP index.

In this event-related potential (ERP) study, children and adults aged 4-30years produced vocalizations while exposed to frequency-altered feedback. Vocal pitch variability and the latency of vocal responses were found to differ as a function of age. ERP responses indexed by the P1-N1-P2 complex were also modulated as a function of age. P1 amplitudes decreased with age, whereas N1 and P2 amplitudes increased with age. In addition, a correlation between vocal variability and N1 amplitudes was found, suggesting a complex interaction between behavioural and neurological responses to frequency-altered feedback. These results suggest that the neural systems that integrate auditory feedback during vocal motor control undergo robust changes with age and physiological development.

Separating mismatch negativity (MMN) response from auditory obligatory brain responses in school-aged children	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Language; Speech; Children; Infants; EEG; ERP; MMN; EQ paradigm; Vowel	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; PITCH CHANGE; READING DISABILITIES; TEMPORAL COMPONENTS; SENSORY MEMORY; ERP COMPONENTS; MATURATION; SPEECH; PERCEPTION	Mismatch negativity (MMN) overlaps with other auditory event-related potential (ERP) components. We examined the ERPs of 50 9- to 11-year-old children for vowels /i/, /y/ and equivalent complex tones. The goal was to separate MMN from obligatory ERP components using principal component analysis and equal probability control condition. In addition to the contrast of the deviant minus standard response, we employed the contrast of the deviant minus control response, to see whether the obligatory processing contributes to MMN in children. When looking for differences in speech deviant minus standard contrast, MMN starts around 112ms. However, when both contrasts are examined, MMN emerges for speech at 160ms whereas for nonspeech MMN is observed at 112ms regardless of contrast. We argue that this discriminative response to speech stimuli at 112ms is obligatory in nature rather than reflecting change detection processing.

Precisely, we here simulated three kinds of realistic emergency situations instead of only one as considered in Haufe et aI., 2011. For each of the three situations, the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data reveals a different characteristic spatio-temporal event-related poten tial (ERP) sequence. For all stimuli, topographical maps of area under the curve (AUC) scores related to the discrimination between emergency and normal driving situations show a significant positive deflection in parietal regions about 300ms post-stimulus. Thus, it is possible to predict different emergency situations from EEG before the actual braking. A classification analysis indeed reveals that EEG-based emergency braking detection can be performance faster than electromyography-or pedal-based detection, while being as robust.

The most commonly used method for assessing ERD/ERS consists on the evaluation of EEG power changes upon the event onset in relation to the baseline, reflecting increased/decreased synchronization. Phase synchronization measures have also been used for this purpose, both across event trials as well as between pairs of electrodes. Here, we propose a 2D spatially continuous extension of the Phase Locking Factor (PLF) metric for ERD/ERS quantification, called PLF Field (PLFF), based on measuring spatial variations of the EEG phase. A continuous phase map is estimated from the discrete set of EEG traces by using the Hilbert transform in the analytical signals framework. The synchronization at each arbitrary spatial location on the scalp space is then computed from the magnitude of the phase gradient at that location. The method is illustrated with EEG data obtained in two motor tasks paradigms. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is largely consistent with the conventional power-based ERD/ERS method, but may provide additional information in studies of neuronal synchronization using EEG.

Good classification performance of the ERP-based BCI usually requires sufficient data recordings for effective training of the LDA classifier, and hence a long system calibration time which however may depress the system practicability and cause the users resistance to the BCI system. In this study, we introduce a spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA) to ERP classification. As a multiway extension of the LDA, the STDA method tries tomaximize the discriminant information between target and nontarget classes through finding two projection matrices from spatial and temporal dimensions collaboratively, which reduces effectively the feature dimensionality in the discriminant analysis, and hence decreases significantly the number of required training samples. The proposed STDA method was validated with dataset II of the BCI Competition III and dataset recorded from our own experiments, and compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for ERP classification. Online experiments were additionally implemented for the validation. The superior classification performance in using few training samples shows that the STDA is effective to reduce the system calibration time and improve the classification accuracy, thereby enhancing the practicability of ERP-based BCI.

Participants viewed each 50 paintings, filtering-distorted versions of these paintings and plain colour stimuli under free-viewing conditions whilst the EEG was recorded from 64 channels. Results revealed P3b-/LPC-like bilateral posterior event-related potentials (ERP) that were larger over the right hemisphere than over the left hemisphere. Art expertise correlated negatively with the amplitude of the ERP responses to paintings and control stimuli. We conclude that art expertise is associated with reduced ERP responses to visual stimuli in general that can be considered to reflect increased neural efficiency due to extensive practice in the contemplation of visual art.

Prestimulus delta and theta determinants of ERP responses in the Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP; ERP genesis; Delta; Theta; Auditory Go/NoGo; Cognitive processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VERTEX RESPONSE; P300; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY	Ongoing low-frequency EEG activity has long been associated with ERP components and their cognitive processing interpretations, yet few studies have directly investigated the prestimulus low-frequency EEG-ERP relationships, particularly within the auditory domain. The present study assessed the delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) bands individually, and their prestimulus influence on five subsequent components (P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3) within an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm. At the nine central sites, accepted trials were sorted according to their ascending vertex prestimulus spectral band amplitude, and ERPs were derived from the upper and lower sorted thirds. The within-subjects analyses included amplitudes and latencies for both Go and NoGo responses, and Go response speed. Only component amplitudes showed effects of high/low prestimulus EEG level. Delta globally modulated the five components - all amplitudes were more positive with high prestimulus delta, regardless of stimulus condition. Theta did not influence P1, but inversely modulated P2 and P3 regionally, and produced stimulus-specific effects in N1, N2, and P3. Low prestimulus theta produced greater NoGo N2 and Go P3, and reduced NoGo P3 responses, each of these suggesting appropriately enhanced cognitive processing. Taken together, these effect patterns differentially implicate prestimulus delta and theta band activity in the determination of ERP component amplitudes and the cognitive processing associated with them.

Based on this experimental design, the present study aimed at investigating the spatio-temporal processing of static and dynamic emotional facial expressions in 19 healthy women by means of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERP) and fMRI-constrained regional source analyses. ERP analysis showed an increased amplitude of the LPP (late posterior positivity) over centro-parietal regions for static facial expressions of disgust compared to neutral faces. In addition, the LPP was more widespread and temporally prolonged for dynamic compared to static faces of disgust and happiness. fMRI constrained source analysis on static emotional face stimuli indicated the spatio-temporal modulation of predominantly posterior regional brain activation related to the visual processing stream for both emotional valences when compared to the neutral condition in the fusiform gyrus. The spatio-temporal processing of dynamic stimuli yielded enhanced source activity for emotional compared to neutral conditions in temporal (e. g., fusiform gyrus), and frontal regions (e. g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex, medial and inferior frontal cortex) in early and again in later time windows. The present data support the view that dynamic facial displays trigger more information reflected in complex neural networks, in particular because of their changing features potentially triggering sustained activation related to a continuing evaluation of those faces. A combined fMRI and EEG approach thus provides an advanced insight to the spatio-temporal characteristics of emotional face processing, by also revealing additional neural generators, not identifiable by the only use of an fMRI approach.

Recently, these responses have been associated with activations in or very close to sensory cortices, suggesting the involvement of basic sensory mechanisms in the detection of syntactic violations. The present study investigated whether intact auditory cortices and adjacent temporal regions are sufficient to generate early syntactic negativities in the auditory event-related potential (ERP). We tested ten clinically non-aphasic patients with left inferior frontal lesions, but intact temporal cortices in a passive auditory ERP paradigm that had reliably elicited early negativities in response to violations of subject-verb agreement and word category in the past. Subject-verb agreement violations failed to elicit early grammaticality effects in these patients, whereas a group of ten age-matched controls showed a reliable early negativity. This finding supports the idea that sensory aspects of syntactic analysis as reflected in early syntactic negativities critically depend on top-down predictions generated by the left inferior frontal cortex. In contrast, word category violations elicited a small, marginally significant early negativity both in controls and patients, suggesting an additional involvement of temporal regions in early phrase structure processing. In an additional auditory oddball experiment patients showed a regular P300, but no N2b component in response to deviant tones, indicating that their deficit in generating sensory predictions extends beyond the language domain.

We here extend this approach to Synthetic Event-Related Potentials (Synthetic ERP). Although the method is of general applicability, we focus on ERP correlates of language processing in the human brain. The method has two components: Phase 1: To generate cortical electro-magnetic source activity from neural or schema network models: and Phase 2:10 generate known neurolinguistic ERP data (ERP scalp voltage topographies and waveforms) from putative cortical source distributions and activities within a realistic anatomical model of the human brain and head. To illustrate the challenges of Phase 2 of the methodology, spatiotemporal information from Friederici's 2002 model of auditory language comprehension was used to define cortical regions and time courses of activation for implementation within a forward model of ERP data. The cortical regions from the 2002 model were modeled using atlas-based masks overlaid on the MNI high definition single subject cortical mesh. The electromagnetic contribution of each region was modeled using current dipoles whose position and orientation were constrained by the cortical geometry. In linking neural network computation via EEG forward modeling to empirical results in neurolinguistics, we emphasize the need for neural network models to link their architecture to geometrically sound models of the cortical surface, and the need for conceptual models to refine and adopt brain-atlas based approaches to allow precise brain anchoring of their modules. The detailed analysis of Phase 2 sets the stage for a brief introduction to Phase 1 of the program, including the case for a schema-theoretic approach to language production and perception presented in detail elsewhere. Unlike Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and Bojak's mean field model, Synthetic ERP builds on models of networks that mediate the relation between the brain's inputs, outputs, and internal states in executing a specific task. The neural networks used for Synthetic ERP must include neuroanatomically realistic placement and orientation of the cortical pyramidal neurons. These constraints pose exciting challenges for future work in neural network modeling that is applicable to systems and cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, an extension of the periodic spatial filter method is proposed that jointly learns spatial filters and the corresponding FIR filters to be used for single trial ERP detection. Experimental results confirm that the proposed spatio-spectral filtering method outperforms its predecessor spatial filter.

Here, we employed completely non-invasive scalp-electroencephalography in studying the neural correlates of the visual cognition of dogs. We measured visual event-related potentials (ERPs) of eight dogs while they observed images of dog and human faces presented on a computer screen. The dogs were trained to lie still with positive operant conditioning, and they were neither mechanically restrained nor sedated during the measurements. The ERPs corresponding to early visual processing of dogs were detectable at 75-100 ms from the stimulus onset in individual dogs, and the group-level data of the 8 dogs differed significantly from zero bilaterally at around 75 ms at the most posterior sensors. Additionally, we detected differences between the responses to human and dog faces in the posterior sensors at 75-100 ms and in the anterior sensors at 350-400 ms. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration of completely non-invasively measured visual brain responses both in individual dogs and within a group-level study, using ecologically valid visual stimuli. The results of the present study validate the feasibility of non-invasive ERP measurements in studies with dogs, and the study is expected to pave the way for further neurocognitive studies in dogs.

Both EOG and ERP have been used separately for implementing human-machine interfaces which can assist disabled patients in performing daily tasks. In this paper, we present a novel EOG/ERP hybrid human-machine interface which integrates the traditional EOG and ERP interfaces together. Eye movements like the blink, wink, gaze, and frown are detected from EOG signals using double threshold algorithm. Multiple ERP components, i.e., N170, VPP and P300 are evoked by inverted face stimuli and classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Based on this hybrid interface, we also design a control scheme for the humanoid robot NAO (Aldebaran robotics, Inc). On-line experiment results show that the proposed hybrid interface can effectively control the robot's basic movements and order it to make various behaviors. While normally operating the robot by hands takes 49.1 s to complete the experiment sessions, using the proposed EOG/ERP interface, the subject is able to finish the sessions in 54.1 s.

This information is readily accessible when subsequently encountered, and a neural correlate of this is an attenuation of the N400 event-related potential (ERP). We used ERPs and time-frequency (TF) analysis to investigate neural correlates of processing inferred information after a causal coherence inference had been generated during text comprehension. Participants read short texts, some of which promoted inference generation. After each text, they performed lexical decisions to target words that were unrelated or inference-related to the preceding text. Consistent with previous findings, inference-related words elicited an attenuated N400 relative to unrelated words. TF analyses revealed unique contributions to the N400 from activity occurring at 1-6 Hz (theta) and 0-2 Hz (delta), supporting the view that multiple, sequential processes underlie the N400.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Perceptual Auditory Priming Without Explicit Recognition Memory	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory perceptual priming; P200; N400; event-related potential (ERP)	IMPLICIT MEMORY; WORD RECOGNITION; HEMISPHERIC-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LEXICAL DECISION; AMNESIC PATIENTS; SPECIFICITY; DISSOCIATION; FAMILIARITY; ACTIVATION	The aim of this study was to identify an event-related potential (ERP correlate) of perceptual auditory priming using a method that can dissociate it from explicit memory similar to Rugg et al. (1998). EEG was recorded during performance of an auditory word recognition test, where 17 participants discriminated "old'' from "new'' aural words, encoded using either a "deep'' or "shallow'' levels-of-processing (LOP) study task. A right-lateralized P200 effect was modulated by words' old/new status but not by accuracy of recognition or LOP manipulation. Because this effect was driven by simple repetition rather than factors known to influence episodic recognition memory, a "bottom-up'' perceptual priming function was inferred which was substantiated by its early temporal appearance. A similar ERP amplitude modulation was evident across a broader topographical region during the subsequent N400 time interval. Conversely the late posterior component (LPC; 500-800 ms) for deeply-encoded, correctly-recognized words was of higher amplitude than LPCs for shallowly-encoded and new words, consistent with proposals that this ERP component indexes episodic memory. To our knowledge this is the first report of an ERP correlate of auditory perceptual priming dissociated from explicit episodic memory.	[Harris, Jill D.; Cutmore, Tim R.

J	Hsu, YF; Hamalainen, JA; Waszak, F				Hsu, Yi-Fang; Hamalainen, Jarmo A.; Waszak, Florian			Temporal expectation and spectral expectation operate in distinct fashion on neuronal populations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Temporal expectation; Spectral expectation; EEG; ERPs; Low-frequency neuronal oscillations	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; N1 WAVE; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; TIME; ORGANIZATION; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS; AUDITION	The formation of temporal expectation (i.e., the prediction of "when") is of prime importance to sensory processing. It can modulate sensory processing at early processing stages probably via the entrainment of low-frequency neuronal oscillations in the brain. However, sensory predictions involve not only temporal expectation but also spectral expectation (i.e., the prediction of "what"). Here we investigated how temporal expectation may interrelate with spectral expectation by explicitly setting up temporal expectation and spectral expectation in a target detection task. We found that reaction time (RT) was shorter when targets were temporally expected than when they were temporally unexpected. The temporal expectation effect was larger with than without spectral expectation. However, this interaction in the behavioural data did not result from an interaction in the electroencephalography (EEG), where we observed independent main effects of temporal expectation and spectral expectation. More precisely, we found that the N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components and the entrainment of low-frequency neuronal oscillations were exclusively modulated by temporal expectation, whilst only the P3 ERP component was modulated by spectral expectation. Our results, thus, support the idea that temporal expectation and spectral expectation operate in distinct fashion on neuronal populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present work, we propose a method for classifying single-trial ERPs using a combination of the Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In particular, the LWT filters, the set of EEG channels and SVM parameters that maximize the classification accuracy are searched using PSO. We evaluate the method's performance through offline analyses on the datasets from the BCI Competitions II and III. The proposed method achieved in most cases a similar or higher classification accuracy than that achieved by other methods, and adapted wavelet basis functions and channel sets that match the time-frequency and spatial properties of the P300 ERP.

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to explore the local and global cortical excitability at rest and during two different face processing behavioral tasks. Single-pulse TMS was delivered (100 ms after face stimulus onset) over the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during a face identity or a face expression matching task, while continuous EEG was recorded using a 60-channel TMS-compatible amplifier. We examined TMS effects on the occipital face-specific ERP component and compared TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded during task performance and a passive point fixation control task. TMS reduced the P1-N1 component recorded at the occipital electrodes. Moreover, performing face tasks significantly modulated TEPs recorded at the occipital and temporal electrodes within the first 30 ms after right mPFC stimulation, with a specific increase of temporal TEPs in the right hemisphere for the facial expression task. Furthermore, in order to test the site-specificity of the reported effects, TMS was applied over the right premotor cortex (PMC) as a control site using the same experimental paradigm. Results showed that TMS over the right PMC did not affect ERP components in posterior regions during the face tasks and TEP amplitude did not change between task and no task condition, either at fronto-central electrodes near the stimulation or at temporal and occipital electrodes. These findings support the notion that the prefrontal cortex exerts a very early influence over the occipital cortex during face processing tasks and that excitability across right fronto-temporal cortical regions is significantly modulated during explicit facial expression processing.

First, the enhancement of SNR to the neighborhood of -2 dB is achieved through the ensemble averaging of the EEG data over a limited number of trials. Then a linear estimator is used to reduce further the amount of the EEG signal in the ERPs. With this estimator the EEG colored noise is first whitened using Cholesky factorization then the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrices of prewhitened data performed and the subspace is decomposed into signal subspace and noise subspace. The components in the noise subspace are nullified and the components in the signal subspace are retained to do the improvement. The proposed algorithm is verified with simulated data and the results shows reliable performance in terms of accuracy and failure rate.

This paper summarizes recent work investigating error monitoring in musicians, i.e., the processes and their neural correlates associated with the monitoring of ongoing actions and the detection of deviations from intended sounds. Electroencephalography(EEG) studies reported a nearly component of the event-related potential(ERP) occurring before the on sets of pitch errors. This component, which can be altered in musicians with focal dystonia, likely reflects processes of error detection and/or error compensation, i.e., attempts to cancel the undesired sensory consequence(a wrong tone) a musicianis about to perceive. Thus, auditory feedback seems not to be a prerequisite for error detection, consistent with previous behavioral results. In contrast, when auditory feedback is externally manipulated and thus unexpected, motor performance can be severely distorted, although not all feedback alterations resultin performance impairments. Recent studies investigating then eural correlates of feedback processing showed that unexpected feedback elicits an ERP component after note onsets, which shows larger amplitudes during music performance than during mere perception of the same musical sequences. Hence, these results stress the role of motor actions for the processing of auditory information. Furthermore, recent methodological advances like the combination of 3D motion capture techniques with EEG will be discussed. Such combinations of different measures can potentially help to disentangle the roles of different feedback types such as proprioceptive and auditory feedback, and in general to derive at a better understanding of the complex interactions between the motor and auditory domain during error monitoring. Finally, outstanding questions and future directions in this context will be discussed.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and cognitive functions behind are elusive, partly due to methodological limitations of previous studies. Here, we account for these difficulties by computing combined electromagnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) source localization techniques. Participants covertly read emotionally high-arousing positive and negative nouns, while EEG and MEG were recorded simultaneously. Combined EEG/MEG current-density reconstructions for the P1 (80-120 ms), P2 (150-190 ms) and EPN component (200-300 ms) were computed using realistic individual head models, with a cortical constraint. Relative to negative words, the P1 to positive words predominantly involved language-related structures (left middle temporal and inferior frontal regions), and posterior structures related to directed attention (occipital and parietal regions). Effects shifted to the right hemisphere in the P2 component. By contrast, negative words received more activation in the P1 time-range only, recruiting prefrontal regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Effects in the EPN were not statistically significant. These findings show that different neuronal networks are active when positive versus negative words are processed. We account for these effects in terms of an "emotional tagging" of word forms during language acquisition. These tags then give rise to different processing strategies, including enhanced lexical processing of positive words and a very fast language-independent alert response to negative words. The valence-specific recruitment of different networks might underlie fast adaptive responses to both approach-and withdrawal-related stimuli, be they acquired or biological.

Distinguishing between target and nontarget fixations in a visual search task using fixation-related potentials	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						EEG; eye movement; P300; fixation-related potential; visual search; selective attention	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; STIMULI	The P300 event-related potential (ERP) can be used to infer whether an observer is looking at a target or not. Common practice in P300 experiments and applications is that observers are asked to fixate their eyes while stimuli are presented. We investigated the possibility to differentiate between single target and nontarget fixations in a target search task involving eye movements by using EEG epochs synchronized to fixation onset (fixation-related potentials: FRPs). Participants systematically scanned search displays consisting of six small Landolt Cs in search of Cs with a particular orientation. After each search display, they indicated whether and where target Cs had been presented. As expected, an FRP component consistent with the P300 reliably distinguished between target and nontarget fixations. It was possible to classify single FRPs into target and nontarget FRPs above chance (on average 62% correct, where 50% would be chance). These results are the first step to practical applications such as covertly monitoring observers' interests and supporting search tasks.	[Brouwer, Anne-Marie; Vincent, Joris; van Erp, Jan B.

In this study the nociceptive activity in the brain evoked by tissue-damaging skin lance was analyzed with electroencephalography (EEG) in 20 healthy adult volunteers (13 men and 7 women) aged 21-40 yr. Time-frequency analysis of the evoked activity revealed a distinct late event-related vertex potential (lance event-related potential, LERP) at 100-300 ms consisting of a phase-locked energy increase between 1 and 20 Hz (delta-beta bands). A pairwise comparison between lance and sham control stimulation also revealed a period of ultralate stronger desynchronization after lance in the delta band (1-5 Hz). Skin application of mustard oil before lancing, which sensitizes a subpopulation of nociceptors expressing the cation channel TRPA1, did not affect the ultralate desynchronization but reduced the phase-locked energy increase in delta and beta bands, suggesting a central interaction between different modalities of nociceptive inputs. Verbal descriptor screening of individual pain experience revealed that lance pain is predominantly due to A delta fiber activation, but when individuals describe lances as C fiber mediated, an ultralate delta band event-related desynchronization occurs in the brain-evoked activity. We conclude that pain evoked by acute tissue damage is associated with distinct A delta and C fiber-mediated patterns of synchronization and desynchronization of EEG oscillations in the brain.

Specifically, we combined the analysis of cognitive control in a cued task-switching paradigm with the fundamental question of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain. Two functional models of P3 amplitude variation in cued task-switching paradigms were put to an empirical test: (1) According to the P3b surprise hypothesis, parietal P3b waveforms are related to surprise over switch cues. (2) According to the P3a entropy hypothesis, frontal P3a waveforms are associated with entropy over switch outcomes. In order to examine these hypotheses, we measured the EEG while sixteen healthy young participants performed cued task-switching paradigms closely modeled to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). We applied a factorial design, with number of tasks (two vs. three viable tasks), cue explicitness (task cuing vs. transition cuing), and cue contingency (prospectively-signaled cuing vs. feedback-based cuing) as independent variables. The ERP results replicated the commonly reported P3b effect associated with task switches, and further showed that P3a amplitudes were related to the entropy of switch outcomes, thereby supporting both hypotheses. Based on these ERP data, we suggest that surprise over task switches, and entropy over switch outcomes, constitute dissociable functional correlates of P3b and P3a ERP components in task-switching paradigms, respectively. Finally, a theoretical integration of the findings is proposed within the framework of Sokolov's (1966) entropy model of the orienting response (OR).

Methods: EEG data were obtained while children were tested with a standard non-symbolic numerical comparison paradigm that allowed us to investigate the effects of numerical distance manipulations for different set sizes, i.e., the classical subitizing, counting and estimation ranges. Effects of numerical distance manipulations on event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes as well as activation patterns of underlying current sources were analyzed. Results: In typically developing children, the amplitudes of a late parietal positive-going ERP component showed systematic numerical distance effects that did not depend on set size. For the group of children with mathematical learning disabilities, ERP distance effects were found only for stimuli within the subitizing range. Current source density analysis of distance-related group effects suggested that areas in right inferior parietal regions are involved in the generation of the parietal ERP amplitude differences. Conclusion: Our results suggest that right inferior parietal regions are recruited differentially by controls compared to children with mathematical learning disabilities in response to non-symbolic numerical magnitude processing tasks, but only for stimuli with set sizes that exceed the subitizing range.

We investigated audiovisual synchrony and asynchrony perception in 6-month-old infants using event-related brain potentials (ERP). In a prior behavioral experiment (n=45), infants were habituated to an audiovisual synchronous stimulus and tested for recovery of interest by presenting an asynchronous test stimulus in which the visual stream was delayed with respect to the auditory stream by 400 ms. Infants who behaviorally discriminated the change in temporal alignment were included in further analyses. In the EEG experiment (final sample: n=15), synchronous and asynchronous stimuli (visual delay of 400 ms) were presented in random order. Results show latency shifts in the auditory ERP components N1 and P2 as well as the infant ERP component Nc. Latencies in the asynchronous condition were significantly longer than in the synchronous condition. After video onset but preceding the auditory onset, amplitude modulations propagating from posterior to anterior sites and related to the Pb component of infants' ERP were observed. Results suggest temporal interactions between the two modalities. Specifically, they point to the significance of anticipatory visual motion for auditory processing, and indicate young infants' predictive capacities for audiovisual temporal synchrony relations.

In conflict situations, this puts them under pressure to either adhere to the group opinion or to risk controversy with the group. Psychological experiments have demonstrated that study participants adapt to erroneous group opinions in visual perception tasks, which they can easily solve correctly when performing on their own. Until this point, however, it is unclear whether this phenomenon of social conformity influences early stages of perception that might not even reach awareness or later stages of conscious decision-making. Using electroencephalography, this study has revealed that social conformity to the wrong group opinion resulted in a decrease of the posterior-lateral P1 in line with a decrease of the later centro-parietal P3. These results suggest that group pressure situations impact early unconscious visual perceptual processing, which results in a later diminished stimulus discrimination and an adaptation even to the wrong group opinion. These findings might have important implications for understanding social behavior in group settings and are discussed within the framework of social influence on eyewitness testimony.

Although many studies have investigated the neural correlates of insight problem solving, however, the question when mental impasses occur during insight problem solving has been rarely studied. The present study adopted high temporal resolution ERPs to investigate the temporal dynamics of an impasse underlying insight problem solving. Time locked ERPs were recorded associated with problems with impasses (PWI) and problems without impasses (POI). The problem types were determined by participants' subjective responses. The results revealed an early frontocentral P2 was linked with the preconscious awareness of mental impasses and a P3a was associated with fixed attention when the impasse formed. These findings suggest the impasse may occur initially at a relatively early stage and metacognition plays an important role in insight problem solving.

In the present study the neural encoding of Western music chords was investigated in newborn infants. Using ERPs, we examined whether the categorizations of major vs. minor and consonance vs. dissonance are present at the level of the change-related mismatch response (MMR). Using an oddball paradigm, root minor, dissonant and inverted major chords were presented in a context of consonant root major chords. The chords were transposed to several different frequency levels, so that the deviant chords did not include a physically deviant frequency that could result in an MMR without categorization. The results show that the newborn infants were sensitive to both dissonant and minor chords but not to inverted major chords in the context of consonant root major chords. While the dissonant chords elicited a large positive MMR, the minor chords elicited a negative MMR. This indicates that the two categories were processed differently. The results suggest newborn infants are sensitive to Western music categorizations, which is consistent with the authors' previous studies in adults and school-aged children.

This demands extensive training sessions to maintain the overall performance of the systems. As an alternative, here we propose an adaptive version of the pi SF method. Taking advantage of simple structure, high performance, and low computational complexity of the algorithm, an extension is developed that can adapt the trained transformation to the new instances. Experimental results confirm that the adaptive method (alpha pi SF) outperforms the non-adaptive versions of pi SF and the xDAWN method in an inter-subject train-test schema.

Uniquely, conversion patients lack a sense of conscious awareness of the origin of their impairment. We investigated whether conversion paresis patients show distinct electroencephalographic (EEG) markers associated with their unconscious movement deficits. Methods: Six unilateral upper limb conversion paresis patients, 12 feigning participants asked to mimic weakness and 12 control participants performed a precued reaction time task, requiring movements of either hand, depending on precue information. Performance measures (force, reaction and movement time), and event-related EEG potentials (ERP) were compared, between groups and across hands or hemisphere, using linear mixed models. Results: Feigners generated the same inter-hand difference in reaction and movement time as expressed by patients, even though no specific targets were set nor feedback given on these measures. We found novel ERP signatures specific to patients. When the symptomatic hand was precued, the P3 ERP component accompanying the precue was dramatically larger in patients than in feigning participants. Additionally, in patients the earlier N1 ERP component was diminished when the precue signalled either the symptomatic or asymptomatic hand. Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous suggestions that lack of awareness of the origin of their symptoms in conversion disorder patients may result from suppression of brain activity normally related to self-agency. In patients the diminished N1 to all precues is consistent with a generalised reduction in cognitive processing of movement-related precues. The P3 enhancement in patients is unlikely to simply reflect changes required for generation of impaired movements, because it was not seen in feigners showing the same behavioural deficits. Rather, this P3 enhancement in patients may represent a neural biomarker of unconscious processes, including additional emotional loading, related to active suppression of brain circuits involved in the attribution of self-agency.

Clearly, estimation of single-trial ERPs can provide researchers with many more details of cognitive activity than the averaging algorithm. A novel method to estimate single-trial ERPs is proposed in this paper. This method includes two key ideas. First, singular value decomposition was used to construct a matrix, which mapped single-trial electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) into a low-dimensional vector that contained little information from the spontaneous EEG. Second, we used the theory of compressed sensing to build a procedure to restore single-trial ERPs from this low-dimensional vector. ERPs are sparse or approximately sparse in the frequency domain. This fact allowed us to use the theory of compressed sensing. We verified this method in simulated and real data. Our method and dVCA (differentially variable component analysis), another method of single-trial ERPs estimation, were both used to estimate single-trial ERPs from the same simulated data. Results demonstrated that our method significantly outperforms dVCA under various conditions of signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the single-trial ERPs estimated from the real data by our method are statistically consistent with the theories of cognitive science.

We investigate the relationship of early occipitotemporal and later centroparietal emotion-modulated ERPs in one sample to fMRI estimates of neural activity in another sample in a replicated experiment. Using this approach, we aimed to link effects found in time-resolved electrocortical measures to specific neural structures across individual emotional and nonemotional picture stimuli. The centroparietal late positive potential (LPP) showed covariation with emotion-modulated regions of hemodynamic activation across multiple dorsal and ventral visual cortical structures, while the early occipitotemporal potential was not reliably associated. Subcortical and corticolimbic structures involved in the perception of motivationally relevant stimuli also related to modulation of the LPP, and were modestly associated to the amplitude of the early occipitotemporal potential. These data suggest that early occipitotemporal potentials may reflect multiple sources of modulation including motivational relevance, and supports the perspective that the slow-wave LPP represents aggregate cortical and subcortical structures involved in emotional discrimination.

The aim of this study was to explore brain activity of interaction between bimodal sensory cognition. Seven healthy volunteers were recruited in the study and ERP to these stimuli were recorded by 64 electrodes EEG recording system. Subjects were exposed to either the auditory and the visual stimulus alone or the combined auditory-visual (AV) stimuli. The identification of brain areas of the EP was realized using CURRY 6.0 software. A source localization analysis was performed across conditions over initial, early and later temporal stages (i.e. 3 stimuli conditions 3 temporal stages). The source locations across conditions were contrasted over similar time periods, indicating that source location of the bimodal auditory-visual (AV) stimuli differed from the sum of source locations from the auditory and the visual stimulus alone. These data provide evidence that there exists interplay in the brain in the bimodal auditory-visual stimuli paradigm.

In Experiment 1, after learning a series of conditional relations involving words and pseudowords, participants performed a relatedness task during which EEG was recorded. Behavioural performance was faster and more accurate on untrained, indirectly related symmetry (i.e., learn AB and infer BA) and equivalence trials (i.e., learn AB and AC and infer CB) than on unrelated trials, regardless of whether or not a formal test for stimulus equivalence relations had been conducted. Consistent with previous results, event related potentials (ERPs) evoked by trained and emergent trials at parietal and occipital sites differed only for those participants who had not received a prior equivalence test. Experiment 2 further replicated and extended these behavioural and ERP findings using arbitrary symbols as stimuli and demonstrated time and frequency differences for trained and untrained relatedness trials. Overall, the findings demonstrate convincingly the ERP correlates of intra-experimentally established stimulus equivalence relations consisting entirely of arbitrary symbols and offer support for a contemporary cognitive-behavioural model of symbolic categorisation and relational inference.

There is little known, however, about the timing of this modulation. The present study aims at elucidating the phasic effects of, emotional processing on auditory processing within subsequent time-windows of visual emotional, processing in humans. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants responded to a, discrimination task of faces with neutral or fearful expressions. A brief complex tone, which subjects, were instructed to ignore, was displayed concomitantly, but with different asynchronies respective to, the image onset. Analyses of the N1 auditory event-related potential (ERP) revealed enhanced brain, responses in presence of fearful faces. Importantly, this effect occurred at picture-tone asynchronies of, 100 and 150 ms, but not when these were displayed simultaneously, or at 50 ms or 200 ms asynchrony. These results confirm the existence of a fast-operating crossmodal effect of visual emotion on auditory, processing, suggesting a phasic variation according to the time-course of emotional processing.

The large body of research in BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERP) use temporal features, which have demonstrated to be stable for each user along time, but do not generalize well among tasks different from the calibration task. This paper explores the use of low frecuency features to improve the generalization capabilities of the BCIs using error-potentials. The results show that there exists a stable pattern in the frequency domain that allows a classifier to generalize among the tasks. Furthermore, the study also shows that it is possible to combine temporal and frequency features to obtain the best of both domains.				jomedes@unizar.es; iturrate@unizar.es; montesano@unizar.es; jminguez@unizar.es	Iturrate, Inaki/B-2396-2018	Minguez Zafra, Javier/0000-0002-2957-0133; Iturrate, Inaki/0000-0001-7781-7826					16	21	22	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X		978-1-4577-0216-7	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2013							5263	5266						4	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BB2DX	24110923	Green Submitted			2022-08-02	WOS:000341702105169

This averaging method is useful as long as the experimental procedure can sufficiently isolate the brain or non-brain process of interest. However, if responses from multiple cognitive processes, time locked to multiple classes of closely spaced events, overlap in time with varying inter-event intervals, averaging will most likely fail to identify the individual response time courses. For this situation, we study estimation of responses to all recorded events in an experiment by a single model using standard linear regression (the rERP technique). Applied to data collected during a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task, our analysis shows: (1) The rERP technique accounts for more variance in the data than averaging when individual event responses are highly overlapping; (2) the variance accounted for by the estimates is concentrated into a fewer ICA components than raw EEG channel signals.

In healthy adults, the N1 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), reflecting neural activity associated with basic sound processing, is suppressed if a sound is accompanied by a video that reliably predicts sound onset. If the sound does not match the content of the video (e. g., hearing /ba/ while lipreading /fu/), the later occurring P2 component is affected. Here, we examined whether these visual information sources affect auditory processing in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 18 patients with schizophrenia and compared with that of 18 healthy volunteers. As stimuli we used video recordings of natural actions in which visual information preceded and predicted the onset of the sound that was either congruent or incongruent with the video. Results: For the healthy control group, visual information reduced the auditory-evoked N1 if compared to a sound-only condition, and stimulus-congruency affected the P2. This reduction in N1 was absent in patients with schizophrenia, and the congruency effect on the P2 was diminished. Distributed source estimations revealed deficits in the network subserving audiovisual integration in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: The results show a deficit in multisensory processing in patients with schizophrenia and suggest that multisensory integration dysfunction may be an important and, to date, under-researched aspect of schizophrenia.

In particular, we assessed whether the motor potentials generated during combined movements were simply superpositions of the potentials generated during the individual movements in isolation. ERPs generated during single-limb movements replicated previously observed motor potentials, and those generated during both the execution (Experiment 1) and preparation (Experiment 2) of combined movements showed some deviations from the predictions of the superposition hypothesis, suggesting the presence of neural interactions between the hand and foot movement systems during preparation and execution of these actions.

Here we examined whether theta power and theta/beta ratio are consistently elevated in ADHD and younger age as proposed. Topographic 48-channel EEG from 32 children (8-16 years) and 22 adults (32-55 years) with ADHD and matched healthy controls (n = 30 children/21 adults) was compared. Following advanced artefact correction, resting EEG was tested for increased theta and theta/beta activity due to ADHD and due to normal immaturity. Discriminant analyses tested classification performance by ADHD and age using these EEG markers as well as EEG artefacts and deviant attentional event-related potentials (ERPs). No consistent theta or theta/beta increases were found with ADHD. Even multivariate analyses indicated only marginal EEG power increases in children with ADHD. Instead, consistent developmental theta decreases were observed, indicating that maturational lags of fewer than 3 years would have been detected in children. Discriminant analysis based on proposed simple spectral resting EEG markers was successful for age but not for ADHD (81 vs. 53 % accuracy). Including ERP markers and EEG artefacts improved discrimination, although not to diagnostically useful levels. The lack of consistent spectral resting EEG abnormalities in ADHD despite consistent developmental effects casts doubt upon conventional neurometric approaches towards EEG-based ADHD diagnosis, but is consistent with evidence that ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, where the resting state is not consistently characterised by maturational lag.

J	Feess, D; Krell, MM; Metzen, JH				Feess, David; Krell, Mario M.; Metzen, Jan H.			Comparison of Sensor Selection Mechanisms for an ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interface	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHANNEL SELECTION; BCI	A major barrier for a broad applicability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) is the large number of EEG sensor electrodes typically used. The necessity for this results from the fact that the relevant information for the BCI is often spread over the scalp in complex patterns that differ depending on subjects and application scenarios. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed to determine an individual optimal sensor selection. These methods have, however, rarely been compared against each other or against any type of baseline. In this paper, we review several selection approaches and propose one additional selection criterion based on the evaluation of the performance of a BCI system using a reduced set of sensors. We evaluate the methods in the context of a passive BCI system that is designed to detect a P300 event-related potential and compare the performance of the methods against randomly generated sensor constellations. For a realistic estimation of the reduced system's performance we transfer sensor constellations found on one experimental session to a different session for evaluation. We identified notable (and unanticipated) differences among the methods and could demonstrate that the best method in our setup is able to reduce the required number of sensors considerably. Though our application focuses on EEG data, all presented algorithms and evaluation schemes can be transferred to any binary classification task on sensor arrays.

Although the response-locked motor potential may link the ERP components to the recorded response, to our knowledge no previous attempt has been made to predict a priori (i.e. before any contact with the electroencephalographic data) the time occurrence of an ERP component based only on the modeling of an overt response. The proposed analysis relies on the delta-lognormal modeling of velocity, as proposed by the kinematic theory of rapid human movement used in several studies of motor control. Although some methodological aspects of this technique still need to be fine-tuned, the initial results showed that the model-based kinematic analysis allowed the prediction of the time occurrence of a motor command ERP in most participants in the experiment. The average map of the motor command ERPs showed that this signal was stronger in electrodes close to the contra-lateral motor area (Fz, FCz, FC1, and FC3). These results seem to support the claims made by the kinematic theory that a motor command is emitted at time t0, the time reference parameter of the model. This article proposes a new time marker directly associated with a cerebral event (i.e. the emission of a motor command) that can be used for the development of new data analysis methodologies and for the elaboration of new experimental protocols based on ERP.

In this study we tested healthy preschool children between the ages of 5 and 6, and observed better response inhibition in 6-year-olds compared to 5-year-olds. Importantly, this age-related difference could not be explained by the N2 component from event-related potential, but was reflected in an increase in right frontal beta power from electroencephalogram. These results suggest that frontal beta power during the preschool period may reflect neural development of inhibitory control.

C	Boutani, H; Ohsuga, M			IEEE	Boutani, Hidenori; Ohsuga, Mieko			Applicability of the "Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset" as a User-friendly Input Interface	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn				We aimed to develop an input interface by using the P3 component of visual event-related potentials (ERPs). When using electroencephalography (EEG) in daily applications, coping with ocular-motor artifacts and ensuring that the equipment is user-friendly are both important. To address the first issue, we applied a previously proposed method that applies an unmixing matrix to acquire independent components (ICs) obtained from another dataset. For the second issue, we introduced a 14-channel EEG commercial headset called the "Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset." An advantage of the Emotiv headset is that users can put it on by themselves within 1 min without any specific skills. However, only a few studies have investigated whether EEG and ERP signals are accurately measured by Emotiv. Additionally, no electrodes of the Emotiv headset are located over the centroparietal area of the head where P3 components are reported to show large amplitudes. Therefore, we first demonstrated that the P3 components obtained by the headset and by commercial plate electrodes and a multipurpose bioelectric amplifier during an oddball task were comparable. Next, we confirmed that eye-blink and ocular movement components could be decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) using the 14-channel signals measured by the headset. We also demonstrated that artifacts could be removed with an unmixing matrix, as long as the matrix was obtained from the same person, even if they were measured on different days. Finally, we confirmed that the fluctuation of the sampling frequency of the Emotiv headset was not a major problem.

Here we consider an auditory oddball paradigm, recorded in normal indoor and walking outdoor conditions. The signal of interest, namely the P300 component of the event related potential (ERP), unlike noise, is a structured signal in the multidimensional space spanned by channels, time and frequency or possibly other types of features. Therefore, we apply spectral regularization using nuclear norm on a tensorial representation of the EEG data. Due to the a-priori structural information conveyed by the nuclear norm penalty, we expect an improved performance compared to traditional approaches, especially under noisy conditions and in case of small sample sizes.

Eighty-three participants completed a Stroop task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Three error-related indices were derived from the EEG: the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and error-related alpha suppression (ERAS). Pre- and posttask salivary samples were assayed for cortisol, and cortisol change scores were correlated with the EEG variables. Better error-correct differentiation in the ERN predicted less cortisol increase during the task, whereas greater ERAS predicted greater cortisol increase during the task; the Pe was not correlated with cortisol changes. We concluded that an enhanced ERN, part of an adaptive cognitive control system, predicts successful stress regulation. In contrast, an enhanced ERAS response may reflect error-related arousal that is not adaptive. The results support the concept of overlapping systems for cognitive and emotional self-regulation.

Similarly, event-related potentials (ERPs) have provided an important on-line measure of the neural correlates of language processing. Recently there has been strong interest in co-registering eyetracking and ERPs from simultaneous recording to capitalize on the strengths of both techniques, but a challenge has been devising approaches for controlling artifacts produced by eye movements in the EEG waveform. In this paper we describe our approach to correcting for eye movements in EEG and demonstrate its applicability to reading. The method is based on independent components analysis, and uses three criteria for identifying components tied to saccades: (1) component loadings on the surface of the head are consistent with eye movements; (2) source analysis localizes component activity to the eyes, and (3) the temporal activation of the component occurred at the time of the eye movement and differed for right and left eye movements. We demonstrate this method's applicability to reading by comparing ERPs time-locked to fixation onset in two reading conditions. In the text-reading condition, participants read paragraphs of text. In the pseudo-reading control condition, participants moved their eyes through spatially similar pseudo-text that preserved word locations, word shapes, and paragraph spatial structure, but eliminated meaning. The corrected EEG, time-locked to fixation onsets, showed effects of reading condition in early ERP components. The results indicate that co-registration of eyetracking and EEG in connected-text paragraph reading is possible, and has the potential to become an important tool for investigating the cognitive and neural bases of on-line language processing in reading.

J	Horvath, J				Horvath, Janos			Attenuation of auditory ERPs to action-sound coincidences is not explained by voluntary allocation of attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Sensation/perception; Normal volunteers; EEG/ERP	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; SPEECH; CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SUPPRESSION; TALKING; N1	The event-related potential (ERP) correlates of sound detection are attenuated when eliciting sounds coincide with our own actions. The role of attention in this effect was investigated in two experiments by presenting tones separated by random intervals. In the homogeneous condition of Experiments 1 and 2, the same tone was repeated, whereas in the mixed condition of Experiment 1, tones with five different frequencies were presented. Participants performed a time-interval production task by marking intervals with keypresses in Experiment 1, and tried to produce keypress-tone coincidences in Experiment 2. Although the auditory ERPs were attenuated for coincidences, no modulation by the multiplicity of tone frequencies in Experiment 1, or by the task-relevancy of tones and coincidences in Experiment 2, was found. This suggests that coincidence-related ERP attenuation cannot be fully explained by voluntary attentional mechanisms.

Subjects received 16 innocuous tones with intensity alternating between 60 and 80 dB, at long inter-stimulus intervals. There was no stimulus-related task, so we could examine the effects of stimulus novelty and intensity in the absence of task demands. Cardiac, respiratory, peripheral vasoconstriction, and electrodermal measures were recorded, as well as continuous EEG. Single-trial ERPs were obtained, and components extracted by Principal Components Analysis were examined for potential response fractionation in the central indices of stimulus processing. The predicted fractionation of autonomic measures was obtained: cardiac deceleration showed no systematic change with intensity or trials, respiratory pause showed a substantial main effect of trials but no intensity effects, peripheral vasoconstriction showed intensity but no trials effects, and electrodermal responses showed substantial main effects of trials and intensity. A range of intensity and novelty effects were obtained in components identified as the N1, P3a, P3b, Novelty P3, and the classic Slow Wave. The different stimulus-response profiles of the ERP components are discussed in relation to the autonomic response profiles within the context of a sequential processing theory of OR elicitation.

Whereas numerous studies have investigated neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory control deficits in children with ADHD, less is known about underlying mechanisms in young adults with ADHD. This study explores the neural correlates of inhibitory control in college students with ADHD-a population that, despite comparatively high educational attainment, still shows marked functional impairments in academic, social, and occupational functioning. Participants were 54 college students with ADHD and 29 typically developing peers. Specifically the fronto-centrally located N2 and the centro-parietal P3 event-related potential (ERP) components were hypothesized to show decreased amplitudes for the ADHD group due to their known association with inhibitory control. Dense array electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected during a Go/nogo task. Results show lower accuracy rates for the ADHD group and significant reductions in P3 amplitude as well as a trend for reduced N2 amplitude in nogo trials where subjects successfully inhibited a response. Notably, nogo N2 and P3 amplitudes correlated with the number of ADHD symptoms: namely, smaller amplitudes were associated with more symptoms. We conclude that when compared to their typically developing peers, relatively high functioning adults with ADHD still show a deviant neural signature. These results contribute to the growing literature of adult ADHD and increase our understanding of the neural correlates of inhibitory control associated with ADHD.

According to the existing theoretical accounts, not all Russian stems are specified for accent in the lexicon. The present study employs event-related potentials (ERPs) to find evidence to support the underlying distinction into accented and unaccented stem types. The results of two EEG experiments using a stress violation paradigm reveal that Russian listeners are highly sensitive to changes of metrical structure and that prosodic manipulations may impede lexical retrieval. In the first experiment, in which the stimuli were not given prior to auditory presentation, metrical violations evoked a pronounced N400 effect for all stem types, and a late positivity for one of the stem types, indicating a difference in stress processing. In the second experiment in which the stimuli were visually introduced before auditory presentation, stress shifts to the second syllable induced late positive component (LPC) indicating an ease in the evaluation of the metrical form. Overall, the present findings partially support the division into lexically specified and unspecified Russian accent types. In addition, the results show a strong correlation between the patterning of ERP components and the direction of stress shift, suggesting a trochee to be the default foot type in Russian.

Individuals vary in the speed with which they perform these operations and can detect targets within cluttered arrays, as shown in visual search tasks. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show particular strengths in visual search. The aim of the current study was to develop an understanding the origin of individual variability in visual search by delineating the processes involved in feature-based target detection, and establishing which, if any, of these processes predict search efficiency. EEG was recorded while participants performed a feature-based selective attention task from which the following EEG variables were computed: P1 amplitude; P1 latency; selection negativity; induced gamma-band power and P3b amplitude. These variables are considered to reflect stimulus encoding, feedback amplification of attended features, cognitive utilization and resource allocation during event classification respectively. Participants also completed a separate visual search task. Regression analyses revealed that only the ERP component associated with resource allocation during event classification (P3b) significantly predicted search efficiency. These data suggest that individual variability in visual search is related to a reduction in modulation of attention allocation to visual features. Implications for the understanding of superior visual search in individuals with ASD are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has recently been proposed that ongoing brain oscillations are not symmetric, so that task-related amplitude modulations generate a baseline shift that does not average out, leading to slow event-related potentials. We test this hypothesis using multivariate methods to formally assess the co-variation between task-related evoked potentials and spectral changes in scalp EEG during a visual working memory task, which is known to elicit both evoked and sustained cortical activities across broadly distributed cortical regions. 64-channel EEG data were acquired from eight healthy human subjects who completed a visuo-spatial associative working memory task as memory load was parametrically increased from easy to hard. As anticipated, evoked activity showed a complex but robust spatio-temporal waveform maximally expressed bilaterally in the parieto-occipital and anterior midline regions, showing robust effects of memory load that were specific to the stage of the working memory trial. Similarly, memory load was associated with robust spectral changes in the theta and alpha range, throughout encoding in posterior regions and through maintenance and retrieval in anterior regions, consistent with the additional resources required for decision making in prefrontal cortex. Analysis of the relationship between event-related changes in slow potentials and cortical rhythms, using partial least squares, is indeed consistent with the notion that the former make a causal contribution to the latter.

Therefore, in psychiatry, there is a current push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy and medication-based approaches. Cognitive deficits have gained considerable importance in the field as critical features of mental illness, and it is now believed that they might represent valid therapeutic targets. Indeed, an increase in cognitive skills has been shown to have a long-lasting, positive impact on the patients' quality of life and their clinical symptoms. We hereby present four principal arguments supporting the use of event-related potentials (ERP) that are derived from electroencephalography, which allow the identification of specific neurocognitive deficiencies in patients. These arguments could assist psychiatrists in the development of individualized, targeted therapy, as well as a follow-up and rehabilitation plan specific to each patient's deficit. Furthermore, they can be used as a tool to assess the possible benefits of combination therapy, consisting of medication, psychotherapy, and "ERP-oriented cognitive rehabilitation". Using this strategy, specific cognitive interventions could be planned based on each patient's needs, for an "individualized" or "personalized" therapy, which may have the potential to reduce relapse rates for many psychiatric disorders. The implementation of such a combined approach would require intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers.

We recorded behavioral and event-related brain potential (ERP) responses of musicians and nonmusicians to discrepancies of pitch between pairs of unfamiliar melodies based on Western classical rules. Musicians detected pitch deviations significantly better than nonmusicians. In musicians compared to nonmusicians, auditory cortical potentials to notes but not unrelated warning tones exhibited enhanced P200 amplitude generally, and in response to pitch deviations enhanced amplitude for N150 and P300 (P3a) but not N100 was observed. P3a latency was shorter in musicians compared to nonmusicians. Both the behavioral and cortical activity differences observed between musicians and nonmusicians in response to deviant notes were significant with stimulation of the right but not the left ear, suggesting that left-sided brain activity differentiated musicians from nonmusicians. The enhanced amplitude of N150 among musicians with right ear stimulation was positively correlated with earlier age onset of music training. Our data support the notion that long-term music training in musicians leads to functional reorganization of auditory brain systems, and that these effects are potentiated by early age onset of training.

Cortical potentials in an auditory oddball task reflect individual differences in working memory capacity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; N100; P300; P3a; Perceptual load; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DIVIDED ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; P300 COMPONENT; ERP COMPONENTS; TARGET DETECTION; P3A; SPAN	This study determined whether auditory cortical responses associated with mechanisms of attention vary with individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) and perceptual load. The operation span test defined subjects with low versus high WMC, who then discriminated target/nontarget tones while EEG was recorded. Infrequent white noise distracters were presented at midline or +/- 90 degrees locations, and perceptual load was manipulated by varying nontarget frequency. Amplitude of the N100 to distracters was negatively correlated with WMC. Relative to targets, only high WMC subjects showed attenuated N100 amplitudes to nontargets. In the higher WMC group, increased perceptual load was associated with decreased P3a amplitudes to distracters and longer-lasting negative slow wave to nontargets. Results show that auditory cortical processing is associated with multiple facets of attention related to WMC and possibly higher-level cognition.

Differences in the ability to use a BCI vary from person to person and from session to session. A reliable predictor of aptitude would allow for the selection of suitable BCI paradigms. For this reason, we investigated whether P300 BCI aptitude could be predicted from a short experiment with a standard auditory oddball. Methods: Forty healthy participants performed an electroencephalography (EEG) based visual and auditory P300-BCI spelling task in a single session. In addition, prior to each session an auditory oddball was presented. Features extracted from the auditory oddball were analyzed with respect to predictive power for BCI aptitude. Results: Correlation between auditory oddball response and P300 BCI accuracy revealed a strong relationship between accuracy and N2 amplitude and the amplitude of a late ERP component between 400 and 600 ms. Interestingly, the P3 amplitude of the auditory oddball response was not correlated with accuracy. Conclusions: Event-related potentials recorded during a standard auditory oddball session moderately predict aptitude in an audiory and highly in a visual P300 BCI. The predictor will allow for faster paradigm selection. Significance: Our method will reduce strain on patients because unsuccessful training may be avoided, provided the results can be generalized to the patient population.

The presented algorithm and hardware implementation allow the precise synchronization of several data streams from several sensor nodes for applications where timing is critical like in event-related potential (ERP) studies. The proposed method has been successfully applied to obtain visual evoked potentials and compared with a reference biosignal amplifier. The control over the exact sampling frequency allows reducing synchronization errors that will otherwise accumulate during a recording. The method is scalable to several sensor nodes communicating with a shared base station.

Emotion is manipulated through arousal and valence with a calibrated picture dataset. A classification framework is designed for single-trial ERP classification. The most discriminative spatio-temporal features of emotional states were selected and fed to a shrinkage linear discriminant classifier. Various binary classifications were tested according to the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) and the arousal level (low, high and no excitation). High classification rate (87%) was obtained for the discrimination between the high-arousal (HA) and low-arousal (LA) negative conditions. Relative good performances were also observed for the (extreme) case "HA negative versus neutral conditions" (66%). Our results suggest that the discrimination of emotional states is better when it is mainly based on an arousal difference between stimuli rather than on a valence difference.

J	Auksztulewicz, R; Blankenburg, F				Auksztulewicz, Ryszard; Blankenburg, Felix			Subjective Rating of Weak Tactile Stimuli Is Parametrically Encoded in Event-Related Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL AWARENESS; ATTENTION; BRAIN; FMRI; CONSCIOUSNESS; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MEMORY	Neural signatures of somatosensory awareness have often been studied by examining EEG responses to hardly detectable stimuli. Previous reports consistently showed that event-related potentials (ERPs) measured over early somatosensory cortex diverge for detected and missed perithreshold stimuli at 80-100 ms after stimulus onset. So far, however, all previous studies have operationalized somatosensory awareness as binary stimulus detection. Here, we investigated whether ERP components attributed to neuronal activity in early somatosensory cortices would parametrically reflect subjective ratings of stimulus awareness. EEG (64 channel) was recorded in human participants (N = 20), with perithreshold electrical stimulation applied to the left median nerve. Participants indicated perceptibility on a continuous visual rating scale, and stimulation intensity was readjusted in each block to a perithreshold level. The aim of the analysis was to investigate which brain areas reflect the subsequent perceptual awareness ratings parametrically, and how early such parametric effects occur. Parametric ERP effects were found as early as 86 ms after stimulus onset. This parametric modulation of ERP amplitude was source localized to secondary somatosensory cortex, and attributed to feedforward processing between primary and secondary somatosensory cortex by means of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Furthermore, later in the analysis window, the subjective rating of stimuli correlated with the amplitude of the N140 component and with a broadly distributed P300 component. By DCM modeling, these late effects were explained in terms of recurrent processing within the network of somatosensory and premotor cortices. Our results indicate that early neural activity in the somatosensory cortex can reflect the subjective quality of tactile perception.

Distinction between added-energy and phase-resetting mechanisms in non-invasively detected somatosensory evoked responses	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			600 HZ; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS	Non-invasively recorded averaged event-related potentials (ERP) represent a convenient opportunity to investigate human brain perceptive and cognitive processes. Nevertheless, generative ERP mechanisms are still debated. Two previous approaches have been contested in the past: the added-energy model in which the response raises independently from the ongoing background activity, and the phase-reset model, based on stimulus-driven synchronization of oscillatory ongoing activity. Many criteria for the distinction of these two models have been proposed, but there is no definitive methodology to disentangle them, owing also to the limited information at the single trial level. Here, we propose a new approach combining low-noise EEG technology and multivariate decomposition techniques. We present theoretical analyses based on simulated data and identify in high-frequency somatosensory evoked responses an optimal target for the distinction between the two mechanisms.

Recent fMRI findings provide evidence for modulation of primary somatosensory cortex when simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli were relevant to the performance of a motor task. The present study aimed to (1) determine the temporal characteristics of this modulation using event-related potentials (ERPs) and (2) investigate the role of task-relevance in mediating such a modulation. Electroencephalography was collected from healthy subjects during visual, vibrotactile or bimodal stimulation as they performed a sensory-guided motor task. Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that simultaneous bimodal stimuli would be associated with modulation of somatosensory ERPs, and Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that such effects would only be seen when both modalities are relevant. ERPs were time-locked to stimulus onset, and mean ERP amplitudes and latencies were extracted for the P50, P100, and N140. The bimodal condition in the first experiment was associated with larger amplitudes at both early and mid-latency components. The manipulation of task-relevance under bimodal conditions produced more complex results for the mid-latency components. For the P50, this enhancement was observed only when both stimuli were relevant, whereas the P100 was smallest when the tactile stimuli were not relevant to the response. These results provide evidence that crossmodal stimuli can modulate early somatosensory event-related potentials and that these effects are mediated by stimulus relevance.

Danger and disease: Electrocortical responses to threat- and disgust-eliciting images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Disgust; Threat; Fear; ERP; LPP; EPN; Emotion	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; EMOTION; PERCEPTION; FEATURES; PICTURES; AROUSAL; CORTEX	Previous research suggests facilitated processing of evolutionarily significant stimuli (e.g., depictions of erotica, mutilation, threat), as reflected by augmented event-related potentials (ERPs), including the early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP). Evolutionary models suggest that images that evoke disgust should be high in motivational salience, but evidence that the EPN and LPP are enhanced by disgusting images is lacking. Prior studies have employed only a small number of disgusting images that were limited in the types of content depicted. In the current study, participants viewed larger sets of disgusting, threatening, and neutral images with more varied content while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Results showed that disgusting and threatening images elicited equivalent LPPs, which were both significantly increased relative to LPPs elicited by neutral images. EPN amplitudes were augmented for both disgusting and threatening relative to neutral images, though significantly more for disgust. These findings offer initial evidence that the EPN and the LPP are sensitive to disgust-eliciting pictures and that these pictures may receive processing that is at least on par with that of threatening images. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ERPs reveal atypical processing of subject versus object Wh-questions in children with specific language impairment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						specific language impairment (SLI); wh-questions; working memory; event-related potentials (ERP)	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SYNTACTIC INTEGRATION; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; MOVEMENT; CAPACITY; BRAIN; GAP	Background: Children with specific language impairment (SLI) show particular difficulty comprehending and producing object (Who did the bear follow?) relative to subject (Who followed the tiger?) wh-questions. Aims: To determine if school-age children with SLI, relative to children with typical development (TD), show a more distinct unevenness, or asymmetry, in the comprehension of these questions. In addition, this study examined whether the sustained left-anterior negativity (LAN) in event-related potentials (ERP) could be used as a marker for atypical processing of these questions in children with SLI. The LAN effect signals the greater working memory processes for maintaining in memory the dislocated object in object wh-questions and reflects working memory capacity in adults. It was predicted that the amplitude of the LAN would be greater in children with SLI, reflecting the characteristic low working memory capacity in this population. The concomitance of these behavioural and electrophysiological effects would suggest that the subject-object asymmetry in SLI should be investigated in relation to poor working memory skills. Methods & Procedures: Groups including 13 children with SLI, 17 same-age TD children and 18 normal adults completed an auditory sentence comprehension task requiring button responses while continuous electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Accuracy for subject and object questions was calculated. The mean amplitude values of the ERP data for the wh-questions were examined to identify differential processing of subject and object questions. Outcomes & Results: TD children demonstrated asymmetrical comprehension of subject and object wh-questions, whereas children with SLI comprehended both question types poorly and adults did not show subject-object asymmetry. ERP waveforms spanning the wh-dependency revealed a large and widespread sustained anterior positivity for object relative to subject questions in the TD group, indicating differential processing of these questions. This effect was attenuated and non-significant in the SLI group. The adults' grand average waveforms showed the expected LAN effect, which was opposite in polarity relative to the children, although it only approached significance. Conclusions & Implications: The finding of less differential processing of subject and object wh-questions in SLI relative to TD children suggests inefficient maintenance of sentential information in working memory for object questions in SLI. Whereas behavioural methods did not identify subject-object asymmetry in SLI, the more fine-grained method of ERPs elucidated this effect. Further analysis of working memory as the basis for the subject-object asymmetry in SLI is critical for identifying appropriate intervention targets for this population.

Short German sentences consisting of a pronoun and a verb, either correct or containing a morphosyntactic violation, were auditorily presented to 17 German-speaking adults with dyslexia, and 17 matched control participants, while an EEG was recorded. In order to investigate the interaction between low-level phonological processing and morphosyntactic processing, the verbal inflections were manipulated to consist of different levels of acoustic salience. The event-related potential (ERP) results confirm altered morphosyntactic processing in participants with dyslexia, especially when morphosyntactic violations are expressed by both lexical and inflectional changes. Moreover, ERP data on phoneme discrimination and behavioural data on phonemic awareness and verbal short-term memory reveal phonological deficits in dyslexic participants. However, a causal relationship between phonological and morphosyntactic processing was not conclusive, because anomalous morphosyntactic processing in dyslexia is not directly mediated by acoustic salience, rather it correlates with high-level phonological skills and is mediated by lexical cues.

Methods: Hypnotizability level was measured in 16 healthy subjects through the Italian version of the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale (SHSS, score: 0-12). EEG data (56 electrodes) were recorded during non-painful and painful electrical stimuli applied to the left index finger. Cortical activity (vertex N1-P2 complex) was compared in subjects with low hypnotizability level (N = 8, SHSS: 0-6) vs. subjects with high hypnotizability level (N = 8, SHSS: 7-12). Results: The amplitude of the N1-P2 complex was lower in the High-hypnotizability compared to the Low-hypnotizability group over primary sensorimotor cortex (C3 and C4 electrodes) and centro-parietal midline areas (Cz and Pz electrodes) for non-painful and painful stimuli. The SHSS showed a statistically significant negative correlation with the vertex N1-P2 complex at C3 and Cz (r = -0.5, p < 0.05) electrodes for non-painful stimuli. Conclusion: Compared to the Low-hypnotizability subjects, High-hypnotizability subjects showed a reduced cortical activity related to non-painful and painful stimuli. Significance: The results suggest a relationship between hypnotizability and cortical activity related to non-painful and painful stimuli in the condition of waking state (no hypnotic effect).

FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						risk perception; HIV; leukemia; intuition; ERP	RESPONSES; INTUITION; EMOTION; SYSTEM; FACES; AIDS	Field studies on HIV risk perception suggest that people may rely on impressions they have about the safety of their partner. Previous studies show that individuals perceived as "risky" regarding HIV elicit a differential brain response in both earlier (200-350 ms) and later (350-700 ms) time windows compared to those perceived as safe. This raises the question whether this event-related brain potential (ERP) response is specific to contagious life-threatening diseases or a general mechanism triggered by life-threatening but non-contagious diseases. In the present study, we recorded dense sensor EEG while participants (N = 36) evaluated photographs of unacquainted individuals for either HIV or leukemia risk. The ERP results replicated previous findings revealing earlier and later differential brain responses towards individuals perceived as high risk for HIV. However, there were no significant ERP differences for high vs. low leukemia risk. Rather than reflecting a generic response to disease, the present findings suggest that intuitive judgments of HIV risk are at least in part specific to sexually transmitted diseases.

Whether older adults can also use retrospective cues (retro-cues) to enhance VWM capacity is unknown. In the current event-related potential (ERP) study, young and old adults performed a VWM task in which spatially informative retro-cues were presented during maintenance. Young but not older adults' VWM capacity benefited from retro-cueing. The contralateral delay activity (CDA) ERP index of VWM maintenance was attenuated after the retro-cue, which effectively reduced the impact of memory load. CDA amplitudes were reduced prior to retro-cue onset in the old only. Despite a preserved ability to delete items from VWM, older adults may be less able to use retrospective attention to enhance memory capacity when expectancy of impending spatial cues disrupts effective VWM maintenance.

This study aimed to assess predictive and integrative context processing in subjects with high or low scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). The N400 amplitude was recorded during semantic judgment of sentence pairs ending with a lateralized expected or unexpected word from the same or a different category (related and unrelated violation). In both groups, the N400 amplitude was less negative for expected words versus unrelated violations, regardless of which hemisphere received the stimulus, and for related versus unrelated violations, but only for left-hemisphere stimuli. The N400 amplitude for unrelated violations was less negative in subjects with high SPQ scores for both hemispheres. These results indicate that subjects with schizotypal traits use context to predict or integrate congruent words, but fail to inhibit incongruent words.

Typically, researchers represent the brain's response as the mean across repeated experimental trials and disregard signal fluctuations over time as "noise". However, it is becoming clear that brain signal variability conveys meaningful functional information about neural network dynamics. This article describes the novel method of multiscale entropy (MSE) for quantifying brain signal variability. MSE may be particularly informative of neural network dynamics because it shows timescale dependence and sensitivity to linear and nonlinear dynamics in the data.

The ERN has frequently been examined in the context of individual differences and has been proposed as a neurobehavioral risk marker. Given this, it is important to characterize the psychometric properties of the ERN across multiple tasks as a function of increasing trial numbers in order to establish task-specific psychometric properties for efficient assessments in clinical or applied settings. The current study examines the internal reliability of the ERN across the flankers, Stroop, and go/no-go tasks as a function of error number. Results suggest that although the tasks all elicit the ERN reliably, important psychometric differences emerged indicating that the flankers task might be prioritized when assessing the ERN.

Fourteen expert players and 14 age-matched novices viewed, for each of four tasks, 128 unique positions on a mini (4x4) chess board each presented for 0.5s. The tasks were to respond: (a) if white king was in check, (b) if black knight was present, (c) if white king was not in check, and (d) if no black knight was present. Experts showed an enhanced N2 with check targets and a larger P3 with knight targets, relative to novices. Expert-novice differences in posterior N2 began as early as 240ms on check-related searches. Results were consistent with the view that prolonged N2 components reflect matching of current perceptual input to memory, and thus are sensitive to experts' superior pattern recognition and memory retrieval of chunks.

Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that the superior temporal sulcus (STS) plays an important role for this improvement. The spectrotemporal dynamics underlying audiovisual speech processing in the STS, and how these dynamics are affected by auditory noise, are not well understood. Using electroencephalography, we investigated how auditory noise affects audiovisual speech processing in event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity. Spoken syllables were presented in audiovisual (AV) and auditory only (A) trials at three different auditory noise levels (no, low, and high). Responses to A stimuli were subtracted from responses to AV stimuli, separately for each noise level, and these responses were subjected to the statistical analysis. Central ERPs differed between the no noise and the two noise conditions from 130 to 150 ms and 170 to 210 ms after auditory stimulus onset. Source localization using the local autoregressive average procedure revealed an involvement of the lateral temporal lobe, encompassing the superior and middle temporal gyrus. Neuronal activity in the beta-band (16 to 32 Hz) was suppressed at central channels around 100 to 400 ms after auditory stimulus onset in the averaged AV minus A signal over the three noise levels. This suppression was smaller in the high noise compared to the no noise and low noise condition, possibly reflecting disturbed recognition or altered processing of multisensory speech stimuli. Source analysis of the beta-band effect using linear beamforming demonstrated an involvement of the STS. Our study shows that auditory noise alters audiovisual speech processing in ERPs localized to lateral temporal lobe and provides evidence that beta-band activity in the STS plays a role for audiovisual speech processing under regular and noisy acoustic conditions.

Novelty is not enough: laser-evoked potentials are determined by stimulus saliency, not absolute novelty. J Neurophysiol 109: 692-701, 2013. First published November 7, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00464.2012.-Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by transient nociceptive stimuli in humans are largely sensitive to bottom-up novelty induced, for example, by changes in stimulus attributes (e. g., modality or spatial location) within a stream of repeated stimuli. Here we aimed 1) to test the contribution of a selective change of the intensity of a repeated stimulus in determining the magnitude of nociceptive ERPs, and 2) to dissect the effect of this change of intensity in terms of "novelty" and "saliency" (an increase of stimulus intensity is more salient than a decrease of stimulus intensity). Nociceptive ERPs were elicited by trains of three consecutive laser stimuli (S1-S2-S3) delivered to the hand dorsum at a constant 1-s interstimulus interval. Three, equally spaced intensities were used: low (L), medium (M), and high (H). While the intensities of S1 and S2 were always identical (L, M, or H), the intensity of S3 was either identical (e. g., HHH) or different (e. g., MMH) from the intensity of S1 and S2. Introducing a selective change in stimulus intensity elicited significantly larger N1 and N2 waves of the S3-ERP but only when the change consisted in an increase in stimulus intensity. This observation indicates that nociceptive ERPs do not simply reflect processes involved in the detection of novelty but, instead, are mainly determined by stimulus saliency.

Thirty four patients with late-onset depression were included after they had reached remission. They were compared to age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. Each participant completed a single item computer version of the Stroop Color-word task using verbal response mode. EEG and RT were simultaneously recorded. RTs were significantly prolonged in patients in all conditions of the Stroop paradigm, and the interference effect was significantly greater in patients compared to controls. Results also revealed abnormal late positive Stroop related potentials in the period of about 500-600 ms period corresponding to the so-called P300b wave. Our study supports the view that patients with late onset depression are also cognitively impaired and that this impairment persists in the period of early remission. Using more sensitive ERP measurement of the Stroop task we demonstrated impaired information processing at an earlier, pre-response related stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although event-related potential (ERP) studies have disclosed a P300 component in oddball responses to both deviant identity and emotional target faces, it is hypothesized that partially different neural processes should subtend emotion vs. identity within the core network of face processing. In the present study, we used simultaneous ERP-fMRI recordings and ERP-informed analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI data to evidence the specific neural networks underlying P300 generation in response to different deviant emotional vs. identity faces. Method: 18 participants were scanned during a visual oddball task in which they had to detect 3 types of deviant faces representing a change in emotion fear or happiness or in identity, within a series of frequent neutral ones. Amplitude and latency parameters of the P300 component, recorded for each type of deviant faces, were used to constrain fMRI analyses. Results: Analysis of fMRI data informed by single-trial parameters of the P300 component disclosed specific activation patterns for fearful, happy and identity deviant faces. For fearful faces, P300 amplitudes were associated with BOLD changes in the left fusiform gyrus whereas latencies were linked to left superior orbito-frontal and right fusiform activations. P300 amplitude modulations for happy deviant faces involved the left posterior cingulate gyrus and right parahippocampal regions whereas P300 latencies related to the right insula and left caudate regions. Finally, identity deviant faces were associated with widespread activities involving cortical and subcortical regions when P300 amplitudes were considered, and P300 latencies were associated with activity in right hippocampal/parahippocampal regions. Discussion: Our results suggest the existence of differential cerebral functional processes involved in the responses to deviant face stimuli, depending on the quality of the deviance (fear vs. happiness vs. identity).

The aim of this study is to compare different modalities of EEG recording for extraction of ERPs. The first comparison evaluates the performance of six disc electrodes with that of the EMOTIV headset, while the second evaluates three different electrode types (disc, needle, and large squared electrode). Material and methods. - Ten healthy volunteers gave informed consent and were randomized to try the traditional EEG system (six disc electrodes with gel and skin preparation) or the EMOTIV Headset first. Together with the six disc electrodes, a needle and a square electrode of larger surface were simultaneously recording near lead Cz. Each modality was evaluated over three sessions of auditory P300 separated by one hour. Results. - No statically significant effect was found for the electrode type, nor was the interaction between electrode type and session number. There was no statistically significant difference of performance between the EMOTIV and the six traditional EEG disc electrodes, although there was a trend showing worse performance of the EMOTIV headset. However, the modality-session interaction was highly significant (P < 0.001) showing that, while the performance of the six disc electrodes stay constant over sessions, the performance of the EMOTIV headset drops dramatically between 2 and 3h of use. Finally, the evaluation of comfort by participants revealed an increasing discomfort with the EMOTIV headset starting with the second hour of use. Conclusion. - Our study does not recommend the use of one modality over another based on performance but suggests the choice should be made on more practical considerations such as the expected length of use, the availability of skilled labor for system setup and above all, the patient comfort.

Syntax in a pianist's hand: ERP signatures of "embodied" syntax processing in music	CORTEX			English	Article						Music; Syntax; Action; Imitation; Embodiment	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BROCAS AREA; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MOTOR SEQUENCE; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; POTENTIALS; EXPECTANCY	Syntactic operations in language and music are well established and known to be linked in cognitive and neuroanatomical terms. What remains a matter of debate is whether the notion of syntax also applies to human actions and how those may be linked to syntax in language and music. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study explored syntactic processes during the observation, motor programming, and execution of musical actions. Therefore, expert pianists watched and imitated silent videos of a hand playing 5-chord sequences in which the last chord was syntactically congruent or incongruent with the preceding harmonic context. 2-chord sequences that diluted the syntactic predictability of the last chord (by reducing the harmonic context) served as a control condition. We assumed that behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) effects (i.e., differences between congruent and incongruent trials) that were significantly stronger in the 5-chord compared to the 2-chord sequences are related to syntactic processing. According to this criterion, the present results show an influence of syntactic context on ERPs related to (i) action observation and (ii) the motor programming for action imitation, as well as (iii) participants' execution times and accuracy. In particular, the occurrence of electrophysiological indices of action inhibition and reprogramming when an incongruent chord had to be imitated implies that the pianist's motor system anticipated (and revoked) the congruent chord during action observation. Notably, this well-known anticipatory potential of the motor system seems to be strongly based upon the observer's music-syntactic knowledge, thus suggesting the "embodied" processing of musical syntax. The combined behavioural and electrophysiological data show that the notion of musical syntax not only applies to the auditory modality but transfers in trained musicians to a "grammar of musical action".

Moreover, event-related potentials caused by different kinds of picture stimuli showed different amplitude levels of N170 which was maximal over occipito-temporal electrode sites. However, the phenomenon which is mentioned above may be correlated with some local bold signal change, and where is the change happened is still unclear. Recently, research for EEG-fMRI has been widely performed through General Linear Model (GLM) to find the relationship between some feature of the ERP component and the activation of local brain area. In our study, we dealt with the simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data of picture stimuli to find the correlation between the change of the N170's amplitude and the BOLD signal. The amplitudes of the N170 component from the average ERPs of 4 different kinds of picture stimuli were extracted from the EEG data and the activation map for the same stimuli was provided based on the fMRI data. GLM was performed including regressors that could represent the change of the N170's amplitude. Our result showed that fusiform and occipital gyrus were activated by the parametric design and were overlapped by the activation map of the common fMRI design. Thus we might infer that these regions had relationship with the change of the amplitudes of N170. Our research may contribute to location of the source of N170 and bring a new approach for the parameter design of the fMRI signal in EEG-fMRI analysis.

J	Egorova, N; Shtyrov, Y; Pulvermuller, F				Egorova, Natalia; Shtyrov, Yury; Pulvermueller, Friedemann			Early and parallel processing of pragmatic and semantic information in speech acts: neurophysiological evidence	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech act; pragmatics; communicative action; social interaction; electroencephalography (EEG); L1 norm source reconstruction; fronto-central cortex; temporo-parietal cortex	NEURAL BASIS; SENTENCE; CONTEXT; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; DISCOURSE; KNOWLEDGE; WORDS	Although language is a tool for communication, most research in the neuroscience of language has focused on studying words and sentences, while little is known about the brain mechanisms of speech acts, or communicative functions, for which words and sentences are used as tools. Here the neural processing of two types of speech acts, Naming and Requesting, was addressed using the time-resolved event-related potential (ERP) technique. The brain responses for Naming and Request diverged as early as similar to 120 ms after the onset of the critical words, at the same time as, or even before, the earliest brain manifestations of semantic word properties could be detected. Request evoked potentials were generally larger in amplitude than those for Naming. The use of identical words in closely matched settings for both speech acts rules out explanation of the difference in terms of phonological, lexical, semantic properties, or word expectancy. The cortical sources underlying the ERP enhancement for Requests were found in the fronto-central cortex, consistent with the activation of action knowledge, as well as in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), possibly reflecting additional implications of speech acts for social interaction and theory of mind. These results provide the first evidence for surprisingly early access to pragmatic and social interactive knowledge, which possibly occurs in parallel with other types of linguistic processing, and thus supports the near-simultaneous access to different subtypes of psycholinguistic information.

Refractory effects of the N1 event-related potential in experienced cochlear implant patients	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY			English	Article						Cochlear implant; EEG; hearing loss; auditory evoked potential (AEP); auditory refractory period	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; HEARING-LOSS; CHILDREN; PLASTICITY; SPEECH; DEPRIVATION; PERCEPTION; MATURATION; DYNAMICS	Objective: To determine if cochlear implant (CI) patients exhibit a temporal processing deficit for auditory stimuli, by examining refractory effects of the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component. Design: CI patients and normally-hearing controls were tested in an auditory refractory period paradigm while ERP recordings were collected across the scalp. Participants were presented with brief 500-Hz tones that were separated by inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 500, 1000, or 3000 ms. The amplitude of the N1 was examined as a function of ISI within each group. Study sample: Ten adult CI patients and 13 age-matched normally-hearing controls were tested. Patients had long-lasting severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss prior to implantation, and a minimum of two years experience with CI activation. Results: Unlike normally-hearing controls, CI users showed no refractory effect for tones at 500 ms ISIs compared to 1000 ms. However, similar to controls, recovery from refractoriness was observed in anterior locations at 3000 ms. Conclusion: The refractory period threshold, defined as the minimum ISI where different N1 amplitudes are elicited, is greater than 1000 ms in CI patients; at least double that of normally-hearing controls.

A Concealed Information Test with Combination of ERP Recording and Autonomic Measurements	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						concealed information test; event-related potentials; autonomic responses; logistic regression model; linear discriminant analysis	GUILTY KNOWLEDGE TEST; LIE DETECTION; INTERSTIMULUS-INTERVAL; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SKIN-CONDUCTANCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; DECEPTION; VALIDITY; P300	The concealed information test (CIT) is based on a comparison between the subject's physiological responses to a probe and irrelevant items in order to detect concealed information. The main purpose of our study was to investigate the CIT accuracy enhancement related to a combination of recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) and autonomic measurements. We tried to maximally liken the experimental conditions to real ones by the use of a criminal context in the "mock crime" instruction and real innocent subjects instead of hypothetical ones. Fifty-two subjects volunteered and performed just one of the innocent or guilty scenarios. The CIT was designed in five blocks with short interstimulus intervals. In each block, stimuli were presented in the 7th-order balanced sequence. In addition to EEG phenomena, the heart rate, skin conductance responses (SCRs), respiratory activity, and finger plethysmogram were recorded. Statistical analyses showed that there was a significant difference between standardized difference scores of the guilty and innocent groups in both ERP and autonomic measures. The SCR did not achieve the expected results reported in standard autonomic-based CIT studies. A review of the two classification methods showed that the combination of ERP and autonomic measurements enhances the CIT accuracy. The best classification accuracy obtained by the aid of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was 90.9%. It seems that using a criminal context in the "mock crime" instruction and the reward-punishment system made subjects more attentive and involved in the experiment; therefore, the accuracy was improved compared with that in similar studies.

As in any brain computer interface, severe physiological and environmental signal artifacts that affect signal quality in EEG are a detriment to performance. To alleviate the negative effects of such artifacts on RSVP Keyboard (TM), we implemented a filter that is based on an existing methodology from the literature. Using statistical modeling of pre-recorded EEG that includes three types of artifacts intentionally generated by operators, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of copy-phrase tasks and analyze the effect of artifact filtering on estimated typing performance.

EEG ANOMALIES IN ADULT ADHD SUBJECTS PERFORMING A WORKING MEMORY TASK	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; electroencephalography; event-related potential; event-related spectral changes or perturbations	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; AND/OR PDD-NOS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; FRENCH VERSION; ALPHA; LOAD	Functional imaging studies have revealed differential brain activation patterns in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) adult patients performing working memory (WM) tasks. The existence of alterations in WM-related cortical circuits during childhood may precede executive dysfunctions in this disorder in adults. To date, there is no study exploring the electrophysiological activation of WM-related neural networks in ADHD. To address this issue, we carried out an electroencephalographic (EEG) activation study associated with time frequency (TF) analysis in 15 adults with ADHD and 15 controls performing two visual N-back WM tasks, as well as oddball detection and passive fixation tasks. Frontal transient (phasic) theta event-related synchronization (ERS, 0-500 msec) was significantly reduced in ADHD as compared to control subjects. Such reduction was equally present in a task-independent manner. In contrast, the power of the later sustained (similar to 500-1200 msec) theta ERS for all tasks was comparable in ADHD and control groups. In active WM tasks, ADHD patients displayed lower alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD, similar to 200-900 msec) and higher subsequent alpha ERS (similar to 900-2400 msec) compared to controls. The time course of alpha ERD/ERS cycle was modified in ADHD patients compared to controls, suggesting that they are able to use late compensatory mechanisms in order to perform this WM task. These findings support the idea of an ADHD-related dysfunction of neural generators sub-serving attention directed to the incoming visual information. ADHD cases may successfully face WM needs depending on the preservation of sustained theta ERS and prolonged increase of alpha ERS at later post-stimulus time points. (C) 2013 IBRO.

J	Cespon, J; Galcio-Alvarez, S; Diaz, F				Cespon, Jesus; Galcio-Alvarez, Santiago; Diaz, Fernando			Electrophysiological Correlates of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment in a Simon Task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; N2PC COMPONENT; VISUAL-SEARCH; ATTENTION; INDIVIDUALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ACTIVATION; GENERATION; CONVERSION	Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially when additional cognitive domains are affected (Petersen et al., 2009). Thus, single-domain amnestic MCI (sdaMCI) and multiple-domain-amnestic MCI (mdaMCI) biomarkers are important for enabling early interventions to help slow down progression of the disease. Recording event-related potentials (ERPs) is a non-invasive and inexpensive measure of brain activity associated with cognitive processes, and it is of interest from a clinical point of view. The ERP technique may also be useful for obtaining early sdaMCI and mdaMCI biomarkers because ERPs are sensitive to impairment in processes that are not manifested at behavioral or clinical levels. In the present study, EEG activity was recorded in 25 healthy participants and 30 amnestic MCI patients (17 sdaMCI and 13 mdaMCI) while they performed a Simon task. The ERPs associated with visuospatial (N2 posterior-contralateral - N2pc -) and motor (lateralized readiness potential - LRP -) processes were examined. The N2pc amplitude was smaller in participants with mdaMCI than in healthy participants, which indicated a decline in the correlates of allocation of attentional resources to the target stimulus. In addition, N2pc amplitude proved to be a moderately good biomarker of mdaMCI subtype (0.77 sensitivity, 0.76 specificity). However, the LRP amplitude was smaller in the two MCI groups (sdaMCI and mdaMCI) than in healthy participants, revealing a reduction in the motor resources available to execute the response in sdaMCI and mdaMCI patients. Furthermore, the LRP amplitude proved to be a valid biomarker (0.80 sensitivity, 0.92 specificity) of both amnestic MCI subtypes.

Happy or sad musical stimuli were presented after happy or sad facial images during electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. We asked participants to judge the affective congruency of the presented face-music pairs. The congruency of emotionally congruent pairs was judged more rapidly than that of incongruent pairs. In addition, the EEG data showed that incongruent musical targets elicited a larger N400 component than congruent pairs. Furthermore, these effects occurred in nonmusicians as well as musicians. In sum, emotional integrative processing of face-music pairs was facilitated in congruent music targets and inhibited in incongruent music targets; this process was not significantly modulated by individual musical experience. This is the first study on musical stimuli primed by facial expressions to demonstrate that the N400 component reflects the affective priming effect. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We tested a haptic robot (HR) as such a tool. Positive results would also be promising for combined use of fMRI and EEG to study reaching. Twenty right-handed subjects performed reaching tasks with their right hand with and without the HR. Reaction time, movement time (MT), accuracy, event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) were studied. Reaction times and accuracies did not differ significantly between the two tasks, while the MT was significantly longer in HR reaching (959 vs. 447 ms). We identified two positive and two negative ERP peaks across all leads in both tasks. The latencies of the P1 and N2 peaks were significantly longer in HR reaching, while there were no significant differences in the P3 and N4 latencies. ERD/ERS topographies were similar between tasks and similar to other reaching studies. Main difference was in ERS rebound which was observed only in actual reaching. Probable reason was significantly larger MT. We found that reaching with the HR engages similar neural structures as in actual reaching. Although there are some constrains, its use may be superior to other techniques used for reaching studies in the MRI environment, where freedom of movement is limited.

Midfrontal conflict-related theta-band power reflects neural oscillations that predict behavior	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; midfrontal; non-phase-locked; oscillations; theta	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; DYNAMICS; EEG; STIMULUS; ERP	Action monitoring and conflict resolution require the rapid and flexible coordination of activity in multiple brain regions. Oscillatory neural population activity may be a key physiological mechanism underlying such rapid and flexible network coordination. EEG power modulations of theta-band (4-8 Hz) activity over the human midfrontal cortex during response conflict have been proposed to reflect neural oscillations that support conflict detection and resolution processes. However, it has remained unclear whether this frequency-band-specific activity reflects neural oscillations or nonoscillatory responses (i.e., event-related potentials). Here, we show that removing the phase-locked component of the EEG did not reduce the strength of the conflict-related modulation of the residual (i.e., non-phase-locked) theta power over midfrontal cortex. Furthermore, within-subject regression analyses revealed that the non-phase-locked theta power was a significantly better predictor of the conflict condition than was the time-domain phase-locked EEG component. Finally, non-phase-locked theta power showed robust and condition-specific (high-vs. low-conflict) cross-trial correlations with reaction time, whereas the phase-locked component did not. Taken together, our results indicate that most of the conflict-related and behaviorally relevant midfrontal EEG signal reflects a modulation of ongoing theta-band oscillations that occurs during the decision process but is not phase-locked to the stimulus or to the response.

Test-retest reliability and stability of N400 effects in a word-pair semantic priming paradigm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Neurophysiology; Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Semantics; Reproducibility of results	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPREADING ACTIVATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; THOUGHT-DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MEMORY; REPETITION; TASK	Objective: Elicited by any meaningful stimulus, the N400 event-related potential (ERP) component is reduced when the stimulus is related to a preceding one. This N400 semantic priming effect has been used to probe abnormal semantic relationship processing in clinical disorders, and suggested as a possible biomarker for treatment studies. Validating N400 semantic priming effects as a clinical biomarker requires characterizing their test-retest reliability. Methods: We assessed test-retest reliability of N400 semantic priming in 16 healthy adults who viewed the same related and unrelated prime-target word pairs in two sessions one week apart. Results: As expected, N400 amplitudes were smaller for related versus unrelated targets across sessions. N400 priming effects (amplitude differences between unrelated and related targets) were highly correlated across sessions (r = 0.85, P < 0.0001), but smaller in the second session due to larger N400s to related targets. Conclusions: N400 priming effects have high reliability over a one-week interval. They may decrease with repeat testing, possibly because of motivational changes. Significance: Use of N400 priming effects in treatment studies should account for possible magnitude decreases with repeat testing. Further research is needed to delineate N400 priming effects' test-retest reliability and stability in different age and clinical groups, and with different stimulus types.

While much progress has been made to overcome the multiple technical challenges associated with the recording of EEG inside the MR scanner, the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact, which is caused by cardiac-related motion inside the magnetic field, remains a major issue affecting EEG quality. The BCG is difficult to remove by standard average artifact subtraction (AAS) methods due to its variability across cardiac cycles. We thus investigate the possibility of directly recording the BCG motion using an optical motion-tracking system. In 5 subjects, the system is shown to accurately measure BCG motion. Regressing out linear and quadratic functions of the measured motion parameters resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes across cardiac cycles compared to MS. A further significant RMS reduction was obtained when applying the regression and AAS methods sequentially, resulting in RMS amplitudes that were not significantly different from those of EEG recorded outside the scanner, although with higher residual variability. The large contributions of pure translational parameters and of non-linear terms to the BCG waveforms indicate that non-rigid motion of the EEG wires (originating from rigid head motion) is likely an important cause of the artifact.

Perception of dissonant chords in non-musicians was accompanied by increase of lower theta activity over right anterior regions, while consonant chords induced greater theta activity over left anterior regions; this pattern of asymmetrical activation was not observed in musicians. ERP analysis revealed that musicians had greater amplitude of early components (P100, N200) than non-musicians irrespective of chord type. The obtained results reflect more efficient musical harmony processing and, possibly, less emotional perception of chords in musicians.

We propose an array of ICA-Based P300 processing systems with additive white Gaussian noise. The array system attains maximum accuracy when noise intensity is not zero and thus the system shows the stochastic resonance effect. The prediction accuracy increases as the number of stages of the array increases. Experimental results show that increasing the array size with the proper amount of noise can improve the accuracy of the original P300 signal detection using ICA-based subspace projection technique.

Reading performance is similar for the two groups in both languages. While reading Mandarin Chinese, the control group showed a left-hemispheric specialization within the 400-600 ms interval in delta synchronization. However, delta synchronizations were widely distributed in all scalp regions and lasted longer than 600 ms in the AS group. One possible interpretation of our data is the hypothesis that the AS group has more difficulty in brain organization of semantic and syntactic processes than the control group when reading their native language, because Chinese syntactic structure requires more work to be done by the perceiver. Nevertheless, other brain mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation), can partially compensate for this difficulty, allowing AS subjects to attain the same level of response activity as the controls.

Demand and modality of directed attention modulate "pre-attentive" sensory processes in schizophrenia patients and nonpsychiatric controls	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Attention; Event related potential; Modulation; Mismatch negativity; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; TASK DEMANDS; HIGH-RISK; P3A; DEFICITS; MMN; P300	Background: Mismatch negativity(MNN) and P3a are event related potential (ERP) measures of early sensory information processing. These components are usually conceptualized as being "pre-attentive" and therefore immune to changes with variations in attentional functioning. This study aimed to determine whether manipulations of attention influence the amplitudes and latencies of MMN and P3a and, if so, the extent to which these early sensory processes govern concurrent behavioral vigilance performance in schizophrenia patients and normal subjects. Methods: Schizophrenia patients (SZ; n = 20) and Nonpsychiatric Control Subjects (NCS; n = 20) underwent auditory ERP testing to assess MMN and P3a across 4 EEG recording sessions in which attentional demand (low vs. high) and sensory modality of directed attention (visual vs. auditory) were experimentally varied. Results: Across conditions, SZ patients exhibited deficits in MMN and P3a amplitudes. Significant amplitude and latency modulation were observed in both SZ and NCS but there were no group-by-condition interactions. The amount of MMN amplitude attenuation from low-to high-demand tasks was significantly associated with increased vigilance performance in both SZ and NCS groups (r = -0.67 and r = -0.60). Several other robust associations were also observed among neurophysiologic, clinical and cognitive variables. Conclusions: Attentional demand and modality of directed attention significantly influence the amplitude and latencies of "pre-attentive" ERP components in both SZ and NCS. Deficits in MMN and P3a were not "normalized" when attention was directed to the auditory stimuli in schizophrenia patients. The adaptive modulation of early sensory information processing appears to govern concurrent attentional task performance. The temporal window reflecting automatic sensory discrimination as indexed as MMN and P3a may serve as a gateway to some higher order cognitive operations necessary for psychosocial functioning.

J	Calvo, MG; Beltran, D				Calvo, Manuel G.; Beltran, David			Recognition advantage of happy faces: Tracing the neurocognitive processes	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERP; Facial expression; Emotion; Recognition; Time course	EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSES; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP; PERCEPTION; IDENTIFICATION; EXPLICIT; FEARFUL	The present study aimed to identify the brain processes and their time course underlying the typical behavioral recognition advantage of happy facial expressions. To this end, we recorded EEG activity during an expression categorization task for happy, angry, fearful, sad, and neutral faces, and the correlation between event-related-potential (ER?) patterns and recognition performance was assessed. N170 (150-180 ms) was enhanced for angry, fearful and sad faces; N2 was reduced and early posterior negativity (EPN; both, 200-320 ms) was enhanced for happy and angry faces; P3b (350-450 ms) was reduced for happy and neutral faces; and slow positive wave (SPW; 700-800 ms) was reduced for happy faces. This reveals (a) an early processing (N170) of negative affective valence (i.e., angry, fearful, and sad), (b) discrimination (N2 and EPN) of affective intensity or arousal (i.e., angry and happy), and (c) facilitated categorization (P3b) and decision (SPW) due to expressive distinctiveness (i.e., happy). In addition, N2, EPN, P3b, and SPW were related to categorization accuracy and speed. This suggests that conscious expression recognition and the typical happy face advantage depend on encoding of expressive intensity and, especially, on later response selection, rather than on the early processing of affective valence.

Comparing P300 modulations: Target-to-target interval versus infrequent nontarget-to-nontarget interval in a three-stimulus task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Target-to-target interval (TTI); Nontarget-to-nontarget interval (NNI); Sequence effects; Interstimulus interval (ISI); P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULUS EVALUATION; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; NOVELTY P3; PROBABILITY; SEQUENCE; COMPONENT; AMPLITUDE; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY; INTENSITY	This study examined temporal determinants of the P300 component of the ERP in a three-stimulus visual oddball task. Frequent standards, with equiprobable targets and infrequent nontargets, were utilized. We tested whether the infrequent nontarget-to-nontarget interval (infrequent NNI) influences P300 amplitudes and latencies analogously to the target-to-target interval (TTI). EEG was recorded from 27 participants, and response time and P300 effects of TTIs and infrequent NNIs were assessed. Increases in TTI augmented target P300 amplitudes and decreased latencies and response times. However, this modulation of P300 amplitude was weak for manipulations of infrequent NNI. P300 latencies increased initially before decreasing across infrequent NNI levels. Together, these findings support the notion that the P300 has an underlying temporal mechanism that is modulated by motivationally significant events. Theoretical implications are discussed.

Electrophysiological responses to emotional prosody perception in cochlear implant users	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Emotional prosody; Cochlear implants; ERP; P200; Gamma band power	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PHASE-LOCKING; ERP EVIDENCE; COMPONENT; MODULATION; STIMULI; PITCH; LATERALIZATION	The present electroencephalographic (EEG) study investigated the ability of cochlear implant (CI) users to recognize emotional prosody. Two CI speech-processing strategies were compared: the ACE (Advance Combination Encoder) and the newly developed MP3000. Semantically neutral sentences spoken in three different emotional prosodies (neutral, angry, happy) were presented to 20 post-lingually deafened CI users and age-matched normal-hearing controls. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to study the N100 and the P200 responses. In addition, event-related spectral power modulations were calculated to study the brain activity corresponding to the recognition of prosody in earlier (0-400) as well as later (600-1200) part of the stimuli where the prosodic features differed maximally. CI users with MP3000 strategy showed a higher proportion of correctly recognized prosodic information compared to the ACE strategy users. Our ERP results demonstrated that emotional prosody elicited significant N100 and P200 peaks. Furthermore, the P200 amplitude in response to happy prosodic information was significantly more positive for the MP3000 strategy compared to the ACE strategy. On spectral power analysis, two typical gamma activities were observed in the MP3000 users only: (1) an early gamma activity in the 100-250 ms time window reflecting bottom-up attention regulation; and (2) a late gamma activity between 900 and 1100 ms post-stimulus onset, probably reflecting top-down cognitive control. Our study suggests that the MP3000 strategy is better than ACE in regard to happy prosody perception. Furthermore, we show that EEG is a useful tool that, in combination with behavioral analysis, can reveal differences between two CI processing strategies for coding of prosody-specific features of language.

In order to verify this hypothesis we performed an EEG experiment presenting to participants images of abstract works of art with marked traces of brushstrokes. The EEG data were analyzed by using Event Related Potentials (ERPs). We aimed to demonstrate a direct involvement of sensorimotor cortical circuits during the beholding of these selected works of abstract art. The stimuli consisted of three different abstract black and white paintings by Franz Kline. Results verified our experimental hypothesis showing the activation of premotor and motor cortical areas during stimuli observation. In addition, abstract works of art observation elicited the activation of reward-related orbitofrontal areas, and cognitive categorization-related prefrontal areas. The cortical sensorimotor activation is a fundamental neurophysiological demonstration of the direct involvement of the cortical motor system in perception of static meaningless images belonging to abstract art. These results support the role of embodied simulation of artist's gestures in the perception of works of art.

J	Shahriari, Y; Erfanian, A				Shahriari, Yalda; Erfanian, Abbas			Improving the performance of P300-based brain-computer interface through subspace-based filtering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; P300 speller; Subspace filtering	MUTUAL INFORMATION; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; CHANNEL SELECTION; POTENTIALS	The detection of the presence of the P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a challenging issue in P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The P300-based developed in this work allows a subject to communicate 1 of 36 symbols presented on a 6 x 6 matrix. When a target symbol is seen by the subject, unique event-related potential (ERP) characterized by P300 is elicited. Thus, in P300 speller, accurate detection of such distinct ERP provides faster and reliable communication. In this paper, a subspace-based spatial filter was employed to enhance the detection of the presence of the P300 in the EEG. The subspace-based filter was designed by maximizing the ratio between the brain signals synchronized with the target stimulus and that with the nontarget stimulus. The processing method was evaluated offline and online on the data obtained from five subjects. The results of offline studies showed that the average accuracies of 97.5% and 90.5% were achieved in P300 detection and character recognition, respectively. The average communication rate achieved was 17.13 bits/min with an average accuracy of 89.5% using 10 electrodes during online experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cognitive deficits have been investigated much less extensively in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) than in ALS. Objective: To investigate bioelectrical activity to Stroop test, assessing frontal function, in ALS, PLS, and control groups. <bold>Methods</bold>: Thirty-two non-demented ALS patients, 10 non-demented PLS patients, and 27 healthy subjects were included. Twenty-nine electroencephalography channels with binaural reference were recorded during covert Stroop task performance, involving mental discrimination of the stimuli and not vocal or motor response. Group effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) latency were analyzed using statistical multivariate analysis.Topographic analysis was performed using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients committed more errors in the execution of the task but they were not slower, whereas PLS patients did not show reduced accuracy, despite a slowing of reaction times (RTs).The main ERP components were delayed in ALS, but not in PLS, compared with controls. Moreover, RTs speed but not ERP latency correlated with clinical scores. ALS had decreased frontotemporal activity in the P2, P3, and N4 time windows compared to controls. Conclusion:These findings suggest a different pattern of psychophysiological involvement in ALS compared with PLS. The former is increasingly recognized to be a multisystems disorder, with a spectrum of executive and behavioral impairments reflecting frontotemporal dysfunction. The latter seems to mainly involve the motor system, with largely spared cognitive functions. Moreover, our results suggest that the covert version of the Stroop task used in the present study, may be useful to assess cognitive state in the very advanced stage of the disease, when other cognitive tasks are not applicable.

Although this ERP attenuation could be caused by central processes, it may also reflect a peripheral mechanism: the coactivation of the stapedius muscle with the task-relevant effector, which reduces signal transmission efficiency in the middle ear, reducing the effective intensity of concurrently presented tones, which, in turn, elicit lower amplitude auditory ERPs. Because stapedius muscle contraction attenuates frequencies below 2kHz, no attenuation should occur at frequencies above 2kHz. A self-induced tone paradigm was administered with 0.5, 2.0, and 8.0kHz pure tones. Self-induced tones elicited attenuated N1 and P2 ERPs, but the magnitude of attenuation was not affected by tone frequency. This result does not support the hypothesis that ERP attenuation to self-induced tones are caused by stapedius muscle contractions.

The search of such patterns takes place in the high dimensional electrode space with all the problems that comes with it. In this paper, we present a technique for the extraction, detection and representation of EEG microstates based on the Local Global graph(LG graph). We use the Local Global graph to represent the spatial configuration of the topographic map and use a LG graph matching approach to determine the different microstates. The proposed method was applied on the average, over trials, Event related potential recording presenting a positive peak known as P300. Five dominant microstates were identified using our methodology. During the whole period of the P300 peak there is one active microstate which presents frontal and parietal topography which is expected for the phase locked activations of the P300. The LG graph modeling of the EEG topography provides a flexible descriptor for the EEG topography and can be used for the efficient microstate segmentation of the EEG.

One motivation for the new method is to present stimuli on the fringe of awareness, such that it is more difficult for deceivers to confound the deception test using countermeasures. The proposed system is able to detect identity deception (by using the first names of participants) with a 100% hit rate (at an alpha level of 0.05). To achieve this, we extended the classic Event-Related Potential (ERP) techniques (such as peak-to-peak) by applying Randomisation, a form of Monte Carlo resampling, which we used to detect deception at an individual level. In order to make the deployment of the system simple and rapid, we utilised data from three electrodes only: Fz, Cz and Pz. We then combined data from the three electrodes using Fisher's method so that each participant was assigned a single p-value, which represents the combined probability that a specific participant was being deceptive. We also present subliminal salience search as a general method to determine what participants find salient by detecting breakthrough into conscious awareness using EEG.

Southern listeners were presented with three word forms, two of which are encountered in both Standard and Southern French ([kot] and [kut]), whereas the third one exists in Standard but not Southern French ([kot]). EEG recordings suggest that all of the word pairs were discriminated by the listeners, although discrimination arose about 100ms later for the pairs which included the non-native word form than for those which contained word forms common to both French varieties. Behavioral data provide evidence that vowel discrimination is sensitive to the influence of the listeners' native phonemic inventory at a late decisional stage of processing.

Sequences of a regularly repeating three-tone pattern, the perceived organization of which spontaneously switched back and forth between two alternative interpretations, were delivered to listeners. Occasionally, a regular tone was exchanged for a slightly or moderately lower one (deviants). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while listeners continuously marked their perception of the sound sequence. We found that for both the regular and the deviant tones, the early exogenous P1 and N1 amplitudes varied together with the perceived sound organization. Percept-dependent effects on the late endogenous N2 and P3a amplitudes were only found for deviant tones. These results suggest that the perceived sound organization affects sound processing both by modulating what information is extracted from incoming sounds as well as by influencing how deviant sound events are evaluated for further processing.

Object substitution masking in schizophrenia: an event-related potential analysis	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						visual processing; schizophrenia; ERP; visual backward masking; reentrant processing	PSYCHIATRIC RATING-SCALE; BACKWARD VISUAL MASKING; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SENSORY CONTRIBUTIONS; RECOGNITION AREAS; QUALITY-ASSURANCE; PERCEPTION; AWARENESS; ATTENTION; INFORMATION	Schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits on visual processing tasks, including visual backward masking, and these impairments are related to deficits in higher-level processes. In the current study we used electroencephalography techniques to examine successive stages and pathways of visual processing in a specialized masking paradigm, four-dot masking, which involves masking by object substitution. Seventy-six schizophrenia patients and 66 healthy controls had event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during four-dot masking. Target visibility was manipulated by changing stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the target and mask, such that performance decreased with increasing SOA. Three SOAs were used: 0, 50, and 100 ms. The P100 and N100 perceptual ERPs were examined. Additionally, the visual awareness negativity (VAN) to correct vs. incorrect responses, an index of reentrant processing, was examined for SOAs 50 and 100 ms. Results showed that patients performed worse than controls on the behavioral task across all SOAs. The ERP results revealed that patients had significantly smaller P100 and N100 amplitudes, though there was no effect of SOA on either component in either group. In healthy controls, but not patients, N100 amplitude correlated significantly with behavioral performance at SOAs where masking occurred, such that higher accuracy correlated with a larger N100. Healthy controls, but not patients, exhibited a larger VAN to correct vs. incorrect responses. The results indicate that the N100 appears to be related to attentional effort in the task in controls, but not patients. Considering that the VAN is thought to reflect reentrant processing, one interpretation of the findings is that patients' lack of VAN response and poorer performance may be related to dysfunctional reentrant processing.

Eye movement related brain responses to emotional scenes during free viewing	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; emotion; EEG; eye movements; co-registration; fixation-related potentials; free viewing; LPP		Emotional stimuli are preferentially processed over neutral stimuli. Previous studies, however, disagree on whether emotional stimuli capture attention preattentively or whether the processing advantage is dependent on allocation of attention. The present study investigated attention and emotion processes by measuring brain responses related to eye movement events while 11 participants viewed images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Brain responses to emotional stimuli were compared between serial and parallel presentation. An emotional set included one image with high positive or negative valence among neutral images. A neutral set comprised four neutral images. The participants were asked to indicate which picture-if any-was emotional and to rate that picture on valence and arousal. In the serial condition, the event-related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the stimulus onset. In the parallel condition, the ERPs were time-locked to the first eye entry on an image. The eye movement results showed facilitated processing of emotional, especially unpleasant information. The EEG results in both presentation conditions showed that the LPP (late positive potential) amplitudes at 400500 ms were enlarged for the unpleasant and pleasant pictures as compared to neutral pictures. Moreover, the unpleasant scenes elicited stronger responses than pleasant scenes. The ERP results did not support parafoveal emotional processing, although the eye movement results suggested faster attention capture by emotional stimuli. Our findings, thus, suggested that emotional processing depends on overt attentional resources engaged in the processing of emotional content. The results also indicate that brain responses to emotional images can be analyzed time-locked to eye movement events, although the response amplitudes were larger during serial presentation.

Hence there is a need to investigate how best to model our Visual Attention (VA) with a view to allocate our attention efficiently. We use the color-word Stroop task combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) to model VA: subjects undertake the Stroop task and their EEG is recorded. This is in contrast to other studies that use techniques such as Event Related Potentials (ERP), Contextual Modeling Frameworks, eye movements and facial recognition. The paper presents a simple and useful model to recognize VA dynamically. We use the linear EEG features of different cortical fields as the main inference factors, and take the response time (RT) of the Stroop task as a metric to quantify subject performance. First, we obtain the most relevant EEG feature vectors from the recording, using a correlation analysis. Second, we use experimental data for training the VA model, using a regression method. Last, we then apply further experimental data to test the proposed model. The results from the tests conducted demonstrate that our model maps visual attention very closely.

Improved detection of amnestic MCI by means of discriminative vector quantization of single-trial cognitive ERP responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Mild cognitive impairment; Event-related potentials; Single-trial analysis; Vector quantization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; P300 SUBCOMPONENTS; ONGOING EEG; IMPAIRMENT; DIAGNOSIS; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEMENTIA; STATE	Cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely employed in the study of dementive disorders. The morphology of averaged response is known to be under the influence of neurodegenerative processes and exploited for diagnostic purposes. This work is built over the idea that there is additional information in the dynamics of single-trial responses. We introduce a novel way to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the recordings of auditory ERP responses. Using single trial responses from a cohort of 25 amnestic MCI patients and a group of age-matched controls, we suggest a descriptor capable of encapsulating single-trial (ST) response dynamics for the benefit of early diagnosis. A customized vector quantization (VQ) scheme is first employed to summarize the overall set of ST-responses by means of a small-sized codebook of brain waves that is semantically organized. Each ST-response is then treated as a trajectory that can be encoded as a sequence of code vectors. A subject's set of responses is consequently represented as a histogram of activated code vectors. Discriminating MCI patients from healthy controls is based on the deduced response profiles and carried out by means of a standard machine learning procedure. The novel response representation was found to improve significantly MCI detection with respect to the standard alternative representation obtained via ensemble averaging (13% in terms of sensitivity and 6% in terms of specificity). Hence, the role of cognitive ERPs as biomarker for MCI can be enhanced by adopting the delicate description of our VQ scheme. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The rationale is that the masks (e.g., strings of X's) prevent parafoveal preprocessing, but do not interfere with foveal processing. A recent study, however, raised doubts about the neutrality of parafoveal masks. In the present study, we explored this issue by means of fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs). Two FRP conditions presented rows of five words. The task of the participant was to judge whether the final word of a list was a "new" word, or whether it was a repeated (i.e., "old") word. The critical manipulation was that the final word was X-masked during parafoveal preview in one condition, whereas another condition presented a valid preview of the word. In two additional event-related brain potential (ERP) conditions, the words were presented serially with no parafoveal preview available; in one of the conditions with a fixed timing, in the other word presentation was self-paced by the participants. Expectedly, the valid-preview FRP condition elicited the shortest processing times. Processing times did not differ between the two ERP conditions indicating that "cognitive readiness" during self-paced processing can be ruled out as an alternative explanation for differences in processing times between the ERP and the FRP conditions. The longest processing times were found in the X-mask FRP condition indicating that parafoveal X-masks interfere with foveal word recognition.

However, it remains unclear what pattern is associated with the inhibition of a planned motor response. Therefore, we performed TMS-EEG recording during a go/stop task, in which participants were instructed to click a computer mouse with a right index finger when an indicator that was moving with a constant velocity reached a target (go trial) or to avoid the click when the indicator randomly stopped just before it reached the target (stop trial). Single-pulse TMS to the left (contralateral) or right (ipsilateral) motor cortex was applied 500 ms before or just at the target time. TEPs related to motor execution and inhibition were obtained by subtractions between averaged EEG waveforms with and without TMS. As a result, in TEPs induced by both contralateral and ipsilateral TMS, small oscillations were followed by a prominent negative deflection around the TMS site peaking at approximately 100 ms post-TMS (N100), and a less pronounced later positive component (LPC) over the broad areas that was centered at the midline-central site in both go and stop trials. However, compared to the pattern in go and stop trials with TMS at 500 ms before the target time, N100 and LPC were differently modulated in the go and stop trials with TMS just at the target time. The amplitudes of both N100 and LPC decreased in go trials, while the amplitude of LPC decreased and the latency of LPC was delayed in both go and stop trials. These results suggested that TMS-induced neuronal reactions in the motor cortex and subsequent their propagation to surrounding cortical areas might change functionally according to task demand when executing and inhibiting a motor response	[Yamanaka, Kentaro] Showa Womens Univ, Grad Sch Human Life Sci, Tokyo 1548533, Japan; [Kadota, Hiroshi; Nozaki, Daichi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Educ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kadota, Hiroshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst, Kochi, Japan		Yamanaka, K (corresponding author), Showa Womens Univ, Grad Sch Human Life Sci, Setagaya Ku, 1-7Taishido, Tokyo 1548533, Japan.	kentaro@swu.ac.jp		Nozaki, Daichi/0000-0002-1338-8337	JSPS [22500529, 22700590, 20670008, LS034]; Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka	JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka	This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C; #22500529) from JSPS and Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka, Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B; #22700590) from JSPS to Hiroshi Kadota, and Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (S; #20670008) from JSPS and the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (#LS034) from JSPS to Daichi Nozaki.		57	9	11	0	7	FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

Here we compare whole-brain arterial spin labelling perfusion MRI and EEG in a group of healthy adults (n = 16, ten females, median age: 27 years, range 21-48) during an eyes closed rest condition. Correlations emerged between perfusion and global average EEG power in low (delta: 2-4 Hz and theta: 4-7 Hz), middle (alpha: 8-13 Hz), and high (beta: 13-30 Hz and gamma: 30-45 Hz) frequency bands in both cortical and sub-cortical regions. The correlations were predominately positive in middle and high-frequency bands, and negative in delta. In addition, central alpha frequency positively correlated with perfusion in a network of brain regions associated with the modulation of attention and preparedness for external input, and central theta frequency correlated negatively with a widespread network of cortical regions. These results indicate that the coupling between average EEG power/frequency and local cerebral blood flow varies in a frequency specific manner. Our results are consistent with longstanding concepts that decreasing EEG frequencies which in general map onto decreasing levels of activation.	[O'Gorman, R.

The current study used EEG data to examine the temporal process of changes in fairness consideration under social exclusion. In this study, a Cyberball game was administered to manipulate participants social exclusion or inclusion. Then, in the following Ultimatum game (UG), participants brain potentials were recorded while they received fair/unfair offers from someone who previously excluded them, someone who previously included them, or a stranger. Results showed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) after onset of distribution outcome was more pronounced for unfair offers compared to fair offers. Moreover, the FRN was more negative-going in response to unfair offers from people who previously excluded them than from the includer and the stranger. Fair offers elicited a larger P300 than unfair offers. In addition, P300 was more positive-going for unfair offers from the stranger than from the excluder and the includer. This study reveals a temporal process in which the effects of social exclusion on fair consideration are reflected in FRN in the early stage of outcome evaluation. These data also suggest that the FRN is modulated by the subjective evaluation of outcome events in a social context.

Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system chiefly consists of automatic artifact elimination, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In addition to the use of independent component analysis, a similarity measure is proposed to further remove the electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts automatically. Several potential features, such as wavelet-fractal-features, are then extracted for subsequent classification. Next, quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is used to select features from the feature combination. Finally, selected sub-features are classified by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with without artifact elimination, feature selection using a genetic algorithm (GA) and feature classification with Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) on MI data from two data sets for eight subjects, the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

Component magnitude varies with the time separating target stimuli (target-to-target interval: TTI), with longer TTIs eliciting larger P300 amplitudes. According to the template-update perspective, TTI effects observable in the P300 reflect the updating of stimulus-templates in working memory (WM). The current study explored whether young adults' memory-task ability could predict TTI effects in P300. EEG activity was recorded from 50 university students (aged 18-25 years) while they completed an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task with manipulations of Ills. Participants also completed a CogState battery and were sorted according to their WM score. ERPs were analysed using a temporal PCA. Two P300 components, P3b and the Slow Wave, were found to linearly increase in amplitude to longer TTI. This TTI effect differed between groups only for the P3b component: The high WM group showed a steeper increase in P3b amplitude with TTI than the low WM group. These results suggest that TIT effects in P300 are directly related to WM processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirty-three veterans (19 with PTSD, 14 without PTSD) who had experienced combat trauma while on deployment in Iraq and/or Afghanistan completed an emotional faces matching task while electroencephalography was recorded. Vertex positive potentials (VPPs) elicited by happy, angry and fearful faces were smaller in veterans with versus without PTSD. In addition, veterans with PTSD exhibited smaller late positive potentials (LPPs) to angry faces and greater intrusive symptoms predicted smaller LPPs to fearful faces in the PTSD group. Veterans with PTSD were also less accurate at identifying angry faces, and accuracy decreased in the PTSD group as hyperarousal symptoms increased. These findings show reduced early processing of emotional faces, irrespective of valence, and blunted prolonged processing of social signals of threat in conjunction with impaired perception for angry faces in PTSD.

J	Olbrich, S; Arns, M				Olbrich, Sebastian; Arns, Martijn			EEG biomarkers in major depressive disorder: Discriminative power and prediction of treatment response	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SLEEP PROFILES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; NON-REM SLEEP; LOUDNESS DEPENDENCE; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; ALPHA ASYMMETRY; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE	Major depressive disorder (MDD) has high population prevalence and is associated with substantial impact on quality of life, not least due to an unsatisfactory time span of sometimes several weeks from initiation of treatment to clinical response. Therefore extensive research focused on the identification of cost-effective and widely available electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biomarkers that not only allow distinguishing between patients and healthy controls but also have predictive value for treatment response for a variety of treatments. In this comprehensive overview on EEG research on MDD, biomarkers that are either assessed at baseline or during the early course of treatment and are helpful in discriminating patients from healthy controls and assist in predicting treatment outcome are reviewed, covering recent decades up to now. Reviewed markers include quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures, connectivity measures, EEG vigilance-based measures, sleep-EEG-related measures and event-related potentials (ERPs). Further, the value and limitations of these different markers are discussed. Finally, the need for integrated models of brain function and the necessity for standardized procedures in EEG biomarker research are highlighted to enhance future research in this field.

Positive and negative affect in adolescent self-evaluation: Psychometric information in single trials used to generate dimension-specific ERPs and neural source models	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Self; Emotion; Adolescence; dEEG; Mood dimensions	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE BIAS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MECHANISMS; CHILDREN; MOOD; PERSPECTIVE; VALIDATION; INVENTORY; EMOTION	We examined brain mechanisms of self-evaluation in a sample of adolescents using dense array EEG (dEEG), neural source analysis, and a novel psychometric weighting method. Each trial of the self-evaluation task was weighted according to its correlation with negative affect and positive affect, such that unique ERP averages were constructed for each mood dimension. Results support the hypothesis that the emotional influence on self-appraisal is dimension specific. Negative affect was associated with more robust ERP responses 300ms into the decision-making epoch. Affect-weighted source analyses further differentiated dorsal-posterior and ventral-anterior features of brain activity. The integration of psychometric weights and dEEG neural source analysis may provide new clues to the neural mechanisms of affective influence on self-evaluative cognition.

Contextual effects on conceptual blending in metaphors: An event-related potential study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						ERP; P600; N400; Metaphor	RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; TIME-COURSE; COMPREHENSION; ERP; INTEGRATION; EEG; P600	Blending theory proposes that metaphor involves mappings between elements in two distinct domains and integration of information from these two domains. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have suggested that literal mapping occurs during metaphor comprehension. However, it has remained unclear whether accessing literal meanings affects metaphor comprehension and the contextual factors affecting blending remain poorly understood. The present study used a two stimulus word-to-sentence matching paradigm to study the effects of literal mapping and semantic congruity on metaphor comprehension using probe words from different domains. ERPs were recorded when 18 participants read short novel metaphors (e.g., The girl is a lemon) or literal control sentences (e.g., The fruit is a lemon) preceded by either a relevant or irrelevant word. Five conditions were measured: congruent target metaphor, congruent source metaphor, congruent literal, incongruent metaphor, and incongruent literal conditions. The analysis of the late positive components (LPC) revealed a significant difference in the P600 amplitudes between incongruent and congruent conditions. We also demonstrated that mapping across remote domains evoked larger P600 amplitudes than mapping across close domains or performing no mapping. The results suggest that the demands of conceptual reanalysis are associated with conceptual mapping and incongruity in both literal and metaphorical language, which supports the position of blending theory that there is a shared mechanism for both metaphoric and literal language comprehension. Amplitude differences suggest that integration difficulty is modulated by mapping degree rather than the timing of lexical access in the present study. Our results do not provide evidence that directly supports earlier models that propose literal meanings are accessed before or in parallel with metaphoric meanings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

'Before' and 'after' mental state examinations and Beck Depressive Inventory showed significant improvement (p < 0.001). Group spectral analysis of resting QEEG showed greater L/R hemispheric symmetry of activity, reduction of right polar pre-frontal hyper activity, and reduction of hypercoherence (all reported depressive parameters).

Quantifying attentional modulation of auditory-evoked cortical responses from single-trial electroencephalography	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory attention; spatial attention; auditory event-related potentials; single-trial classification; brain-computer interfaces	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAIN-CONTROL; SPEECH; CORTEX; P300; POTENTIALS; MECHANISM; LATENCY; SOUNDS; FIELD	Selective auditory attention is essential for human listeners to be able to communicate in multi-source environments. Selective attention is known to modulate the neural representation of the auditory scene, boosting the representation of a target sound relative to the background, but the strength of this modulation, and the mechanisms contributing to it, are not well understood. Here, listeners performed a behavioral experiment demanding sustained, focused spatial auditory attention while we measured cortical responses using electroencephalography (EEG). We presented three concurrent melodic streams; listeners were asked to attend and analyze the melodic contour of one of the streams, randomly selected from trial to trial. In a control task, listeners heard the same sound mixtures, but performed the contour judgment task on a series of visual arrows, ignoring all auditory streams. We found that the cortical responses could be fit as weighted sum of event-related potentials evoked by the stimulus onsets in the competing streams. The weighting to a given stream was roughly 10 dB higher when it was attended compared to when another auditory stream was attended; during the visual task, the auditory gains were intermediate. We then used a template-matching classification scheme to classify single-trial EEG results. We found that in all subjects, we could determine which stream the subject was attending significantly better than by chance. By directly quantifying the effect of selective attention on auditory cortical responses, these results reveal that focused auditory attention both suppresses the response to an unattended stream and enhances the response to an attended stream. The single-trial classification results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that auditory attentional modulation is sufficiently robust that it could be used as a control mechanism in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

The target circle was either red or green and was accompanied in the display by a distractor in the other color. To dissociate event-related potentials of target and distractor processing, one of them was on the vertical meridian and the other in a lateral position. In Experiment 1, the target color was indicated on a per-trial basis and, in Experiment 2, on a per-block basis. The results revealed the N2pc elicited by red targets had an earlier latency relative to the N2pc elicited by green targets. Contralateral responses of positive polarity linked to distractor inhibition were found only with red lateral distractors. The results suggest that the choice of colors to distinguish targets from distractors may play a role in visual search performance and in the functional characterization of event-related lateralizations.

Some suggest abnormalities can be found on the P300 event-related potential component, recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), despite unobservable cognitive impairments. Objective: To examine the P300 and cognitive performance following a remote concussion during an n-back task that varies in working memory load. Research design: Seventeen participants with a remote concussion and 17 controls performed a visual n-back task in which working memory demands were systematically increased by manipulating cognitive load. Participants also completed neuropsychological and self-report measures. Results: The concussion group showed a decrease in P300 amplitude compared to controls that was independent of working memory load on the n-back task. While no performance differences were observed between groups, P300 amplitude was negatively correlated with response times at higher loads in both groups. Conclusion: High functioning young adults with a remote concussion may have inefficient recruitment of processing resources for target identification, evident by the attenuated P300. The negative correlations between response time and P300 amplitude suggest that the time necessary to accurately respond to targets increases as the efficiency of allocating processing resources decreases during highly demanding working memory tasks.

Atypical automatic auditory change processing has been highlighted in ASD via the analysis of mismatch negativity (MMN). The present study investigated visual deviancy detection in children with ASD in order to determine whether unusual reactions to change operate in other sensory modalities. Twelve children with ASD were presented with a passive visual oddball paradigm using dynamic stimuli. Compared to controls, children with ASD showed an earlier visual mismatch response, suggesting a hypersensitivity to visual deviancy. This study is thus consistent with the hypothesis of the existence of general atypical change detection processing in children with ASD that might contribute to their intolerance of change.

In the present study, we obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of working-memory load, and investigated how these waveforms are modulated by illumination conditions. We hypothesized that illumination conditions may affect cognitive performance. We designed an EEG study to monitor and record participants' EEG during the Sternberg working memory task under four different illumination conditions. Illumination conditions were generated with a factorial design of two color-temperatures (3000 and 7100 K) by two illuminance levels (150 and 700 Ix). During a working memory task, we observed that high illuminance led to significantly lower frontal EEG theta activity than did low illuminance. These differences persisted despite no significant difference in task performance between illumination conditions. We found that the latency of an early event-related potential component, such as N1, was significantly modulated by the illumination condition. The fact that the illumination condition affects brain activity but not behavioral performance suggests that the lighting conditions used in the present study did not influence the performance stage of behavioral processing. Nevertheless, our findings provide objective evidence that illumination conditions modulate brain activity. Further studies are necessary to refine the optimal lighting parameters for facilitating working memory. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Role of the lateral prefrontal cortex in speech monitoring	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						on-linespeechmonitoring; prefrontallesions; errornegativity; electroencephalography; brainnetworks; overtpicture-naming	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERROR NEGATIVITY; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; SEMANTIC CONTEXT; VERBAL FEEDBACK; VOCAL RESPONSES; ERP COMPONENTS	The role of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in speech monitoring has not been delineated. Recent work suggests that medial frontal cortex (MFC) is involved in overt speech monitoring initiated before auditory feedback. This mechanism is reflected in an event-related potential (ERP), the error negativity (Ne), peaking within 100 ms after vocal-onset. Critically, in healthy individuals the Ne is sensitive to the accuracy of the response; it is larger for error than correct trials. By contrast, patients with LPFC damage are impaired in non-verbal monitoring tasks showing no amplitude difference between the Ne measured in correct vs. error trials. Interactions between the LPFC and the MFC are assumed to play a necessary role for normal action monitoring. We investigated whether the LPFC was involved in speech monitoring to the same extent as in non-linguistic actions by comparing performance and EEG activity in patients with LPFC damage and in aged-matched controls performing linguistic (Picture Naming) and non-linguistic (Simon) tasks. Controls did not produce enough errors to allow the comparison of the Ne or other ERP in error vs. correct trials. PFC patients had worse performance than controls in both tasks, but their Ne was larger for error than correct trials only in Naming. This task-dependent pattern can be explained by LPFC-dependent working-memory requirements present in non-linguistic tasks used to study action monitoring but absent in picture naming. This suggests that LPFC may not be necessary for speech monitoring as assessed by simple picture naming. In addition, bilateral temporal cortex activity starting before and peaking around vocal-onset was observed in LPFC and control groups in both tasks but was larger for error than correct trials only in Naming, suggesting the temporal cortex is associated with on-line monitoring of speech specifically when access to lexical representations is necessary.

We suggested that this NT170 latency effect may result from phase reset of an ongoing theta rhythm by a parahippocampal system for spatial navigation. Here we tested several predictions that follow from this proposal, namely, that the effect is observed only when the rewards are presented in a spatial environment, that it is sensitive to individual differences in spatial ability, that it is localizable to the right parahippocampal region, and that it is consistent with partial phase resetting of an ongoing theta rhythm. These results hold promise for integrating ERP measures of spatial navigation with extensive animal, human, and computational literatures on parahippocampal function. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Here, we scrutinized the existence of a corresponding neural signal by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) and computational modeling. In the first experiment, we designed a task that manipulated the probability of gaining a monetary reward and measured ERPs during anticipation and at reward delivery. A sustained frontocentral neural activity (i.e., the stimulus preceding negativity, SPN) was evidenced during the anticipation period. Critically, the SPN was found to increase in amplitude as the reward became more unexpected. Changes in the SPN were found to be predictive of individual differences in risk seeking, suggesting that a greater risk attitude involved a greater motivational state for receiving an improbable reward. In the second experiment, SPN results associated with unexpected monetary gains were replicated in a condition in which participants avoided monetary losses and the occurrence of unexpected rewards was also associated with an increase in the amount of self-reported pleasure. These findings support the existence of a neural ERP signature that encodes the process of tuning our motivation to the possibility of receiving a desirable but improbable rewarding outcome.

Here, we investigated electroencephalographic responses to words, pseudo-words and complex sounds, in conditions where phonological and lexical categorizations were behaviorally successful (categorized stimuli) or unsuccessful (uncategorized stimuli). Data showed a greater decrease in low-beta power at left-hemisphere temporal electrodes for categorized non-lexical sounds (complex sounds and pseudo-words) than for categorized lexical sounds (words), consistent with the signature of a failure in lexical access. Similar differences between lexical and non-lexical sounds were observed for uncategorized stimuli, although these stimuli did not yield evoked potentials or theta activity. The results of the present study suggest that behaviorally uncategorized stimuli were processed at the lexical level, and provide evidence of the neural bases of the results observed in previous behavioral studies investigating auditory perception in the absence of stimulus awareness.

J	Wehrspaun, CC; Pfabigan, DM; Sailer, U				Wehrspaun, Claudia C.; Pfabigan, Daniela M.; Sailer, Uta			Early event-related potentials indicate context-specific target processing for eye and hand motor systems	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Eye-hand-coordination; EEG; Sensory expectation; Attention; N2-component; C1-component	SPATIALLY SPECIFIC MODULATIONS; ERP EVIDENCE; MOVEMENTS; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; SHIFTS; TASK	Concurrent eye and hand movements toward a common visual target require different motor programs based on identical visual input. We used event-related brain potentials (ERP) to determine if and when the processing of the visual target differs for the two motor systems. The N2, an index for target evaluation, was more negative for the target of a hand than of an eye movement in two experiments. A possible interpretation for this finding is different visual target processing. Targets for hand movements require a different weighting of visual information, for example concerning features such as surface structure which are important for hand but not for eye movements. In experiment 2, the early C1-component, which had an average maximum at 67 ms following target onset, was significantly more negative when subjects pointed at the stimuli. Traditionally, the C1 has been regarded as a sensory component, but recent studies have linked it to higher order processing, such as attention and expectations. Thus, the present data indicate that target processing for eye or hand movements is already context-specific during early visual information processing. We suggest that differences in a target's relevance for upcoming movements modify target processing as well as sensory expectations.

Clinical usefulness and feasibility of time-frequency analysis of chemosensory event-related potentials	RHINOLOGY			English	Article						chemosensory event-related potentials; olfaction; trigeminal; time-frequency analysis; EEG	OLFACTORY-BULB VOLUME; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETRONASAL; RECOVERY; SMELL; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULATION; TESTS; AGE	Background:The Clinical usefulness of olfactory event-related:brain potentials (OERPs) to assess olfactory function is limited by the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the responses identified using conventional time-domain averaging. Recently, it was shown that time-frequency analysis of the obtained EEG signals can markedly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of OERPs in healthy controls, because It enhances both phase-locked and non phase-locked EEG responses.The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of this approach and evaluate its feasibility in a clinical setting. Methodology: We retrospectively analysed EEG recordings-obtained from 45 patients (15 anosmic, 15 hyposmic and 15 normosmic).The responses to olfactory stimulation were analysed using conventional time-domain analysis and joint time-frequency analysis.The ability of the two methods to discriminate between anosmic, hyposmic and normosmic patients was assessed-using a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Results:The discrimination performance of OERPs identified using conventional time-domain averaging was poor. In contrast, the discrimination performance of the EEG response identified in the time-frequency domain was relatively high. Furthermore, we found a significant Correlation,between the magnitude of this response and the psychophysical olfactory score. Conclusion:Time-frequency analysis of the EEG responses to olfactory stimulation could be used as an effective and reliable diagnostic tool for the objective clinical evaluation of olfactory function in patients.

J	Mensen, A; Khatami, R				Mensen, Armand; Khatami, Ramin			Advanced EEG analysis using threshold-free cluster-enhancement and non-parametric statistics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Threshold-free; Permutation; Statistics	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; PERMUTATION TEST; SIZE INFERENCE; RANDOM-FIELD; TESTS; DIFFERENCE; IMAGES; VOXEL	Advances in EEG signal analysis and its combination with other investigative techniques make appropriate statistical analysis of large EEG datasets a crucial issue. With an increasing number of available channels and samples, as well as more exploratory experimental designs, it has become necessary to develop a statistical process with a high level of statistical integrity, signal sensitivity which nonetheless produces results which are interpretable to the common user. Threshold-free cluster-enhancement has recently been proposed as a useful analysis tool for fMRI datasets. This approach essentially takes into account both a data point's statistical intensity and neighbourhood to transform the original signal into a more intuitive understanding of 'real' differences between groups or conditions. Here we adapt this approach to optimally deal with EEG datasets and use permutation-based statistics to build an efficient statistical analysis. Furthermore we compare the results with several other non-parametric and parametric approaches currently available using realistic simulated EEG signals. The proposed method is shown to be generally more sensitive to the variety of signal types common to EEG datasets without the need for any arbitrary adjusting of parameters. Moreover, a unique p-value is produced for each channel-sample pair such that specific questions can still be asked of the dataset while providing general information regarding the large-scale experimental effects.

A neurophysiological monitoring of parameters like Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) could be a first step to follow-up the clinical evolution of these patients during their rehabilitation phase. Eleven patients diagnosed as VS (n = 8) and MCS (n = 3) by means of the JFK Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) underwent scalp EEG recordings during the delivery of a 3-stimuli auditory oddball paradigm, which included standard, deviant tones and the subject own name (SON) presented as a novel stimulus, administered under passive and active conditions. Four patients who showed a change in their clinical status as detected by means of the CRS-R (i.e., moved from VS to MCS), were subjected to a second EEG recording session. All patients, but one (anoxic etiology), showed ERP components such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and novelty P300 (nP3) under passive condition. When patients were asked to count the novel stimuli (active condition), the nP3 component displayed a significant increase in amplitude (p = 0.009) and a wider topographical distribution with respect to the passive listening, only in MCS. In 2 out of the 4 patients who underwent a second recording session consistently with their transition from VS to MCS, the nP3 component elicited by passive listening of SON stimuli revealed a significant amplitude increment (p < 0.05). Most relevant, the amplitude of the nP3 component in the active condition, acquired in each patient and in all recording sessions, displayed a significant positive correlation with the total scores (p = 0.004) and with the auditory sub-scores (p < 0.00001) of the CRS-R administered before each EEG recording. As such, the present findings corroborate the value of ERPs monitoring in DOC patients to investigate residual unconscious and conscious cognitive function.

Hence, further research is necessary to improve the diagnostic accuracy at the bedside. The main neuropathological feature of VS is the diffuse damage of cortical and subcortical connections. Starting with this premise, we used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to evaluate the cortical reactivity and effective connectivity during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in chronic VS or MCS patients. Moreover, the TMS-EEG data were compared with the results from standard somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs). Thirteen patients with chronic consciousness disorders were examined at their bedsides. A group of healthy volunteers served as the control group. The amplitudes (reactivity) and scalp distributions (connectivity) of the cortical potentials evoked by TMS (TEPs) of the primary motor cortex were measured. Short-latency median nerve SEPs and auditory ERPs were also recorded. Reproducible TEPs were present in all control subjects in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres relative to the site of the TMS. The amplitudes of the ipsilateral and contralateral TEPs were reduced in four of the five MCS patients, and the TEPs were bilaterally absent in one MCS patient. Among the VS patients, five did not manifest ipsilateral or contralateral TEPs, and three of the patients exhibited only ipsilateral TEPs with reduced amplitudes. The SEPs were altered in five VS and two MCS patients but did not correlate with the clinical diagnosis. The ERPs were impaired in all patients and did not correlate with the clinical diagnosis. These TEP results suggest that cortical reactivity and connectivity are severely impaired in all VS patients, whereas in most MCS patients, the TEPs are preserved but with abnormal features. Therefore, TEPs may add valuable information to the current clinical and neurophysiological assessment of chronic consciousness disorders.

Its main symptoms, epileptic seizures and drug-resistant myoclonus, may be associated with neurophysiological evidence of abnormal cortical excitability or reduced inhibition. The aim of the present study was to utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce cortical responses measured with electroencephalography (EEG) in order to observe prevailing cortical excitability/inhibition changes, as well as power and coherence of the cortical oscillations in EPM1. We studied 7 genetically verified EPM1 patients (4 female; age 36 +/- 6 years) and 6 healthy control subjects (1 female; age 34 +/- 12 years). Navigated TMS was focused on the left primary motor cortex at the representation area of the right thumb. TMS-EEG response's were measured at 90% of the resting motor threshold intensity in 110-150 trials. We observed that P30 waveform following the TMS was significantly (p<0.05) increased in EPM1 patients suggesting increased cortico-cortical excitability, while the later N100/P180 waveform was significantly (p<0.05) decreased indicating reduced inhibition. In the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), we found that alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations following the TMS were significantly lower in power in the EPM1 patients compared to controls. In the alpha and beta bands, the inter-trial coherence (ITC) representing the degree of synchronization was also decreased in EPM1. Our results suggest abnormal reactivity in EPM1, and may indicate impaired cortico-cortical inhibition and attenuation of subsequent cortical circuits or the thalamic or subcortical nuclei.

Discrimination of animate and inanimate motion in 9-month-old infants: An ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Infant; EEG/ERP; Nc; Attention; Animacy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION; CAUSALITY; STIMULI	Simple geometric shapes moving in a self-propelled manner, and violating Newtonian laws of motion by acting against gravitational forces tend to induce a judgement that an object is animate. Objects that change their motion only due to external causes are more likely judged as inanimate. How the developing brain is employed in the perception of animacy in early ontogeny is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to use ERP techniques to determine if the negative central component (Nc), a waveform related to attention allocation, was differentially affected when an infant observed animate or inanimate motion. Short animated movies comprising a marble moving along a marble run either in an animate or an inanimate manner were presented to 15 infants who were 9 months of age. The ERPs were time-locked to a still frame representing animate or inanimate motion that was displayed following each movie. We found that 9-month-olds are able to discriminate between animate and inanimate motion based on motion cues alone and most likely allocate more attentional resources to the inanimate motion. The present data contribute to our understanding of the animate-inanimate distinction and the Nc as a correlate of infant cognitive processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using EEG event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study examines the functional stage(s) of this differentiation. Positive, negative, and neutral nouns were randomly mixed with pseudowords and letter strings derived from words within each valence and presented for reading while participants' EEG was recorded. Results indicated emotion effects in the N1 (110-140 ms), early posterior negativity (EPN, 216-320) and late positive potential (LPP, 432-500 ms) time windows. Across valence, orthographic word-form effects occurred from about 180 ms after stimulus presentation. Crucially, in emotional words, lexicality effects (real words versus pseudowords) were identified from 216 ms, words being more negative over posterior cortex, coinciding with EPN effects, whereas neutral words differed from pseudowords only after 320 ms. Emotional content affects word processing at pre-lexical, lexical and post-lexical levels, but remarkably lexical access to emotional words is faster than access to neutral words.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback can obviously improve the anxiety disorders and reduce stress level, and can also enhance attention performance in healthy subjects. The present study examined the effects and mechanisms of EEG biofeedback training on the attentional bias of high trait anxiety (HTA) individuals toward negative stimuli. Results: Event-related potentials were recorded while HTA (n=24) and nonanxious (n=21) individuals performed the color-word emotional Stroop task. During the emotional Stroop task, HTA participants showed longer reaction times and P300 latencies induced by negative words, compared to nonanxious participants. The EEG biofeedback significantly decreased the trait anxiety inventory score and reaction time in naming the color of negative words in the HTA group. P300 latencies evoked by negative stimuli in the EEG biofeedback group were significantly reduced after the alpha training, while no significant changes were observed in the sham biofeedback group after the intervention. Conclusion: The prolonged P300 latency is associated with attentional bias to negative stimuli in the HTA group. EEG biofeedback training demonstrated a significant improvement of negative emotional attentional bias in HTA individuals, which may be due to the normalization of P300 latency.

Here we present a design in which 60 (30 ADHD) children, age: 10.9 +/- 1.4, were asked to covertly orient their attention to one or two (out of four) cued locations, and search for a target stimulus in one of these locations, while recording behavioral responses and EEG/ERP In all conditions, ADHD children showed delayed reaction times and poorer behavioral performance. They also exhibited larger cue-elicited P2 but reduced CNV in the preparation stage, Larger amplitude of CNV predicted better performance in the task. Target-elicited N1 and selection negativity were also reduced in the ADHD group compared to non-ADHD. Groups also differed in the early and late P3 time-Windows. The present results suggest that exogenous orienting of attention could be dysfunctional in ADHD under certain conditions. This limitation is not necessarily caused by an impairment of the orienting process itself, but instead by a difficulty in maintaining the relevant information acquired during the early preparation stage through the target processing stage, when it is really needed.

ADHD is characterized by developmentally in appropriate behaviors of inattention, and/or impulsivity and hyperactivity. These behavioral manifestations contribute to diminished academic, occupational and social functioning, and have neurobiological bases. Neuronal deficits, especially in the attention and executive function processing networks, have been implicated in both children and adults with ADHD by using sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging approaches. These structural and functional abnormalities in the brain networks have been associated with the impaired cognitive, affective, and motor behaviors seen in the disorder. The goal of this review is to summarize and integrate emerging themes from the existing neuroimaging connectivity studies based on advanced imaging techniques, applied in data of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography and event related potential; and to discuss the results of these studies when considering future directions for under standing pathophysiological mechanisms and developmental trajectories of the behavioral manifestations in ADHD. We conclude this review by suggesting that future research should put more effort on understanding the roles of the subcortical structures and their structural/functional pathways in ADHD.

Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system mainly consists of enhanced active segment selection, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection of active segments. We then extract several features, including spectral power and asymmetry ratio, coherence and phase-locking value, and multiresolution fractal feature vector, for subsequent classification. Next, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select features from the combination of above-mentioned features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. Compared with "without enhanced active segment selection," several potential features and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on MI data from two data sets for 10 subjects, the results indicate that the proposed method achieves 86.7% average classification accuracy, which is promising in BCI applications.

Their involvement in feedback processing and its neural correlates has not been investigated so far. Multi-channel EEG was collected while healthy female volunteers performed a time-estimation task and received negative or positive feedback in form of signs or emotional faces. The affective-interpersonal factor Fearless Dominance, but not Self-Centered Impulsivity, was associated with reduced feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitudes. This neural dissociation extends previous findings on the impact of psychopathy on feedback processing and further highlights the importance of distinguishing psychopathic traits and extending previous (neuroscientific) models of psychopathy.

Concurrent EEG and MEG brain measurements were obtained from a group of 16 children with dyslexia aged 8-12 years, and a group of 16 age-matched children with normal reading ability. Auditory responses were elicited using 500 ms duration broadband noise. These responses were strongly lateralized in control children. Children with dyslexia showed significantly less lateralisation of auditory cortical functioning, and a different pattern of development of auditory lateralization with age. These results provide further evidence that the core neurophysiological deficit of dyslexia is a problem in the balance of auditory function between the two hemispheres. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The fronto-central P3a ERP is involved in involuntary processing of novel auditory information, whereas the parietal P3b indexes controlled attention processing. The amplitude of the auditory P3b has been found to be decreased in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have examined the relations between the P3b, the related P3a, and antidepressant treatment response. We tested 53 unmedicated individuals (25 females) with MDD, as well as 43 non-depressed controls (23 females) on the novelty oddball task, wherein infrequent deviant (target) and frequent standard (non-target) tones were presented, along with infrequent novel (non-target/distractor) sounds. The P3a and P3b ERPs were assessed to novel and target sounds, respectively, as were their accompanying behavioral performance measures. Depression ratings and the antidepressant response status were assessed following 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with three different regimens. Antidepressant treatment non-responders had smaller baseline P3a/b amplitudes than responders and healthy controls. Baseline P3b amplitude also weakly predicted the extent of depression rating changes by week 12. Females exhibited larger P3a/b amplitudes than males. With respect to task performance, controls had more target hits than treatment non-responders. ERP measures correlated with clinical changes in males and with behavioral measures in females. These results suggest that greater (or control-like) baseline P3a/b amplitudes are associated with a positive antidepressant response, and that gender differences characterize the P3 and, by extension, basic attentive processes.

J	Gong, WJ; Zhang, T; Shan, L				Gong, Weijun; Zhang, Tong; Shan, Lei			Cortical lateralization in stroke patients measured by event-related potentials during motor imagery	MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						event-related potentials; motor imagery; stroke; rehabilitation	MENTAL PRACTICE; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REHABILITATION; MOVEMENTS; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOVERY; CORTEX	Stroke is a leading cause of impairment and disability worldwide, and motor imagery (MI) has been used in stroke rehabilitation. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to study MI. However, the characteristic features of EEG during MI in stroke patients have not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the difference in event-related potentials (ERPs) during MI between healthy controls and stroke patients. This study included nine stroke patients and nine healthy age-matched controls, who performed tasks involving MI, passive movement without MI and passive movement with MI. One hundred and twenty-eight channel ERPs were recorded to capture cerebral activation. Electrodes E44 and E120 (corresponding to the inferior precentral area) were selected to analyze the lateralization effects of ERPs. Lateralization was calculated as the ratio of the potential at 500 ms at electrode E120 to that at electrode E44. In the controls, the different ERPs exhibited differential direction between the 0-300 and the 300-700 ms interval. ERPs were evoked by passive movement with MI and MI alone, but not passive movement without MI. In addition, a lateralization effect in control patients as shown by the observation that the lateralization ratio in passive movement with MI and MI alone was significantly different from that in passive movement without MI (P<0.05). The amplitudes of the different ERPs were significantly smaller in stroke patients compared with those in the controls (P<0.05). The lateralization ratio in the stroke patients was opposite and significantly different from that of the controls (P<0.05). The results suggested that the MI-induced lateralization effect in ERPs may be used as a measure for evaluating the MI impairment and recovery in stroke patients.

J	Czigler, I; Intraub, H; Stefanics, G				Czigler, Istvan; Intraub, Helene; Stefanics, Gabor			Prediction Beyond the Borders: ERP Indices of Boundary Extension-Related Error	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY; P300; REPRESENTATION; LAYOUT; SCENES; BRAIN; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; LOOKING	Boundary extension (BE) is a rapidly occurring memory error in which participants incorrectly remember having seen beyond the boundaries of a view. However, behavioral data has provided no insight into how quickly after the onset of a test picture the effect is detected. To determine the time course of BE from neural responses we conducted a BE experiment while recording EEG. We exploited a diagnostic response asymmetry to mismatched views (a closer and wider view of the same scene) in which the same pair of views is rated as more similar when the closer item is shown first than vice versa. On each trial, a closer or wider view was presented for 250 ms followed by a 250-ms mask and either the identical view or a mismatched view. Boundary ratings replicated the typical asymmetry. We found a similar asymmetry in ERP responses in the 265-285 ms interval where the second member of the close-then-wide pairs evoked less negative responses at left parieto-temporal sites compared to the wide-then-close condition. We also found diagnostic ERP effects in the 500-560 ms range, where ERPs to wide-then-close pairs were more positive at centro-parietal sites than in the other three conditions, which is thought to be related to participants' confidence in their perceptual decision. The ERP effect in the 265-285 ms range suggests the falsely remembered region beyond the view-boundaries of S1 is rapidly available and impacts assessment of the test picture within the first 265 ms of viewing, suggesting that extrapolated scene structure may be computed rapidly enough to play a role in the integration of successive views during visual scanning.

The system is composed of a passive robotic device (Trackhold) for kinematic tracking and gravity compensation, five dedicated virtual reality (VR) applications for training of distinct movement patterns, and high-resolution EEG for synchronous monitoring of cortical activity. In contrast to active devices, the Trackhold omits actuators for increased patient safety and acceptance levels, and for reduced complexity and costs. VR applications present all relevant information for task execution as easy-to-understand graphics that do not need any written or verbal instructions. High-resolution electroencephalography (HR-EEG) is synchronized with kinematic data acquisition, allowing for the epoching of EEG signals on the basis of movement-related temporal events. Two healthy volunteers participated in a feasibility study and performed a protocol suggested for the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. Kinematic data were analyzed by means of in-house code. Open source packages (EEGLAB, SPM, and GMAC) and in-house code were used to process the neurological data. Results from kinematic and EEG data analysis are in line with knowledge from currently available literature and theoretical predictions, and demonstrate the feasibility and potential usefulness of the proposed rehabilitation system to monitor neuro-motor recovery.

To answer these questions EEG and MEG responses were recorded from healthy participants while they were presented with spoken Finnish inflected, derived, and monomorphemic words. In the non-attended task, the participants were instructed to ignore the incoming auditory stimuli and concentrate on the silent cartoon. In the attended task, previously reported by Leminen et al. (2011), the participants were to judge the acceptability of each stimulus. Importantly, EEG and MEG responses were time-locked to the onset of critical information [suffix onset for the complex words and uniqueness point (UP) for the monomorphemic words]. Early after the critical point, word type did not interact with task: in both attended and non-attended tasks, the event-related potentials (ERPs) showed larger negativity to derived than inflected or monomorphemic words similar to 100 ms after the critical point. MEG source waveforms showed a similar pattern. Later than 100 ms after the critical point, there were no differences between word types in the non-attended task either in the ERP or source modeling data. However, in the attended task inflected words elicited larger responses than other words similar to 200 ms after the critical point. The results suggest different brain representations for derived and inflected words. The early activation after the critical point was elicited both in the non-attended and attended tasks. As this stage of word recognition was not modulated by attention, it can be concluded to reflect an automatic mapping of incoming acoustic information onto stored representations. In contrast, the later differences between word types in the attended task were not observed in the non-attended task. This indicates that later compositional processes at the (morpho)syntactic-semantic level require focused attention	[Leminen, Alina; Lehtonen, Minna; Leminen, Miika; Kujala, Teija] Univ Helsinki, Inst Behav Sci, Cognit Brain Res Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lehtonen, Minna] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Psychol & Logoped, Turku, Finland; [Leminen, Miika] Finnish Ctr Excellence Interdisciplinary Mus Res, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Nevalainen, Paivi; Makela, Jyrki P.] Hosp Dist Helsinki & Uusimaa, HUSLAB, BioMag Lab, Helsinki, Finland; [Kujala, Teija] Univ Helsinki, Cicero Learning, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland		Leminen, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Behav Sci, Cognit Brain Res Unit, Siltavuorenpenger 1B,POB 9, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.	alina.leminen@helsinki.fi	Mäkelä, Jyrki/M-1215-2019; Lehtonen, Minna/AAN-8202-2020; Leminen, Alina/A-1297-2015; Kujala, Teija/G-6704-2016; Leminen, Miika/F-6767-2015; Lehtonen, Minna/K-3672-2012; Leminen, Alina/W-9127-2019	Lehtonen, Minna/0000-0002-6137-8854; Leminen, Alina/0000-0003-1527-6715; Leminen, Miika/0000-0003-1005-956X; Lehtonen, Minna/0000-0002-6137-8854; Leminen, Alina/0000-0003-1527-6715	Ellaand Georg Ehrnrooth foundation; University of Helsinki; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Academy of Finland [131963, 212819, 128840, 137511]; HUSLAB	Ellaand Georg Ehrnrooth foundation; University of Helsinki; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); HUSLAB	The current study was funded by the Ellaand Georg Ehrnrooth foundation, University of Helsinki (own research funds), the Finnish Cultural Foundation, the Academy of Finland (projects 131963, 212819,128840,137511), and HUSLAB.		54	8	8	1	16	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

The feedback negativity (FN), an event-related potential that differentiates outcomes indicating monetary losses versus gains, has recently emerged as a possible neural measure of reward processing. If this view is correct, then the FN should correlate with measures of reward sensitivity in other domains, although few studies have investigated this question. In the current study, 46 participants completed a self-report measure of reward responsiveness, a signal detection task that generated a behavioral measure of reward sensitivity, and a gambling task that elicited an FN. Consistent with the view that the FN reflects reward-related neural activity, a larger FN correlated with increased behavioral and self-report measures of sensitivity to reward.

However, far less is known about the possible neurophysiological basis of such processing. To contribute to a better understanding of hand mental rotation processing, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) methods were applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from participants mentally rotating their hands. Time-frequency analyses revealed that alpha-band power suppression was larger over central-parietal regions. This is in accordance with motor imagery findings suggesting that the motor regions may be involved in processing or detection of kinaesthetic information. Furthermore, the presence of a significant negative correlation between reaction times (RTs) and alpha-band power suppression over central regions is illustrated. These findings are consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, which proposes the non-use of many brain regions irrelevant for the task performance as well as the more focused use of specific task-related regions in individuals with better performance. These results indicate that ERSP provides some independent insights into the mental rotation process and further confirms that parietal and motor cortices are involved in mental rotation.

J	Wang, WJ; Hsieh, IF; Chen, CC				Wang, Wei-Jen; Hsieh, I-Fan; Chen, Chun-Chuan			Accelerating Computation of DCM for ERP in MATLAB by External Function Calls to the GPU	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG; RESPONSES; MEG; RECONSTRUCTION; NETWORK; BRAIN; FMRI; MRI	This study aims to improve the performance of Dynamic Causal Modelling for Event Related Potentials (DCM for ERP) in MATLAB by using external function calls to a graphics processing unit (GPU). DCM for ERP is an advanced method for studying neuronal effective connectivity. DCM utilizes an iterative procedure, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, to find the optimal parameters given a set of observations and the underlying probability model. As the EM algorithm is computationally demanding and the analysis faces possible combinatorial explosion of models to be tested, we propose a parallel computing scheme using the GPU to achieve a fast estimation of DCM for ERP. The computation of DCM for ERP is dynamically partitioned and distributed to threads for parallel processing, according to the DCM model complexity and the hardware constraints. The performance efficiency of this hardware-dependent thread arrangement strategy was evaluated using the synthetic data. The experimental data were used to validate the accuracy of the proposed computing scheme and quantify the time saving in practice. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can accelerate the computation by a factor of 155 for the parallel part. For experimental data, the speedup factor is about 7 per model on average, depending on the model complexity and the data. This GPU-based implementation of DCM for ERP gives qualitatively the same results as the original MATLAB implementation does at the group level analysis. In conclusion, we believe that the proposed GPU-based implementation is very useful for users as a fast screen tool to select the most likely model and may provide implementation guidance for possible future clinical applications such as online diagnosis.

The objectives of this study are to examine the EEG (Electroencephalographic) based changes in functional connectivity of the brain due to the change blindness. The functional connectivity was estimated using the wavelet-based MSC (Magnitude Square Coherence) function of ERPs (Event Related Potentials). The ERPs of 30 subjects were used and were recorded using the visual attention experiment in which subjects were instructed to detect changes in visual stimulus presented before them through the computer monitor. The two-way ANOVA statistical test revealed significant increase in both gamma and theta band MSCs, and significant decrease in beta band MSC for change detection trials. These findings imply that change blindness might be associated to the lack of functional connectivity in gamma and theta bands and increase of functional connectivity in beta band. Since gamma, theta, and beta frequency bands reflect different functions of cognitive process such as maintenance, encoding, retrieval, and matching and work load of VSTM (Visual Short Term Memory), the change in functional connectivity might be correlated to these cognitive processes during change blindness.

However, empirical evidence for this claim is scarce. By means of high-density electroencephalography, this study investigated whether one represents and simulates the action of an interaction partner when planning to perform a joint action. The results showed that joint action planning compared with individual action planning resulted in amplitude modulations of the frontal P3a and parietal P3b event-related potentials, which are associated with stimulus classification, updating of representations, and decision-making. Moreover, there was evidence for anticipatory motor simulation of the partner's action in the amplitude and peak latency of the late, motor part of the Contingent Negative Variation, which was correlated with joint action performance. Our results provide evidence that when people engage in joint tasks, they represent in advance each other's actions in order to facilitate coordination.

However, the relationship between underlying neuropathology and the motor, cognitive and behavioural changes associated with the disorder still remain poorly understood. Less conventional technologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), provide a unique opportunity to further investigate the causal relationships between targeted neural circuits and objective neurophysiological responses together with overt behaviours. In this review, we discuss previous successful applications of TMS in other neurological disorders and its prospective use in HD. We also address the added value of multimodal TMS techniques, such as TMS-EEG, in investigating the integrity of neural networks in non-motor regions in HD. We conclude that neurophysiological outcome measures are likely to contribute towards characterising further the trajectory of decline across functional domains in HD, enhance understanding of underlying neural mechanisms, and offer new avenues for elucidating sensitive endophenotypic biomarkers of disease progression.

Here, we separated the effects of word concreteness and task demands on the N400 and N700 in a single word processing paradigm with a within-subjects, between-tasks design and carefully controlled word stimuli. The N400 was larger to concrete words than to abstract words, and larger in the visualization task condition than in the surface task condition, with no interaction. A marked anterior N700 was elicited only by concrete words in the visualization task condition, suggesting that this component indexes imagery. These findings are consistent with a revised or extended dual coding theory according to which concrete words benefit from greater activation in both verbal and imagistic systems.

Family history of psychosis moderated early auditory cortical response abnormalities in non-psychotic bipolar disorder	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						biomarker; electroencephalography; gating; N100; oddball; P200; P300; psychosis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; PSYCHIATRIC-ILLNESS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; P300 FINDINGS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SUPPRESSION; LOCALIZATION; AMPLITUDE	ObjectivesBipolar I disorder is a disabling illness affecting 1% of people worldwide. Family and twin studies suggest that psychotic bipolar disorder (BDP) represents a homogeneous subgroup with an etiology distinct from non-psychotic bipolar disorder (BDNP) and partially shared with schizophrenia. Studies of auditory electrophysiology [e.g., paired-stimulus and oddball measured with electroencephalography (EEG)] consistently report deviations in psychotic groups (schizophrenia, BDP), yet such studies comparing BDP and BDNP are sparse and, in some cases, conflicting. Auditory EEG responses are significantly reduced in unaffected relatives of psychosis patients, suggesting that they may relate to both psychosis liability and expression. MethodsWhile 64-sensor EEGs were recorded, age- and gender-matched samples of 70 BDP, 35 BDNP {20 with a family history of psychosis [BDNP(+)]}, and 70 psychiatrically healthy subjects were presented with typical auditory paired-stimuli and auditory oddball paradigms. ResultsOddball P3b reductions were present and indistinguishable across all patient groups. P2s to paired stimuli were abnormal only in BDP and BDNP(+). Conversely, N1 reductions to stimuli in both paradigms and P3a reductions were present in both BDP and BDNP(-) groups but were absent in BDNP(+). ConclusionsAlthough nearly all auditory neural response components studied were abnormal in BDP, BDNP abnormalities at early- and mid-latencies were moderated by family psychosis history. The relationship between psychosis expression, heritable psychosis risk, and neurophysiology within bipolar disorder, therefore, may be complex. Consideration of such clinical disease heterogeneity may be important for future investigations of the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disturbance.

This robust phenomenon is called (visuo-) spatial negative priming (SNP). Among other explanations, concepts of persisting or retrieved spatial inhibition play a major role. Two relevant issues were investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The first pertains to context sensitivity of inhibition: Is a probe distractor necessary for SNP? The second concerns levels of processing at which spatial inhibition operates: Does SNP affect perception, selection, and/or stimulus classification? A localization task with and without probe distractors was employed while 64-channel EEG was recorded. Obviously, SNP does not require a probe distractor; the distractor-absent SNP effect was larger than the distractor-present SNP effect. Distractor-present SNP had two lateralized ERP effects, N1pc amplitude reduction and N2pc amplitude increase. Smaller N1pc may indeed reflect perceptual decrement, but was inversely related to size of behavioral SNP. By contrast, only strong-SNP participants showed N2pc increase, which points to selection disadvantage due to persisting inhibition of higher-level spatial representations. Distractor-absent SNP had no N1pc/N2pc correlates; instead, reduced amplitude of a broadly distributed P300 component suggests impaired stimulus classification due to episodic retrieval of inappropriate prime information. Overall, SNP seems to emerge from relatively late stages of processing, thus challenging the idea of context-free persisting inhibition of low-level spatial representations. Furthermore, distractor-present and distractor-absent SNP are qualitatively different from each other. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been repeatedly proposed to support the superior retention of emotional memories. However, its exact contribution and, specifically, whether its effect is mainly on the consolidation of the contents or the processing of the affective component of emotional memories is not clear. Here, we investigated the effects of sleep rich in slow wave sleep (SWS) or REM sleep on the consolidation of emotional pictures and the accompanying changes in affective tone, using event-related potentials (ERPs) together with subjective ratings of valence and arousal. Sixteen healthy, young men learned 50 negative and 50 neutral pictures before 3-h retention sleep intervals that were filled with either SWS-rich early or REM sleep-rich late nocturnal sleep. In accordance with our hypothesis, recognition was better for emotional pictures than neutral pictures after REM compared to SWS-rich sleep. This emotional enhancement after REM-rich sleep expressed itself in an increased late positive potential of the ERP over the frontal cortex 300-500 ms after stimulus onset for correctly classified old emotional pictures compared with new emotional and neutral pictures. Valence and arousal ratings of emotional pictures were not differentially affected by REM or SWS-rich sleep after learning. Our results corroborate that REM sleep contributes to the consolidation of emotional contents in memory, but suggest that the affective tone is preserved rather than reduced by the processing of emotional memories during REM sleep.

The current study investigated emotional processing in non-demented individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) using an electrophysiological measure, the centro-parietal late positive potential (LPP). Non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (n=17) and healthy control participants (n=16) viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures while EEG was recorded from a 64-channel geodesic net. The Parkinson patients did not differ from controls in terms of early electrophysiological components that index perceptual processing (occipital P100, N150, P250). Parkinson patients, however, showed reduced LPP amplitude specifically when viewing unpleasant, compared to pleasant, pictures as well as when compared to controls, consistent with previous studies suggesting a specific difference in aversive processing between PD patients and healthy controls. Importantly, LPP amplitude during unpleasant picture viewing was most attenuated for patients reporting high apathy. The data suggest that apathy in PD may be related to a deficit in defensive activation, and may be indexed cortically using event-related potentials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sixty-five healthy children (6-13 years) participated in this study. Reading-related potentials were recorded during visual stimulation with single Italian alphabetic letters. Stimuli were displayed for 5 ms either automatically at a randomly uttered time lag or upon voluntary self-paced button press by children. In the covert conditions, children had to passively look at single letters, while in the overt conditions children were required to read aloud the letters. Electromyographic activity of the forearm and lips was additionally recorded during all tasks. Superimposition of reading-related potentials with the electromyographic activity of forearm and lips during self-paced reading aloud allowed to segregate the reading-related components into four periods: preparatory, pre-lexical, lexical and post-lexical. Reading-related potentials of the preparatory period can be related to preparation/intention to read, those of the pre-lexical period to visual-perceptual processes, those of the lexical period to the external/internal reafferent activity and those of the post-lexical period to the feedback processes following task completion. Analysis of variance showed a significant interaction of reading-related components with electrode locations and task conditions in all periods. The systematic characterization of the neurophysiological correlates of the elementary association between letters and sounds is helpful to highlight the neurobiological and functional basis of reading in healthy as well as impaired readers, for possibly developing neurophysiologically grounded rehabilitation therapies and further improving the explanatory models of dyslexia.

A BINARY PHASE-SHIFT KEYING RECEIVER FOR THE DETECTION OF ATTENTION TO HUMAN SPEECH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dichotic listening; attention detection; EEG; ERP; BPSK; SNR	RIGHT-EAR ADVANTAGE; FUZZY SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN; EEG; STATE; IDENTIFICATION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION	Synthetic sounds, tone-beeps, vowels or syllables are typically used in the assessment of attention to auditory stimuli because they evoke a set of well-known event-related potentials, whose characteristics can be statistically contrasted. Such approach rules out the use of stimuli with non-predictable response, such as human speech. In this study we present a procedure based on the robust binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) receiver that permits the real-time detection of selective attention to human speeches in dichotic listening tasks. The goal was achieved by tagging the speeches with two barely-audible tags whose joined EEG response constitutes a reliable BPSK constellation, which can be detected by means of a BPSK receiver. The results confirmed the expected generation of the BPSK constellation by the human auditory system. Also, the bit-error rate and the information transmission rate achieved in the detection of attention fairly followed the expected curves and equations of the standard BPSK receiver. Actually, it was possible to detect attention as well as the estimation a priori of its accuracy based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the BPSK signals. This procedure, which permits the detection of the attention to human speeches, can be of interest for new potential applications, such as brain-computer interfaces, clinical assessment of the attention in real time or for entertainment.

We recently used an instruction delay paradigm to investigate the EEG signatures associated with preparation, planning and execution of arm isometric exertions. Subjects (n=8), prepared, planned and exerted force with their right arm in horizontal plane, according to visual cues. Here we show that surface Laplacian, as a simple spatial filter can provide useful knowledge about the involved brain regions in different stages of the task. The results show that there is a negative peak at FCz in response to the preparation cue. The planning cue causes positive peaks at FCz and P-z followed by a sustained negativity at FCz. The GO cue leads to a a negative peak at FCz and a positive peak at P-z which is followed by a sustained positivity at C-1. The results suggest that there is considerable involvement of pre-motor and parietal areas in different stages of motor preparation, planning and execution of isometric tasks. The results provide considerably local information on brain activity compared to ear-lobe referenced event-related potentials and favor the applicability of non-invasive EEG recordings and techniques to study motor neurophysiology when appropriately used in complex experimental setups. This can be of interest for different diagnostic and clinical applications and for linking the signatures of brain activity in different neuro-imaging modalities e.g. EEG and fMRI.

Using an event-related picture-viewing paradigm in electroencephalography, we investigated whether erotica - that is appetitive, evolutionarily relevant stimuli - have effects on early stages of attentional processing that are distinct from those of other positive and arousing stimuli. Seventeen male students viewed arousing photos of erotic, nude women or pictures of extreme sport scenes, as well as control pictures of attractive, dressed women or daily activities. Erotic pictures differed from extreme sport pictures not only in late but also in early attentional processes, as indicated by event-related potentials appearing from 130ms after stimulus onset (P1). The findings suggest (a) that the dimension of appetence should be considered in addition to valence and arousal when investigating psychophysiological reactions to affective-motivational stimuli and (b) that early attentional processing as mirrored by the P1 can be influenced by motivational systems.

J	Horvath, J				Horvath, Janos			Action-sound coincidence-related attenuation of auditory ERPs is not modulated by affordance compatibility	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Forward model; Self-generated sounds; Auditory processing; EEG; Event-related potentials; T-complex; N1; P2	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPEECH; CORTEX; SUPPRESSION; RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MOVEMENTS; COMPONENT; TALKING	A couple of studies showed that auditory processing of sounds presented concurrently with one's own actions is attenuated. Because in these studies actions were key-presses, it was hypothesized that attenuation might be caused by robust key-press-effect associations formed by long-term interactions with everyday devices. Key-pressing may be special because most everyday devices are designed to comply with the perceived affordance that a key/button should be pressed to trigger an effect. Therefore, key-presses would attenuate auditory processing, but key-releases would not. In the present experiment, participants marked time intervals by pressing or releasing a key. Independently, a random sequence of tones was presented. Tones coinciding with a key-press or -release elicited similarly attenuated Tb, vertex N1, and P2 ERPs, suggesting that coincidence-related auditory attenuation is not brought about by special key-press-effect associations. Whereas Tb and P2 attenuations were pure amplitude modulations, vertex N1 was attenuated (partly) by an overlapping coincidence-related ERP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cortical Graph Smoothing: A Novel Method for Exploiting DWI-Derived Anatomical Brain Connectivity to Improve EEG Source Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Connectome matrix; diffusion tensor imaging; electroencephalography; inverse problems; neuroimaging	ANISOTROPIC WATER DIFFUSION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; IMAGE REGISTRATION; WEIGHTED MRI; L-CURVE; REGULARIZATION; TRACTOGRAPHY; TRACKING	The electroencephalography source estimation problem consists of inferring cortical activation from measurements of electrical potential taken on the scalp surface. This inverse problem is intrinsically ill-posed. In particular the dimensionality of cortical sources greatly exceeds the number of electrode measurements, and source estimation requires regularization to obtain a unique solution. In this work, we introduce a novel regularization function called cortical graph smoothing, which exploits knowledge of anatomical connectivity available from diffusion-weighted imaging. Given a weighted graph description of the anatomical connectivity of the brain, cortical graph smoothing penalizes the weighted sum of squares of differences of cortical activity across the graph edges, thus encouraging solutions with consistent activation across anatomically connected regions. We explore the performance of the cortical graph smoothing source estimates for analysis of the event related potential for simple motor tasks, and compare against the commonly used minimum norm, weighted minimum norm, LORETA and sLORETA source estimation methods. Evaluated over a series of 18 subjects, the proposed cortical graph smoothing method shows superior localization accuracy compared to the minimum norm method, and greater relative peak intensity than the other comparison methods.

What changes in neural oscillations can reveal about developmental cognitive neuroscience: Language development as a case in point	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural oscillations; EEG; Language development; Theta; Gamma	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; THETA-POWER INCREASES; EEG ACTIVITY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; POTENTIALS	EEG is a primary method for studying temporally precise neuronal processes across the lifespan. Most of this work focuses on event related potentials (ERPs); however, using time-locked time frequency analysis to decompose the EEG signal can identify and distinguish multiple changes in brain oscillations underlying cognition (Bastiaansen et al., 2010). Further this measure is thought to reflect changes in inter-neuronal communication more directly than ERPs (Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006). Although time frequency has elucidated cognitive processes in adults, applying it to cognitive development is still rare. Here, we review the basics of neuronal oscillations, some of what they reveal about adult cognitive function, and what little is known relating to children. We focus on language because it develops early and engages complex cortical networks. Additionally, because time frequency analysis of the EEG related to adult language comprehension has been incredibly informative, using similar methods with children will shed new light on current theories of language development and increase our understanding of how neural processes change over the lifespan. Our goal is to emphasize the power of this methodology and encourage its use throughout developmental cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

How rapidly the brain integrates visual and contextual information of artworks remains to be investigated. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated neural activity when subjects with no professional experience in art viewed images of sculptures (masterpieces from the Classical and Renaissance periods, characterized by a canonical proportion of the golden ratio) and performed a five-scale rating of how appealing they were. At the beginning of each trial, we manipulated the expectations of the subjects for an upcoming sculpture by presenting information about its authenticity (either "genuine" or "fake"), although all images were actually taken from genuine artworks. The image of the sculpture was then presented, either in its original proportion or after being deformed by a photo-editing software. This 2 x 2 factorial design enabled us to identify whether each component of the EEG response was sensitive to contextual information (genuine or fake), visual information (original or deformed), or both. Results revealed that amplitudes of a positive EEG component emerging at 200-300 ms after the presentation of the artworks (mainly distributed over the parietal cortex) were significantly modulated by both visual and contextual factors, indicating a rapid integration of these two types of information in the brain.

Cerebellar contribution to the prediction of self-initiated sounds	CORTEX			English	Article						Cerebellum; Auditory prediction; Selectivity; Forward-model; Event-related potentials (ERP)	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INTERNAL-MODELS; TIME PERCEPTION; BRAIN; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; P300	In everyday life we frequently make the fundamental distinction between sensory input resulting from our own actions and sensory input that is externally-produced. It has been speculated that making this distinction involves the use of an internal forward-model, which enables the brain to adjust its response to self-produced sensory input. In the auditory domain, this idea has been supported by event-related potential and evoked-magnetic field studies revealing that self-initiated sounds elicit a suppressed N100/M100 brain response compared to externally-produced sounds. Moreover, a recent study reveals that patients with cerebellar lesions do not show a significant N100-suppression effect. This result supports the theory that the cerebellum is essential for generating internal forward predictions. However, all except one study compared self-initiated and externally-produced auditory stimuli in separate conditions. Such a setup prevents an unambiguous interpretation of the N100-suppression effect when distinguishing self- and externally-produced sensory stimuli: the N100-suppression can also be explained by differences in the allocation of attention in different conditions. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) -study we investigated the N100-suppression effect in an altered design comparing (i) self-initiated sounds to externally-produced. sounds that occurred intermixed with these self-initiated sounds (i.e., both sound types occurred in the same condition) or (ii) self-initiated sounds to externally-produced sounds that occurred in separate conditions. Results reveal that the cerebellum generates selective predictions in response to self-initiated sounds independent of condition type: cerebellar patients, in contrast to healthy controls, do not display an N100-suppression effect in response to self-initiated sounds when intermixed with externally-produced sounds. Furthermore, the effect is not influenced by the temporal proximity of externally-produced sounds to self-produced sounds. Controls and patients showed a P200-reduction in response to self-initiated sounds. This suggests the existence of an additional and probably more conscious mechanism for identifying self-generated sounds that does not functionally depend on the cerebellum. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The etiology of insomnia is still unknown, whereas the hyperarousal concept has gained much attention with respect to pathophysiology. According to this model, insomnia is characterized by significant hyperarousal on an autonomous and central nervous level. Objective findings derived from polysomnography frequently show much less severe differences to good sleepers than subjective sleep complaints assessed by self-rating questionnaires. However, using more fine-grained methods to characterize the electrophysiology of sleep in insomnia, rather distinct differences between the sleep of good sleepers and patients with insomnia have been noted. These methods include the spectral analysis of the sleep EEG, micro-arousal and CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) analysis as well as the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) during night-sleep. The application of these methods shows stronger correlations with the subjective experience of disturbed sleep than standard sleep EEG scoring. An overview of the relevant empirical evidence is presented, previous investigations are extended and a theoretical synthesis within the framework of the hyperarousal concept of insomnia is attempted.

Although NIBS is a promising tool for inducing alteration of cortical excitability but it presents challenge in terms of optimization of the electrode placement and stimulation parameters, especially in cases of heterogeneously damaged cortical structures where getting accurate conductivity values for computational head-modeling is challenging. Moreover, the target in the brain for NIBS to facilitate a specific residual function may be unknown where electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization for related event related potential may play an important role. Therefore, in this theoretical study, we explored the possibility of using a lead-field based formulation of the electromagnetic reciprocity theorem to reciprocally energize the EEG electrodes in order to target the neural source of event related potentials during a functional task. Moreover, a Magnetic Resonance Current Density Imaging based method is proposed to determine subject-specific lead-field where it is postulated that such NIBS-based artificial subthreshold ephaptic feedback may facilitate cortical neural events (e.g., event related synchronization/desynchronization), which remains to be validated in future via human studies.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained when four subjects imagined the vocalization of Japanese vowels, /a/, lit, /u/, /e/, and /o/ in order and in random order while the subjects remained silent and immobilized were recorded using Ill scalp electrodes and 3 reference electrodes. Regarding detection of the imagined voice, some problems occurred by which the related brain geometries and suitable electrodes for classifications differed between subjects. To overcome these problems, we used an adaptive collection that divided ERP data into small elements, performed evaluation relative to the elements, and selected better elements for classification. In earlier reports of studies using the common spatial patterns (CSPs) filter and support vector machines (SI/Ms), the classification accuracies (CAs) were 56-72% for the pairwise classification /a/ vs. /u/ in the case of 63 channel EEG measurement In this study, the CA was improved to 73-92% using the adaptive collection. According to the CA, 19 channel measurements were worse than 111 channel measurements, but 63 channel measurements were slightly worse that 111 channel measurements. Using 63 channel measurements, 73% of CA was achieved for all pairwise combinations of the five vowels. The average of the CAs was 85%. These results show that the proposed method exhibited great potential for use in classification of imagined voice for a speech prosthesis controller.

The Bivalency effect in task switching: Event-related potentials	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						event-related potentials; bivalency effect; task-switching; ERP; EEG	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; INFORMATION; INVOLVEMENT; COMPETITION; SETS	During task switching, if we occasionally encounter stimuli that cue more than one task (i.e., bivalent stimuli), response slowing is observed on all univalent trials within that block, even when no features overlap with the bivalent stimuli. This observation is known as the bivalency effect. Previous fMRI work (Woodward et al., 2008) clearly suggests a role for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in the bivalency effect, but the time course remains uncertain. Here, we present the first high-temporal resolution account for the bivalency effect using stimulus-locked event-related potentials. Participants alternated among three simple tasks in six experimental blocks, with bivalent stimuli appearing occasionally in bivalent blocks (blocks 2, 4, and 6). The increased reaction times for univalent stimuli in bivalent blocks demonstrate that these stimuli are being processed differently from univalent stimuli in purely univalent blocks. Frontal electrode sites captured significant amplitude differences associated with the bivalency effect within time windows 100120 ms, 375450 ms, and 500550 ms, which may reflect additional extraction of visual features present in bivalent stimuli (100120 ms) and suppression of processing carried over from irrelevant cues (375450 ms and 500550 ms). Our results support the fMRI findings and provide additional evidence for involvement of the dACC. Furthermore, the bivalency effect dissipated with extended practice both behaviorally and electrophysiologically. These findings are discussed in relation to the differential processing involved in a controlled response style. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To achieve this, the interfaces controlling such robotic systems must be able to estimate the user's intention to move and to distinguish it from the undesired tremor. In this context, analysis of electroencephalographic activity is of special interest, since it provides information on the planning and execution of voluntary movements. This paper proposes an adaptive and asynchronous EEG-based system for online detection of the intention to move in patients with tremor. An experimental protocol with separated self-paced wrist extensions was used to test the ability of the system to detect the intervals preceding voluntary movements. Six healthy subjects and four essential tremor patients took part in the experiments. The system predicted 60 +/- 10% of the movements with the control subjects and 42 +/- 27% of the movements with the patients. The ratio of false detections was low in both cases (1.5 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.5 false activations per minute with the controls and patients, respectively). The prediction period with which the movements were detected was higher than in previous similar studies (1.06 +/- 1.02 s for the controls and 1.01 +/- 0.99 s with the patients). Additionally, an adaptive and fixed design were compared, and it was the adaptive design that had a higher number of movement detections. The system is expected to lead to further development of more natural interfaces between the assistive devices and the patients wearing them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One problem reported in schizophrenia patients is that they Lend to show deficits in face emotion processing, on which negative symptoms are thought to have stronger influence. In this study, four event-related potential (ERP) components (P100, N170, N250, and P300) and their source activities were analyzed using EEG data acquired from 23 schizophrenia patients while they were presented with facial emotion picture stimuli. Correlations between positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores and source activations during facial emotion processing, were calculated to identify the brain areas affected by symptom scores. Our analysis demonstrates that PANSS positive scores are negatively correlated with major areas of the left temporal lobule for early ERP components (P100, N170) and with the right middle frontal lobule for a later component (N250), which indicates that positive symptoms affect both early face processing and facial emotion processing. On the other hand, PANSS negative scores are negatively correlated with several clustered regions, including the left fusiform gyrus (at P100), most of which are not overlapped with regions showing Correlations with PANSS positive scores. Our results suggest that positive and negative symptoms affect independent brain regions during facial emotion processing, which may help to explain the heterogeneous characteristics of schizophrenia.

Left parietal alpha enhancement during working memory-intensive sentence processing	CORTEX			English	Article						Alpha oscillations; Argument-verb dependency; Sentence processing; Source localization; Verbal working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FILLER-GAP DEPENDENCIES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SYNTACTIC INTEGRATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; TRACE POSITIONS; BROCAS AREA; COMPREHENSION; CORTEX; ERP	Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related brain potential (ERP) studies have shown that verbal working memory plays an important role during sentence processing. There is growing evidence from outside of sentence processing that human alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz) play a critical role in working memory. This study aims to link this to the sentence processing domain. Time-frequency analyses and source localization were performed on electroencephalography (EEG) data that were recorded during the processing of auditorily presented sentences involving either a short or a long distance between an argument (subject or object) and the respective sentence-final verb. We reasoned that oscillatory activity in the alpha band should increase during sentences with longer argument-verb distances, since decreased temporal proximity should result in increased memory demands. When verbal working memory-intensive long-dependency sentences were compared to short-dependency sentences, a sustained oscillatory enhancement at 10 Hz was found during storage prior to the sentence-final verb, turning into a transient power increase in the beta band (13-20 Hz) at the sentence-final verb. The sources of the alpha oscillations were localized to bilaterally occipital and left parietal cortices. Only the source activity in the left parietal cortex was negatively correlated with verbal working memory abilities. These findings indicate that the parsimonious role of alpha oscillations in domain-general working memory can be extended to language, that is, sentence processing. We suggest that the function of left parietal cortex underlying verbal working memory storage during sentence processing is to inhibit the premature release of verbal information that will subsequently be integrated.

Effects of Memantine on Event-Related Potential, Oscillations, and Complexity in Individuals With and Without Family Histories of Alcoholism	JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS			English	Article							RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; HIGH-RISK; EEG; THETA; KETAMINE; GLUTAMATE; P300; TASK; MODULATION; DEPENDENCE	Objective: Enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function associated with a positive family history of alcoholism (FHP) has been hypothesized to contribute to the heritable risk for alcoholism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of alcoholism family history, NMDA receptor function, and cortical information processing by testing acute effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on event-related potential (ERP). Method: Twenty-two healthy FHP and 20 healthy family history negative (FEN; no alcoholic relatives) subjects were administered placebo or 40 mg of memantine under double-blind counterbalanced conditions on two separate occasions. Electroencephalogram data were collected from eight channels with eyes open during an auditory oddball discrimination task. We evaluated P3b amplitude, total theta, alpha activity, and fractal dimension from ERP trials. Results: FHP and FEN subjects did not differ in P3b amplitude. A significant Group x Drug interaction was observed in theta, alpha activity, and fractal dimension at the parietal and occipital sites. FHP individuals exhibited significantly higher fractal dimension and lower theta and alpha activity after placebo relative to FEN subjects. Following memantine administration, theta activity decreased in both groups but more markedly for FHN individuals. Alpha activity decreased for FHN subjects and increased for FHP individuals, whereas the fractal dimension decreased for FHP subjects and increased for FEN subjects after memantine. Conclusions: A plausible interpretation of these results is that FHP individuals may have altered NMDA receptor function compared with FHN individuals. These findings provide additional evidence of differences in the regulation of NMDA receptor function between FHP and FEN individuals. (J. Stud.

Effects of Neurofeedback Versus Stimulant Medication in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Randomized Pilot Study	JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; INITIAL VALIDATION; EEG; ADHD; CHILDREN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; METHYLPHENIDATE; RELIABILITY; BIOFEEDBACK	Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the effects of 30 sessions of neurofeedback (NF) with stimulant medication on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. Methods: Thirty-two medication-naive ADHD patients, ages 7-16, from a neuropsychiatric clinic, were randomized to NF (n=16) or drug treatment (n=16). Other actions, such as parent management training, information, or support in school were given as needed, with no differences between the groups. All participants were assessed before treatment on two rating scales, each with parent and teacher forms. In addition, quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), which included behavioral data from a go/no go test were administered. NF training took place in the clinic over a period of 7-11 months, and was followed by a repeat of the same assessment tools. The mean time interval between pre- and postassesment was not significantly different in the two groups. The 18 symptoms of ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV)) were used as the primary outcome measure. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference between the groups at evaluation in favor of medication, with a large effect size. This picture was confirmed by other outcome measures. The QEEG spectral power in the theta and beta bands did not change in either group. In ERP, the P3 no go component increased significantly in 8 of 12 patients who had a clinically relevant medication effect, but did not increase in the medication nonresponders or the NF group. Conclusions: Our study supports effects for stimulants, but not for NF. Effects of NF may require thorough patient selection, frequent training sessions, a system for excluding nonresponders, and active transfer training. The P3 no go ERP component may be a marker for treatment response.

Here, we tested whether the ERAN is modulated by expertise in more than one music culture, as typical of folk musicians. Finnish folk musicians and nonmusicians participated in electroencephalography recordings. The cadences consisted of seven chords. In incongruous cadences, the third, fifth, or seventh chord was a Neapolitan. The ERAN to the Neapolitans was enhanced in folk musicians compared to nonmusicians. Folk musicians showed an enhanced P3a for the ending Neapolitan. The Neapolitan at the fifth position was perceived differently and elicited a late enhanced ERAN in folk musicians. Hence, expertise in more than one music culture seems to modify chord processing by enhancing the ERAN to ambivalent chords and the P3a to incongruous chords, and by altering their perceptual attributes.

The present study involved the combination of event-related potentials (ERPs) with the divided visual field presentation technique to explore the relative contributions of the left and right hemispheres (LH and RH) to the construction of novel meanings in fully literal language. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded as healthy adults read sentences that supported either a conventional literal reading of the sentence final word ("His main method of transportation is a boat"), or a novel literal meaning derived from conceptual mapping ("The clever boys used a cardboard box as a boat"). The novel and conventional conditions were matched for doze probability (a measure of predictability based on the sentence context), lexical association between the sentence frame and the final word (using latent semantic analysis), and other factors known to influence ERPs to language stimuli. To compare effects of novelty to previously reported effects of predictability, a high-doze conventional condition ("The only way to get around Venice is to navigate the canals in a boat.") was included. ERPs were time-locked to sentence final words ("boat") presented in either the left visual field, to preferentially stimulate the RH (Ivf/RH), or in the right visual field, targeting the LH (rvf/LH). The N400 component of the ERP was affected by predictability in both presentation sides, but by novelty only in rvf/LH. Two distinct late frontal positive effects were observed. Word predictability modulated a frontal positivity with a LH focus, but semantic novelty modulated a frontal positivity focused in RH. This is the first demonstration that the frontal positivity may be composed of multiple overlapping components with distinct functional and anatomical characteristics. Extending contemporary accounts of the frontal positivity, we suggest that both frontal positivities reflect learning mechanisms involving prediction based on statistical regularities in language (LH) and world knowledge (RH).

This issue has been addressed by comparing the temporal relationship between attentional modulations on neural activities and behavior. Our previous study measured the time course of attention with amplitude and phase coherence of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and found that the modulation latency of phase coherence rather than that of amplitude was consistent with the latency of behavioral performance. In this study, as a complementary report, we compared the time course of visual attention shift measured by event-related potentials (ERPs) with that by target detection task. We developed a novel technique to compare ERPs with behavioral results and analyzed the EEG data in our previous study. Two sets of flickering stimulus at different frequencies were presented in the left and right visual hemifields, and a target or distracter pattern was presented randomly at various moments after an attention-cue presentation. The observers were asked to detect targets on the attended stimulus after the cue. We found that two ERP components, P300 and N2pc, were elicited by the target presented at the attended location. Time-course analyses revealed that attentional modulation of the P300 and N2pc amplitudes increased gradually until reaching a maximum and lasted at least 1.5 s after the cue onset, which is similar to the temporal dynamics of behavioral performance. However, attentional modulation of these ERP components started later than that of behavioral performance. Rather, the time course of attentional modulation of behavioral performance was more closely associated with that of the concurrently recorded SSVEPs analyzed. These results suggest that neural activities reflected not by either the P300 or N2pc, but by the SSVEPs, are the source of attentional modulation of behavioral performance.

We have addressed which brain regions are and the mechanisms involved in binocular rivalry using EEG and fMRI measurements of cortical activities during observations of competitive (rivalry) and cooperative (fusion) drifting vertical gratings. By applying an EEG-fMRI integrative method, we analyzed the time courses of multiple cortical sources of event-related potentials obtained under rivalry or fusion conditions. We detected significant cortical activities at bilateral MT+/V5 and the right prefrontal eye field in the rivalry condition; however, this may not reflect intrinsic alternation in binocular rivalry. Our findings suggest that novel integrative methods are necessary to investigate the distributed cortical network associated with binocular rivalry, through analysis of multiple cortical sources of event-related desynchronization and/or synchronization in certain frequency bands.

Prestimulus alpha and beta determinants of ERP responses in the Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; ERP genesis; Alpha; Beta; Auditory Go/NoGo; Attention; Arousal	BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; TARGET DETECTION; EEG-DYNAMICS; PHASE-RESET; P300; ATTENTION; AMPLITUDE; MODULATIONS	The nature of the relationships between the level of immediately-prestimulus EEG activity and auditory ERP components remains unclear. Particularly, both inverse and direct relationships have been reported for the alpha band. Here we aim to clarify the pattern of prestimulus EEG contributions in alpha (8-13 Hz), and investigate those in beta (14-24 Hz), for five ERP components (P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) in an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo paradigm. Separate FFTs were applied to the prestimulus Cz data of each accepted trial. The alpha and beta bands were independently assessed. The mean prestimulus spectral band amplitude was computed and used to sort the trials at nine central sites, and the upper and lower sorted trial thirds were averaged to form ERPs for Go and NoGo responses. Prestimulus EEG level effects (High vs. Low) were examined in each component's latency and amplitude, and Go reaction time was also assessed. Prestimulus alpha directly modulated the amplitude of the positive components (P1, P2, P3), while prestimulus beta directly modulated the positivity of the exogenous component amplitudes (P1, N1, P2); each amplitude effect occurred independently of the Go/NoGo stimulus conditions. Prestimulus beta also inversely modulated Go N1 latency; no reaction time effects were found for either band. The pattern of findings is intriguing and the various modulations are discussed in relation to attention and arousal. Together, these results confirm the importance of the EEG brain state immediately prestimulus, and indicate the considerable influence that these states have on event-related response processing.

For example, initial processing of verbal stimuli in the language-dominant left-hemisphere leads to more efficient response inhibition than initial processing of verbal stimuli in the non-dominant right hemisphere. However, it is unclear whether this organizational principle is specific for the language system, or a general principle that also applies to other types of lateralized cognition. To answer this question, we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of early attentional processes, facial expression perception and response inhibition during tachistoscopic presentation of facial "Go" and "Nogo" stimuli in the left and the right visual field (RVF). Participants committed fewer false alarms after Nogo-stimulus presentation in the left compared to the RVF. This right-hemispheric asymmetry on the behavioral level was also reflected in the neurophysiological correlates of face perception, specifically in a right-sided asymmetry in the N170 amplitude. Moreover, the right-hemispheric dominance for facial expression processing also affected event-related potentials typically related to response inhibition, namely the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3. These findings show that an effect of hemispheric asymmetries in early information processing on the efficacy of higher cognitive functions is not limited to left-hemispheric language functions, but can be generalized to predominantly right-hemispheric functions.

No somatotopy of sensorimotor alpha-oscillation responses to differential finger stimulation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-Related Desynchronization; Mu; Neuronal oscillations; Common Spatial Patterns; Somatosensory Evoked Potentials	MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EVOKED-RESPONSES; SPATIOTEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SPATIAL FILTERS; PARIETAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	The somatotopic layout of the primary somatosensory cortex is known for its fine spatial structure as delineated in single cell recordings and macroscopic EEG evoked responses. While a gross somatotopic layout has been revealed also for neuronal oscillations responding to sensorimotor stimulation of distant body parts (e.g. hand vs. foot), it is still unclear whether these oscillatory dynamics exhibit fine spatial layout comparable to those found in evoked responses. In twelve healthy subjects we applied electric stimuli to the first (D1) and fifth finger (D5) of the same hand while performing high-density electroencephalography. We used Common Spatial Pattern analysis to optimally extract components showing the strongest Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in neuronal alpha oscillations. In agreement with the previous studies, dipole locations of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) confirmed the existence of spatially distinct representations of each finger. In contrast, dipole locations of alpha-ERD patterns did not yield spatially different source locations, indicating that the stimulation of different fingers most likely resulted in oscillatory activity of overlapping neuronal populations. When both fingers were stimulated simultaneously the SEP dipole strength was found increased in comparison to a stimulation of either finger alone, in agreement with spatially distinct SEP to finger stimulation. The strength of ERD, on the other hand, was the same regardless of whether either one or both fingers were stimulated. Our findings might reflect anatomical constraints on the sequential temporal activation of fingers' skin where almost simultaneous activation of many fingers usually occurs in everyday activities, such as grasping or holding objects. Such simultaneity is unlikely to benefit from slow amplitude modulation of alpha oscillations, which would rather be beneficial for contrasting somatosensory processing of distinct body parts.

Modulation of effective connectivity during vocalization with perturbed auditory feedback	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Vocalization; Auditory feedback; ERP; DCM; Audio-vocal integration; Pitch shift	SPEECH PRODUCTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; PITCH FEEDBACK; CORTEX; INTEGRATION; MODEL; EEG; MEG; PERTURBATIONS; SUPPRESSION	The integration of auditory feedback with vocal motor output is important for the control of voice fundamental frequency (F-0). We used a pitch-shift paradigm where subjects respond to an alteration, or shift, of voice pitch auditory feedback with a reflexive change in F-0. We presented varying magnitudes of pitch shifted auditory feedback to subjects during vocalization and passive listening and measured event related potentials (ERPs) to the feedback shifts. Shifts were delivered at +100 and +400 cents (200 ms duration). The ERP data were modeled with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) techniques where the effective connectivity between the superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus and premotor areas were tested. We compared three main factors: the effect of intrinsic STG connectivity, STG modulation across hemispheres and the specific effect of hemisphere. A Bayesian model selection procedure was used to make inference about model families. Results suggest that both intrinsic STG and left to right STG connections are important in the identification of self-voice error and sensory motor integration. We identified differences in left-to-right STG connections between 100 cent and 400 cent shift conditions suggesting that self- and non-self-voice error are processed differently in the left and right hemisphere. These results also highlight the potential of DCM modeling of ERP responses to characterize specific network properties of forward models of voice control. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because the P300 amplitude influences attentional resource allocation during discrimination, the component elicited during perception of known and unknown faces should indicate familiarity processing. Methods and results: Nine typically developing children (TD) and nine children with ASDs participated in this study (Experiment 1). The P300 amplitude in TD children was significantly larger during familiar face perception than during unfamiliar face perception (p < 0.01). However, there was no evidence of familiarity effect in children with ASDs. In three children with ASDs, we also assessed the P300 amplitude during perception of a therapist's face one month before (baseline), a few days before and after social skills training (SST) sessions (Experiment 2). To evaluate the effect of familiarity on facial identity processing, we analyzed the therapist/unknown ratio of P300 amplitudes related to the face discrimination task as an index. The ratio was larger after SST sessions than before, but there was no difference in the ratio between baseline and before SST assessments. Conclusion: The P300 might be influenced by attentional resource allocation depending on the stage of learning face identification in children with ASDs. We speculate that this approach to evaluating brain responses during facial identity recognition could be used as a tool to clarify children's communication difficulties.

Pseudo-words with a neutral, happy, threatening, and fearful prosody were presented at two spatial positions. Participants attended to one position in order to detect infrequent targets. Emotional prosody was task irrelevant. The electro-encephalogram (EEG) was recorded to assess processing differences as a function of spatial attention and emotional valence. Results: Event-related potentials (ERPs) differed as a function of emotional prosody both when attended and when unattended. While emotional prosody effects interacted with effects of spatial attention at early processing levels (< 200 ms), these effects were additive at later processing stages (> 200 ms). Conclusions: Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.

TMS has been combined with numerous neuroimaging techniques including, electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Recent work has also demonstrated the feasibility and utility of combining TMS with non-invasive near-infrared optical imaging techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and the event-related optical signal (EROS). Simultaneous TMS and optical imaging affords a number of advantages over other neuroimaging methods but also involves a unique set of methodological challenges and considerations. This paper describes the methodology of concurrently performing optical imaging during the administration of TMS, focusing on experimental design, potential artifacts, and approaches to controlling for these artifacts.

The brain depends on these dimensions to process words. Earlier studies demonstrated that stimuli of the different semantic classes led to differences in neuronal processing. We investigated the influence of connotative meaning on multisensory processing (food words strongly related to odor, taste, vision or somatosensory texture). A group of 795 subjects rated 197 food words on the basis of 11 pairs of adjectives with opposite meanings. Factor analysis revealed three dimensions (Evaluation, Potency and Texture). Words with high positive or negative scores, and low scores on the other dimensions, were used as stimuli in an ERP experiment. EEG was recorded in 40 healthy adults from 30 channels and averaged according to semantic stimulus class. Component latency, global field power and topography were influenced by semantic meaning. These experiments determined that very early effects at 107 ms after stimulus presentation where latency and GFP were affected by stimulus class. When mapped topographically, different stimulus classes led to different scalp topography of evoked brain activity in sagittal direction already at an early state of processing (around 107 ms). The extent of lateralization of potential fields' centers of gravity was influenced by stimulus class around 304 ms. In summary, semantic dimensions influence neuronal processing of words related to multisensory perception. Such effects suggest a rapid and complex way of processing multisensory stimuli.

In the present project, monozygotic (N=51 pairs) and dizygotic (N=48 pairs) twins performed a visual oddball task with dense-array EEG. Using spatial PCA, two principal components each were retained for targets and standards; wavelets were used to obtain time-frequency maps of eigenvalue-weighted event-related oscillations for each individual. Distribution of inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) and single trial power (STP) over time indicated that the early principal component was primarily associated with ITC while the later component was associated with a mixture of ITC and STP. Spatial PCA on point-by-point broad sense heritability matrices revealed data-derived frequency bands similar to those well established in EEG literature.

Automatic Semantic Facilitation in Anterior Temporal Cortex Revealed through Multimodal Neuroimaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FIELD POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; CORTICAL SURFACE; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MEG-DATA; LOBE; COMPREHENSION	A core property of human semantic processing is the rapid, facilitatory influence of prior input on extracting the meaning of what comes next, even under conditions of minimal awareness. Previous work has shown a number of neurophysiological indices of this facilitation, but the mapping between time course and localization-critical for separating automatic semantic facilitation from other mechanisms-has thus far been unclear. In the current study, we used a multimodal imaging approach to isolate early, bottom-up effects of context on semantic memory, acquiring a combination of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in the same individuals with a masked semantic priming paradigm. Across techniques, the results provide a strikingly convergent picture of early automatic semantic facilitation. Event-related potentials demonstrated early sensitivity to semantic association between 300 and 500 ms; MEG localized the differential neural response within this time window to the left anterior temporal cortex, and fMRI localized the effect more precisely to the left anterior superior temporal gyrus, a region previously implicated in semantic associative processing. However, fMRI diverged from early EEG/MEG measures in revealing semantic enhancement effects within frontal and parietal regions, perhaps reflecting downstream attempts to consciously access the semantic features of the masked prime. Together, these results provide strong evidence that automatic associative semantic facilitation is realized as reduced activity within the left anterior superior temporal cortex between 300 and 500 ms after a word is presented, and emphasize the importance of multimodal neuroimaging approaches in distinguishing the contributions of multiple regions to semantic processing.

Control children, typically reading children with risk for reading disability (RD), and children with RD participated in the experiment. Passive oddball paradigm was used for eliciting mismatch negativity during EEG data collection. Data were cleaned by two digital filters with pass bands of 1-30 Hz and 1-15 Hz and a wavelet filter with the pass band narrower than 1-12 Hz. Three model order selection methods were used to estimate the number of sources in each filtered EEG dataset. Under the filter With the pass band of 1-30 Hz, the numbers of sources were very similar among different individual EEG datasets and the group ICA would be suggested; regarding the other two filters with much narrower pass bands, the numbers of sources were relatively diverse, and then, applying group ICA would not be appropriate. Hence, before group ICA is performed, its rationale can be logically validated by the estimated number of sources in EEG data through model order selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although these components have been known for decades, their interpretation is still controversial. A current hypothesis (first indicator hypothesis) claims that the first indication of an action being erroneous leads to a negative deflection of the EEG signal over frontal midline areas. In some cases this requires sensory feedback in the form of knowledge of results (KR). If KR is given, then the first negative deflection can be found around 250 ms after feedback presentation (feedback-related negativity, FRN). When KR is not required, a negative deflection is found already around 100 ms after action onset (ERN). This deflection may be evoked when a mismatch between required and actually executed actions is detected. To detect such a mismatch, however, necessitates knowledge about which actionis required. To test this assumption, the current study monitored EEG error components during acquisition of an internal model, i.e., acquisition of the knowledge of which actions are needed to reach certain goals. Actions consisted of finger presses on a piano keyboard and goals were tones of a certain pitch to be generated, thus the internal model represented audio-motor mapping. Results show that with increasing proficiency in mapping goals to appropriate actions, the amplitude of the ERN increased, whereas the amplitude of the FRN remained unchanged. Thus, when knowledge is present about which action is required, this supports generation of an ERN around 100 ms, likely by detecting a mismatch between required and performed actions. This is in accordance with the first indicator hypothesis. The present study furthermore lends support to the notion that FRN mainly relies on comparison of sensory targets with sensory feedback.

Resolving this question will inform neural and computational theories of visual word recognition and semantic memory use. We measured real-time brain activity using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a go/nogo task to determine the upper limit by which category-related knowledge (living/nonliving) and action-related knowledge (graspable/ungraspable) must have been accessed to influence a downstream decision process. We find that decision processes can be influenced by the living/nonliving distinction by 160 ms after stimulus onset whereas information about (one-hand) graspability is not available before 300 ms. We also provide evidence that rapid access to category-related knowledge occurs for all items, not just a subset of living, nonliving, graspable, or ungraspable ones, and for all participants regardless of their response speed. The latency of the N200 nogo effect by contrast is sensitive to decision speed. We propose a tentative hypothesis of the neural mechanisms underlying semantic access and a subsequent decision process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, little is known about psychophysiological responses to pain faces in chronic pain. Event-related potentials and brain oscillations, corrugator activity, and heart rate were recorded in 20 fibromyalgia patients and 20 pain-free controls when viewing pain, anger, happy, and neutral faces. Pain and anger faces elicited greater unpleasantness and arousal than happy and neutral faces, and pain faces evoked greater corrugator response than the rest of faces in all participants. Fibromyalgia patients displayed greater cardiac deceleration to all facial expressions than pain-free controls, and enhanced N100 amplitudes to pain and anger faces in comparison with neutral faces. Pain-free controls were characterized by enhanced N100 amplitudes to happy faces as compared to patients, and by more positive event-related potential amplitudes to happy than to other faces in the time window of 200 to 300 ms. Fibromyalgia patients showed greater theta power in response to pain and anger faces, as well as more reduced alpha power than pain-free controls to all faces. These findings suggest that information processing in fibromyalgia might be characterized by enhanced defensive reactions and increased mobilization of attention resources to pain and anger faces, and by reduced allocation of attention to happy faces. Perspective: Our findings suggest that brain and cardiac activity elicited by viewing facial expressions of pain and anger in others is altered in fibromyalgia patients. This cognitive bias toward negative emotions could be used in clinical settings as a psychobiological marker during the assessment and treatment of fibromyalgia.

J	Alomari, MH; Samaha, A; AlKamha, K				Alomari, Mohammad H.; Samaha, Aya; AlKamha, Khaled			Automated Classification of L/R Hand Movement EEG Signals using Advanced Feature Extraction and Machine Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; BCI; ICA; MRCP; ERD/ERS; machine learning; NN; SVM	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	In this paper, we propose an automated computer platform for the purpose of classifying Electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with left and right hand movements using a hybrid system that uses advanced feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. It is known that EEG represents the brain activity by the electrical voltage fluctuations along the scalp, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a device that enables the use of the brain's neural activity to communicate with others or to control machines, artificial limbs, or robots without direct physical movements. In our research work, we aspired to find the best feature extraction method that enables the differentiation between left and right executed fist movements through various classification algorithms. The EEG dataset used in this research was created and contributed to PhysioNet by the developers of the BCI2000 instrumentation system. Data was preprocessed using the EEGLAB MATLAB toolbox and artifacts removal was done using AAR. Data was epoched on the basis of Event-Related (De) Synchronization (ERD/ERS) and movement-related cortical potentials ( MRCP) features. Mu/beta rhythms were isolated for the ERD/ERS analysis and delta rhythms were isolated for the MRCP analysis. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) spatial filter was applied on related channels for noise reduction and isolation of both artifactually and neutrally generated EEG sources. The final feature vector included the ERD, ERS, and MRCP features in addition to the mean, power and energy of the activations of the resulting Independent Components (ICs) of the epoched feature datasets. The datasets were inputted into two machine-learning algorithms: Neural Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Intensive experiments were carried out and optimum classification performances of 89.8 and 97.1 were obtained using NN and SVM, respectively. This research shows that this method of feature extraction holds some promise for the classification of various pairs of motor movements, which can be used in a BCI context to mentally control a computer or machine.

Participants performed the number-conservation task and, after the EEG session, the mental imagery task. In the number-conservation task, first two rows with the same number of tokens and the same length were presented on a computer screen (COV condition) and then, the tokens in one of the two rows were spread apart (INT condition). Participants were instructed to determine whether the two rows had an identical number of tokens. In the mental imagery task, two rows with different lengths but the same number of tokens were presented and participants were instructed to imagine the tokens in the longer row aligning with the tokens in the shorter row. In the number-conservation task, we found that the amplitudes of the centro-parietal N2 and fronto-central P3 were higher in the INT than in the COV conditions. In addition, the differences in response times between the two conditions were correlated with the differences in the amplitudes of the fronto-central P3. In light of previous results reported on the number-conservation task in adults, the present results suggest that inhibition might be necessary to succeed the number-conservation task in adults even when the transformation of the length of one of the row is displayed. Finally, we also reported correlations between the speed at which participants could imagine the shortening of one of the row in the mental imagery task, the speed at which participants could determine that the two rows had the same number of tokens after the tokens in one of the row were spread apart and the latency of the late positive parietal component in the number-conservation task. Therefore, performing the number-conservation task might involve mental transformation processes in adults.

EEG analysis reveals widespread directed functional interactions related to a painful cutaneous laser stimulus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; human; pain; cortex; network; event-related causality	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PARIETAL CORTEX STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; A-DELTA-FIBER; GRANGER CAUSALITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT INTENTION; CORTICAL NETWORK; COLD-WATER	During attention to a painful cutaneous laser stimulus, event-related causality (ERC) has been detected in recordings from subdural electrodes implanted directly over cortical modules for the treatment of epilepsy. However, these studies afforded limited sampling of modules and did not examine interactions with a nonpainful stimulus as a control. We now sample scalp EEG to test the hypothesis that attention to the laser stimulus is associated with poststimulus ERC interactions that are different from those with attention to a nonpainful stimulus. Subjects attended to (counted) either a painful laser stimulus (laser attention task) or a nonpainful electrical cutaneous stimulus that produced distraction from the laser (laser distraction task). Both of these stimuli were presented in random order in a single train. The intensities of both stimuli were adjusted to produce similar baseline salience and sensations in the same cutaneous territory. The results demonstrated that EEG channels with poststimulus ERC interactions were consistently different during the laser stimulus versus the electric stimulus. Poststimulus ERC interactions for the laser attention task were different from the laser distraction task. Furthermore, scalp EEG frontal channels play a driver role while parietal temporal channels play a receiver role during both tasks, although this does not prove that these channels are connected. Sites at which large numbers of ERC interactions were found for both laser attention and distraction tasks (critical sites) were located at Cz, Pz, and C3. Stimulation leading to disruption of sites of these pain-related interactions may produce analgesia for acute pain.	[Markman, T.; Liu, C. C.; Chien, J. H.; Zhang, J.; Lenz, F.

J	Herrmann, B; Henry, MJ; Scharinger, M; Obleser, J				Herrmann, Bjoern; Henry, Molly J.; Scharinger, Mathias; Obleser, Jonas			Auditory filter width affects response magnitude but not frequency specificity in auditory cortex	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; INTER-STIMULUS INTERVAL; SHORT-TERM PLASTICITY; MULTIPLE TIME SCALES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; ADAPTATION; SHAPES; HEARING	Spectral analysis of acoustic stimuli occurs in the auditory periphery (termed frequency selectivity) as well as at the level of auditory cortex (termed frequency specificity). Frequency selectivity is commonly investigated using an auditory filter model, while frequency specificity is often investigated as neural adaptation of the N1 response in electroencephalography (EEG). However, the effects of aging on frequency-specific adaptation, and the link between peripheral frequency selectivity and neural frequency specificity have not received much attention. Here, normal hearing younger (20-31 years) and older participants (49-63 years) underwent a psychophysical notched noise experiment to estimate individual auditory filters, and an EEG experiment to investigate frequency-specific adaptation in auditory cortex. The shape of auditory filters was comparable between age groups, and thus shows intact frequency selectivity in normal aging. In auditory cortex, both groups showed N1 frequency-specific neural adaptation effects that similarly varied with the spectral variance in the stimulation, while N1 responses were overall larger for older than younger participants. Importantly, the overall N1 amplitude, but not frequency-specific neural adaptation was correlated with the pass-band of the auditory filter. Thus, the current findings show a dissociation of peripheral frequency selectivity and neural frequency specificity, but suggest that widened auditory filters are compensated for by a response gain in frequency-specific areas of auditory cortex.

General anesthesia as a possible GABAergic modulator affects visual processing in children	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GABA; development; general anesthesia; EEG; psychophysics; vision; segmentation	FIGURE-GROUND SEGREGATION; TEXTURE SEGREGATION; LORAZEPAM; CORTEX; BENZODIAZEPINE; INHIBITION; MONKEY; SEGMENTATION; SEVOFLURANE; FEEDFORWARD	Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) inhibitory interneurons play an important role in visual processing, as is revealed by studies administering drugs in human and monkey adults. Investigating this process in children requires different methodologies, due to ethical considerations. The current study aimed to investigate whether a new method, being general anesthesia using Sevoflurane, can be used to trace the effects of GABAergic modulation on visual brain functioning in children. To this aim, visual processing was investigated in children aged 4-12 years who were scheduled for minor urologic procedures under general anesthesia in day-care treatment. In a visual segmentation task, the difference in Event-Related Potential (ERP) response to homogeneous and textured stimuli was investigated. In addition, psychophysical performance on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were measured. Results were compared between before and shortly after anesthesia. In two additional studies, effects at 1 day after anesthesia and possible effects of task-repetition were investigated. ERP results showed longer latency and lower amplitude of the Texture Negativity (TN) component shortly after compared to before anesthesia. No effects of anesthesia on psychophysical measurements were found. No effects at 1 day after anesthesia or of repetition were revealed either. These results show that GABAergic modulation through general anesthesia affects ERP reflections of visual segmentation in a similar way in children as benzodiazepine does in adults, but that effects are not permanent. This demonstrates that ERP measurement after anesthesia is a successful method to study effects of GABAergic modulation in children.

Independent power spectral features of the brain rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were extracted from the recorded EEG signals. The extracted power spectral features were then associated to the auditory perception and neural network models for the left and right ears were developed. The result indicates that the gamma-power derived from the electrodes can be deployed independently to characterize the EEG dynamics of normal hearing and abnormal hearing perception of a person. The effects of brain rhythms on perceiving two different auditory frequencies namely 500 Hz and 1000 Hz their associated auditory response have been investigated. From the network models, it has been inferred that the neural network models were able to discriminate the normal hearing and abnormal hearing persons.	[Paulraj, M.

Multivariate temporal dictionary learning for EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Dictionary learning; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multivariate; Shift-invariance; EEG; Evoked potentials; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MATCHING PURSUIT; SINGLE; DECOMPOSITION; LOCALIZATION; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; ERPS	This article addresses the issue of representing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in an efficient way. While classical approaches use a fixed Gabor dictionary to analyze EEG signals, this article proposes a data-driven method to obtain an adapted dictionary. To reach an efficient dictionary learning, appropriate spatial and temporal modeling is required. Inter-channels links are taken into account in the spatial multivariate model, and shift-invariance is used for the temporal model. Multivariate learned kernels are informative (a few atoms code plentiful energy) and interpretable (the atoms can have a physiological meaning). Using real EEG data, the proposed method is shown to outperform the classical multichannel matching pursuit used with a Gabor dictionary, as measured by the representative power of the learned dictionary and its spatial flexibility. Moreover, dictionary learning can capture interpretable patterns: this ability is illustrated on real data, learning a P300 evoked potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Knockout of NMDA Receptors in Parvalbumin Interneurons Recreates Autism-Like Phenotypes	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; electrophysiology; endophenotype; animal models; NMDA receptor 1 knockout	MICE MUS-MUSCULUS; MOUSE MODELS; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS	Autism is a disabling neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, language impairment, and repetitive behaviors with few effective treatments. New evidence suggests that autism has reliable electrophysiological endophenotypes and that these measures may be caused by n-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) disruption on parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons. These findings could be used to create new translational biomarkers. Recent developments have allowed for cell-type selective knockout of NMDARs in order to examine the perturbations caused by disrupting specific circuits. This study examines several electrophysiological and behavioral measures disrupted in autism using a PV-selective reduction in NMDA R1 subunit. Mouse electroencephalograph (EEG) was recorded in response to auditory stimuli. Event-related potential (ERP) component amplitude and latency analysis, social testing, and premating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) recordings were performed. Correlations were examined between the ERP latency and behavioral measures. The N1 ERP latency was delayed, sociability was reduced, and mating USVs were impaired in PV-selective NMDA Receptor 1 Knockout (NR1 KO) as compared with wild-type mice. There was a significant correlation between N1 latency and sociability but not between N1 latency and premating USV power or T-maze performance. The increases in N1 latency, impaired sociability, and reduced vocalizations in PV-selective NR1 KO mice mimic similar changes found in autism. Electrophysiological changes correlate to reduced sociability, indicating that the local circuit mechanisms controlling N1 latency may be utilized in social function. Therefore, we propose that behavioral and electrophysiological alterations in PV-selective NR1 KO mice may serve as a useful model for therapeutic development in autism. Autism Res 2013, 6: 6977.

Methods: We recorded 31-channel scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) from nine healthy subjects during brisk imagery tasks of left and right foot movements. EEG was analyzed with time-frequency maps and topographies, and the accuracy rate of classification between left and right foot movements was calculated. Results: Beta rebound at the end of imagination (increase of EEG beta rhythm amplitude) was identified from the two EEGs derived from the right-shift and left-shift bipolar pairs at the vertex. This process enabled discrimination between right or left foot imagery at a high accuracy rate (maximum 81.6% in single trial analysis). Conclusion: These data suggest that foot motor imagery has potential to elicit left-right differences in EEG, while BCI using the unilateral foot imagery can achieve high classification accuracy, similar to ordinary BCI, based on hand motor imagery. Significance: By combining conventional discrimination techniques, the left-right discrimination of unilateral foot motor imagery provides a novel BCI system that could control a foot neuroprosthesis or a robotic foot.

It is known that when these overlapping mechanisms are simultaneously activated by action observation and execution, motor performance is influenced by observation and vice versa. To understand the neural dynamics underlying this influence and to measure how variations in brain activity impact the precise kinematics of motor behavior, we coupled kinematics and electrophysiological recordings of participants while they performed and observed congruent or non-congruent actions or during action execution alone. We found that movement velocities and the trajectory deviations of the executed actions increased during the observation of congruent actions compared to the observation of non-congruent actions or action execution alone. This facilitation was also discernible in the motor-related potentials of the participants; the motor-related potentials were transiently more negative in the congruent condition around the onset of the executed movement, which occurred 300 ms after the onset of the observed movement. This facilitation seemed to depend not only on spatial congruency but also on the optimal temporal relationship of the observation and execution events.

However, little is known about performance monitoring in premature pathological aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study recorded the error-related negativity (ERN) and the correct-related negativity (CRN) as indices of performance monitoring and compared these responses in older adults with MCI to the ones of younger and older adult controls. No differences in either ERN or CRN were found between younger and older adult controls. Compared to both control groups, we observed a more negatively pronounced CRN in MCI subjects. Only in this group did the amplitude of the CRN not differ from the one of the ERN. In general, larger differences between both components (i.e., ERN > CRN) were associated with better performances in cognitive tests requiring inhibition and executive control. These results indicate that electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring (ERN and CRN) are differentially affected by aging and MCI.

Distinction between brain and non-brain independent components (ICs) accounting for, e.g., eye or muscle activities is an important step in the analysis. Here we present a fully automated method to identify eye-movement related EEG components by analyzing the spatial distribution of their scalp projections (scalp maps). The EyeCatch method compares each input scalp map to a database of eye-related IC scalp maps obtained by data-mining over half a million IC scalp maps obtained from 80,006 EEG datasets associated with a diverse set of EEG studies and paradigms. To our knowledge this is the largest sample of IC scalp maps that has ever been analyzed. Our result show comparable performance to a previous state-of-art semi-automated method, CORRMAP, while eliminating the need for human intervention.

In those studies, lexical processing of spoken stimuli became manifest as an enhanced ERP in response to unattended real words, as opposed to phonologically matched but meaningless pseudoword stimuli. This lexical ERP enhancement was explained by automatic activation of word memory traces realized as distributed strongly intra-connected neuronal circuits, whose robustness guarantees memory trace activation even in the absence of attention on spoken input. Such an account would predict the automatic activation of these memory traces upon any presentation of linguistic information, irrespective of the presentation modality. As previous lexical MMN studies exclusively used auditory stimulation, we here adapted the lexical MMN paradigm to investigate early automatic lexical effects in the visual modality. In a visual oddball sequence, matched short word and pseudoword stimuli were presented tachistoscopically in perifoveal area outside the visual focus of attention, as the subjects' attention was concentrated on a concurrent non-linguistic visual dual task in the center of the screen. Using EEG, we found a visual analogue of the lexical ERP enhancement effect, with unattended written words producing larger brain response amplitudes than matched pseudowords, starting at similar to 100 ms. Furthermore, we also found significant visual MMN, reported here for the first time for unattended perifoveal lexical stimuli. The data suggest early automatic lexical processing of visually presented language which commences rapidly and can take place outside the focus of attention.

Subject position affects EEG magnitudes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Current source modeling; Neuroanatomy; Gamma power; ERP magnitude; Brain shift	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ATROPHY; MOTOR CORTEX; STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; DIAGNOSIS; SLEEP; ALPHA; CSF	EEG (electroencephalography) has been used for decades in thousands of research studies and is today a routine clinical tool despite the small magnitude of measured scalp potentials. It is widely accepted that the currents originating in the brain are strongly influenced by the high resistivity of skull bone, but it is less well known that the thin layer of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) has perhaps an even more important effect on EEG scalp magnitude by spatially blurring the signals. Here it is shown that brain shift and the resulting small changes in CSF layer thickness, induced by changing the subject's position, have a significant effect on EEG signal magnitudes in several standard visual paradigms. For spatially incoherent high-frequency activity the effect produced by switching from prone to supine can be dramatic, increasing occipital signal power by several times for some subjects (on average 80%). MRI measurements showed that the occipital CSF layer between the brain and skull decreases by approximately 30% in thickness when a subject moves from prone to supine position. A multiple dipole model demonstrated that this can indeed lead to occipital EEG signal power increases in the same direction and order of magnitude as those observed here. These results suggest that future EEG studies should control for subjects' posture, and that some studies may consider placing their subjects into the most favorable position for the experiment. These findings also imply that special consideration should be given to EEG measurements from subjects with brain atrophy due to normal aging or neurodegenerative diseases, since the resulting increase in CSF layer thickness could profoundly decrease scalp potential measurements.

The paradigm combines 3-tone pitch patterns with alternating timbres, resulting in a repeating 6-tone structure that can be perceived as rising based on temporal proximity, or as falling based on timbre similarity. Listeners continuously report their percept while EEG is recorded. Results show an ERP modulation starting at approximate to 70ms after sound onset that can be explained by whether a sound belongs to perceived foreground or background, with no additional effect of integrated versus segregated grouping. Auditory grouping as indexed by the mismatch negativity did not correspond with reported sound grouping. The paradigm offers a new possibility for investigating effects of conscious perceptual organization on sound processing.

The effects of ignored versus foveated cues upon inhibition of return: An event-related potential study	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Inhibition of return; Eye movements; Visual attention; VEP; EEG; MEG	REFLEXIVE ATTENTION; COMPONENTS; EXTRASTRIATE; MECHANISMS	Taylor and Klein (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 26:1639-1656, 2000) discovered two mutually exclusive "flavors" of inhibition of return (IOR): When the oculomotor system is "actively suppressed," IOR affects input processes (the perception/attention flavor), whereas when the oculomotor system is "engaged," IOR affects output processes (the motor flavor). Studies of brain activity with ignored cues have typically reported that IOR reduces an early sensory event-related potential (ERP) component (i.e., the P1 component) of the brain's response to the target. Since eye movements were discouraged in these experiments, the P1 reduction might be a reflection of the perception/attention flavor of IOR. If, instead of ignoring the cue, participants made a prosaccade to the cue (and then returned to fixation) before responding to the target, the motor flavor of IOR should then be generated. We compared these two conditions while monitoring eye position and recording ERPs to the targets. If the P1 modulation is related to the perceptual/attentional flavor of IOR, we hypothesized that it might be absent when the motoric flavor of IOR was generated by a prosaccade to the cue. Our results demonstrated that target-related P1 reductions and behavioral IOR were similar, and significant, in both conditions. However, P1 modulations were significantly correlated with behavioral IOR only when the oculomotor system was actively suppressed, suggesting that P1 modulations may only affect behaviorally exhibited IOR when the attentional/perceptual flavor of IOR is recruited.

The role of attention in such reversals is not clear. We tested whether perceptual reversals depend on attentional resources by manipulating perceptual load and recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during intermittent presentation of Necker stimuli. The results did not reveal any influence for perceptual load on the frequency of reversals. The ERPs showed that perceptual load influenced electrophysiological activity over parieto-central areas in the P1 time window (110140?ms), but load did not modify the early enhancements of positivity (30140?ms), which correlated with perceptual reversals at occipito-temporal sites. We conclude that disambiguation of ambiguous figures is based on early mechanisms that can work efficiently with only a minimal amount of attentional resources.

Spatial Auditory BCI Paradigm based on Real and Virtual Sound Image Generation	2013 ASIA-PACIFIC SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING ASSOCIATION ANNUAL SUMMIT AND CONFERENCE (APSIPA)	Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Summit and Conference of the Asia-Pacific-Signal-and-Information-Processing-Association (APSIPA)	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2013	Kaohsiung, TAIWAN	Asia Pacific Signal & Informat Proc Assoc				This paper presents a novel concept of spatial auditory brain-computer interface utilizing real and virtual sound images. We report results obtained from psychophysical and EEG experiments with nine subjects utilizing a novel method of spatial real or virtual sound images as spatial auditory brain computer interface (BCI) cues. Real spatial sound sources result in better behavioral and BCI response classification accuracies, yet a direct comparison of partial results in a mixed experiment confirms the usability of the virtual sound images for the spatial auditory BCI. Additionally, we compare stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in a single sequence BCI experiment. The interesting point of the mixed usage of real and virtual spatial sound images in a single experiment is that both stimuli types generate distinct event related potential (ERP) response patterns allowing for their separate classification. This discovery is the strongest point of the reported research and it brings the possibility to create new spatial auditory BCI paradigms.

Physiological brain aging is characterized by a progressive dysfunction and loss of synaptic contacts and neuronal abnormal apoptosis. Neural and synaptic redundancy as well as functional and structural plastic remodeling of brain networking promote maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life but are not sufficient to face the pathologic scenario of excessive synaptic/neuronal loss as in dementias. It is, then, important to implement techniques that are able to measure changes in normal aging brain and to discriminate the threshold from neurodegenerative processes. Rhythmic electromagnetic brain oscillatory activity is a hallmark of neuronal function and it contains relevant traces of neuronal assemblies cooperation across different brain functions; an integrated approach utilizing modern neurophysiological techniques, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging is promising for large-scale, affordable, and non-invasive intercept of at-risk populations both at a group and probably also at a single-subject level. This approach might also guarantee the possibility of studying drug-induced changes in the electrical properties of the human cortex, developing and testing models of brain connectivity and treating neuropsychiatric diseases. In this paper some neurophysiological cutting-edge techniques will be presented that provide innovative information and deal with the broad issue of the role of neurophysiology for the assessment of patho-physiological aging and dementia also providing new insight to the actions of central nervous system drugs at the cortical level.

Error-Monitoring and Post-Error Compensations: Dissociation between Perceptual Failures and Motor Errors with and without Awareness	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ANTISACCADE TASK; RESPONSE ERRORS; ALPHA POWER; PERFORMANCE; NEGATIVITY; ERP; ADJUSTMENTS	Whether humans adjust their behavior in response to unaware errors remains a controversial issue relevant to insight in neuropsychiatric conditions. Initial error awareness studies found that the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential (ERP) originating in the medial prefrontal cortex after errors, activated equally for aware and unaware errors, suggesting a candidate preconscious mechanism. However, recent studies demonstrate that the ERN decreases after unaware errors. We hypothesized that the ERN is dependent upon awareness, and predicted that previous discrepancies might be due to unaware errors not being differentiated from perceptually uncertain, low-confidence responses that might increase the ERN amplitude. Here we addressed this hypothesis by distinguishing between aware errors, unaware errors, and uncertain responses, and using stimuli (faces) associated with well established sensory ERPs to evaluate the degree of stimulus processing for each trial type. We found that while aware and unaware errors were related to failures at the time of response, uncertain responses were due to failures at the time of stimulus processing indexed by lower amplitude sensory ERPs. Moreover, uncertain responses showed similar ERN activity as aware errors, in comparison with decreased activity for unaware errors. Finally, compared with aware errors, uncertain responses and unaware errors showed reduced neural compensations, such as alpha suppression. Together these findings suggest that the ERN is activated by aware motor errors as well as sensory failures, and that both awareness and certainty are necessary for neural adaptations after errors.

The neural mismatch responses in event-related potentials to such distracting stimuli depend on age. Adults commonly show a negative response, whereas in children a positive as well as a negative mismatch response has been reported. Using electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), here we investigated the developmental changes of distraction processing in school-aged children (9-10 years) and adults. Participants took part in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm comprising a visuo-spatial primary task and task-irrelevant environmental sounds distracting from this task. Behaviorally, distractors delayed reaction times (RTs) in the primary task in both age groups, and this delay was of similar magnitude in both groups. The neurophysiological data revealed an early as well as a late mismatch response elicited by distracting stimuli in both age groups. Together with previous research, this indicates that deviance detection is accomplished in a hierarchical manner in the auditory system. Both mismatch responses were localized to auditory cortex areas. All mismatch responses were generally delayed in children, suggesting that not all neurophysiological aspects of deviance processing are mature in school-aged children. Furthermore, the P3a, reflecting involuntary attention capture, was present in both age groups in the EEG with comparable amplitudes and at similar latencies, but with a different topographical distribution. This suggests that involuntary attention shifts toward complex distractors operate comparably in school-aged children and adults, yet undergoing generator maturation.

In this study, we investigated whether improvement in mental health might require (1) reduction in the sensory pain experience and brain correlates of that experience, and/or (2) improved perceptions of the controllability of pain and corresponding brain activity related to cognitive control and emotional regulation. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with chronic pain were assessed and randomized into an intervention group (who attended an 8-wk MBPM) or a control group (treatment-as-usual), before being reassessed after 8 weeks. Outcome measures included clinical pain, perceived control over pain, mental and physical health, and mindfulness. Neural activity was measured during the anticipation and experience of acute experimental pain, using electroencephalography with source reconstruction. Results: Improvements were found in the MBPM group relative to the control group in mental health, which related to greater perceived control of pain, but not to reductions in clinical or experimental pain ratings. Anticipatory and pain-evoked event-related potentials to acute experimental pain were decreased, but sources of these event-related potentials were estimated to be in regions that modulate emotional responses rather than pain intensity. Mental health and perceived control outcomes correlated with reduced anticipatory deactivations of dorsolateral prefrontal and somatosensory cortices. Discussion: Increased activity in cognitive control regions of the brain during pain anticipation related to improved mental health and perceived control over pain, but not to decreased pain experience. Greater perceived control may therefore result from improved regulation of the emotional response to pain.	[Brown, Christopher A.; Jones, Anthony K.

For the simulated data the presented method gives a significant improvement in the observation of single trial ERPs as well as in the estimation of their amplitudes and latencies, in comparison with a standard denoising technique (Donoho's thresholding) and in comparison with the noisy single trials. For the real data, the proposed method largely filters the spontaneous EEG activity, thus helping the identification of single trial visual and auditory ERPs. The proposed method provides a simple, automatic and fast tool that allows the study of single trial responses and their correlations with behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The visual mismatch negativity elicited with visual speech stimuli	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech perception; visual perception; lipreading; scalp electrophysiology; mismatch negativity (MMN); hemispheric laterazation for speech	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; FACE RECOGNITION; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; MMN; MOTION; INFORMATION	The visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), deriving from the brain's response to stimulus deviance, is thought to be generated by the cortex that represents the stimulus. The vMMN response to visual speech stimuli was used in a study of the lateralization of visual speech processing. Previous research suggested that the right posterior temporal cortex has specialization for processing simple non-speech face gestures, and the left posterior temporal cortex has specialization for processing visual speech gestures. Here, visual speech consonant-vowel (CV) stimuli with controlled perceptual dissimilarities were presented in an electroencephalography (EEG) vMMN paradigm. The vMMNs were obtained using the comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) for separate CVs in their roles as deviant vs. their roles as standard. Four separate vMMN contrasts were tested, two with the perceptually far deviants (i.e., "zha" or "fa") and two with the near deviants (i.e., "zha" or "ta"). Only far deviants evoked the vMMN response over the left posterior temporal cortex. All four deviants evoked vMMNs over the right posterior temporal cortex. The results are interpreted as evidence that the left posterior temporal cortex represents speech contrasts that are perceived as different consonants, and the right posterior temporal cortex represents face gestures that may not be perceived as different CVs.

The P3 has been linked to attention and memory brain functions. Methods: In 24 schizophrenia patients and 28 control subjects, wavelet transform was used to reveal event-related modulations of the EEG signal during target trials in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Results: Patients showed reductions in P3 amplitude accompanied by reduced low frequency delta-theta and increased beta-gamma band EEG activity. Conclusions: These results indicate abnormalities in the synchronization and/or efficiency of neural processes involved in memory and attention networks in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed the relevance of rhythm for language processing, but there has been only little research using the method of event-related potentials to investigate this phenomenon in a natural metrical context. To this end, an experiment was conducted in which the so-called Rhythm Rule (alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables) was either met or violated by stress clashes or stress lapses which are known to occur in German. The comparison of rhythmic well-formed conditions with the conditions including rhythmic irregularities revealed biphasic EEG-patterns for rhythmically marked structures, i.e., stress clashes and lapses. The present results show that irregular but possible rhythmic variants are costly in language processing, reflected by an early negativity and an N400 in contrast to the well-formed control conditions. Supposedly, the early negativity reflects error detection in rhythmical structure and supports the view that the brain is sensitive to subtle violations of rhythmical structure. A late positive component reflects the evaluation process related to the task requirements. The study shows that subtle rhythmical deviations from the Rhythm Rule are perceived and treated differently from well-formed structures during processing, even if the deviation in question is permitted and can therefore occur in language production.

Emotional Face Perception in Patients with Schizophrenia: an Event-Related Potential Study	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						emotional face perception; ERP; N170; schizophrenia; symptom severity	FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; COGNITION; DISCRIMINATION; EXPRESSIONS; DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS; FEATURES; ERPS	Emotional face recognition has been shown to be drastically impaired among patients with schizophrenia. Since the underlying processes of this deficit have not been widely addressed, we attempted to investigate the relationship between facial expression perception and clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. We enrolled 28 patients with schizophrenia and 28 healthy adults matched by their sex and age. The amplitude and latency of component N170 in event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) induced by presentations of happy, fearful, and neutral face images were comparatively evaluated in these two groups. Furthermore, the relationship between the N170 measures and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The N170 responses to facial expressions in patients with schizophrenia were significantly delayed, as compared to healthy control participants [F (1, 54) = 4.25, P = 0.044]. The N170 response to fearful faces (as compared to happy and neutral faces) was elicited with the minimum latency in the control group, while this component was most delayed among schizophrenics. Positive schizophrenia symptoms correlated with the amplitudes of the left-hemisphere N170 component in response to happy, fearful, and neutral faces. Our findings suggest that the facial expression deficit in schizophrenia is related to delayed responses in face perception and is influenced by the severity of positive symptoms. The evident delay in fearful face perception among patients with schizophrenia may partly explain their inappropriate reactions to threatening conditions.

Emotionally salient stimuli are detected more often, even if presented in the attentional blink period, and elicit an enlarged P3 response, which has been interpreted as enhanced consolidation. This effect correlates with individual differences in trait affectivity such as anxiety or dysphoria. Here, we ask if it is also related to the capacity to detect emotions in others, i.e., to interpersonal social traits. We therefore presented emotional and neutral images depicting social scenes as targets in an attentional blink design and measured detection rates and event-related potentials. In addition, we recorded self-reports of empathy as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results show enhanced performance for emotional stimuli and increased P3 amplitudes, which correlated with individual differences in empathy. The data suggest that self-reported empathy goes along with enhanced processing of emotion in social stimuli, even under stimulus conditions that are suboptimal for conscious target detection.

However, these conclusions should be considered cautiously because EEG-recorded Gamma may be contaminated by noncephalic activity such as microsaccades. Moreover, EEG studies of Gamma cannot easily reveal its intracranial sources. Here we recorded MEG rather than EEG, assessed the sources of the M170 and Gamma oscillations using beamformer, and explored the sensitivity of these neural manifestations to global, featural and configural information in faces. The M170 was larger in response to faces and face components than in response to watches. Scrambling the configuration of the inner components of the face even if presented without the face contour reduced and delayed the M170. The amplitude of MEG Gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) was higher than baseline during an epoch between 230-570 ms from stimulus onset and was particularly sensitive to the configuration of the stimuli, regardless of their category. However, in the lower part of this frequency range (30-40 Hz) only physiognomic stimuli elevated the MEG above baseline. Both the M170 and Gamma were generated in a posterior-ventral network including the fusiform, inferior-occipital and lingual gyri, all in the right hemisphere. The generation of Gamma involved additional sources in the visual system, bilaterally. We suggest that the evoked M170 manifests a face-perception mechanism based on the global characteristics of face, whereas the induced Gamma oscillations are associated with the integration of visual input into a pre-existent coherent perceptual representation.

One problem reported in schizophrenia patients is that they tend to show deficits in face emotion processing, on which negative symptoms are thought to have stronger influence. In this study, four event-related potential (ERP) components (P100, N170, N250, and P300) and their source activities were analyzed using EEG data acquired from 23 schizophrenia patients while they were presented with facial emotion picture stimuli. Correlations between positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores and source activations during facial emotion processing were calculated to identify the brain areas affected by symptom scores. Our analysis demonstrates that PANSS positive scores are negatively correlated with major areas of the left temporal lobule for early ERP components (P100, N170) and with the right middle frontal lobule for a later component (N250), which indicates that positive symptoms affect both early face processing and facial emotion processing. On the other hand, PANSS negative scores are negatively correlated with several clustered regions, including the left fusiform gyrus (at P100), most of which are not overlapped with regions showing correlations with PANSS positive scores. Our results suggest that positive and negative symptoms affect independent brain regions during facial emotion processing, which may help to explain the heterogeneous characteristics of schizophrenia.

In particular, we use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) patterns associated with right elbow flexion and extension movements, while lifting different weights. We observe that it is possible to classify tasks of varying difficulty based on EEG signals. Additionally, we also present a correlation analysis between intention levels detected from EEG and surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals. Our experimental results suggest that it is possible to extract the intention level information from EEG signals in response to task difficulty and indicate some level of correlation between EEG and EMG. With a view towards detecting patients' intention levels during rehabilitation therapies, the proposed approach has the potential to ensure active involvement of patients throughout exercise routines and increase the efficacy of robot assisted therapies.

To date, it is not well understood how these inputs influence the perception and processing of pain. Previous studies on integrative processing between sensory modalities other than pain have shown that multisensory response gains are strongest when the constituent unimodal stimuli are minimally effective in evoking responses. This finding has been termed the principle of inverse effectiveness (IE). In this high-density electroencephalography study, we investigated the influence of Gabor patches of low and high contrast levels on the perception and processing of spatially and temporally aligned painful electrical stimuli of low and high intensities. Subjective pain ratings, event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory responses served as dependent measures. In line with the principle of IE, stronger crossmodal biasing effects of visual input on subjective pain ratings were found for low compared to high intensity painful stimuli. This effect was paralleled by stronger bimodal interactions in right-central ERPs (150-200 ms) for low compared to high intensity pain stimuli. Moreover, an enhanced suppression of medio-central beta-band activity (12-24 Hz, 200-400 ms) was found for low compared to high intensity pain stimuli. Our findings possibly reflect a facilitation of stimulus processing that serves to enhance response readiness of the sensorimotor system following painful stimulation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that multisensory processing between visual and painful stimuli follows the principle of IE and suggests a role for beta-band oscillations in the crossmodal modulation of pain.

Because of the apparent demand to stop a motor reaction, the electrophysiological responses evoked by stop and no-go trials have sometimes likewise been interpreted as indicators of inhibitory processes. Recent research, however, suggests a richer conceptual background. Evidence denotes an association of a frontal-midline N200/theta oscillations with premotor cognitive processes such as conflict monitoring or response program updating, and an anterior P300/delta oscillations with response-related, evaluative processing stages, probably the evaluation of motor inhibition'. However, the data are still insufficient to unambiguously relate these electroencephalographic measures to specific inhibitory functions. Beta band activity only recently has become a focus of attention in this task context because of its association with the motor system and regions involved in inhibitory control. Its functional role in response inhibition tasks needs further exploration though. Hence, as things stand, any deduction of differences regarding actual inhibitory capabilities or loads between subject groups or conditions based on electroencephalographic measures has to be treated with caution.

However, it is unclear whether these brain oscillations reflect developmental changes in the processing of affective information during adolescence. EEG data were collected from 51 adolescents and 18 undergraduates as they viewed a total of 90 pictures. In the range of fast wave activities, event-related synchronization (ERS) in the beta band varied with emotional valence, indicating that beta ERS is indicative of early bottom-up processing of visual emotional stimuli. Adolescents at the age of 12 years exhibited more positive beta ERS amplitudes over posterior brain regions for positive versus neutral pictures compared to adolescents at the ages 14years, 16 years and in young adults; however, no age-related differences were found for negative versus neutral pictures. In the range of slow wave activities, delta ERSs and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes exhibited affective modulation and decreased over anterior brain regions from between the age of 12 years and early adulthood. These slow wave activities (delta and LPPs) reflected top-down attention to the motivational relevance of the emotional stimuli. Taken together, these observations suggest that adolescents exhibit dissociable ERS patterns in the delta and beta bands during affective processing. Furthermore, adolescents undergo age-dependent changes in oscillatory brain reorganization. Our results should be useful to researchers interested in affective processing during adolescence.

Here we investigated whether alpha-ERD could be functionally distinguished in 2 temporally and spatially segregated subcomponents as suggested by previous studies. In addition, we tested whether the degree of dependence of nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD magnitude on the prestimulus cc-power would have been larger than the degree of dependence on the poststimulus cc-power. Our findings confirmed the dissociation between a sensory-related alpha-ERD maximally distributed over contralateral central electrodes, and a task-related alpha-ERD (possibly affected by motor-related activity), maximally distributed at posterior parietal and occipital electrodes. The cortical sources of these activities were estimated to be located at the level of sensorimotor and bilateral occipital cortices, respectively. Importantly, the time course of the alpha-ERD revealed that functional segregation emerged only at late latencies (400 to 750 ms) whereas topographic similarity was observed at earlier latencies (250 to 350 ms). Furthermore, the nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD magnitude was significantly more dependent on prestimulus than poststimulus cc-power. Altogether these findings provide direct evidence that the nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD reflects the summation of sensory-related and task-related cortical processes, and that prestimulus fluctuations can remarkably influence the non-phase-locked nociceptive alpha-ERD. Perspective: Present results extend the functional understanding of cc-oscillation suppression during pain perception and demonstrate the influence of prestimulus variability on this cortical phenomenon. This work has the potential to guide pain clinicians in a more accurate interpretation on physiological and psychological modulations of alpha-oscillations.

Much research has studied the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), or the brain's automatic response to rare changes in a series of repetitive auditory stimuli. But recent studies indicate that a visual homolog to this component of the event-related potential (ERP) can also be measured. While most visual mismatch response (vMMR) studies have focused on adult populations, few studies have investigated this response in healthy children, and little is known about the developmental nature of this phenomenon. We recorded EEG data in 22 healthy children (ages 812) and 20 healthy adults (ages 1842). Participants were presented with two types of task irrelevant background images of black and gray gratings while performing a visual target detection task. Spatial frequency of the background gratings was varied with 85% of the gratings being of high spatial frequency (HSF; i.e., standard background stimulus) and 15% of the images being of low spatial frequency (LSF; i.e., deviant background stimulus). Results in the adult group showed a robust mismatch response to deviant (non-target) background stimuli at around 150 ms post-stimulus at occipital electrode locations. In the children, two negativities around 150 and 230 ms post-stimulus at occipital electrode locations and a positivity around 250 ms post-stimulus at fronto-central electrode locations were observed. In addition, larger amplitudes of P1 and longer latencies of P1 and N1 to deviant background stimuli were observed in children vs. adults. These results suggest that processing of deviant stimuli presented outside the focus of attention in 812-year-old children differs from those in adults, and are in agreement with previous research. They also suggest that the vMMR may change across the lifespan in accordance with other components of the visual ERP.	[Cleary, Katherine M.; Donkers, Franc C.

Jon			Recording Visual Evoked Potentials and Auditory Evoked P300 at 9.4T Static Magnetic Field	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; NETWORKS	Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown a number of advantages that make this multimodal technique superior to fMRI alone. The feasibility of recording EEG at ultra-high static magnetic field up to 9.4T was recently demonstrated and promises to be implemented soon in fMRI studies at ultra high magnetic fields. Recording visual evoked potentials are expected to be amongst the most simple for simultaneous EEG/fMRI at ultra-high magnetic field due to the easy assessment of the visual cortex. Auditory evoked P300 measurements are of interest since it is believed that they represent the earliest stage of cognitive processing. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of recording visual evoked potentials and auditory evoked P300 in a 9.4T static magnetic field. For this purpose, EEG data were recorded from 26 healthy volunteers inside a 9.4T MR scanner using a 32-channel MR compatible EEG system. Visual stimulation and auditory oddball paradigm were presented in order to elicit evoked related potentials (ERP). Recordings made outside the scanner were performed using the same stimuli and EEG system for comparison purposes. We were able to retrieve visual P100 and auditory P300 evoked potentials at 9.4T static magnetic field after correction of the ballistocardiogram artefact using independent component analysis. The latencies of the ERPs recorded at 9.4T were not different from those recorded at 0T. The amplitudes of ERPs were higher at 9.4T when compared to recordings at 0T. Nevertheless, it seems that the increased amplitudes of the ERPs are due to the effect of the ultra-high field on the EEG recording system rather than alteration in the intrinsic processes that generate the electrophysiological responses.

This study used high-density ERPs to record participants' brain activity while they performed an insight task. Results showed that both insight solutions and incomprehension solutions elicited a more negative ERP deflection (N320 approximate to 550) than noninsight solutions in the time window of 320 approximate to 550 msec. Scalp ERPs and topographical maps revealed that the insight N320 approximate to 550 exhibited a relative RH dominance, whereas the incomprehension N320 approximate to 550 exhibited a relative midline dominance. Dipole source analysis showed that the generator of N320 approximate to 550 elicited by insight and incomprehension solutions was localized in the right middle frontal gyrus and the right parahippocampus gyrus, respectively. These distinct spatiotemporal patterns involved in insight processing and incomprehension processing suggest that the observed N320 approximate to 550 might reflect the processing of set-shift and the formation of novel associations. Moreover, the spatiotemporal pattern of brain activation associated with insight solutions supported the idea that the right hemispheric dominance theory of creative thinking also applies to creative insight.

However, a link between these systems has not yet been demonstrated in healthy humans, primarily because of data acquisition and analysis limitations. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while subjects performed auditory and visual oddball tasks and used these data to investigate the BOLD correlates of single-trial EEG variability at latencies spanning the trial. We focused on variability along task-relevant dimensions in the EEG for identical stimuli and then combined auditory and visual data at the subject level to spatially and temporally localize brain regions involved in endogenous attentional modulations. Specifically, we found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) correlates strongly with both early and late EEG components, whereas brainstem, right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), and right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) correlate significantly only with late components. By orthogonalizing with respect to event-related activity, we found that variability in insula and temporoparietal junction is reflected in reaction time variability, rOFC and brainstem correlate with residual EEG variability, and ACC and rMFG are significantly correlated with both. To investigate interactions between these correlates of temporally specific EEG variability, we performed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) on the fMRI data. We found strong evidence for reciprocal effective connections between the brainstem and cortical regions. Our results support the adaptive gain theory of locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) function and the proposed functional relationship between the LC-NE system, right-hemisphere ventral attention network, and P300 EEG response.

Modification of threat-processing in non-anxious individuals: A preliminary, behavioral and ERP study	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Attention bias; Anxiety; ERP; Attention bias modification	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY DISORDER; PLASTICITY; REACTIVITY	Background and objectives: Previous research suggests that attention bias toward threat contributes to the development and maintenance of anxiety. The current study extends this work by mapping the neural correlates of experimentally-induced changes in attention bias. The study examines both behavioral and psychophysiological changes associated with experimentally-induced changes in threat bias. Methods: Thirty-four non-anxious female adults were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: training attention toward threat or placebo control. Attention bias was assessed and trained via a modified dot-probe task. Participants completed pre- and post-training assessments of attention bias and stress reactivity. As well, EEG was collected during pre- and post-test assessment of attention bias using the dot-probe task. Results: Training induced significant changes in attention bias, though findings were complicated by group differences in baseline threat-bias scores. Compared to controls, those in the training group showed greater depression vulnerability to a post-training stressor and increased P2 amplitude, an ERP component associated with attention toward threat, during the dot-probe task. Limitations: Although participants were randomly assigned to groups, there were still group differences in pre-training bias scores. Also, while the use of a stress task before the initial assessment of attention bias was used to control for initial differences in stress vulnerability, this may have altered pre-bias scores since participants completed this task immediately after being stressed. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate training-induced changes in behavior and neural response patterns relevant to work on attention bias modification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Meltzer, JA; Braun, AR				Meltzer, Jed A.; Braun, Allen R.			P600-like positivity and left anterior negativity responses are elicited by semantic reversibility in nonanomalous sentences	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Syntax; EEG; Language; ERP; N400; LAN; Working memory; Reanalysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; ANIMACY; WORDS; INFORMATION; COMPLEXITY; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS	ERPs are commonly elicited by semantic and syntactic violations in sentences, leading to proposals that they reflect neural activity underlying ordinary language comprehension. We examined ERPs in an auditory sentence-picture-matching task, using nonanomalous sentences that were either semantically reversible, (boy pushes girl) or irreversible, (boy eats apple). Timelocked to the end of the critical clause, which occurred in the middle of a longer sentence, we observed an enhanced central-posterior positivity in response to the reversible sentences. The topography of this response is consistent with the P600 potential reported in studies of syntactic anomalies and other manipulations related to sentence structure. Following the end of the sentence, during a memory delay period prior to picture onset, reversible sentences also evoked a protracted anterior negativity, predominantly on the left. This negativity was stronger for sentences containing relative clauses compared to simple active sentences, but did not differ between object-embedded and the less complex subject-embedded clauses. The observation of a P600 occurring selectively in reversible sentences supports the interpretation of that potential as reflecting the syntactic processing of thematic relationships, as irreversible sentences contained alternative cues for thematic roles. The left anterior negativity likely reflects later processes of rehearsal and reanalysis of sentence content in working memory. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The alignment of segments is needed in order to extract event related waves hidden in the background EEG activity. Commonly, the information on onsets is provided by the acquisition system. However, wrong configuration of the recording system or human errors during the acquisition or storage of data may make this information unavailable. Usually, these errors are discovered during the datasets analysis stage, and this stage can take place even several months after the acquisition of datasets. Unluckily, changes on patients status and the expensiveness of EEG registrations make unfeasible to repeat the acquisitions. In this paper we present and evaluate two mechanisms that we included in an EEGLAB plugin for the automatic reconstruction of onsets in EEG-TMS recordings. The methods of the TMS Triggers Reconstruction Software (TRS-TMS) plugin are discussed and evaluated obtaining guidelines for their correct configuration in the routine usage.

We placed the 4 channel-based EEG electrodes. In addition, we tried to analyze fMRI data of one trial for each stimulus to improve the EEG drawbacks. As a result of EEG-fMRI data analysis, we confirmed that the odorant (citralva) occurred to decrease the average relative power (ARP) values of alpha, beta and gamma bands when compared with the stable and rest sessions and the odorant (2-mercaptoethanol) occurred to increase the ARP values of alpha, beta and gamma bands. fMRI data on citralva and 2-mercaptoethanol stimuli showed that the particular brain area was deactivated in citralva stimuli and activated in 2-mercaptoethanol. It showed that meaningful EEG signals can be measured with just a few electrodes.

ERPs were elicited by a simple reaction time task (SRT), a Go/NoGo task, and a Stroop-like task (CST). The cognitive conflict was thus manipulated in order to probe the degree to which information processing is shared across cognitive systems. We proposed to dissociate inhibition and interference conflict effects on brain activity by using identical Stroop-like congruent/incongruent stimuli in all three task contexts and while varying the response required. NoGo-incongruent trials showed a larger N2 and enhanced activations of rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and pre-supplementary motor area, whereas Go-congruent trials showed a larger P3 and increased parietal activations. Congruent and incongruent conditions of the CST task also elicited similar N2, P3 and late negativity (LN) ERPs, though CST-incongruent trials revealed a larger LN and enhanced prefrontal and ACC activations. Considering the stimulus probability and experimental manipulation of our study, current findings suggest that NoGo N2 and frontal NoGo P3 appear to be more associated to response inhibition rather than a specific conflict monitoring, whereas occipito-parietal P3 of Go and CST conditions may be more linked to a planned response competition between the prepared and required response. LN, however, appears to be related to higher level conflict monitoring associated with response choice-discrimination but not when the presence of cognitive conflict is associated with response inhibition.

Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual 'addiction'. This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control, high-frequency sexual behavior, consequences due to those behaviors, and poor ability to reduce those behaviors. However, such symptoms also may be better understood as a non-pathological variation of high sexual desire. Hypersexuals are thought to be relatively sexual reward sensitized, but also to have high exposure to visual sexual stimuli. Thus, the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear. If these individuals exhibit habituation, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished; if they merely have high sexual desire, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased. Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms. Methods: Fifty-two (13 female) individuals who self-identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional (pleasant sexual, pleasant-non-sexual, neutral, and unpleasant) photographs while electroencephalography was collected. Results: Larger P300 amplitude differences to pleasant sexual stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, was negatively related to measures of sexual desire, but not related to measures of hypersexuality. Conclusion: Implications for understanding hypersexuality as high desire, rather than disordered, are discussed.

We measured ERPs when subjects perform an auditory oddball task under daytime exposures to short-and middle-wavelength lights. In the oddball task, a standard tone of 1 kHz and a target tone of 2 kHz were used. Subjects were instructed to press a button as soon as they heard the target tone. The ERP component that occurs approximately 300 ms after a stimulus onset (P300) was analyzed. The results showed that amplitude of P300 in the short-wavelength light condition was significantly larger than that in the middle-wavelength light condition approximately 1020 min after the start of light exposure. It has been suggested that the amplitude of P300 reflects the amount of attentional resources for a given task. Therefore, the results obtained suggest that amount of attentional resource allocated to the oddball task is increased during exposure to the short-wavelength light in the daytime.

Significant differences were observed in the time window where the P1-NI-P2 complex for /a/ is expected. This difference may be due to the absence/presence of the Auditory Change Complex (ACC) elicited by /s/. Furthermore, by combining the P1-N1-P2 complex elicited by each component of /asu/ (/a//s//u/) recorded individually, it was possible to compose ERPs similar to those elicited by /asu/. Interestingly, the optimized weights of /s/ were significantly lower for Japanese than for native-English listeners, suggesting that the trace of the ACC associated with /s/ was less visible in the actual ERP response to /asu/ for Japanese native listeners. These results may together suggest that Japanese and English native individuals process the /s/ in /asu/ differently and that the ACC is sensitive to language-specific perceptual categories.

Scalp EEG-Based Discrimination of Cognitive Deficits After Traumatic Brain Injury Using Event-Related Tsallis Entropy Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomedical signal processing; EEG; medical diagnosis; traumatic brain injury (TBI)	BIOPHYSICAL LINKAGE; ATTENTION; INDEX; TIME; TBI; MRI	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children and adolescents in the U. S. This is a pilot study, which explores the discrimination of chronic TBI from normal controls using scalp EEG during a memory task. Tsallis entropies are computed for responses during an old-new memory recognition task. A support vector machinemodel is constructed to discriminate between normal andmoderate/severe TBI individuals using Tsallis entropies as features. Numerical analyses of 30 records (15 normal and 15 TBI) show amaximum discrimination accuracy of 93% (p-value = 7.8557E-5) using four features. These results suggest the potential of scalp EEG as an efficacious method for noninvasive diagnosis of TBI.

Dissociating Stimulus-Set and Response-Set in the Context of Task-Set Switching	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						task-set; cognitive control; task-switching; ERP; EEG	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT; COMPONENTS; COSTS	The primary aim of the present research was to determine how stimulus-set and response-set components of task-set contribute to switch costs and conflict processing. Three experiments are described wherein participants completed an explicitly cued task-switching procedure. Experiment 1 established that task switches requiring a reconfiguration of both stimulus- and response-set incurred larger residual switch costs than task switches requiring the reconfiguration of stimulus-set alone. Between-task interference was also drastically reduced for response-set conflict compared with stimulus-set conflict. A second experiment replicated these findings and demonstrated that stimulus- and response-conflict have dissociable effects on the "decision time" and "motor time" components of total response time. Finally, a third experiment replicated Experiment 2 and demonstrated that the stimulus- and response- components of task switching and conflict processing elicit dissociable neural activity as evidence by event-related brain potentials.

Clinical evaluation is of limited value in the assessment of patients with traumatic brain injury and is often inaccurate in determining the extent of brain damage. Neurophysiological techniques and neuroimaging can provide valuable prognostic information and are useful in monitoring for seizures and other causes of secondary brain damage and in tracking the effects of therapy. More recently, cognitive electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that many patients clinically deemed to be in vegetative or in minimally conscious states are, in fact, aware. This opens new frontiers for further research into establishing communication with otherwise unresponsive patients.

Participants memorized one or four letters and then responded to memory-matching letters presented in a relevant color while ignoring distractor letters or letters in an irrelevant color. Stimuli in the relevant color elicited larger frontal selection positivities (FSP) and occipital selection negativities (OSN) compared to irrelevant color stimuli. Only distractors elicited a larger FSP in the high than in the low memory load task. Memory load prolonged the OSN for all letters. Response mapping complexity was also modulated but did not affect the FSP and OSN. Together, the FSP data suggest that high memory load increased distractability. The OSN data suggest that memory load sustained attention to letters in a relevant color until working memory processing was completed, independently of whether the letters were in working memory or not.

Event-related oscillations might be used for detection of cognitive deficits. Our group's earlier results showed diminished delta visual and auditory target oscillatory responses in AD, and we investigated whether this prevails for MCI. Eighteen MCI subjects and 18 age-matched healthy elderly controls were investigated. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes of oscillatory responses for each subject's averaged oscillatory target responses in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands upon application of visual oddball paradigm were measured. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze four locations (frontal, central, parietal, occipital), at three coronal (left, midline, right) sites. Independent t tests were applied for post-hoc analyses. The oddball target delta response (0.5-3.0 Hz) was 26-32% lower in MCI than healthy controls over fronto-central-parietal regions [F(1.34) = 4.562, p = 0.04]. Without a group effect, theta oscillatory responses (4-7 Hz) showed significant differences in coronal electrodes indicating highest values over mid-electrode sites, and a anteriorposterior x coronal effect, being maximum at mid-central. Alpha frequency band analyses indicated no statistical differences. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of visual target delta oscillatory responses were lower in fronto-central-parietal regions in MCI than in healthy controls. This supports our earlier findings in AD, showing hypoactive delta fronto-central-parietal regions during cognitive tasks. These results indicate that event-related oscillations may detect early changes of brain dynamics in MCI, and deserves to be investigated as a candidate biomarker in further studies using multimodal techniques.

Sequential processing in the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task: A temporal PCA study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; Equiprobable Go/NoGo paradigm; Principal Components Analysis (PCA)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ERP RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; WAVE	The unwarned auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task provides a convenient means to assess differential processing, although our interpretations remain limited by the lack of research regarding the range of elicited components and their functional significance. We examined sequential processing in this paradigm, presenting 24 participants with a total of 300 trials in two blocks. EEG was recorded from 19 channels, and the Go and NoGo event-related potentials were decomposed using temporal Principal Components Analysis. Of the 218 unrestricted Varimax-rotated factors, seven were identifiable as components based on their latency, polarity, and topography: early N1, Processing Negativity (PN), and P2 components were followed by N2, P3, the classic Slow Wave (SW), and a diffuse Late Positivity (LP). N1 was enhanced to Go, as was the defining temporal topography of PN. NoGo produced increased centroparietal P2, frontocentral N2, and P3a, in comparison to Go, which produced a more parietal N2 and P3b, and an enhanced SW. The LP was larger in NoGo. These results suggest that N1 marks the beginning of Go and NoGo differentiation. Complete Go/NoGo categorisation is marked by N2; this is followed by different processing chains leading to the NoGo non-response (marked by P3a) and Go response (marked by P3b and SW). The larger LP in NoGo marks the cortical inactivation following the earlier cessation of processing in this condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The participants matched the pictures of a blank Task without using mental rotation, but used mental rotation to match the pictures of Task A. The ERPs data were analyzed using spatial complexity analysis. The results showed: a) the rotation-related negativity of the ERPs data was shown when mental rotation was performed; b) the EEG data showed a significantly greater synchronization in the fast frequency bands (>20 Hz) when the participants used their mental rotation ability.

Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) we investigated the temporal course of word translation. Participants translated words from and to their first (L1, Dutch) and second (L2, English) language while ERPs were recorded. Interlingual homographs (IHs) were included to introduce language conflict. IHs share orthographic form but have different meanings in L1 and L2 (e.g., room in Dutch refers to cream). Results showed that the brain distinguished between translation directions as early as 200 ms after word presentation: the P2 amplitudes were more positive in the L1L2 translation direction. The N400 was also modulated by translation direction, with more negative amplitudes in the L2L1 translation direction. Furthermore, the IHs were translated more slowly, induced more errors, and elicited more negative N400 amplitudes than control words. In a naming experiment, participants read aloud the same words in L1 or L2 while ERPs were recorded. Results showed no effect of either IHs or language, suggesting that task schemas may be crucially related to language control in translation. Furthermore, translation appears to involve conceptual processing in both translation directions, and the task goal appears to influence how words are processed.

In this paper, we hypothesized PCA decomposition could be used to diminish the background activity and further improve the performance of connectivity analysis in event related experiments. The idea was tested using simulation, where we found that for the 306-channel Elekta Neuromag system, the first 4 PCs represent the dominant background activity, and the source connectivity pattern after preprocessing is consistent with the true connectivity pattern designed in the simulation. Improving signal to noise of the evoked responses by discarding the first few PCs demonstrates increased coherences at major physiological frequency bands when removing the first few PCs. Furthermore, the evoked information was maintained after PCA preprocessing. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that the first few PCs represent background activity, and PCA decomposition can be employed to remove it to expose the evoked activity for the channels under investigation. Therefore, PCA can be applied as a preprocessing approach to improve neuronal connectivity analysis for event related data.

Some researchers propose that practice speeds up the rate of a general-purpose rotation algorithm. Others maintain that performance improvements arise through the adoption of a new cognitive strategyrepeated exposure leads to rapid retrieval from memory of the required response to familiar mental rotation stimuli. In two experiments we provide support for an integrated explanation of practice effects in mental rotation by combining behavioral and EEG measures in a way that provides more rigorous inference than is available from either measure alone. Before practice, participants displayed two well-established signatures of mental rotation: Both response time and EEG negativity increased linearly with rotation angle. After extensive practice with a small set of stimuli, both signatures of mental rotation had all but disappeared. In contrast, after the same amount of practice with a much larger set both signatures remained, even though performance improved markedly. Taken together, these results constitute a reversed association, which cannot arise from variation in a single cause, and so they provide compelling evidence for the existence of two routes to expertise in mental rotation. We also found novel evidence that practice with the large but not the small stimulus set increased the magnitude of an early visual evoked potential, suggesting increased rotation speed is enabled by improved efficiency in extracting three-dimensional information from two-dimensional stimuli.

Delta BROs have been linked with continuous gathering of information from the surrounding environment, which is classically attributed to the precuneus. Furthermore, fMRI studies have shown that precuneal activity is reduced or missing when consciousness is low or absent. We therefore hypothesized that the source of delta BROs in healthy subjects could be located in the precuneus and that delta BROs could be absent or reduced in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). To test these hypotheses, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at rest was recorded in 12 healthy controls and nine patients with DOC (four vegetative states, and five minimally conscious states). Three-second-lasting EEG epochs centred on each blink instance were analyzed in both time- (BROs) and frequency domains (event-related spectral perturbation or ERSP and intertrial coherence or ITC). Cortical sources of the maximum blink-related delta power, corresponding to the positive peak of the delta BROs, were estimated by standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography. In control subjects, as expected, the source of delta BROs was located in the precuneus, whereas in DOC patients, delta BROs were not recognizable and no precuneal localization was possible. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between spectral indexes and levels of cognitive functioning in all subjects participating in the study. This reinforces the hypothesis that delta BROs reflect neural processes linked with awareness of the self and of the environment. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2178-2189, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The proposed technique is based on gradient based adaptive algorithms such as Least Mean Square (LMS), Normalised Least Mean Square (N-LMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithms and an evolutionary algorithm like particle swarm optimisation (PSO) technique. Descendent structure is made through three adaptive noise cancellers for the removal of line noise, ECG and EOG artefacts. When compared, the adaptive noise canceller technique based on PSO performs better than all gradient based approaches. Several examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the quality, for better and correct interpretation of EEG.

Oscillation analyses conducted on the Think/No-Think (TNT) task and volitional suppression of retrieval are of interest to broaden our knowledge of neural oscillations associated not only during successful memory retrieval but also when retrieval is unwanted or suppressed. In the current study, we measured EEG during a TNT task and performed ERP and EEG spectral power band analyses. ERP results replicated other researchers' observations of increases in 500-800 msec parietal effects for items where retrieval was instructed to be elaborated compared with being suppressed. Furthermore, EEG analyses indicated increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (3-8 Hz) oscillations across parietal electrodes for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus those to be elaborated. Additionally, during the second half of the experiment (after repeated attempts at control), increases in theta oscillations were found across both frontal and parietal electrodes for items that were instructed to be suppressed and that were ultimately forgotten versus those ultimately remembered. Increased alpha power for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus elaborated may indicate reductions of retrieval attempts or lack of retrieval success. Increased theta power for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus elaborated may indicate increased or prolonged cognitive control to monitor retrieval events.

Application of SVM-RFE on EEG signals for detecting the most relevant scalp regions linked to affective valence processing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Affective valence; Brain oscillations; EEG; Feature extraction; Morlet wavelet; SVM-RFE	CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; STIMULI; EMOTION	In this work, event related potentials (ERPs) induced by visual stimuli categorized with different value of affective valence are studied. EEG signals are recorded during visualization of selected pictures belonging to International Affective Picture System (IAPS). A Morlet wavelet filter is used to transform the EEG input space to a topography-time-frequency feature space. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is applied for detecting scalp spectral dynamics of interest (SSDOIs) in this feature space, allowing to identify the most relevant time intervals, frequency bands and EEG channels. This feature selection method has proven to outperform the classical t-test in the discrimination of brain cortex regions involved in affective valence processing. Furthermore, the presented combination of feature extraction and selection techniques can be applied as an alternative in other different clinical applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Auditory click stimuli evoke event-related potentials in the visual cortex	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						event-related potential; electroencephalography; electrocorticography; visual cortex; auditory cortex; audio-visual network; click	MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; PROJECTIONS	The objective of this study was to determine whether unimodal auditory stimuli evoke event-related potentials (ERPs) in brain areas normally designated as the visual cortex (VC). The topographical distribution of ERPs evoked by auditory click stimuli was measured from (a) electroencephalographic electrodes on the scalp of six neurologically normal adult human participants and (b) intracranial electrodes implanted on the cortex of one epileptic adult human participant. In all participants, unimodal click stimuli evoked ERPs over both the auditory cortex (AC) and the VC. Relative amplitudes of ERPs at different scalp electrodes did not support the idea that the ERPs over VC were volume-conducted versions of those over AC, and intracranial records confirmed the origin of some click-evoked ERPs in both V1 and other regions of VC. We conclude that unimodal auditory stimuli can evoke ERPs in VC. This finding adds to the earlier evidence for the effect of visual stimuli on AC by providing new evidence for bidirectional functional connectivity in the audio-visual network of the human brain. The implication is that not only do visual stimuli affect hearing; auditory stimuli also affect visual perception.

J	Schneider, D; Wascher, E				Schneider, Daniel; Wascher, Edmund			Mechanisms of target localization in visual change detection: An interplay of gating and filtering	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Selective attention; Change detection; N1; N2pc; ERP	NEURAL MECHANISMS; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION; COMPETITION; DISTRACTOR; POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; SEARCH; N2PC	Localizing visual information requires drawing on retinotopic activation maps located in visual cortex that are modulated both by stimulus saliency and a top-down bias toward relevant inputs. The present study investigated the role of this spatial stimulus representation for target localization by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In different blocks, participants were instructed to localize a luminance change or simply detect its presence in a fast sequence further containing a randomly occurring orientation change distractor. Both in the localization and detection task, the lowest behavioral performances were shown when target and distractor were presented contralateral to each other (spatial conflict condition). On ERP level, higher posterior asymmetries in favor of the relevant luminance change in the N1 and N2 time windows were observed for the localization compared to the detection task and suggested an increased top-down bias on spatial target representation in visual areas when the response to a relevant stimulus had a spatial component. The increased top-down bias included both a stronger gating of relevant information in the N1 time window for unilateral feature changes and a subsequent increased filtering process with an onset that was delayed as a function of the distraction caused by irrelevant signals in the display. These mechanisms were impaired when participants failed to localize the luminance change, indicating that the top-down amplification of spatial target representation in visual areas relative to the irrelevant surrounding is a substantial component of localizing visual feature changes.

Emotional sounds modulate early neural processing of emotional pictures	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						emotional pictures; emotional sounds; audiovisual stimuli; ERPs; P100; P200; LPP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; COMBINED PERCEPTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION; VOICE; ERP; STIMULI	In our natural environment, emotional information is conveyed by converging visual and auditory information; multimodal integration is of utmost importance. In the laboratory, however, emotion researchers have mostly focused on the examination of unimodal stimuli. Few existing studies on multimodal emotion processing have focused on human communication such as the integration of facial and vocal expressions. Extending the concept of multimodality, the current study examines how the neural processing of emotional pictures is influenced by simultaneously presented sounds. Twenty pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures of complex scenes were presented to 22 healthy participants. On the critical trials these pictures were paired with pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sounds. Sound presentation started 500 ms before picture onset and each stimulus presentation lasted for 2 s. EEG was recorded from 64 channels and ERP analyses focused on the picture onset. In addition, valence and arousal ratings were obtained. Previous findings for the neural processing of emotional pictures were replicated. Specifically, unpleasant compared to neutral pictures were associated with an increased parietal P200 and a more pronounced centroparietal late positive potential (LPP), independent of the accompanying sound valence. For audiovisual stimulation, increased parietal P100 and P200 were found in response to all pictures which were accompanied by unpleasant or pleasant sounds compared to pictures with neutral sounds. Most importantly, incongruent audiovisual pairs of unpleasant pictures and pleasant sounds enhanced parietal P100 and P200 compared to pairings with congruent sounds. Taken together, the present findings indicate that emotional sounds modulate early stages of visual processing and, therefore, provide an avenue by which multimodal experience may enhance perception.

To do so, we tested non-professional typers in a picture typing task while continuously recording EEG. Participants were instructed to write (by means of a standard keyboard) the corresponding name for a given picture. The lexical frequency of the words was manipulated: half of the picture names were of high-frequency while the remaining were of low-frequency. Different measures were obtained: (1) first keystroke latency and (2) keystroke latency of the subsequent letters and duration of the word. Moreover, ERPs locked to the onset of the picture presentation were analyzed to explore the temporal course of word frequency in typewriting. The results showed an effect of word frequency for the first keystroke latency but not for the duration of the word or the speed to which letter were typed (interstroke intervals). The electrophysiological results showed the expected ERP frequency effect at posterior sites: amplitudes for low-frequency words were more positive than those for high-frequency words. However, relative to previous evidence in the spoken modality, the frequency effect appeared in a later time-window. These results demonstrate two marked differences in the processing dynamics underpinning typing compared to speaking: First, central processing dynamics between speaking and typing differ already in the manner that words are accessed; second, central processing differences in typing, unlike speaking, do not cascade to peripheral processes involved in response execution.

A P300-based BCI speller system is based upon visual Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in response to stimulation, as derived from EEG, and is used to type on a computer screen. The Row-Column speller Paradigm (RCP), utilizing a 6-by-6 character matrix, has been a widely-used successful P300 speller, despite inherent problems of adjacency, crowding, and fatigue. RCP is compared here with a new P300 speller interface, the Zigzag Paradigm (ZP). In the ZP interface every second row of the 6-by-6 character matrix is off set to the right by d/2 cm, where d cm is the horizontal distance between two adjacent characters. This shifting addressed the adjacency problem by removing all vertical adjacent characters and increasing the distance between most adjacent characters. This shifting also addressed the crowding problem, for most characters, by reducing the number of other characters surrounding a character; critically the target character. A user study upon neurologically-normal individuals revealed significant improvements in online classification performance with the ZP, as supported the view that ZP effectively addressed adjacency and crowding problems. Subjective ratings also revealed that the ZP was more comfortable and caused less fatigue. Theoretical and practical implications of the applicability of the ZP for patients with neuromuscular diseases are discussed.

The brain wave responses of participants in choosing correct and incorrect answers on English reading tests were studied. Three English reading tests at differing levels of difficulty were used in the experiment and twelve participants (non-native English learners), six males and six females whose ages ranged from 20 to 24, voluntarily participated in the experiment. Experimental results were analyzed by independent t-tests on the EEG potentials of participants having different levels of English proficiency. A significant difference was observed at the frontal lobe under differing conditions. Subjects who chose incorrect answers on the tests elicited a higher N600, a finding similar to that of previous literature. In addition, an interesting result was found: for males, the significant area was located in the right hemisphere, whereas for females, it was in the left hemisphere. This seems to imply that males and females employ different areas of the brain to comprehend the meaning of difficult statements.	[Tian, Y. J.; Tai, Y. H.; Kuo, T. H.; Sun, K.

Bayesian Approach to Dynamically Controlling Data Collection in P300 Spellers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; dynamic stopping; P300 speller	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB; DETERMINANTS; POTENTIALS; LATENCY; SIZE; TASK	P300 spellers provide a noninvasive method of communication for people who may not be able to use other communication aids due to severe neuromuscular disabilities. However, P300 spellers rely on event-related potentials (ERPs) which often have low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In order to improve detection of the ERPs, P300 spellers typically collect multiple measurements of the electroencephalography (EEG) response for each character. The amount of collected data can affect both the accuracy and the communication rate of the speller system. The goal of the present study was to develop an algorithm that would automatically determine the necessary amount of data to collect during operation. Dynamic data collection was controlled by a threshold on the probabilities that each possible character was the target character, and these probabilities were continually updated with each additional measurement. This Bayesian technique differs from other dynamic data collection techniques by relying on a participant-independent, probability-based metric as the stopping criterion. The accuracy and communication rate for dynamic and static data collection in P300 spellers were compared for 26 users. Dynamic data collection resulted in a significant increase in accuracy and communication rate.

This is based on the work of Simson et al. (1977b), the scalp topography of potentials in auditory and visual Go/NoGo tasks. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 43,864-875, which compared Go and NoGo topography after CNV was subtracted from NoGo trials only. Specifically, the NoGo P3 topography showed the distinctive frontocentral maximum, which is often linked to motor inhibition, when referenced to a pre-target baseline. This NoGo topography changed to a more parietal maximum, similar to that on Go trials, when referenced to a pre-cue baseline. Many researchers have cited this study, while failing to use the delayed response design on which Simson et al. based their argument. We attempted to replicate Simson et al.'s experiment with delayed responses and also with immediate responses, as are more often used. As expected, the amplitudes of CNV and P3 to both Go and NoGo trials were increased when immediate compared to delayed responses were required, but we failed to replicate the topographic shift of NoGo P3 with different baselines for both delayed and immediate responses. That is, subtraction of the CNV from NoGo P3 did not change the distinctive frontocentral topography of this component. The results suggest that CNV may affect the amplitude and measurement of the NoGo P3, but that NoGo P3 anteriorisation is not caused by CNV resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies of the neurophysiological effects of healthy aging on sensory processing have attributed changes in auditory evoked responses to reduced inhibition from frontocortical areas on primary auditory processing or to a global slowing of neural responses. We investigated whether the age-related changes in visual evoked potentials can be primarily accounted for by similar deficits in frontocortical inhibition or processing speed. Using evoked potentials, we examined the primary visual processing of younger (mean age, 20.0 years) and older (mean age, 76.8 years) adults in a visual oddball paradigm. We found that the pattern of early visual responses cannot be explained via reduced frontocortical inhibition or a reduction in speed of visual processing. Rather our results point toward the existence of a robust compensatory neural response to impoverished sensory input in aging. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG correlates of self-referential processing	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						self-referential processing; default mode network; EEG; ERP; oscillations	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; INTERNAL CONSISTENCY RELIABILITY; SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; OWN-NAME; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS	Self-referential processing has been principally investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, understanding of the brain functioning is not possible without careful comparison of the evidence coming from different methodological domains. This paper aims to review electroencephalographic (EEG) studies of self-referential processing and to evaluate how they correspond, complement, or contradict the existing fMRI evidence. There are potentially two approaches to the study of EEG correlates of self-referential processing. Firstly, because simultaneous registration of EEG and fMRI has become possible, the degree of overlap between these two signals in brain regions related to self-referential processing could be determined. Second and more direct approach would be the study of EEG correlates of self-referential processing per se. In this review, I discuss studies, which employed both these approaches and show that in line with fMRI evidence, EEG correlates of self-referential processing are most frequently found in brain regions overlapping with the default network, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. In the time domain, the discrimination of self-and others-related information is mostly associated with the P300 ERP component, but sometimes is observed even earlier. In the frequency domain, different frequency oscillations have been shown to contribute to self-referential processing, with spontaneous self-referential mentation being mostly associated with the alpha frequency band.

These task switch costs (TSC) reflect processes of switching between control settings for different tasks. Thepresentstudyinvestigatedwhethertasksetsoperateasasingle, integrated representation or as an agglomeration of relatively independent components. In a cued task switch paradigm, target detection (present/absent) and discrimination (blue/green/right-/left-tilted) tasks alternated randomly across trials. The target was either a color or an orientation singleton among homogeneous distractors. Across two trials, the task and target-defining dimension repeated or changed randomly. For task switch trials, agglomerated task set spredicta difference between dimension changes and repetitions: joint task and dimension switches require full tasks etre configuration, while dimension repetitions permitre using some control settings from the previous trial. By contrast, integrated task sets always require full switches, predicting dimension repetition effects(DREs) to be absent across task switches. RT analyses showed significant DRE sacross task switches as well as repetitions supporting the notion of agglomerated task sets. Additionally, two event related potentials( ERP) were analyzed: the Posterior-Contralateral- Negativity (PCN) indexing spatial selection dynamics, and the Sustained-Posterior-Contralateral-Negativity (SPCN) indexing post-selective perceptual/semantic analysis. Significant DREs across task switches were observed for both the PCN and SPCN components. Together, DREs across task switches for RTs and two functionally distinct ERP components suggest that reusing control settings across different tasks is possible. The results thus support the" agglomerated-task-set" hypothesis, and are inconsistent with" integrated task sets."

The present study investigates whether impaired ART-sensitivity at a pre-reading age precedes and predicts later emerging reading problems in a sample of Dutch children. An oddball paradigm, with a deviant that differed from the standard stimulus in ART, was administered to 41-month-old children (30 genetically at-risk for developmental dyslexia and 14 controls) with concurrent EEG measurement. A second deviant that differed from the standard stimulus in frequency served as a control deviant. Grade two reading scores were used to divide the at-risks in a typical-reading and a dyslexic subgroup. We found that both ART- and frequency processing were related to later reading skill. We however also found that irrespective of reading level, the at-risks in general showed impaired basic auditory processing when compared to controls and that it was impossible to discriminate between the at-risk groups on basis of both auditory measures. A relatively higher quality of early expressive syntactic skills in the typical-reading at-risk group might indicate a protective factor against negative effects of impaired auditory processing on reading development. Based on these results we argue that ART- and frequency-processing measures, although they are related to reading skill, lack the power to be considered single-cause predictors of developmental dyslexia. More likely, they are genetically driven risk factors that may add to cumulative effects on processes that are critical for learning to read. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The modeling is based upon a flexible simulation tool, which enables parametric specification of the underlying neurophysiologic characteristics. While the impact of selecting specific parameters is of interest, in this work we focus on the insights, which emerge from rather accepted assumptions regarding neuronal representation. We show that harnessing of even such simple assumptions enables the derivation of significant insights regarding the nature of the neurophysiologic processes underlying behavior. We demonstrate our approach in some detail by modeling the behavioral go/no-go task. We further demonstrate the practical significance of this simplified modeling approach in interpreting experimental data - the manifestation of these processes in the EEG and ERP literature of normal and abnormal (ADHD) function, as well as with comprehensive relevant ERP data analysis. In-fact we show that from the model-based spatiotemporal segregation of the processes, it is possible to derive simple and yet effective and theory-based EEG markers differentiating normal and ADHD subjects. We summarize by claiming that the neurophysiologic processes modeled for the go/no-go task are part of a limited set of neurophysiologic processes which underlie, in a variety of combinations, any behavioral function with measurable operational definition. Such neurophysiologic processes could be sampled directly from EEG on the basis of model-based spatiotemporal segregation.

The EEG patterns of event-related desynchronization/synchronization are studied during the human perception of sound stimuli, which was given by scraping a sharp knife along the surface of a ridged metal bottle sound. This evaluation was conducted with the purpose of search the correlating EEG signals with emotional state caused by unpleasant stimuli and their influence of brain-computer-interface commands, as motor imagery commands, in order to increase the efficiency of this kind of human-machine-interface performance. It was observed that waveforms in mu and beta frequency bands of Fp1 and Fp2 channels present variations that could been caused by neural activity due to the unpleasant sound stimuli.

It was determined that subjects solved nonverbal tasks faster and more effectively with their left hands, while they used two strategies of recognition to solve verbal tasks (fast reactions with right and left hand). Analysis of spectral characteristics of EEG revealed that mechanisms of both anterior and posterior attention systems were simultaneously involved in the process of effective recognition of nonverbal stimuli and ineffective recognition of verbal stimuli. Analysis of the event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that ineffective recognition of verbal and nonverbal stimuli resulted in an increase in the amplitude of sensory components of ERPs (N1m, P1m), while effective recognition increased the amplitude of cognitive components of ERPs (P2m, P3m).

Left temporal alpha-band activity reflects single word intelligibility	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech intelligibility; degraded speech; noise-vocoding; alpha oscillations; left inferior temporal cortex		The electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of degraded speech perception have been explored in a number of recent studies. However, such investigations have often been inconclusive as to whether observed differences in brain responses between conditions result from different acoustic properties of more or less intelligible stimuli or whether they relate to cognitive processes implicated in comprehending challenging stimuli. In this study we used noise vocoding to spectrally degrade monosyllabic words in order to manipulate their intelligibility. We used spectral rotation to generate incomprehensible control conditions matched in terms of spectral detail. We recorded EEG from 14 volunteers who listened to a series of noise vocoded (NV) and noise-vocoded spectrally rotated (rNV) words, while they carried out a detection task. We specifically sought components of the EEG response that showed an interaction between spectral rotation and spectral degradation. This reflects those aspects of the brain electrical response that are related to the intelligibility of acoustically degraded monosyllabic words, while controlling for spectral detail. An interaction between spectral complexity and rotation was apparent in both evoked and induced activity. Analyses of event-related potentials showed an interaction effect for a P300-like component at several centro-parietal electrodes. Time frequency analysis of the EEG signal in the alpha-band revealed a monotonic increase in event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the NV but not the rNV stimuli in the alpha band at a left temporo-central electrode cluster from 420-560 ms reflecting a direct relationship between the strength of alpha-band ERD and intelligibility. By matching NV words with their incomprehensible rNV homologues, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of evoked and induced processes involved in degraded speech perception, largely uncontaminated by purely acoustic effects.

In this article, we focus on electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography findings in patients with schizophrenia. Auditory-P50, -N100, and -P300 findings, visual-P100, -N170, and -N400 findings, and neural oscillations in patients with schizophrenia are overviewed. Published results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have neurophysiological deficits from the very early phase of sensory processing (i.e. P50, P100, N100) to the relatively late phase (i.e. P300, N400) in both auditory and visual perception. Exploring the associations between neural substrates, including neurotransmitter systems, and neurophysiological findings, will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

For this purpose 19-channel EEG was recorded during a cued visual Go/NoGo task. First, spatial filters of the two independent components (ICs) were obtained by application of ICA to ERPs of 102 healthy adults. Second, in 26 individuals, ERPs were recorded from the same task a second time 6-18 months after the first recording. Statistical analyses were performed on both the P3 NoGo waves and the activation curves of the two ICs from both recordings. Amplitude and latency were estimated by "peak" and "fractional area" (FA) methods for both the P3 NoGo wave and ICs. Intraclass correlations (ICC) for latency were excellent (ICC > .90) for both the P3 NoGo wave and the two ICs when measured with the FA method, and good (ICC > .75) for amplitude measured by both methods (FA or peak). We conclude that the long-term stability of P3 NoGo wave and the two IC makes them well suited for reliable assessment of cognitive control function in research and clinic. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

P300 amplitude reduction is associated with early-onset and late-onset pathological substance use in a prospectively studied cohort of 14-year-old adolescents	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Children/Infants; EEG/ERP; Individual differences	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; USE DISORDERS; EXTERNALIZING PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; BEHAVIORAL DISINHIBITION; ALCOHOL-USE; HIGH-RISK; DEPENDENCE; ENDOPHENOTYPE; COMMON; ABUSE	P3 amplitude reduction (P3AR) is associated with risk for adolescent-onset pathological substance use (PSU). In this longitudinal study, data from over 1,100 adolescent twins were used to examine P3AR in relation to early adolescent onset PSU (i.e., by age 14), late adolescent onset PSU (i.e., ages 14-18), misuse of different classes of substances (PSU-nicotine, PSU-alcohol, PSU-illicit), degree of PSU comorbidity, and gender differences. P3 amplitude was recorded at age 14 from two midline electrodes during a visual oddball paradigm. PSU was defined as meeting criteria for any symptom of a substance use disorder assessed using semistructured clinical interviews. P3AR was associated with degree of drug class comorbidity, early adolescent onset PSU for all three substance classes, and late adolescent onset PSU for alcohol and illicit PSU. Gender differences in P3AR were not statistically significant. These findings provide further evidence that P3AR indexes a nonspecific diathesis for adolescent-onset PSU.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of an experimental manipulation of response conflict on the amplitude of the P300 component during response inhibition, and examined whether individual differences in the amplitude of this P300 component would predict voluntary ad-lib alcohol consumption, in social drinkers. Using a repeated measures design, 16 participants performed a stop-signal task after receiving instructions that either emphasised or de-emphasised response conflict while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was concurrently recorded, before their ad-lib drinking was assessed. Results revealed that task instructions had the predicted effects on behavioural indices of response inhibition and the associated P300 components. Most importantly, individual differences in the amplitude of P300 subcomponents during response inhibition were negatively correlated with ad-lib alcohol consumption. Results provide the first experimental support for theoretical models that posit that reduced amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition is associated with alcohol-seeking behaviour in humans.

The present study investigates whether social exclusion also directly influences basic cognitive functions, specifically the ability to exert cognitive control. Participants were either excluded or included while playing an online game. To test whether exclusion altered cognitive control, we measured the electrophysiological responses to a Go/No Go task. In this task participants had to withhold a response (No Go) on a small number of trials while the predominant tendency was to make an overt (Go) response. Compared to Go trials the event-related potential evoked by No Go trials elicited an increased N2, reflecting the detection of the response conflict, followed by an increased P3, reflecting the inhibition of the predominant response. The N2 effect was larger for participants who had experienced exclusion, while the P3 effect was smaller. This indicates that exclusion leads to an increased ability to detect response conflicts, while at the same time exclusion decreases the neural processes that underlie the inhibition of unwanted behavior.

BCG appears in EEG signals recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The proposed method is a semiblind source extraction algorithm based on linear prediction technique. We define a cost function according to a joint short- and long-term prediction strategy to extract the BCG sources. We call this method SLTP-BSE standing for short-and long-term prediction blind source extraction. The objective of this work is to 1) model the temporal structure of the sources using short-term prediction and 2) impose the prior information about the BCG sources using long-term prediction. These two procedures are simultaneously implemented to optimize the system. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using both synthetic and real EEG data. The obtained results show that the proposed technique is able to remove the BCG artifact while preserving the task-related parts of the signal. The results of SLTP-BSE are compared with those of well-known BCG removal techniques confirming the superiority of the proposed method.

As a cue, auditory BCIs can deal with many of the characteristics of stimuli such as tone, pitch, and voices. Spatial information on auditory stimuli also provides useful information for a BCI. However, in a portable system, virtual auditory stimuli have to be presented spatially through earphones or headphones, instead of loudspeakers. We investigated the possibility of an auditory BCI using the out-of-head sound localization technique, which enables us to present virtual auditory stimuli to users from any direction, through earphones. The feasibility of a BCI using this technique was evaluated in an EEG oddball experiment and offline analysis. A virtual auditory stimulus was presented to the subject from one of six directions. Using a support vector machine, we were able to classify whether the subject attended the direction of a presented stimulus from EEG signals. The mean accuracy across subjects was 70.0% in the single-trial classification. When we used trial-averaged EEG signals as inputs to the classifier, the mean accuracy across seven subjects reached 89.5% (for 10-trial averaging). Further analysis showed that the P300 event-related potential responses from 200 to 500 ms in central and posterior regions of the brain contributed to the classification. In comparison with the results obtained from a loudspeaker experiment, we confirmed that stimulus presentation by out-of-head sound localization achieved similar event-related potential responses and classification performances. These results suggest that out-of-head sound localization enables us to provide a high-performance and loudspeaker-less portable BCI system.

An electrophysiological correlate of conflict processing in an auditory spatial Stroop task: The effect of individual differences in navigational style	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory; Spatial; Stroop; ERP; Navigation; Conflict	COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; INTERFERENCE; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; OVERLAP	Recent work has identified an event-related potential (ERP) component, the incongruency negativity (Ninc), which is sensitive to auditory Stroop conflict processing. Here, we investigated how this index of conflict processing is influenced by individual differences in cognitive style. There is evidence that individuals differ in the strategy they use to navigate through the environment; some use a predominantly verbal-egocentric strategy while others rely more heavily on a spatial-allocentric strategy. In addition, navigational strategy, assessed by a way-finding questionnaire, is predictive of performance on an auditory spatial Stroop task, in which either the semantic or spatial dimension of stimuli must be ignored. To explore the influence of individual differences in navigational style on conflict processing, participants took part in an auditory spatial Stroop task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Whereas behavioral performance only showed a main effect of congruency, we observed the predicted three-way interaction between congruency, task type and navigational style with respect to our physiological measure of Stroop conflict. Specifically, congruency-dependent modulation of the N-inc was observed only when participants performed their non-dominant task (e.g., verbal navigators attempting to ignore semantic information). These results confirm that the Ninc reliably indexes auditory Stroop conflict and extend previous results by demonstrating that the Ninc is predictably modulated by individual differences in cognitive style.

We recorded EEG data while participants performed an associative recognition task that involved manipulations of word length, associative fan, and probe type, which were hypothesized to affect the perceptual encoding, retrieval, and decision stages of the recognition task, respectively. Analyses of the behavioral and EEG data, supplemented with classification of the EEG data using machine-learning techniques, provided evidence that generally supported the sequence of stages assumed by a computational model developed in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational cognitive architecture. However, the results suggested a more complex relationship between memory retrieval and decision-making than assumed by the model. Implications of the results for modeling associative recognition are discussed. The study illustrates how a classifier approach, in combination with focused manipulations, can be used to investigate the timing of processing stages.

Fifteen subjects were asked to focus visual attention on global and single elements in intact faces and in their scrambled image. EEG data were recorded from 256-Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor-Net200. Event-related potentials (ERPs) analyses showed a difference between the intact face and the scrambled face from N170 component until 600 ms on the occipito-temporal montage and at 400-600 ms on the frontal montage. Only the eyes showed a difference between conditions (intact/scrambled face) at 500 ms. The most activated source detected by sLORETA was the right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) for both conditions and for all elements. Left BA21 resulted in significantly more activation in response to eyes in the intact face compared to the eyes in the scrambled face at 500 ms. The left BA21 has a central role in high-level visual processing and in understanding others' intentions. These findings suggest a specificity of the eyes and indicate that the eyes play the social and communicative role of comprehending the nonverbal intentions of others only when inserted in an intact face.

Electrophysiological indices of inhibitory control failure have been found to manifest even before the presentation of the stimuli triggering the inhibition, suggesting that pre-stimulus brain-states modulate inhibition performance. However, previous electrophysiological investigations on the state-dependency of inhibitory control were based on averaged event-related potentials (ERPs), a method eliminating the variability in the ongoing brain activity not time-locked to the event of interest. These studies thus left unresolved whether spontaneous variations in the brain-state immediately preceding unpredictable inhibition-triggering stimuli also influence inhibitory control performance. To address this question, we applied single-trial EEG topographic analyses on the time interval immediately preceding NoGo stimuli in conditions where the responses to NoGo trials were correctly inhibited [correct rejection (CR)] vs. committed [false alarms (FAs)] during an auditory spatial Go/NoGo task. We found a specific configuration of the EEG voltage field manifesting more frequently before correctly inhibited responses to NoGo stimuli than before FAs. There was no evidence for an EEG topography occurring more frequently before FAs than before CR. The visualization of distributed electrical source estimations of the EEG topography preceding successful response inhibition suggested that it resulted from the activity of a right fronto-parietal brain network. Our results suggest that the fluctuations in the ongoing brain activity immediately preceding stimulus presentation contribute to the behavioral outcomes during an inhibitory control task. Our results further suggest that the state-dependency of sensory-cognitive processing might not only concern perceptual processes, but also high-order, top-down inhibitory control mechanisms.

Neural substrates of normal and impaired preattentive sensory discrimination in large cohorts of nonpsychiatric subjects and schizophrenia patients as indexed by MMN and P3a change detection responses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Cognition; Sensory information processing; EEG; Source localization; LORETA; Endophenotype; Mismatch negativity; MMN; P3a; P300	DURATION MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-STIMULI; HIGH-RISK; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; ANTERIOR THALAMUS; EEG; LOCALIZATION	Objective: Schizophrenia (SZ) patients have information processing deficits, spanning from low level sensory processing to higher-order cognitive functions. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a are event-related potential (ERP) components that are automatically elicited in response to unattended changes in ongoing, repetitive stimuli that provide a window into abnormal information processing in SZ. MMN and P3a are among the most robust and consistently identified deficits in SZ, yet the neural substrates of these responses and their associated deficits in SZ are not fully understood. This study examined the neural sources of MMN and P3a components in a large cohort of SZ and nonpsychiatric control subjects (NCS) using Exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Analyses (eLORETA) in order to identify the neural sources of MMN and P3a as well as the brain regions associated with deficits commonly observed among SZ patients. Methods: 410 SZ and 247 NCS underwent EEG testing using a duration-deviant auditory oddball paradigm (1-kHz tones, 500 ms SOA; standard p = 0.90, 50-ms duration; deviant tones P=0.10, 100-ms duration) while passively watching a silent video. Voxel-by-voxel within- (MMN vs. P3a) and between-group (SZ vs. NCS) comparisons were performed using eLORETA. Results: SZ had robust deficits in MMN and P3a responses measured at scalp electrodes consistent with other studies. These components mapped onto neural sources broadly distributed across temporal, frontal, and parietal regions. MMN deficits in SZ were associated with reduced activations in discrete medial frontal brain regions, including the anterior-posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyri. These early sensory discriminatory MMN impairments were followed by P3a deficits associated with widespread reductions in the activation of attentional networks (frontal, temporal, parietal regions), reflecting impaired orienting or shifts of attention to the infrequent stimuli. Conclusions: MMN and P3a are dissociable responses associated with broadly distributed patterns of neural activation. MMN deficits among SZ patients appear to be primarily accounted for by reductions in medial prefrontal brain regions that are followed by widespread dysfunction across cortical networks associated with P3a in a manner that is consistent with hierarchical information processing models of cognitive deficits in SZ patients. Impairments in automatic stimulus discrimination may contribute to higher-order cognitive and psychosocial deficits in SZ. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Correct and early diagnosis is important because RED may lead to serious injuries and is a well-treatable disorder. Since the characteristic electrophysiologic finding in patients with RBD is the increased electromyographic tone during REM sleep/Stage R, simultaneous video/polysomnography recording is essential for diagnosing this parasomnia. Moreover, several neurophysiological techniques have been used to improve our knowledge and understanding of this troubling sleep disorder. We reviewed the most important studies employing quantitative electroencephalography, event-related potentials, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brainstem reflexes and cortico-muscular coherence analysis. All these neurophysiological techniques have proven to provide a valuable tool to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying RED. The review concludes with a brief discussion on the possible future implications for improving therapeutic approaches. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

It is often affected with various artifacts that have biological and external sources. Eye electrical activity might be considered as the most common artifact, which increase the difficulty in analyzing the EEG and to obtaining clinical information. In this paper, two different methods based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), for elimination of eye blinks in EEG are compared. First method is based on EMD and entropy at which the noisy signal is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by EMD and entropy is used as the index of stopping IMF extraction, when the process reach the artifact components. The second method uses EMD for extract artifact reference form the noisy signal and employs it as the artifact input in adaptive filtering. The performance index of this experiment is the correlation coefficient between bands of pure EEG and filtered EEG, which indicates both methods worked almost equal in beta, alpha and theta band however, the method based on combination of EMD and adaptive filtering outperforms the EMD and entropy in delta band.

Here we aimed to explore further tDCS induced behavioral and neurophysiological modulation including assessment of relapse rate over a prolonged time course in alcoholism. We examined the effects of repeated anodal tDCS (2 mA, 35 cm(2), 20 min) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on relapse to the use of alcohol in alcoholics from outpatient services, who received additional routine clinical treatment. Furthermore, event related potentials (ERPs), cognitive and frontal executive processes, craving, depressive and anxiety symptoms were obtained before and after treatment. From thirteen alcoholic subjects, seven were randomized to sham-tDCS and six to real tDCS treatment (once a week for five consecutive weeks). Depressive symptoms and craving were reduced to a larger extent in the tDCS group compared to the sham group (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015, respectively). On the other hand, active tDCS was able to block the increase in neural activation triggered by alcohol related and neutral cues in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as indexed by ERP as seen in the sham-tDCS group. Finally, there was a trend for increased change in executive function in the tDCS group compared to the sham-tDCS group (p = 0.082), and, similarly, a trend for more relapses in the tDCS group compared to sham tDCS (four alcoholic subjects (66.7%) vs. one (14.3%), p = 0.053). These results confirm the previous findings of tDCS effects on craving in alcoholism and also extend these findings as we showed also tDCS-related mood improvement. However, potential increase in relapse is possible; thus the clinical value of an increase in craving and improvement in depression and executive function needs to be carefully assessed in further studies; including investigation of optimal parameters of stimulation.

Many studies have explored how the brain might be actively preparing movement before the sense of volition; however, because the timing of the sense of volition has depended on subjective and retrospective judgments, these findings are still regarded with a degree of scepticism. EEG events such as beta event-related desynchronization and movement-related cortical potentials are associated with the brain's programming of movement. Using an optimized EEG signal derived from multiple variables, we were able to make real-time predictions of movements in advance of their occurrence with a low false-positive rate. We asked participants what they were thinking at the time of prediction: Sometimes they were thinking about movement, and other times they were not. Our results indicate that the brain can be preparing to make voluntary movements while participants are thinking about something else.

Participants (age range = 25-55 years) spent 4 consecutive nights in the laboratory, and Night-4 data were used for analysis. N1 amplitude was generally larger in both insomnia groups compared to GS, and P2 amplitude was larger in Para-I than in the 2 other groups, especially in REM sleep. Results suggest that, although hyperarousal appears to persist during sleep in adults with insomnia, inhibition deficits are more likely to be present in Para-I compared to Psy-I.

During the last two decades, the advancement of instrumentation amplifiers and microcontrollers has provided the adequate tools for the task. In this paper the design of a portable embedded system capable of recording up to 128 EEG electrodes simultaneously is presented. EEG records are stored in a standard SD flash card and can be transmitted to a host PC with a Bluetooth module. The main features of this device are portability, low power consumption, scalability, and low noise among others. The implemented device may allow psychophysiology researchers to perform non-invasive experiments, where individuals are not tied with an uncomfortable group of cables to amplifiers and test equipment.

Reduced cortical call to arms differentiates psychopathy from antisocial personality disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Antisocial personality disorder; brain response; differential diagnosis; ERP; psychopathy	STARTLE REFLEX; DEFENSIVE REACTIVITY; P3 AMPLITUDE; PROBE P3; EMOTION; TRAITS; MODULATION; HERITABILITY; REDUCTION; RESPONSES	Background. Psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are both characterized by impulsive, externalizing behaviors. Researchers have argued, however, that psychopathy is distinguished from ASPD by the presence of interpersonal-affective features that reflect an underlying deficit in emotional sensitivity. No study to date has tested for differential relations of these disorders with the brain's natural orienting response to sudden aversive events. Method. Electroencephalography was used to assess cortical reactivity to abrupt noise probes presented during the viewing of pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures in 140 incarcerated males diagnosed using the Psychopathy Checklist - Revised and DSM-IV criteria for ASPD. The primary dependent measure was the P3 event-related potential response to the noise probes. Results. Psychopaths showed significantly smaller amplitude of P3 response to noise probes across trials of all types compared with non-psychopaths. Follow-up analyses revealed that this overall reduction was attributable specifically to the affective-interpersonal features of psychopathy. By contrast, no group difference in general amplitude of probe P3 was evident for ASPD versus non-ASPD participants. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate a reduced cortical orienting response to abrupt aversive stimuli in participants exhibiting features of psychopathy that are distinct from ASPD. The specificity of the observed effect fits with the idea that these distinctive features of psychopathy reflect a deficit in defensive reactivity, or mobilization of the brain's defensive system, in the context of threat cues.

The event-related potential P300 is generated along a widely distributed network involving several of the areas implicated in OCD. P300 abnormalities reported in patients with OCD suggest increased activity in these areas. The aim of the present study was to investigate this assumption in unmedicated patients with OCD, and to assess the effects of OCD treatment on P300 brain activity patterns. Seventy-one unmedicated patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD and 71 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects participated in the study. The P300 was obtained through 32-channel EEG during an auditory oddball paradigm. Forty-three patients underwent a second EEG assessment after treatment with sertraline and behavioural therapy. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to localize the sources of brain electrical activity. Results: Increased P300-related activity was observed predominantly in the left orbitofrontal cortex, but also in left prefrontal, parietal and temporal areas, in patients compared to controls at baseline. After treatment, reduction of left middle frontal cortex hyperactivity was observed in patients. Conclusions: Findings of increased activity in frontoparietal areas in patients are consistent with several previous studies. Importantly, OCD treatment led to reduction of hyperactivity in the left middle frontal cortex, an area associated with context processing and uncertainty that might be important for the emergence of OCD symptoms. Thus, the present study is the first to show an association between P300 abnormalities and activity in brain regions postulated to be involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Neurophysiological responses to schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; N400; Communication abnormalities; Social exclusion; Thought disorder; Stigma	BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPEECH; ERP; DISCRIMINATION; SENTENCES; SCALE; WORDS; POWER; N400	Background: Individuals with schizophrenia experience difficulty with interpersonal interactions, in part resulting from communication abnormalities that are common in the disorder, and to the expectancy effects from knowledge of the person's diagnosis. The auditory N400 event-related potential provides an objective measure of recognition of incongruent speech and thus is a potential tool to understand how listeners respond to disordered speech as a function of awareness of diagnosis. Methods: In this study, participants listened to segments of conversation between two people in which the sentence final word was a normal ending, a word approximation, or a neologism while EEG was recorded. Participants were randomized to two groups: told that the speaker had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or not told about a diagnosis. Results: Participants who were not told that the speaker had schizophrenia displayed a significant N400 during both word approximations and neologisms. However, no significant N400 was observed for participants who were told that the speaker had schizophrenia. Conclusions: Differential neurological responses to the same abnormal speech depending on whether the diagnosis of the speaker was known, indicate an early processing expectancy effect for abnormal communication to come from someone with schizophrenia. Such responses to abnormal speech in schizophrenia indicate an expectation of abnormality from individuals with schizophrenia, which has implications for understanding social exclusion of individuals with the disorder.

Here we investigated behavioural and also neural correlates of tactile exogenous attention when participants either watched a visual stream (single task) or also detected targets in the visual stream (dual task). During the visual stream, tactile cues were presented to the left or right hand followed by tactile targets at the same or opposite hand. Behavioural results demonstrated slowed responses to tactile targets at cued locations (i.e., IOR) in the single whilst no attention effect in the dual task. Concurrently recorded EEG revealed multiple stages of tactile processing to be attenuated when engaging in a visual task: First, the amplitude of the cueelicited somatosensory P100 component was suppressed suggesting relative early cross-modality effects in the dual task. Second, correlates of cue-induced attentional control processes showed a reduced late somatosensory negativity (LSN) in the dual compared to the single task suggesting smaller preparatory processes. Finally, early attentional selection correlates of post-target ERPs (N80) were absent in the dual task. This study demonstrated for the first time that engaging in a visual task abolished behavioural IOR in touch. ERP analyses showed that early somatosensory processing as well as specific correlates of tactile attentional orienting and target selection are diminished under visual engagement. Our findings are in line with a supramodal account of attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, identifying biological markers in the early stages of psychosis is an important step toward early detection and intervention. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a are leading candidate biomarkers. MMN measures differ in their sensitivity to varying deviants. However, this has not been fully addressed in assessing the early stages of psychosis. In the current study, we examined MMN/P3a to duration deviant (dMMN/dP3a) and frequency deviant (fMMN/fP3a) in the early stages of psychosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examined both MMN/P3a to duration deviant (dMMN/dP3a) and frequency deviant (fMMN/fP3a) in the early stages of psychosis. Methods: Participants consisted of 20 patients with first episode schizophrenia (FES), 21 ultra-high risk (UHR) individuals, and 22 healthy controls (HC). We measured dMMN/dP3a and fMMN/fP3a ERP components by means of a 64 electrodes-cap for EEG recording, and we used two-tone auditory oddball paradigms with 2000 stimuli. Results: The amplitude of dMMN was significantly reduced in FES and UHR compared to HC. The amplitude of fMMN showed no significant difference among the three groups. The amplitudes of dP3a and fP3a were significantly reduced in FES and UHR compared to HC. Conclusion: These findings suggest that dMMN may have higher sensitivity than fMMN whereas dP3a and fP3a may have similar sensitivity in the early stages of psychosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

J	Lafontaine, MP; Theoret, H; Gosselin, F; Lippe, S				Lafontaine, Marc Philippe; Theoret, Hugo; Gosselin, Frederic; Lippe, Sarah			Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Repetition Suppression to Unfamiliar Faces: An ERP Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; DECISION-MAKING; INVERTED FACES; VISUAL-CORTEX; N170; HUMANS	Repeated visual processing of an unfamiliar face suppresses neural activity in face-specific areas of the occipito-temporal cortex. This "repetition suppression" (RS) is a primitive mechanism involved in learning of unfamiliar faces, which can be detected through amplitude reduction of the N170 event-related potential (ERP). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exerts top-down influence on early visual processing. However, its contribution to N170 RS and learning of unfamiliar faces remains unclear. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) transiently increases or decreases cortical excitability, as a function of polarity. We hypothesized that DLPFC excitability modulation by tDCS would cause polarity-dependent modulations of N170 RS during encoding of unfamiliar faces. tDCS-induced N170 RS enhancement would improve long-term recognition reaction time (RT) and/or accuracy rates, whereas N170 RS impairment would compromise recognition ability. Participants underwent three tDCS conditions in random order at,72 hour intervals: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal and sham. Immediately following tDCS conditions, an EEG was recorded during encoding of unfamiliar faces for assessment of P100 and N170 visual ERPs. The P3a component was analyzed to detect prefrontal function modulation. Recognition tasks were administered similar to 72 hours following encoding. Results indicate the right anodal/left cathodal condition facilitated N170 RS and induced larger P3a amplitudes, leading to faster recognition RT. Conversely, the right cathodal/left anodal condition caused N170 amplitude and RTs to increase, and a delay in P3a latency. These data demonstrate that DLPFC excitability modulation can influence early visual encoding of unfamiliar faces, highlighting the importance of DLPFC in basic learning mechanisms.

Brief pitch-priming facilitates infants' discrimination of pitch-evoking noise: Evidence from event-related potentials	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Pitch; Development; Event-related potentials; Mismatch negativity; Iterated rippled noise (IRN)	ITERATED RIPPLED NOISE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; COMPLEX TONES; MISMATCH RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; DYSFUNCTION; MATURATION; COMPONENTS	Pitch is derived by the auditory system through complex spectrotemporal processing. Pitch extraction is thought to depend on both spectral cues arising from lower harmonics that are resolved by cochlear filters in the inner ear, and on temporal cues arising from the pattern of action potentials contained in the cochlear output. Adults are capable of extracting pitch in the absence of robust spectral cues, taking advantage of the temporal cues that remain. However, recent behavioral evidence suggests that infants have difficulty discriminating between stimuli with different pitches when resolvable spectral cues are absent. In the current experiments, we used the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event related potential derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to examine a cortical representation of pitch discrimination for iterated rippled noise (IRN) stimuli in 4- and 8-month-old infants. IRN stimuli are pitch-evoking sounds generated by repeatedly adding a segment of white noise to itself at a constant delay. We created IRN stimuli (delays of 5 and 6 ms creating pitch percepts of 200 and 167 Hz) and high-pass filtered them to remove all resolvable spectral pitch cues. In experiment 1, we did not find EEG evidence that infants could detect the change in the pitch of these IRN stimuli. However, in Experiment 2, after a brief period of pitch-priming during which we added a sine wave component to the IRN stimulus at its perceived pitch, infants did show significant MMN in response to pitch changes in the IRN stimuli with sine waves removed. This suggests that (1) infants can use temporal cues to process pitch, although such processing is not mature and (2) that a short amount of pitch-priming experience can alter pitch representations in auditory cortex during infancy.

The ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) was recorded from 38 scalp electrodes and high-beta band (21 -28 Hz), an index of cognitive cortical arousal, was computed as normalized percentage across 0-100 Hz spectral range in six electrode clusters during three linguistic tasks: Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic/visuo-perceptual. During the Phonological task, controls showed greater beta activation on left versus right central cluster, whereas aphasic patients exhibited an inverted pattern of lateralization. In addition, patients' left central cluster, located over the core lesion, showed reduced beta activity with respect to controls. A similar inhibited activation was found in aphasics' left posterior cluster located over undamaged areas. At left anterior locations, aphasics, unlike controls, exhibited larger left versus right beta activity during both Phonological and Orthographic/visuo-perceptual tasks. Results point to substantial reorganization of language in recovered non-fluent aphasics at left prefrontal sites located anterior to the damaged Broca's area and inhibited language-related activation in left posterior undamaged, but disconnected, regions.

We were interested in the neural correlates of these perceptual effects. Participants viewed random, reflection, rotation, and translation patterns while we recorded EEG from the scalp. Half the participants classified the pattern regularity overtly, the other half did not explicitly attend to pattern regularity but reported rare oddball trials, where two squares were embedded among the dots. The amplitude of a symmetry-related ERP known as the sustained posterior negativity was most pronounced for reflection, then rotation and translation. We suggest that reflectional symmetry, despite its biological significance, may not be processed by unique visual mechanisms, but instead it could be a preferred stimulus for a more general regularity-sensitive network in the extrastriate visual cortex.

These models are able to accurately mimic the event-related potentials observed by EEG/MEG measurement systems, and are considered to be key components for understanding brain functionality. In this paper, we focus on a class of nonlinear dynamic causal models (DCM) that are described by a set of connectivity parameters. In practice, the DCM parameters are inferred using data obtained by an EEG or MEG sensor array in response to a certain event or stimulus, and then used to analyze the strength and direction of the causal interactions between different brain regions. The usefulness of these parameters in this process will depend on how accurately they can be estimated, which in turn will depend on noise, the sampling rate, number of data samples collected, the accuracy of the source localization and reconstruction steps, etc. The goals of this paper are to present several algorithms for DCM parameter estimation, derive Cramer-Rao performance bounds for the estimates, and compare the accuracy of the algorithms against the theoretical performance limits under a variety of circumstances. The influence of noise and sampling rate will be explicitly investigated.	[Wu, Shun Chi; Swindlehurst, A.

MMN-like responses have been extensively investigated in animal models, but the existence of MMN equivalent is still controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate how closely the putative MMN (MMNp) in rats exhibited the comparable properties of human MMN. We used a surface microelectrode array with a grid of 10x7 recording sites within an area of 4.5x3.0 mm to densely map evoked potentials in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats under the oddball paradigm. Firstly, like human MMN, deviant stimuli elicited negative deflections in auditory evoked potentials following the positive middle-latency response, termed P1. Secondly, MMNp exhibited deviance-detecting property, which could not be explained by simple stimulus specific adaptation (SSA). Thirdly, this MMNp occurred focally in the auditory cortex, including both the core and belt regions, while P1 activation focus was obtained in the core region, indicating that both P1 and MMNp are generated in the auditory cortex, yet the sources of these signals do not completely overlap. Fourthly, MMNp significantly decreased after the application of AP5 (D-(-)-2-amino5- phosphonopentanoic acid), an antagonist at NMDA receptors. In stark contrast, AP5 affected neither P1 amplitude nor SSA of P1. These results provide compelling evidence that the MMNp we have examined in rats is functionally comparable to human MMN. The present work will stimulate translational research into MMN, which may help bridge the gap between electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies in humans and electrophysiological studies in animals.

Auditory event-related potentials (P3a, P3b) and genetic variants within the dopamine and serotonin system in healthy females	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Dopamine; Serotonin; Genetic; EEG; P3a; P3b	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; TRANSPORTER GENE; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; 5-HTTLPR POLYMORPHISM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; P300; COMT; GENOTYPE; ASSOCIATION	The late positive components of the human event-related brain potential comprise electrocortical reflections of stimulus-driven attentional capture (the anteriorly distributed P3a) and top-down control detection of relevant events (the posteriorly distributed P3b). As of yet, the neuropharmacologic and neurogenetic origin of the P3a and P3b is not fully understood. In this study, we address the contribution of dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms. Sixty healthy females completed an active auditory novelty oddball paradigm while EEG was recorded. In all subjects, genetic polymorphisms within the dopamine system (dopamine transporter [DAT1], catecholamine-O-methyltransferase val158met [COMTval158met]) and the serotonin system (serotonin transporter [5HTTLPR]) were assessed. Across genotypes, novels (relative to standards) elicited a fronto-centrally distributed P3a, and targets (relative to standards) a parieto-centrally distributed P3b. Genotypes effects were observed for both P3a (COMT, 5HTTPLR) and P3b (DAT1, COMT, 5HTTLPR) only at prefrontal electrode location (Fz). Specifically, the frontal P3a was enhanced in COMT met/met homozygotes, but not in DAT1 9R. The target-related P3b was enhanced in COMT met/met and DAT1 9R relative to its genetic counterparts, but only at frontal electrodes. This 'anteriorized' enhancement may reflect either an additional frontal component in the target-related P3 dependent on dopamine, or a more subtle shift in the neural ensemble that generates the target-related P3. Results for 5HTTLPR short allele homozygotes mimicked those in COMT met/met homozygotes. In all, the present findings suggest involvement of frontal-cortical dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms in bottom-up attentional capture (COMT val158met, 5HTTLPR), with an additional top-down component sensitive to striatal signals (DAT1).

A special region of the cortex, the Fusiform Gyms (FG), is believed to be the specific area for processing face features and emotions. However, behavioral, fMRI and ERP studies addressed to investigate the role of FG dysfunction in ASD have led to conflicting results. Using a high-density EEG system, we recorded the face-sensitive ERP to neutral and emotional (happiness and fearful) faces, as a measure of early activity of the FG, in children with high functioning ASD. By controlling a number of experimental and clinical variables that could have biased previous research such as gaze direction, attention to tasks, stimulus appearance and clinical profiles - we aimed to assess the effective role of the FG in the face emotion processing deficit hypothesized in ASD. No significant differences in early face-sensitive ERP components were found between ASD and neurotypical children. However, a systematic latency delay and amplitude reduction of all early potentials were observed in the ASD group, regardless of the stimulus, although more evident for emotions. Therefore, we can assume a diffuse dysfunction of neural mechanisms and networks in driving and integrating social information conveyed by faces, in particular when emotions are involved, rather than a specific impairment of the FG-related face processing circuit. Nevertheless, there is need of further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is an endogenous psychiatric disorder characterized by extreme shifts in mood, energy, and ability to function socially. BD patients usually show cognitive dysfunction, and the goal of this study was to access their altered visual information processing via visual MMN (vMMN) and P3 using windmill pattern stimuli. Methods: Twenty patients with BD and 20 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and handedness participated in this study. Subjects were seated in front of a monitor and listened to a story via earphones. Two types of windmill patterns (standard and deviant) and white circle (target) stimuli were randomly presented on the monitor. All stimuli were presented in random order at 200 ms durations with an 800-ms inter-stimulus interval. Stimuli were presented at 80% (standard), 10% (deviant), and 10% (target) probabilities. The participants were instructed to attend to the story and press a button as soon as possible when the target stimuli were presented. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded throughout the experiment using 128 channel EEG equipment. vMMN was obtained by subtracting standard from deviant stimuli responses, and P3 was evoked from the target stimulus. Results: Mean reaction times for target stimuli in the BD group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Additionally, mean vMMN-amplitudes and peak P3 amplitudes were significantly lower in the BD group than in controls. Conclusions: Abnormal vMMN and P3 in patients indicate a deficit of visual information processing in BD, which is consistent with their increased reaction time to visual target stimuli. Significance: Both bottom-up and top-down visual information processing are likely altered in BD.

In general, the executive function of response inhibition appears unaffected by ecstasy use. Nonetheless, it remains a possibility that cognitive tasks alone are not sensitive enough to pick up subtle changes in function. The current study sought to investigate behavioural measures of response inhibition and their electrophysiological correlates in drug users. Twenty ecstasy polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy polydrug users and 20 drug naive controls were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires about their background drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task whilst electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there were no between-group differences on the behavioural measure of response inhibition. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed no main effect of group across midline electrodes for the P3, N2 and P2 components. Univariate ANOVA revealed significant between-group differences in the P2 component with the ecstasy user group having a significantly higher mean amplitude than drug naive controls at two midline frontal electrodes: at Fz and significantly higher mean amplitude than both control groups at FCz. The present study provides evidence of atypical early processing in ecstasy users that is suggestive of compensatory mechanisms ameliorating any behavioural differences.	[Roberts, C.

In this study not only subjective evaluations using the SD method but also objective ones with biomedical signals and response time were performed for the evaluations of the mascot characters. The result of tests and researches showed that there was a correlation between brain wave event related potential and response time for the character cognitions and, mascots' acceptability also played a major role to their popularities besides "cuteness" and "weirdness". Under these results, local governments' mascots were picked up respectively and a research was conducted on what kind of effects they made for attracting interest to local governments, which led to the conclusion that the local governments, featuring mascots with distinctive and understandable motives in order to explain their products and cultures, succeeded in getting more interests than the ones with undistinguished and weak characters.

Along with such externally guided decision-making, there are instances of decision-making in which no correct answer based on external circumstances is available for the subject (internally guided decision-making, e.g. preference judgment). We compared these two different types of decision-making in terms of conflict-monitoring and their relation with resting-state brain activity. Current electroencephalography (EEG) data demonstrated that conflict-related N2 amplitudes (i.e., difference between large-conflict and small-conflict conditions) in externally guided decision-making were modulated by the type of external stimulus (i.e., large-conflict stimulus pair or small-conflict stimulus pair) but were not found to be correlated with resting-state brain activity (i.e. resting-state EEG power). In contrast, conflict-related N2 amplitudes in internally guided decision-making were found to be correlated with resting-state brain activity, but were not found to be modulated by the type of stimulus itself: the degree to which the type of external stimulus modulates the conflict during stimulus encoding varies according to individual differences in intrinsic brain activity. Considering those results comprehensively, we demonstrate for the first time resting-state and stimulus-related differences between externally and internally guided decision-making.

In order to answer this question for visual word recognition, we used EEG/MEG as well as fMRI to determine the latency ranges and spatial areas in which brain activation towords is modulated by task demands. We presented letter strings in three tasks (lexical decision, semantic decision, silent reading), and measured combined EEG/MEG as well as fMRI responses in two separate experiments. EEG/MEG sensor statistics revealed the earliest reliable task effects at around 150 ms, which were localized, using minimum norm estimates (MNE), to left inferior temporal, right anterior temporal and left precentral gyri. Later task effects (250 and 480 ms) occurred in left middle and inferior temporal gyri. Our fMRI data showed task effects in left inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal and precentral cortices. Although there was some correspondence between fMRI and EEG/MEG localizations, discrepancies predominated. We suggest that fMRI may be less sensitive to the early short-lived processes revealed in our EEG/MEG data. Our results indicate that task-specific processes start to penetrate word recognition already at 150 ms, suggesting that early word processing is flexible and intertwined with decision making.

For example, while listening to a piece of Western-style music, an anomalous key change or an out-of-key pitch is readily apparent, even to the non-musician. In this paper we investigate differences between musical experts and non-experts during musical anomaly detection. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalograms (EEG) of five expert cello players and five non-musicians while they listened to excerpts of J.S. Bach's Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1. All subjects were familiar with the piece, though experts also had extensive experience playing the piece. Subjects were told that anomalous musical events (AMEs) could occur at random within the excerpts of the piece and were told to report the number of AMEs after each excerpt. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to remain still while listening to the excerpts and their lack of movement was verified via visual and EEG monitoring. Experts had significantly better behavioral performance (i.e. correctly reporting AME counts) than non-experts, though both groups had mean accuracies greater than 80%. These group differences were also reflected in the EEG correlates of key-change detection post-stimulus, with experts showing more significant, greater magnitude, longer periods of, and earlier peaks in condition-discriminating EEG activity than novices. Using the timing of the maximum discriminating neural correlates, we performed source reconstruction and compared significant differences between cellists and non-musicians. We found significant differences that included a slightly right lateralized motor and frontal source distribution. The right lateralized motor activation is consistent with the cortical representation of the left hand - i.e. the hand a cellist would use, while playing, to generate the anomalous key-changes. In general, these results suggest that sensory anomalies detected by experts may in fact be partially a result of an embodied cognition, with a model of the action for generating the anomaly playing a role in its detection.

We investigated pen-fixation brain activity for internal state-specific tagging. Human participants performed a task, in which a visual object was presented for identification in lateral visual field, to which they moved their eyes as soon as possible from a central fixation point. Next, a phrase appeared in the same location; the phrase could either be an easy or hard question about the object, answered by pressing one of two alternative response buttons, or it could be an instruction to simply press one of these two buttons. Depending on whether these messages were blocked or randomly mixed, one of two different internal states was induced: either the task was known in advance or it wasn't. Eye movements and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded simultaneously during task performance. Using eye-event-time-locked averaging and independent component analysis, saccade- and fixation-related components were identified. Coss-frequency phase-synchrony was observed between the alpha/betal ranges of fixation-related and beta2/gammal ranges of saccade-related activity 50 ms prior to fixation onset in the mixed-phrase condition only. We interpreted this result as evidence for internal state-specific tagging.

The present study examines the neural nature of this effect by studying the N450 rhyme effect. Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological responses of Dutch pre-literate kindergartners and literate second graders were recorded while they made rhyme judgments of word pairs in three conditions; phonologically rhyming (e.g., wijn-pijn), overlapping non-rhyming (e.g., pen-pijn) and unrelated non-rhyming pairs (e.g., boom-pijn). Results: Behaviorally, both groups had difficulty judging overlapping but not rhyming and unrelated pairs. The neural data of second graders showed overlapping pairs were processed in a similar fashion as unrelated pairs; both showed a more negative deflection of the N450 component than rhyming items. Kindergartners did not show a typical N450 rhyme effect. However, some other interesting ERP differences were observed, indicating preliterates are sensitive to rhyme at a certain level. Significance: Rhyme judgments of globally similar items rely on the same process as rhyme judgments of rhyming and unrelated items. Therefore, incorporating a globally similar condition in rhyme assessments may lead to a more in-depth measure of early phonological awareness skills.

Implicit conditioning of faces via the social regulation of emotion: ERP evidence of early attentional biases for security conditioned faces	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; Motivation; Social factors; Unconscious processes; Conditioning; EEG; ERP	AVERSIVE ENVIRONMENTS; ATTACHMENT; ATTRACTION; RACE; SUPPORT	Not much is known about the neural and psychological processes that promote the initial conditions necessary for positive social bonding. This study explores one method of conditioned bonding utilizing dynamics related to the social regulation of emotion and attachment theory. This form of conditioning involves repeated presentations of negative stimuli followed by images of warm, smiling faces. L. Beckes, J. Simpson, and A. Erickson (2010) found that this conditioning procedure results in positive associations with the faces measured via a lexical decision task, suggesting they are perceived as comforting. This study found that the P1 ERP was similarly modified by this conditioning procedure and the P1 amplitude predicted lexical decision times to insecure words primed by the faces. The findings have implications for understanding how the brain detects supportive people, the flexibility and modifiability of early ERP components, and social bonding more broadly.

Although imaging techniques have been paramount in exploring disorders of consciousness, electrophysiologic techniques continue to be important for studying brain function in behaviorally unresponsive patients. In acute coma, electroencephalogram and evoked potentials have important roles in excluding nonconvulsive seizures, determining prognosis, monitoring for signs of improvement or worsening, and examining for markers of conscious response to external stimuli. Absence of cortical SSEPs is the most specific marker of poor prognosis after cardiac arrest. Recognition of stimulus-induced epileptiform discharges and clinical seizures has further blurred the lines along the ictal-interictal spectrum in coma. For chronic disorders of consciousness, more experimental techniques, such as cognitive event-related potentials and long-latency evoked potentials, have demonstrated an expanded role in determining prognosis and examining for indicators of consciousness. Like functional magnetic resonance imaging, these specialized techniques have demonstrated signs of preserved cognition in patients who otherwise appear unconscious. Future directions for clinical electrophysiologic testing in disorders of consciousness are likely to include automated and quantitative signal processing techniques and better standardization of cognitive event-related potentials.

Animal Detection in Natural Images: Effects of Color and Image Database	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; RAPID VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING SPEED; TIME-COURSE; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; CONTEXT; CORTEX	The visual system has a remarkable ability to extract categorical information from complex natural scenes. In order to elucidate the role of low-level image features for the recognition of objects in natural scenes, we recorded saccadic eye movements and event-related potentials (ERPs) in two experiments, in which human subjects had to detect animals in previously unseen natural images. We used a new natural image database (ANID) that is free of some of the potential artifacts that have plagued the widely used COREL images. Color and grayscale images picked from the ANID and COREL databases were used. In all experiments, color images induced a greater N1 EEG component at earlier time points than grayscale images. We suggest that this influence of color in animal detection may be masked by later processes when measuring reation times. The ERP results of go/nogo and forced choice tasks were similar to those reported earlier. The non-animal stimuli induced bigger N1 than animal stimuli both in the COREL and ANID databases. This result indicates ultra-fast processing of animal images is possible irrespective of the particular database. With the ANID images, the difference between color and grayscale images is more pronounced than with the COREL images. The earlier use of the COREL images might have led to an underestimation of the contribution of color. Therefore, we conclude that the ANID image database is better suited for the investigation of the processing of natural scenes than other databases commonly used.

Methods: Twenty-five females and 27 males viewed 414 pictures of the International affective picture system varying in emotional valence (positive, negative and neutral) and presence of humans (human and scenes). EEG event related potentials (ERPs) were obtained and correlations were computed with self-reported empathy. Results: Compared to males, females showed increased anterior N2 and parietal LPP amplitudes to humans contrasted with scenes (independent of emotional valence) and to negative contrasted with neutral emotions (independent of human presence). Independent of sex the N1 and anterior N2 were specifically increased for positive human emotions and the parietal LPP for negative human emotions. Across sexes, the N2 and LPP human emotion effects and LPP human effects were associated with self-reported affective empathy, but not with cognitive empathy. Conclusions: This study provides electrophysiological evidence that women prioritize the processing of socially relevant and negative emotional information, but that women did not show enhanced brain potentials to pictures with positive or negative emotions in humans.

J	Yamanaka, K; Nozaki, D				Yamanaka, Kentaro; Nozaki, Daichi			Neural Mechanisms Underlying Stop-and-Restart Difficulties: Involvement of the Motor and Perceptual Systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REACTION-TIME PARADIGMS; SELF-PACED MOVEMENTS; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; SIGNAL PARADIGM; ALPHA-RHYTHM	The ability to suddenly stop a planned movement or a movement being performed and restart it after a short interval is an important mechanism that allows appropriate behavior in response to contextual or environmental changes. However, performing such stop-and-restart movements smoothly is difficult at times. We investigated performance (response time) of stop-and-restart movements using a go/stop/re-go task and found consistent stop-and-restart difficulties after short (similar to 100 ms) stop-to-restart intervals (SRSI), and an increased probability of difficulties after longer (>200 ms) SRSIs, suggesting that two different mechanisms underlie stop-and-restart difficulties. Next, we investigated motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in a moving muscle induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during a go/stop/re-go task. In re-go trials with a short SRSI (100 ms), the MEP amplitude continued to decrease after the re-go-signal onset, indicating that stop-and-restart difficulties with short SRSIs might be associated with a neural mechanism in the human motor system, namely, stop-related suppression of corticomotor (CM) excitability. Finally, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during a go/stop/re-go task and performed a single-trial-based EEG power and phase time-frequency analysis. Alpha-band EEG phase locking to re-go-signal, which was only observed in re-go trials with long SRSI (250 ms), weakened in the delayed re-go response trials. These EEG phase dynamics indicate an association between stop-and-restart difficulties with long SRSIs and a neural mechanism in the human perception system, namely, decreased probability of EEG phase locking to visual stimuli. In contrast, smooth stop-and-restart human movement can be achieved in re-go trials with sufficient SRSI (150-200 ms), because release of stop-related suppression and simultaneous counter-activation of CM excitability may occur as a single task without second re-go-signal perception. These results suggest that skilled motor behavior is subject to various constraints in not only motor, but also perceptual (and attentional), systems.

J	Wang, G; Ren, DT				Wang, Gang; Ren, Doutian			Effect of Brain-to-Skull Conductivity Ratio on EEG Source Localization Accuracy	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							IN-VIVO; EPILEPSY; GEOMETRY; ERP	The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio (BSCR) on EEG source localization accuracy. In this study, we evaluated four BSCRs: 15, 20, 25, and 80, which were mainly discussed according to the literature. The scalp EEG signals were generated by BSCR-related forward computation for each cortical dipole source. Then, for each scalp EEG measurement, the source reconstruction was performed to identify the estimated dipole sources by the actual BSCR and the misspecified BSCRs. The estimated dipole sources were compared with the simulated dipole sources to evaluate EEG source localization accuracy. In the case of considering noise-free EEG measurements, the mean localization errors were approximately equal to zero when using actual BSCR. The misspecified BSCRs resulted in substantial localization errors which ranged from 2 to 16 mm. When considering noise-contaminated EEG measurements, the mean localization errors ranged from 8 to 18 mm despite the BSCRs used in the inverse calculation. The present results suggest that the localization accuracy is sensitive to the BSCR in EEG source reconstruction, and the source activity can be accurately localized when the actual BSCR and the EEG scalp signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used.

First, the ICA algorithm is used to analyze EEG signals to get the independent components (ICs); then, the wavelet method is applied to the demixed ICs as an intermediate step; finally, the EEG data are reconstructed from the new ICs (that are obtained in the intermediate step) by using the inverse ICA. The experimental results show that the automatic artifact removal method can not only remove eye artifacts, muscle artifacts and some unknown physiological artifacts sources, but also efficiently keep the weak neural activities from strong background artifacts. The results can establish a basis for ADHD clinical diagnose study.

Task-switching studies have suggested a plausible correlate of task conflicta poststimulus posterior negativityhowever, in such paradigms the negativity may also reflect poststimulus task-set reconfiguration postulated in some models. Here, participants alternated between single-task blocks of classifying letters and digits; hence, no within-block task-set reconfiguration was required. Presenting letters alongside digits slowed responses to the digits and elicited an ERP negativity from approximate to 350ms, relative to task-neutral symbols presented alongside digits, consistent with task conflict. The negativity was also present for congruent digit-letter stimuli; this and the lack of behavioral response congruency effects indicate conflict at the level of task-set rather than response selection.

This study assessed event-related theta oscillations in medication-free, euthymic patients with bipolar disorder upon auditory oddball paradigm. Twenty-two DSM-IV euthymic bipolar I (n = 19) and II (n = 3) patients and twenty-two healthy subjects were included. Patients were euthymic for at least 6 months, and psychotropic-free for at least 2 weeks. EEG was recorded at 30 electrode sites. Auditory oddball paradigm and sensory stimuli were used. Event-related Oscillations were analyzed using adaptive filtering in two different theta frequency bands (4-6 Hz, 6-8 Hz). In healthy subjects, slow theta (4-6 Hz) responses were significantly higher than those of euthymic patients upon target, non-target and sensory stimuli (p < 0.05). Fast theta (6-8 Hz) responses of healthy subjects were significantly higher than those of euthymic patients upon target-only stimuli (p < 0.05). Reduced theta oscillations during auditory processing provide strong quantitative evidence of activation deficits in related networks in bipolar disorder.

J	Magnuski, M; Gola, M				Magnuski, Mikolaj; Gola, Mateusz			It's not only in the eyes: Nonlinear relationship between face orientation and N170 amplitude irrespective of eye presence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						N170; Face inversion effect; Face processing; Event Related Potentials; EEG	INTERSTIMULUS PERCEPTUAL VARIANCE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THATCHER ILLUSION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; INVERSION; BRAIN; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; SELECTIVITY	We have investigated the interplay between face orientation, eye presence, and N170 amplitude by recording Event Related Potentials. To clarify previous reports of nonlinearity in N170 amplitude changes along rotation angle changes, we adopted Itier et al.'s model (Itier et al., 2007) which links N170 face inversion effects with the presence of eyes. Comparison of N170 amplitude and latency for five stimulus categories (Faces-with-eyes, Faces-without-eyes, Eyes, Cars-with-lights, Cars-without-lights) in five different rotations (0, 45, 90, 135, 180) resulted in mixed conclusions. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) a strong nonlinear relationship between N170 and angle of rotation that is specific to faces, distinguishing face from car category even when no significant differences were observed between these categories for upright and inverted orientations; and (2) the nonlinear relationship between N170 and angle of rotation does not depend on eye presence. We also propose an alternative model according to which N170 amplitude consists of two related aspects of face processing: (A) incompatibility (relative distance of the stimulus pattern from experience-based hypothetical prototype) and (B) integration (degree to which stimulus is integrated into holistic representation), with the former affecting the latter. Moreover, we suggest two possible neural events underlying these two aspects of face processing: neural population size activated by the stimulus, and synchronization within this population.

In order to identify the brain process of inhibition control, this study introduced a new methodology to observe brain dynamics in response and success/failure inhibition in typical and realistic scenarios. Subjects will feel stress during decision-making in scenario-compatible stop-signal tasks in bith typical and realistic scenarios. The advantage of this research would be very useful in tough condition of daily life such as, driving and sport competition or in unusual situations like gun-fighting in the field of war and flooding. This study will develop two main issues: brain activity comparing between success and failure inhibition control and comparing brain activity during decision-making in normal scenario and in stress (realistic) scenario. The findings of the present study suggest that there is an increase in stressful condition during decision-making. However EEG results indicated that, in the parietal area, the event-related potential (ERP) appeared reverse phase relative to the frontal area. Therefore, we conclude that there is obvious difference in brain dynamics activities between success/failure inhibition in typical and realistic scenarios. In this research, we purposed Gaussian-classifier for typical and realistic scenarios. The classification average accuracy was observed 77.82% in typical and 75.67 % in realistic scenarios.

Individual EEG differences in affective valence processing in women with low and high neuroticism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Affective valence; EEG; Individual differences; Neuroticism; Single-trial; SVM	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; VISUAL-STIMULI; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; EXTROVERSION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: In this study, individual differences in brain electrophysiology during positive and negative affective valence processing in women with different neuroticism scores are quantified. Methods: Twenty-six women scoring high and low on neuroticism participated on this experiment. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was applied on the EEG single trials elicited by high arousal pictures with negative and positive valence scores. Based on the accuracy values obtained from subject identification tasks, the most distinguishing EEG channels among participants were detected, pointing which scalp regions show more distinct patterns. Results: Significant differences were obtained, in the EEG heterogeneity between positive and negative valence stimuli, yielding higher accuracy in subject identification using negative pictures. Regarding the topographical analysis, significantly higher accuracy values were reached in occipital areas and in the right hemisphere (p < 0: 001). Conclusions: Mainly, individual differences in EEG can be located in parietooccipital regions. These differences are likely to be due to the different reactivity and coping strategies to unpleasant stimuli in individuals with high neuroticism. In addition, the right hemisphere shows a greater individual specificity. Significance: An SVM-based classifier asserts the individual specificity and its topographical differences in electrophysiological activity for women with high neuroticism compared to low neuroticism.

Limitations of traditional accuracy-only approaches in the investigation of audiovisual speech perception have motivated the use of new methodologies. In an audiovisual speech identification task, we utilized capacity (Townsend and Nozawa, 1995), a dynamic measure of efficiency, to quantify audiovisual integration. Capacity was used to compare RI distributions from audiovisual trials to RI distributions from auditory-only and visual-only trials across three listening conditions: clear auditory signal, S/N ratio of 12 dB, and S/N ratio of 18 dB. The purpose was to obtain EEG recordings in conjunction with capacity to investigate how a late ERR co-varies with integration efficiency. Results showed efficient audiovisual integration for low auditory S/N ratios, but inefficient audiovisual integration when the auditory signal was clear. The ERR analyses showed evidence for greater audiovisual amplitude compared to the unisensory signals for lower auditory S/N ratios (higher capacity/efficiency) compared to the high S/N ratio (low capacity/inefficient integration). The data are consistent with an interactive framework of integration, where auditory recognition is influenced by speech-reading as a function of signal clarity.

Developmental differences in EEG and sleep responses to acute ethanol administration and its withdrawal (hangover) in adolescent and adult Wistar rats	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Adolescence; Alcohol; EEG; Alcoholism; Slow-wave sleep; Hangover	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN-FUNCTION; ANIMAL-MODELS; FOLLOW-UP; AGE; EXPOSURE	Age-related differences in sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol may play an important role in the increased risk for the development of alcoholism seen in teens that begin drinking at an early age. The present study evaluated the acute and protracted (hangover) effects of ethanol in adolescent (P33-P40) and adult (P100-P107) Wistar rats, using the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). Six minutes of EEG was recorded during waking, 15 min after administration of 0, 1.5, or 3.0 g/kg ethanol, and for 3 h at 20 h post ethanol, during the rats' next sleep cycle. Significantly higher overall frontal and parietal cortical power was seen in a wide range of EEG frequencies in adolescent rats as compared to adult rats in their waking EEG. Acute administration of ethanol did not produce differences between adolescents and adults on behavioral measures of acute intoxication. However, it did produce a significantly less intense acute EEG response to ethanol in the theta frequencies in parietal cortex in the adolescents as compared to the adults. At 20 h following acute ethanol administration, during the rats' next sleep cycle, a decrease in slow-wave frequencies (1-4 Hz) was seen and the adolescent rats were found to display more reduction in the slow-wave frequencies than the adults did. The present study found that adolescent rats, as compared to adults, demonstrate low sensitivity to acute ethanol administration in the theta frequencies and more susceptibility to disruption of slow-wave sleep during hangover. These studies may lend support to the idea that these traits may contribute to increased risk for alcohol use disorders seen in adults who begin drinking in their early teenage years.

Single-trial decoding of auditory novelty responses facilitates the detection of residual consciousness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vegetative state; Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; Minimally conscious state; Multivariate pattern classifier; Decoding; EEG; MEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; VEGETATIVE STATE; UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; REM-SLEEP; COMA; RECOVERY; DISORDERS	Detecting residual consciousness in unresponsive patients is a major clinical concern and a challenge for theoretical neuroscience. To tackle this issue, we recently designed a paradigm that dissociates two electro-encephalographic (EEG) responses to auditory novelty. Whereas a local change in pitch automatically elicits a mismatch negativity (MMN), a change in global sound sequence leads to a late P300b response. The latter component is thought to be present only when subjects consciously perceive the global novelty. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to detect because individual variability is high, especially in clinical recordings. Here, we show that multivariate pattern classifiers can extract subject-specific EEG patterns and predict single-trial local or global novelty responses. We first validate our method with 38 high-density EEG, MEG and intracranial EEG recordings. We empirically demonstrate that our approach circumvents the issues associated with multiple comparisons and individual variability while improving the statistics. Moreover, we confirm in control subjects that local responses are robust to distraction whereas global responses depend on attention. We then investigate 104 vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) and conscious state (CS) patients recorded with high-density EEG. For the local response, the proportion of significant decoding scores (M = 60%) does not vary with the state of consciousness. By contrast, for the global response, only 14% of the VS patients' EEG recordings presented a significant effect, compared to 31% in MCS patients' and 52% in CS patients'. In conclusion, single-trial multivariate decoding of novelty responses provides valuable information in non-communicating patients and paves the way towards real-time monitoring of the state of consciousness.

This study was designed to explore the potential improvement from using electrocorticography (ECoG) compared to the more traditional usage of electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: We tested the P300 speller on two epilepsy patients with temporary subdural electrode arrays over the occipital and temporal lobes respectively. We then performed offline analysis to determine the accuracy and bit rate of the system and integrated spectral features into the classifier and used a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to further improve the results. Results: The subject with the occipital grid achieved an accuracy of 82.77% and a bit rate of 41.02, which improved to 96.31% and 49.47 respectively using a language model and spectral features. The temporal grid patient achieved an accuracy of 59.03% and a bit rate of 18.26 with an improvement to 75.81% and 27.05 respectively using a language model and spectral features. Spatial analysis of the individual electrodes showed best performance using signals generated and recorded near the occipital pole. Conclusions: Using ECoG and integrating language information and spectral features can improve the bit rate of a P300 speller system. This improvement is sensitive to the electrode placement and likely depends on visually evoked potentials. Significance: This study shows that there can be an improvement in BCI performance when using ECoG, but that it is sensitive to the electrode location.

To diagnose efficiently epilepsy, it is valuable to classify electroencephalogram signal. In this paper, we proposed a new e-health design of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification for epilepsy diagnosis. The design is based on support vector machine to classify electroencephalogram signal. We first decompose electroencephalogram signal into bands by using discrete wavelet transform and compute the approximate entropy values in the bands. Next, by proposed feature selection method, the feature vectors are selected adaptively from statistical wavelet coefficients and approximate entropy values. Finally, the support vector machine is used to classify the selected features. The experimental results showed the proposed system has great performance and reliability and the total accuracy of classification can achieve 98%.

Yet, the precise spatiotemporal neuronal activity patterns underlying the cortical information processing have remained largely elusive. Although the high temporal and spatial resolution of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings is increasingly being exploited in functional neuroimaging, it has not been used to study heart cycle-related effects. Here, we addressed the capacity of ECoG to characterize neuronal signals within the cardiac cycle, as well as to disentangle them from heart cycle-related artifacts. Based on topographical distribution and latency, we identified a biphasic potential within the primary somatosensory cortex, which likely constitutes a heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) of neuronal origin. We also found two different types of artifacts: i) oscillatory potential changes with a frequency identical to the heart pulse rate, which probably represent pulsatility artifacts and ii) sharp potentials synchronized to the R-peak, corresponding to the onset of ventricular contraction and the cardiac field artifact (CFA) in EEG. Finally, we show that heart cycle-related effects induce pronounced phase-synchrony patterns in the ECoG and that this kind of correlation patterns, which may confound ECoG connectivity studies, can be reduced by a suitable correction algorithm. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first one to show a focally localized cortical HEP that could be clearly and consistently observed over subjects, suggesting a basic role of primary sensory cortex in processing of heart-related sensory inputs. We also conclude that taking into account and reducing heart cycle-related effects may be advantageous for many ECoG studies, and are of crucial importance, particularly for ECoG-based connectivity studies. Thus, in summary, although ECoG poses new challenges, it opens up new possibilities for the investigation of heartbeat-related viscerosensory processing in the human brain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Cues informed either about the upcoming (1) spatial stimulus-response compatibility (rule cues), or (2) the stimulus location (position cues), or (3) were non-informative. Only rule cues allowed anticipating the upcoming compatibility condition. Position cues allowed anticipation of the upcoming location of the Simon stimulus but not its compatibility condition. Rule cues elicited fastest and most accurate performance for both compatible and incompatible trials. The contingent negative variation (CNV) in the event-related potential (ERP) of the cue-target interval is an index of anticipatory preparation and was magnified after rule cues. The N2 in the post-target ERP as a measure of online action control was reduced in Simon trials after rule cues. Although compatible trials were faster than incompatible trials in all cue conditions only non-informative cues revealed a compatibility effect in additional indicators of Simon task conflict like accuracy and the N2. We thus conclude that rule cues induced anticipatory re-coding of the Simon task that did not involve cognitive conflict anymore. fMRI revealed that rule cues yielded more activation of the left rostral, dorsal, and ventral prefrontal cortex as well as the pre-SMA as compared to POS and NON-cues. Pre-SMA and ventrolateral prefrontal activation after rule cues correlated with the effective use of rule cues in behavioral performance. Position cues induced a smaller CNV effect and exhibited less prefrontal and pre-SMA contributions in fMRI. Our data point to the importance to disentangle different anticipatory adjustments that might also include the prevention of upcoming conflict via task re-coding.

Previous research has focused on group effects, and has largely overlooked the potential problem of interindividual differences. Interindividual variance causes problems with the interpretation of group-level results. In this study we want to demonstrate the degree of consistency in the active oddball task across subjects, in order to answer the question of whether this task is able to reliably detect conscious target processing in unresponsive patients. We asked 18 subjects to count rare targets and to ignore frequent standards and rare distractors in an auditory active oddball task. Event-related-potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency data were analyzed with permutation-t-tests on a single subject level. We plotted the group-average ERPs and time-frequency data, and evaluated the numbers of subjects showing significant differences between targets and distractors in certain time-ranges. The distinction between targets/distractors and standards was found to be significant in the time-range of the P300 in all participants. In contrast, significant differences between targets and distractors in the time-range of the P3a/b were found in 8 subjects, only. By including effects in the N1 and in a late negative component there remained 2 subjects who did not show a distinction between targets and distractors in the ERP. While time-frequency data showed prominent effects for target/distractor vs. standard, significant differences between targets and distractors were found in 2 subjects, only. The results suggest that time-frequency-and ERP-analysis of the active oddball task may not be sensitive enough to detect voluntary brain activation in unresponsive patients. In addition, we found that time-frequency analysis was even less informative than ERPs about the subject's task performance. Despite suggesting the use of more sensitive paradigms and/or analysis techniques, the present results give further evidence that electroencephalographic research should rely more strongly on single-subject analysis because interpretations of group-effects may be misleading.

The goal of this study was to determine whether functional abnormalities exist in the cortical processing of musical sound in schizophrenia. Methods: Twelve schizophrenic patients and twelve age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited, and participants listened to a random sequence of two kinds of sonic entities, intervals (tritones and perfect fifths) and chords (atonal chords, diminished chords, and major triads), of varying degrees of complexity and consonance. The perception of musical sound was investigated by the auditory evoked potentials technique. Results: Our results showed that schizophrenic patients exhibited significant reductions in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components elicited by musical stimuli, to which consonant sounds contributed more significantly than dissonant sounds. Schizophrenic patients could not perceive the dissimilarity between interval and chord stimuli based on the evoked potentials responses as compared with the healthy controls. Conclusion: This study provided electrophysiological evidence of functional abnormalities in the cortical processing of sound complexity and music consonance in schizophrenia. The preliminary findings warrant further investigations for the underlying mechanisms.

Many studies associated the gamma oscillations with oscillators around the 40 Hz frequency, yet recent studies have shown that gamma frequencies may be part of a broadband phenomenon ranging from 30 Hz up to 250 Hz. In this study we have examined the possibility that a simple model, based on available neurophysiological parameters, involving an increase in asynchronous (Poisson distributed) neural firing may be sufficient to generate the observed gamma power increases. Our simulation shows a roughly linear increase in gamma power as a function of the aggregated firing rate of the neural population, while the influence of the synchronization level within the neurons on the gamma power is limited. Our model supports the viewpoint that the broadband gamma response is mainly driven by the summed, asynchronous, activity of the neural population. We show that the time frequency spectrogram of the stimulus response can be reconstructed by combining two different phenomena the broadband gamma power increase due to local processing and the more spatially distributed event related desynchronization (ERD). Our model thus raises the possibility that the broadband gamma response is closely linked to the aggregate population firing rate of the recorded neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enhancement of Gamma Oscillations Indicates Preferential Processing of Native over Foreign Phonemic Contrasts in Infants	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PHONETIC PERCEPTION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; AMERICAN INFANTS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD	Young infants discriminate phonetically relevant speech contrasts in a universal manner, that is, similarly across languages. This ability fades by 12 months of age as the brain builds language-specific phonemic maps and increasingly responds preferentially to the infant's native language. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie the development of infant preference for native over non-native phonemes remain unclear. Since gamma-band power is known to signal infants' preference for native language rhythm, we hypothesized that it might also indicate preference for native phonemes. Using high-density electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) recordings and source-localization techniques to identify and locate the ERP generators, we examined changes in brain oscillations while 6-month-old human infants from monolingual English settings listened to English and Spanish syllable contrasts. Neural dynamics were investigated via single-trial analysis of the temporal-spectral composition of brain responses at source level. Increases in 4-6 Hz (theta) power and in phase synchronization at 2-4 Hz (delta/theta) were found to characterize infants' evoked responses to discrimination of native/non-native syllable contrasts mostly in the left auditory source. However, selective enhancement of induced gamma oscillations in the area of anterior cingulate cortex was seen only during native contrast discrimination. These results suggest that gamma oscillations support syllable discrimination in the earliest stages of language acquisition, particularly during the period in which infants begin to develop preferential processing for linguistically relevant phonemic features in their environment. Our results also suggest that by 6 months of age, infants already treat native phonemic contrasts differently from non-native, implying that perceptual specialization and establishment of enduring phonemic memory representations have been initiated.

J	Knosche, TR; Graser, M; Anwander, A				Knoesche, Thomas R.; Graeser, Markus; Anwander, Alfred			Prior knowledge on cortex organization in the reconstruction of source current densities from EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Source reconstruction; Cortex parcellation; Source current density	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; INVERSE PROBLEM; CORTICAL SOURCES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FMRI; MEG; MODEL; DIFFUSION; MEG/EEG	The reconstruction of the generators of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is important for understanding brain processes. Since the inverse problem has no unique solution, additional knowledge or assumptions are needed. Often, results from other anatomical or functional measurement modalities are difficult to interpret directly in terms of EEG source strengths, but they provide valuable information about the functional similarity between brain regions, for example, in form of parcellations. We propose a novel approach to the incorporation of such parcellations as priors into the reconstruction of distributed source current densities from EEG. Two algorithms are described, based on a surface-constrained LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic TomogrAphy) approach. The first, patchLORETA1, uses both topological neighborhood and prior information to define smoothness, while the second, patchLORETA2 neglects topological neighborhood. Computer simulations, using a smooth reconstruction surface on the brain envelope, reveal important aspects of the algorithms' performance, in particular the influences of noise and incongruence between measurements and prior information. It turns out that patchLORETA1 makes efficient use of the provided prior information and at the same time is quite robust towards faulty priors as well as noise. The algorithms are also tested on the localization of the sources of event-related potentials. Here, both the smooth brain and folded cortical surfaces serve as reconstruction spaces. We find that patchLORETA1 becomes ineffective on the folded cortex, while patchLORETA2 yields plausible results. We also discuss the extension of the proposed algorithms to other types of priors and propose ways to overcome shortcomings of the current implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we introduce a novel statistical method for characterizing the spatial consistency of EEG dynamics across a set of data records. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) first finds voxels in a common template brain space at which a given dynamic measure is consistent across nearby source locations, then computes local-mean EEG measure values for this voxel subspace using a statistical model of source localization error and between-subject anatomical variation. Finally, clustering the mean measure voxel values in this locally consistent brain subspace finds brain spatial domains exhibiting distinguishable measure features and provides 3-D maps plus statistical significance estimates for each EEG measure of interest. Applied to sufficient high-quality data, the scalp projections of many maximally independent component (IC) processes contributing to recorded high-density EEG data closely match the projection of a single equivalent dipole located in or near brain cortex. We demonstrate the application of MPA to a multi-subject EEG study decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA), compare the results to k-means IC clustering in EEGLAB (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), and use surrogate data to test MPA robustness. A Measure Projection Tool-box (MPT) plug-in for EEGLAB is available for download (sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/MPT). Together, MPA and ICA allow use of EEG as a 3-D cortical imaging modality with near-cm scale spatial resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Multimodal imaging: Simultaneous EEG in a 3T Hybrid MR-PET system	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Positron Emission Tomography (PET); Electrophysiology; Temporal resolution; Hybrid MR-PET system		The new generation of integrated MR-PET systems allows the simultaneous acquisition of MR and PET data. While MR delivers structural data with an excellent spatial resolution, the advantage of PET is its information on a molecular level. However, both modalities have a low temporal resolution. Thus, for pharmacological studies or patients who suffer from treatment resistant epilepsy the combination of yet another modality such as EEG could be desirable. We tested the feasibility of evoked visual potentials in a 3T Hybrid MR-PET system (Siemens Germany) in comparison to a standalone 3T Trio System (Siemens Germany). A T2*-weighted EPI sequence was used: TR: 2.2 s, TE: 30 ms, FOV: 200 mm, slice thickness 3, 36 slices in a healthy volunteer (male, 27 years old) using an MR-compatible 32-channel EEG system (Brainproducts, Munich, Germany). We applied 200 trials of visual stimulation from a white and black checkerboard. Visual evoked potentials were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer (Brainproducts, Munich, Germany). Gradient correction and cardioballistic artefact correction were performed as implemented in Vision Analyzer. Visual event related potentials were successfully recorded at the 3T Hybrid MR-PET system. Both curves differ slightly in shape and latency due to the following factors: the distance from the screen varies slightly and the size of the field of view of the subjects is smaller in the 3T MR-PET system in comparison to the 3T stand alone system. Extending the 3T MR-PET Hybrid system to 3T Hybrid MR-PET-EEG is feasible and adds another tool to clinical neuroimaging and research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Especially, an asynchronous BCI is one of the most important topics since practical input interfaces are incomplete without self-paced inputs. In order to construct an asynchronous BCI, it is essential to recognize the standby state, where a user enters no commands. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting the standby state and develop an asynchronous BCI based on event-related potentials with the intended movement direction. We conducted online experiments with developed asynchronous BCI. As a result, all three subjects showed considerable recognition accuracies.

Methods: CMC was calculated between simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) measures from fifteen healthy subjects who performed 10 repetitions of alternating isometric wrist flexion and extension tasks at 15% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque levels. Task precision was calculated from torque recordings. Subjects rated the perceived difficulty levels for both tasks. Results: Flexors had significantly lower; peak beta CMC, peak frequency, frequency width, normalised EMG beta power, torque fluctuation (< 5 Hz and beta band) and perceived difficulty ratings; but higher MVC and precision compared to extensors. EEG alpha and beta powers were non-different between flexion and extension. Conclusions: An inverse relationship between CMC and motor precision was found in our inter-muscle study, contrary to the direct relationship found in a prior intra-muscle study. Functional suitability, long term usage adaptation and lower perceived difficulty of wrist flexion may explain the results. Significance: We extend the CMC literature to include the clinically different, antagonistic wrist flexors and extensors and add to the debate relating CMC and motor precision by positing the confounding effect of perceived difficulty.

Appetitive long-term taste conditioning enhances human visually evoked EEG responses	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Conditioning; Taste; Visual evoked potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR-5; DENTATE GYRUS; MEMORY; LTP; CORTEX; INVOLVEMENT; TOMOGRAPHY	Long-term effects of learned associations between an image and a taste have not been studied with electromagnetic brain scanning techniques. The possibility that taste conditioning may change sensory image processing was investigated in young adult subjects. EEG-responses evoked by images were recorded before and after a training session using an image as conditioned stimulus and a pleasant taste as unconditioned stimulus. The results showed that in posterior electrodes placed over visual cortex areas, the following changes occurred after conditioning: (1) the amplitude and duration of the N2-P3 waves in the visual evoked potentials were enhanced; (2) the N2 and P3 peak delays were shortened; (3) power induced by image presentation was enhanced in the delta and theta frequency bands; (4) cross-hemispheric delta and theta coherences among the posterior electrodes were enhanced; (5) calculations of the underlying whole brain distribution of currents using swLORETA showed elevated current densities in posterior voxels. None of the above changes occurred in a sham-trained control group. In electrodes placed over the prefrontal cortex, delta and theta power also rose significantly. It is suggested that the appetitive taste conditioning potentiated synaptic activity in visual cortex networks and that this led to an increased speed of image processing.

We propose an objective and quantitative method for the automatic detection of eyeblink artefacts from raw data using extreme value statistics, with a p-value acting as a threshold parameter. For testing the method, we used 29 channel electroencephalogram recordings of 55 healthy subjects. A total 7,700 s of EEG were analysed. The proposed method was found to detect blink artefacts reliably, showing that extreme value statistics can be employed to detect blink artefacts, even in the absence of EOG recordings.

Crucially, these paradigms involve display changes that have to occur during the time of saccadic blindness, when the subject is unaware of the change. Therefore, a combination of high-speed eye tracking and high-speed visual stimulation is required in these paradigms. For combined eye movement and brain activity studies (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG), fast and exact timing of display changes is especially important, because of the high susceptibility of the brain to visual stimulation. Eye tracking systems already achieve sampling rates up to 2000 Hz, but recent LCD technologies for computer screens reduced the temporal resolution to mostly 60 Hz, which is too slow for gaze-contingent display changes. We developed a high-speed video projection system, which is capable of reliably delivering display changes within the time frame of < 5 ms. This could not be achieved even with the fastest cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors available (< 16 ms). The present video projection system facilitates the realization of cutting-edge eye movement research requiring reliable high-speed visual stimulation (e.g., gaze-contingent display changes, short-time presentation, masked priming). Moreover, this system can be used for fast visual presentation in order to assess brain activity using various methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The latter technique was previously excluded from high-speed visual stimulation, because it is not possible to operate conventional CRT monitors in the strong magnetic field of an MRI scanner. Therefore, the present video projection system offers new possibilities for studying eye movement-related brain activity using a combination of eye tracking and fMRI.

However, in patients who have undergone full or partial transection of forebrain fibers connecting the two hemispheres (split-brain), independent structures subserving all processing stages should reside in each disconnected hemisphere, thus predicting parallel processing of dual tasks. Surprisingly, this prediction is usually not verified behaviorally. We reasoned that brain imaging with high-density recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) could clarify the extent and limits of parallel processing in callosal patients. We studied a patient (AC) with posterior callosal section in a lateralized number-comparison task. Behaviorally, the split-brain patient showed robust dual-task interference, superficially similar to the psychological refractory period (PRP) effect in the control group of 14 healthy subjects, but significantly different in important aspects such as slowing of response times in the first task. Analysis of ERPs revealed that the parietal P3 component became split into distinct contralateral components in the patient, and was dramatically reduced for targets in his left visual field. In contrast to the control group, P3 latencies showed minimal to nonexistent postponement related to dual-task processing in the patient. In summary, our findings suggest that the left and right hemisphere networks normally involved in a single distributed "global neuronal workspace" that underlies the generation of the P3 component and serial processing, became strongly decoupled after a posterior callosal lesion.

The experiment was divided in three parts: in the first one, the subject only observes the movement of the robotic manipulator; in the second part, the subject follows the robot movement with his right arm; finally, in the third part, the subject imagines the execution of the corresponding movement synchronized with the movement of the robot. Event related (de) synchronization in each of the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) channels was analyzed. Event related desynchronization was present in alpha and beta bands in various areas of the cortex, including occipital, parietal, central and prefrontal areas. The results provided some physiological insights into human-robot interaction for future developments in brain-machine interfaces.

Left Lateralized Enhancement of Orofacial Somatosensory Processing Due to Speech Sounds	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						neuroimaging; speech perception; speech production		Purpose: Somatosensory information associated with speech articulatory movements affects the perception of speech sounds and vice versa, suggesting an intimate linkage between speech production and perception systems. However, it is unclear which cortical processes are involved in the interaction between speech sounds and orofacial somatosensory inputs. The authors examined whether speech sounds modify orofacial somatosensory cortical potentials that were elicited using facial skin perturbations. Method: Somatosensory event- related potentials in EEG were recorded in 3 background sound conditions ( pink noise, speech sounds, and nonspeech sounds) and also in a silent condition. Facial skin deformations that are similar in timing and duration to those experienced in speech production were used for somatosensory stimulation. Results: The authors found that speech sounds reliably enhanced the first negative peak of the somatosensory event- related potential when compared with the other 3 sound conditions. The enhancement was evident at electrode locations above the left motor and premotor area of the orofacial system. The result indicates that speech sounds interact with somatosensory cortical processes that are produced by speech- production- like patterns of facial skin stretch. Conclusion: Neural circuits in the left hemisphere, presumably in left motor and premotor cortex, may play a prominent role in the interaction between auditory inputs and speech- relevant somatosensory processing.

Neural Substrates of Executive Dysfunction in Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS): a Brain Potential Study	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; executive function; FMR1; P300; working memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FMR1 MESSENGER-RNA; PREMUTATION CARRIERS; CGG-REPEAT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; P300; GENE; AGE; INTELLIGENCE	Executive dysfunction in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) has been suggested to mediate other cognitive impairments. In the present study, event-related potentials and neuropsychological testing were combined to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the executive dysfunction in FXTAS. Thirty-two-channel electroencephalography was recorded during an auditory oddball task requiring dual responses. FXTAS patients (N 41, mean age 62) displayed prolonged latencies of N1 and P3 and reduced amplitudes of P2 and P3, whereas their N2 measures remained within the normal range, indicating relatively preserved early-stage auditory attention but markedly impaired late-stage attention and working memory updating processes (as indexed by P3). Topographical mapping revealed a typical parietal P3 peak preceded by a prominent fronto-central P3 in normal control subjects (N 32), whereas FXTAS patients had decreased parietal P3 amplitude and diminished fronto-central positivities with a delayed onset (50 ms later than controls, P 0.002). The P3 abnormalities were associated with lower executive function test (e.g., BDS-2) scores. Smaller P3 amplitudes also correlated with increased CGG repeat length of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and higher FMR1 mRNA levels. These results indicate that abnormal fronto-parietal attentional network dynamics underlie executive dysfunction, the cardinal feature of cognitive impairment in FXTAS.

Scalp video-electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may suffice for defining lesional area and seizure-onset zone in discrete, surgically resectable lesions. The choice of timing for surgery requires a multidisciplinary evaluation, especially in children, when a wait and see approach is chosen. Discordant electroclinical and neuroimaging data and an ill-defined epileptogenic lesion require invasive investigations. A multimodal integrated approach may maximize the extent of resection while preserving cerebral function in the eloquent cortex. Radical removal of the tumor is the most important predictor of seizure freedom. Additional predictors include histopathology, age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, and seizure type. Patients with brain tumors are highly vulnerable in relation to the frequent drug-resistance of seizures, the potential interactions between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and chemotherapeutic agents (CMTs), and the risk of AED-related cognitive adverse events (24% higher than in the rest of the epilepsy population), in addition to brain damage resulting from tumor itself, surgery, and radiotherapy. No robust, randomized, controlled evidence supports the choice of AEDs for the treatment of seizures in patients with brain tumors. Newer AEDs have limited or no enzyme-inducing profile, prevalent renal excretion, lower plasma protein binding and, consequently, fewer interactions with CMTs. Enzyme-inducing AEDs can lower serum levels of concomitantly administered CMTs.

The evaluation of effective EEG patterns is one of the crucial issues in the current research of BCI. Most of the traditional visual evoked paradigms only evoke one kind of EEG pattern for the subsequent feature classification. This study presents a new paradigm based on P300 and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) that involves event-related stimulation and frequency flashing stimulation. P300 and SSVEP patterns are evoked simultaneously to enhance the discriminahility of features. Offline comparison is implemented among the proposed paradigm and the traditional P300 and SSVEP paradigms. The results show that the new paradigm evokes more significant P300 features while weaken SSVEP features a little without destroying the online feasibility of the BCI system. Therefore, the proposed paradigm can satisfy requirements from different subjects to enlarge the user of group.

The starting time of the movement was indicated with the clock making one revolution for 4 s. The time at which the clock hand passed the 3 o'clock position was defined as a go timing. In the go trials, a subject was instructed to start the movement at the timing. In a series of trials, a task, we designated pre-stop task, with a stop signal indicated unexpectedly before the timing of the go-signal was conducted. In the pre-stop task, the subject abandoned the motor intention immediately after the stop-signal, and all subjects were able to inhibit finger movement. Cerebral potentials from the scalp were recorded using a 20-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system. In the go task, typical movement-related cortical potentials were observed. On the other hand, a positive potential distributed at the midline fronto-cental scalp about 400ms after the go-signal was observed only in the pre-stop task. This result suggests that the positive component observed in the pre-stop task is associated with the abandonment of the motor intention.

Brain dynamics encode the spectrotemporal boundaries of auditory objects	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; NEUROMAGNETIC RESPONSES; BOTTOM-UP; PITCH; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; TRANSIENT; ATTENTION	Perception of objects in the scene around us is effortless and intuitive, yet entails profound computational challenges. Progress has been made in understanding some mechanisms by which the brain encodes the boundaries and surfaces of visual objects. However, in the auditory domain, these mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated differences between neural responses to spectrotemporal boundaries in the auditory scene. We used iterated rippled noise to create perceptual boundaries with and without energy transients. In contrast to boundaries marked by energy transients, second-order boundaries were characterized by an absence of early components in the event-related potential. First-order energy boundaries triggered a transient evoked gamma-band response and a well-defined P90 component of the event-related potential, whereas second-order boundaries evoked only the later N1 component. Furthermore, the N1 component was delayed when evoked by second-order boundaries and theta-band electroencephalography activity at this latency exhibited significant phase lag for second-order compared to first-order boundaries. We speculate that boundaries defined by sharp energy transients can be registered by early feed-forward mechanisms. By contrast, boundaries defined only by discontinuities at discrete frequency bands require integration across the tonotopic representation of the frequency spectrum and require time-consuming interaction between auditory areas.

Coalescence of dominance motivation and responses to facial anger in resting-state and event-related electrophysiology	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dominance motivation; Delta/beta ratio; Facial anger; Resting state electroencephalogram; N170	ANGRY FACES; APPETITIVE MOTIVATION; REWARD ANTICIPATION; NEURAL RESPONSE; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; TESTOSTERONE; EEG; EXPRESSIONS; PERCEPTION	People vary in their proneness to dominate as a function of their motivation to fulfill their need for reward and social status. Recent research suggests that in humans dominant individuals respond vigilantly to angry faces, whereas non-dominant individuals rapidly signal submission. Dominance motivation has been suggested to reside in asymmetrical patterns of cortical and subcortical processing. The ratio between delta and beta band oscillations has been proposed as a proxy for this asymmetry, which we here aimed to map onto individual patterns of the event-related potentials (N170) as well as behavioral responses to facial anger in the context of dominance motivation. Results show that dominance motivation indeed predicts increased delta in the delta/beta asymmetry; a pattern that further translates into behavioral vigilance as well as attenuation of the event-related response to angry faces. The present data are interpreted to suggest that dominance motivation is related to increased subcortical and decreased cortical processing, and that this translates into increased vigilance in dominance challenges. This motivational state is further characterized by less detailed processing of facial information as reflected in the attenuation of N170 amplitude. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the neural activity associated with comprehending an extended text is not well-understood. Here we describe a current-source-density (CSD) index that predicts individual differences in the comprehension of an extended text. The index is the difference in CSD-transformed event-related potentials (ERPs) to a target word between two conditions: a comprehension condition with words from a story presented in their original order, and a scrambled condition with the same words presented in a randomized order. In both conditions participants responded to the target word, and in the comprehension condition they also tried to follow the story in preparation for a comprehension test. We reasoned that the spatiotemporal pattern of difference-CSDs would reflect comprehension-related processes beyond word-level processing. We used a pattern-classification method to identify the component of the difference-CSDs that accurately (88%) discriminated good from poor comprehenders. The critical CSD index was focused at a frontal-midline scalp site, occurred 400-500 ms after target-word onset and was strongly correlated with comprehension performance. Behavioral data indicated that group differences in effort or motor preparation could not explain these results. Further, our CSD index appears to be distinct from the well-known P300 and N400 components, and CSD transformation seems to be crucial for distinguishing good from poor comprehenders using our experimental paradigm. Once our CSD index is fully characterized, this neural signature of individual differences in extended-text comprehension may aid the diagnosis and remediation of reading comprehension deficits.

We used electroencephalography to study the neurobiology of perception of social risk, in subjects playing the role of proposers in an iterated ultimatum game in pairs. Based on statistical modeling, we used the previous behaviors of both players to separate high-risk [HR] offers from low-risk [LR] offers. The HR offers present higher rejection probability and higher entropy (variability of possible outcome) than the LR offers. Rejections of LR offers elicited both a stronger mediofrontal negativity and a higher prefrontal theta activity than rejections of HR offers. Moreover, prior to feedback, HR offers generated a drop in alpha activity in an extended network. Interestingly, trial-by-trial variation in alpha activity in the medial prefrontal, posterior temporal, and inferior pariental cortex was specifically modulated by risk and, together with theta activity in the prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, predicted the proposers subsequent behavior. Our results provide evidence that alpha and theta oscillations are sensitive to social risk and underlie a fine-tuning regulation of social decisions.

These deficits have been traced back to both deficits in orthographic and phonological processing. For a better understanding of the reading speed deficit in DD it is necessary to clarify which processing steps are degraded in children with DD during reading. In order to address this question the present study used EEG to investigate three reading related ERPs: the N170, N400 and LPC. Twenty-nine children without DD and 52 children with DD performed a phonological lexical decision (PLD)-task, which tapped both orthographic and phonological processing. Children were presented with words, pseudohomophones, pseudowords and false fonts and had to decide whether the presented stimulus sounded like an existing German word or not. Compared to control children, children with DD showed deficits in all the investigated ERPs. Firstly, a diminished mean area under the curve for the word material-false font contrasts in the time window of the N170 was observed, indicating a reduced degree of print sensitivity; secondly, N400 amplitudes, as suggested to reflect the access to the orthographic lexicon and grapheme-phoneme conversion, were attenuated; and lastly, phonological access as indexed by the LPC was degraded in children with DD. Processing differences dependent on the linguistic material in children without DD were observed only in the LPC, suggesting that similar reading processes were adopted independent of orthographic familiarity. The results of this study suggest that effective treatment should include both orthographic and phonological training. Furthermore, more longitudinal studies utilizing the same task and stimuli are needed to clarify how these processing steps and their time course change during reading development.

Transient shifts in frontal and parietal circuits scale with enhanced visual feedback and changes in force variability and error. J Neurophysiol 109: 2205-2215, 2013. First published January 30, 2013; doi:10.1152/jn.00969.2012.-When subjects perform a learned motor task with increased visual gain, error and variability are reduced. Neuroimaging studies have identified a corresponding increase in activity in parietal cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and extrastriate visual cortex. Much less is understood about the neural processes that underlie the immediate transition from low to high visual gain within a trial. This study used 128-channel electro-encephalography to measure cortical activity during a visually guided precision grip task, in which the gain of the visual display was changed during the task. Force variability during the transition from low to high visual gain was characterized by an inverted U-shape, whereas force error decreased from low to high gain. Source analysis identified cortical activity in the same structures previously identified using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Source analysis also identified a time-varying shift in the strongest source activity. Superior regions of the motor and parietal cortex had stronger source activity from 300 to 600 ms after the transition, whereas inferior regions of the extrastriate visual cortex had stronger source activity from 500 to 700 ms after the transition. Force variability and electrical activity were linearly related, with a positive relation in the parietal cortex and a negative relation in the frontal cortex. Force error was nonlinearly related to electrical activity in the parietal cortex and frontal cortex by a quadratic function. This is the first evidence that force variability and force error are systematically related to a time-varying shift in cortical activity in frontal and parietal cortex in response to enhanced visual gain.

This is not only true for localization in the horizontal plane but also for localization in depth. Depth ranging of sound sources implicates various distance cues, among others sound intensity. In this study, we measured human electroencephalography and compared mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes and latencies for horizontal motion, radial motion, and pure intensity changes in the free field. We observed similar MMN latencies for horizontal and radial motion, whereas MMN responses to pure intensity changes were comparably delayed. MMN amplitudes and latencies were not different for approaching and receding sounds. Our data suggest similar fast processing for horizontal and radial motion, whereas pure intensity changes are possibly processed with less priority.

NEURON 58; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-LOCKING; ORDER INFORMATION; GENERIC METHOD	Working memory (WM) processes help keep information in an active state so it can be used to guide future behavior. Although numerous studies have investigated brain activity associated with spatial WM in humans and monkeys, little research has focused on the neural mechanisms of WM for temporal order information, and how processing of temporal and spatial information might differ. Available evidence indicates that similar frontoparietal regions are recruited during temporal and spatial WM, although there are data suggesting that they are distinct processes. The mechanisms that allow for differential maintenance of these two types of information are unclear. One possibility is that neural oscillations may differentially contribute to temporal and spatial WM. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare patterns of oscillatory activity during maintenance of spatial and temporal information in WM. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed enhanced left frontal theta (5-8 Hz), enhanced posterior alpha (9-12 Hz), and enhanced left posterior beta (14-28 Hz) power during the delay period of correct temporal order trials compared to correct spatial trials. In contrast, gamma (30-50 Hz) power at right lateral frontal sites was increased during the delay period of spatial WM trials, as compared to temporal WM trials. The present results are consistent with the idea that neural oscillatory patterns provide distinct mechanisms for the maintenance of temporal and spatial information in WM. Specifically, theta oscillations are most critical for the maintenance of temporal information in WM. Possible roles of higher frequency oscillations in temporal and spatial memory are also discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Briley, PM; Krumbholz, K				Briley, Paul M.; Krumbholz, Katrin			The specificity of stimulus-specific adaptation in human auditory cortex increases with repeated exposure to the adapting stimulus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						stimulus-specific adaptation; human auditory cortex; rapid receptive-field plasticity; electroencephalography; mismatch negativity	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; FREQUENCY-SELECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; N1 WAVE; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; SOUNDS; BRAIN; ERP; CONDUCTANCES	The neural response to a sensory stimulus tends to be more strongly reduced when the stimulus is preceded by the same, rather than a different, stimulus. This stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is ubiquitous across the senses. In hearing, SSA has been suggested to play a role in change detection as indexed by the mismatch negativity. This study sought to test whether SSA, measured in human auditory cortex, is caused by neural fatigue (reduction in neural responsiveness) or by sharpening of neural tuning to the adapting stimulus. For that, we measured event-related cortical potentials to pairs of pure tones with varying frequency separation and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). This enabled us to examine the relationship between the degree of specificity of adaptation as a function of frequency separation and the rate of decay of adaptation with increasing SOA. Using simulations of tonotopic neuron populations, we demonstrate that the fatigue model predicts independence of adaptation specificity and decay rate, whereas the sharpening model predicts interdependence. The data showed independence and thus supported the fatigue model. In a second experiment, we measured adaptation specificity after multiple presentations of the adapting stimulus. The multiple adapters produced more adaptation overall, but the effect was more specific to the adapting frequency. Within the context of the fatigue model, the observed increase in adaptation specificity could be explained by assuming a 2.5-fold increase in neural frequency selectivity. We discuss possible bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of this effect.

This type of BCI often exploits mu and beta oscillations in EEG recorded over the sensorimotor areas, and their event-related desynchronization (ERD) following motor imagery is believed to represent increased sensorimotor cortex excitability. However, it remains unclear whether the sensorimotor cortex excitability is actually correlated with ERD. Thus we assessed the association of ERD with primary motor cortex (M1) excitability during motor imagery of right wrist movement. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twenty healthy participants were recruited. The participants performed 7 s of rest followed by 5 s of motor imagery and received online visual feedback of the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand M1 while performing the motor imagery task. TMS was applied to the right hand M1 when ERD exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF were recorded from the agonist muscle of the imagined hand movement. Results showed that the large ERD during wrist motor imagery was associated with significantly increased MEP amplitudes and reduced SICI but no significant changes in ICF. Thus ERD magnitude during wrist motor imagery represents M1 excitability. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that a motor imagery task involving ERD may induce changes in corticospinal excitability similar to changes accompanying actual movements.

While Squires et al. (1976) showed and modeled dependencies of P300 amplitudes from observed stimuli on various time scales, Mars et al. (2008) proposed a computational model keeping track of stimulus probabilities on a long-term time scale. We suggest here a computational model which integrates prior information with short-term, long-term, and alternation-based experiential influences on P300 amplitude fluctuations. To evaluate the new model, we measured trial-by-trial P300 amplitude fluctuations in a simple two-choice response time task, and tested the computational models of trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes using Bayesian model evaluation. The results reveal that the new digital filtering (DIF) model provides a superior account of the trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes when compared to both Squires et al.'s (1976) model, and Mars et al.'s (2008) model. We show that the P300-generating system can be described as two parallel first-order infinite impulse response (IIR) low-pass filters and an additional fourth-order finite impulse response (FIR) high-pass filter. Implications of the acquired data are discussed with regard to the neurobiological distinction between short-term, long-term, and working memory as well as from the point of view of predictive coding models and Bayesian learning theories of cortical function.

However, little is known regarding the underlying phonological mechanisms of rhyme awareness in dyslexia, as rhyme awareness is typically assessed using explicit behavioural measures that represent only the endpoint of processing and often lack phonological distracters. We examined event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to auditory word pairs that differed in phonological overlap during a rhyme judgement task given to 6-year-old beginning readers who were at risk for dyslexia (n=30) and typical-reading age-matched controls (n=29). ERPs were recorded in response to word pairs with various types of phonological overlap, including rhyming (e.g., wall-ball), non-rhyming overlapping (e.g., bell-ball) and non-rhyming unrelated (e.g., sock-ball) word pairs. Both groups of participants exhibited N400 responses for basic rhyme judgements vs. unrelated targets. In the typical-reading controls, the neural responses also differed between the rhyming targets and the non-rhyming overlapping targets, whereas neural responses to these targets were similar in the group of children at risk for dyslexia, indicating difficulties in their ability to process similar-sounding, non-rhyming targets. These findings suggest that typical-reading children solve the rhyme judgement task using a more analytical approach, whereas children who are at risk for dyslexia base their judgments on a comparison of overall sound similarity.

Deconstructing the early visual electrocortical responses to face and house stimuli	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						faces; N170; P100; independent component analysis; event-related potentials; robust estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRIAL EEG DYNAMICS; RECOGNITION; OBJECT; CATEGORIZATION; PERCEPTION; REPETITION; INVERSION; ATTENTION; ERPS	The initial timing of face-specific effects in event-related potentials (ERPs) is a point of contention in face-processing research. The occasional reports of a larger P100 to face stimuli compared to other image categories is often attributed to differences in low-level stimulus characteristics. Separating the P100 from the classic N170 effect has not been done except by adjusting stimuli to control for low-level stimulus characteristics, which yields robust face effects only after 130 ms. In the present study we use a stimulus set with minimal controls for low-level characteristics. This produces significantly larger (P < 0.01) P100 and N170 amplitudes for images of faces compared to houses in a group effect. However, with independent component analysis (ICA), we demonstrate that (a) the P100 scalp effect stems from a neural network that is indeed independent of that producing the N170 effect, despite the N170 component being active at the time of the P100; (b) compared to the N170 effect, the P100 effect is less reliable even when it is present because of intersubject variability; and (c) some individuals show a component with a larger response to houses over faces at the time of the P100 that is undetectable at the scalp because the activation of larger spatiotemporally overlapping activity cancels its field projection. Thus, with ICA, we are able to account for the general finding in the literature of a consistent N170 face effect and a less reliable P100 face effect at the level of anatomically independent electrocortical processes.

Discriminating neurological from psychiatric hypersomnia using the forced awakening test	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep inertia; Event-related potentials; Hypersomnia	SLEEP LATENCY TEST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TEST MSLT; WAKEFULNESS TEST; INERTIA; NARCOLEPSY; MAINTENANCE; DIAGNOSIS; STANDARD; WAVE	Introduction. - Sleep inertia refers to the inability to attain full alertness following awakening from sleep and is a major component of hypersomnia. As event-related potentials (ERPs) are correlated to the degree of consciousness, they allow exploring information processing in transitional states of vigilance. Their modifications during forced awakening (FA) context have been shown to reflect sleep inertia. Objectives. - To assess the diagnostic value of a FA test using an oddball stimulation protocol during a nap in a representative sample of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Methods. - One hundred and seventy three patients [30 narcolepsy, 62 idiopathic hypersomnia, 33 sleep apnoea syndrome, and 48 other (mainly psychiatric) hypersomnia] performed an auditory target detection stimulation task during pre-, post-nap wakefulness, and during two successive intra-nap FA while the EEG was simultaneously recorded. Both the accuracy of target detection and the ERPs were evaluated. ERPs during forced awakening test were considered to reflect sleep inertia if they presented with a P300 delay and/or sleep negativities (N350/N550). Results. - Pre-nap behavior and ERPs were normal in all patients. Behavioral results were significantly worse during FA than during wakefulness for all groups of patients. P300 latencies were significantly delayed on FA conditions in each group of patients except the psychiatric group. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of sleep inertia were 64% and 94%, respectively, with predictive values of 96% (positive) and 50% (negative).

It is currently a challenge to extract the mismatch negativity (MMN) waveform on the basis of a small number of EEG trials, which are typically unbalanced between conditions. Approach. In order to address this issue, a method combining the techniques of resampling and spatial filtering is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the first step of the method, termed 'resampling difference', randomly samples the standard and deviant sweeps, and then subtracts standard sweeps from deviant sweeps. The second step of the method employs the spatial filters designed by a signal-to-noise ratio maximizer (SIM) to extract the MMN component. The SIM algorithm can maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for event-related potentials (ERPs) to improve extraction. Simulation data were used to evaluate the influence of three parameters (i.e. trial number, repeated-SIM times and sampling times) on the performance of the proposed method. Main results. Results demonstrated that it was feasible and reliable to extract the MMN waveform using the method. Finally, an oddball paradigm with auditory stimuli of different frequencies was employed to record a few trials (50 trials of deviant sweeps and 250 trials of standard sweeps) of EEG data from 11 adult subjects. Results showed that the method could effectively extract the MMN using the EEG data of each individual subject. Significance. The extracted MMN waveform has a significantly larger peak amplitude and shorter latencies in response to the more deviant stimuli than in response to the less deviant stimuli, which agreed with the MMN properties reported in previous literature using grand-averaged EEG data of multi-subjects.

Since EEG signals are very weak and is from a source with high output impedance, in addition to amplification of the signal and filtering, design of a differential pre-amplifier with high common-mode rejection ratio and high signal-to-noise ratio was very important. In order to minimize the requirements of the notch filters to remove power line interference, Driven Right Leg (DRL) technique was integrated in the analog design for reducing common mode voltage of the patient body. The instrumentation amplifier with DRL was followed by a high pass filter stage, two amplifier stages and a low pass filter stage. The Digital signal processing techniques were implemented in LabVIEW (National Instruments) with further filtering for power line noise, ability to identify the most significant EEG band present in acquired signal, and capability for further analysis of the signal. A high performance single channel EEG system with high input impedance, high signal to noise ratio, and high amplification range was achieved for the use under non shielded conditions. The performance of individual blocks as well as the integrated system was verified. Testing results showed that the performance of all parts of the EEG system satisfies the design specifications. The effectiveness of the design was verified by comparing to results from Great Lakes Neurotechnologies BioRadio 150 system as well as using EEG signals obtained during visual and motor tasks.

SWDs are concomitant with a complete or partial impairment of consciousness, notably expressed by an interruption of ongoing behaviour together with a lack of conscious perception of external stimuli. It is largely considered that the paroxysmal synchronizations during the epileptic episode transiently render the thalamocortical system incapable of transmitting primary sensory information to the cortex. Here, we examined in young patients and in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established genetic model of absence epilepsy, how sensory inputs are processed in the related cortical areas during SWDs. In epileptic patients, visual event-related potentials (ERPs) were still present in the occipital EEG when the stimuli were delivered during seizures, with a significant increase in amplitude compared to interictal periods and a decrease in latency compared to that measured from non-epileptic subjects. Using simultaneous in vivo EEG and intracellular recordings from the primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS and non-epileptic rats, we found that ERPs and firing responses of related pyramidal neurons to whisker deflection were not significantly modified during SWDs. However, the intracellular subthreshold synaptic responses in somatosensory cortical neurons during seizures had larger amplitude compared to quiescent situations. These convergent findings from human patients and a rodent genetic model show the persistence of cortical responses to sensory stimulations during SWDs, indicating that the brain can still process external stimuli during absence seizures. They also demonstrate that the disruption of conscious perception during absences is not due to an obliteration of information transfer in the thalamocortical system. The possible mechanisms rendering the cortical operation ineffective for conscious perception are discussed, but their definite elucidation will require further investigations.

Unmasking the obligatory components of nociceptive event-related brain potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pain; nociception; event-related potentials; primary somatosensory cortex; laser-evoked potentials; intraepidermal stimulation	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PAIN MATRIX; CORTICAL RESPONSE; BLIND SEPARATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; EEG RESPONSES; STIMULI; HUMANS; PERCEPTION	It has been hypothesized that the human cortical responses to nociceptive and nonnociceptive somatosensory inputs differ. Supporting this view, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by thermal nociceptive stimuli have been suggested to originate from areas 1 and 2 of the contralateral primary somatosensory (S1), operculo-insular, and cingulate cortices, whereas the early components of nonnociceptive SEPs mainly originate from area 3b of S1. However, to avoid producing a burn lesion, and sensitize or fatigue nociceptors, thermonociceptive SEPs are typically obtained by delivering a small number of stimuli with a large and variable interstimulus interval (ISI). In contrast, the early components of nonnociceptive SEPs are usually obtained by applying many stimuli at a rapid rate. Hence, previously reported differences between nociceptive and nonnociceptive SEPs could be due to differences in signal-to-noise ratio and/or differences in the contribution of cognitive processes related, for example, to arousal and attention. Here, using intraepidermal electrical stimulation to selectively activate A delta-nociceptors at a fast and constant 1-s ISI, we found that the nociceptive SEPs obtained with a long ISI are no longer identified, indicating that these responses are not obligatory for nociception. Furthermore, using a blind source separation, we found that, unlike the obligatory components of nonnociceptive SEPs, the obligatory components of nociceptive SEPs do not receive a significant contribution from a contralateral source possibly originating from S1. Instead, they were best explained by sources compatible with bilateral operculo-insular and/or cingulate locations. Taken together, our results indicate that the obligatory components of nociceptive and nonnociceptive SEPs are fundamentally different.

Neural mechanisms of emotion regulation in childhood anxiety	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Childhood anxiety; event-related potentials; emotion faces; emotion regulation	MENTAL-HEALTH SURVEY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVITY ERN; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PEDIATRIC ANXIETY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; TIME-COURSE; FACES	Background: The present study was designed to examine the cortical processes that mediate cognitive regulation in response to emotion-eliciting stimuli in anxious children. Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from clinically anxious children (n=29) and typically developing children (n=34). Event-related potential components were recorded while children performed a go/no-go task using facial stimuli depicting angry, calm, and happy expressions. Results: Anxious children had significantly greater posterior P1 and frontal N2 amplitudes, components associated with attention/arousal and cognitive control, respectively, than typically developing children. Anxious children also had significantly greater error-related negativities and correct-response negativities relative to typically developing children. For the anxious group only, there were no differences in neural activation between face (emotion) types or trial (Go vs. No-go) types. A regression analysis revealed that No-go N2 amplitudes for calm faces predicted self-reported anxiety levels. Conclusions: Anxious children appeared to show increased cortical activation regardless of the emotional content of the stimuli. Anxious children also showed greater medial-frontal activity regardless of task demands and response accuracy. Taken together, these findings suggest indiscriminate cortical processes that may underlie the hypervigilant regulatory style seen in clinically anxious individuals.

The present study examined the impact of an LPHN3 haplotype that has recently been associated with ADHD (Arcos-Burgos et al., 2010) on neural activity in a visual Go-NoGo task. Two hundred sixteen adult ADHD patients completed a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) while the ongoing EEG was simultaneously recorded. Results showed that patients carrying two copies of the LPHN3 risk haplotype (n = 114) made more omission errors and had a more anterior Go-centroid of the P300 than patients carrying at least one LPHN3 non-risk haplotype (n = 102). Accordingly, the NoGo-Anteriorization (NGA; topographical ERP difference of the Go- and NoGo-condition), a neurophysiological marker of prefrontal functioning, was reduced in the LPHN3 high risk group. However, in the NoGo-condition itself no marked differences attributable to the LPHN3 haplotype could be found. Our findings indicate that, within a sample of ADHD patients, the LPHN3 gene impacts behavioral and neurophysiological measures of cognitive response control. The results of our study further strengthen the concept of an LPHN3 risk haplotype for ADHD and support the usefulness of the endophenotype approach in psychiatric and psychological research.

In such context, reading, and decision-making processes are intertwined and this experiment attempts to separate them through electrophysiological patterns provided by the Eye-Fixation-Related Potentials technique (EFRPs). We conducted an experiment in which EFRPs were recorded while participants read blocks of text that were semantically highly related, moderately related, and unrelated to a given goal. Participants had to decide as fast as possible whether the text was related or not to the semantic goal given at a prior stage. Decision making (stopping information search) may occur when the paragraph is highly related to the goal (positive decision) or when it is unrelated to the goal (negative decision). EFRPs were analyzed on and around typical eye fixations: either on words belonging to the goal (target), subjected to a high rate of positive decisions, or on low frequency unrelated words (incongruent), subjected to a high rate of negative decisions. In both cases, we found EFRPs specific patterns (amplitude peaking between 51 to 120 ms after fixation onset) spreading out on the next words following the goal word and the second fixation after an incongruent word, in parietal and occipital areas.

Indeed, we show a clear spill-over effect showing that the effect on word N spread out on word N + 1 and N + 2.

For example, when a walking person disappears temporarily behind a wall, observers have a clear sense of his physical presence despite the absence of any visual information (movement permanence). To investigate the neural substrates of biological motion permanence, we recorded scalp EEG activity of sixteen subjects while they passively observed either biological or scrambled motion disappearing behind an occluder and reappearing. The moment of the occluder's appearance was either fixed or randomized. The statistical comparison between the biological and scrambled motion ERA waveforms revealed a modulation of activity in centro-parietal and right occipito-temporal regions during the occlusion phase when the biological motion disappearance was time-locked, possibly reflecting the recall of sensorimotor representations. These representations might allow the prediction of moving organisms in occlusion conditions. When the appearance of the occluder was unpredictable there was no difference between biological and scrambled motion either before or during occlusion, indicating that temporal prediction is relevant to the processing of biological motion permanence.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and causes of LOC during diving in former North Sea divers, and the impact on health-related quality of life. Materials and methods: Up to 1990 a total of 373 Norwegian offshore divers worked in the North Sea. From 2000 to 2011, 221 of these were referred to the Department of Occupational Medicine at Haukeland University Hospital for examination due to health complaints. They filled in a questionnaire for registration of diving experience and health complaints, including the SF-36 version 1 for the assessment of quality of life. The questionnaire and the hospital records were systematically reviewed by 2 independent observers. Episodes of LOC during diving and the causes were registered. All participants underwent a clinical neurological examination. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and the event-related brain potential (P300) were recorded. Results: One or more episodes of LOC were reported by 58 of 219 divers. LOC due to gas cut was reported by 27 of these. Divers having experienced LOC due to gas cut had lower SF-36 sub-scores then the rest of the diving population. EEG and P300 recordings did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: A high proportion of former Norwegian North Sea divers reported episodes of LOC, for which gas cut was the most common cause. Both hypoxia and peritraumatic stress associated with the episode could have a long term impact on the quality of life. Neurophysiological functions, however, did not differ between the groups.

Participants were presented with syllables randomly occurring in the left or right ear and spoken by different voices and with a concurrent foveal stream of consonant letters written in darker or lighter fonts. During auditory phonological (A(P)) and non-phonological tasks, they responded to syllables in a designated ear starting with a vowel and spoken by female voices, respectively. These syllables occurred infrequently among standard syllables starting with a consonant and spoken by male voices. During visual phonological and non-phonological tasks, they responded to consonant letters with names starting with a vowel and to letters written in dark fonts, respectively. These letters occurred infrequently among standard letters with names starting with a consonant and written in light fonts. To examine genuine effects of attention and task on ERPs not overlapped by ERPs associated with target processing or deviance detection, these effects were studied only in ERPs to auditory and visual standards. During selective listening to syllables in a designated ear, ERPs to the attended syllables were negatively displaced during both phonological and non-phonological auditory tasks. Selective attention to letters elicited an early negative displacement and a subsequent positive displacement (Pd) of ERPs to attended letters being larger during the visual phonological than non-phonological task suggesting a higher demand for attention during the visual phonological task. Active suppression of unattended speech during the A(P) and non-phonological tasks and during the visual phonological tasks was suggested by a rejection positivity (RP) to unattended syllables. We also found evidence for suppression of the processing of task-irrelevant visual stimuli in visual ERPs during auditory tasks involving left-ear syllables.

A current trend is to describe data by ontologies and semantic web resources. However, classic technologies and models cannot be replaced in a short time. Due to this, dependencies between various data models should be explicitly described and properties, which the models have in common, should be unified. This work summarizes the current state in data modeling. It describes various ways to model and store data and transformation mechanisms between data models. It deals with well-known concepts (relational and object oriented model) as well as with emerging concepts (ontologies). Finally, the hierarchical metadata model consisting of levels with different expressive power is introduced.

We performed high-density EEG source imaging to measure auditory gating of the P50 component of the evoked potential and middle to late latency auditory processing in 21 participants with the 22q11.2 deletion and 17 age-matched healthy controls. While we found no indication of altered P50 suppression in 22q11 DS, we observed marked differences for the first N1 component with increased amplitudes on central electrodes, corresponding to increased activations in dorsal anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex. We also found a left lateralized reduction of activation of primary and secondary auditory cortex during the second N1 (120 ms) and the P2 component in 22q11 DS. Our results show that sensory gating and activations until 50 ms were preserved in 22q11 DS, while impairments appear at latencies that correspond to higher order auditory processing. While the increased activation of cingulate and medial frontal cortex could reflect developmental changes in 22q11 DS, the reduced activity seen in left auditory cortex might serve as a biomarker for the development of schizophrenia, if confirmed by longitudinal research protocols.

Physiological, behavioural and modeling studies suggest this is due to the intrinsic or 'internal' noise in neural systems, which derives from a mixture of bottom-up and top-down sources. We show here that internal noise can form the basis of perceptual decision making when the external signal lacks the required information for the decision. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in listeners attempting to discriminate between identical tones. Since the acoustic signal was constant, bottom-up and top-down influences were under experimental control. We found that early cortical responses to the identical stimuli varied in global field power and topography according to the perceptual decision made, and activity preceding stimulus presentation could predict both later activity and behavioural decision. Our results suggest that activity variations induced by internal noise of both sensory and cognitive origin are sufficient to drive discrimination judgments.

Mothers of 3- and 6-month-olds showed equivalent early-wave (N/P1 visual and N170 face-sensitive) responses to own and unfamiliar baby faces but differentiating late-wave (N/P600 familiar/novel) activity to own versus unfamiliar infant faces. Based on 3 months experience with their own infant's face, mothers' brain patterns give evidence of distinctive late-wave (recognition) sensitivity.

Methods: Nineteen female FMS patients and 18 matched, healthy control subjects underwent EEG examination during brushing stimulation of the right forearm. Participants rated any pain experienced and underwent a manual tender point scale (MTPS) examination. Amplitude changes of cortical rhythms during brushing were analysed in alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) frequency bands. Results: Thirteen patients reported pain during brushing. Independent t-test comparison of event related desynchronisation (ERD) during brushing revealed a cluster of electrodes over ipsilateral (right) central-parietal region which demonstrated ERD in patients only. Clinical MTPS scores correlated with beta-band ERD in this cluster of electrodes. Beamformer analysis revealed a widespread array of source activations in patients, including bilateral insula and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. Control subject source activations were limited to contralateral (left) hemisphere. Conclusions: Results indicate ipsilateral cortical activations in FMS patients, but not in healthy controls, during brushing. Ipsilateral ERD during brushing is associated with MTPS score suggesting abnormal processing of somatosensory input which may contribute to clinical pain. Significance: Altered functioning in FMS may reflect physiological changes in response to afferent somatosensory information manifesting in chronic pain.

These functions subserve response control processes for which fronto-striatal networks have been shown to play an important role. Within these networks, the brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF), which is known to underlie aging effects, plays a pivotal role. We investigated how cognitive subprocesses constituting a cycle of distraction, orientation and refocusing of attention are affected by the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism using event-related potentials (ERPs) in 122 healthy elderly. Using an auditory distraction paradigm we found that the Val/Val genotype confers a disadvantage to its carriers. This disadvantage was partly compensated by intensified attentional shifting mechanisms. It could be based on response selection processes being more vulnerable against interference from distractors in this genotype group. Processes reflecting transient sensory memory processes, or the re-orientation of attention were not affected by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, suggesting a higher importance of BDNF for mechanisms related to response control, than stimulus processing. The results add on recent literature showing that the Met allele confers some benefit to its carriers. We suggest an account for unifying different results of BDNF Val66Met association studies in executive functions, based on the role of BDNF in fronto-striatal circuits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is still known about the neurophysiological correlates of perceptual integration in this condition. We have used a 3D structure-from-motion (SFM) integrative task to characterize the neuronal underpinnings of 3D perception in WS and to probe whether gamma oscillatory patterns reflect changed holistic perception. Coherent faces were parametrically modulated in 3D depth (three different depth levels) to vary levels of stimulus ambiguity. We have found that the electrophysiological (EEG/ERP) correlates of such holistic percepts were distinct across groups. Independent component analysis demonstrated the presence of a novel component with a late positivity around 200 ms that was absent in controls. Source localization analysis of ERP signals showed a posterior occipital shift in WS and reduced parietal dorsal stream sources. Interestingly, low gamma-band oscillations (20-40 Hz) induced by this 3D perceptual integration task were significantly stronger and sustained during the stimulus presentation in WS whereas high gamma-band oscillations (60-90 Hz) were reduced in this clinical model of impaired visual coherence, as compared to controls. These observations suggest that dorsal stream processing of 3D SFM stimuli has distinct neural correlates in WS and different cognitive strategies are employed by these patients to reach visual coherence. Importantly, we found evidence for the presence of different sub-bands (20-40 Hz/60-90 Hz) within the gamma range which can be dissociated concerning the respective role On the coherent percept formation, both in typical and atypical development.

Such methods provide a framework for interpreting measurements made at the single-trial level with respect to a set of two or more distinct mental states. Here, we define an approach in which the output of a binary classifier trained on data from an auditory mismatch paradigm can be used for online tracking of perception and as a neurofeedback signal. The auditory mismatch paradigm is known to induce distinct perceptual states related to the presentation of high- and low-probability stimuli, which are reflected in event-related potential (ERR) components such as the mismatch negativity (MMN). The first part of this paper illustrates how pattern classification methods can be applied to data collected in an MMN paradigm, including discussion of the optimization of preprocessing steps, the interpretation of features and how the performance of these methods generalizes across individual participants and measurement sessions. We then go on to show that the output of these decoding methods can be used in online settings as a continuous index of single-trial brain activation underlying perceptual discrimination. We conclude by discussing several potential domains of application, including neurofeedback, cognitive monitoring and passive brain-computer interfaces.

J	Zoefel, B; Heil, P				Zoefel, Benedikt; Heil, Peter			Detection of near-threshold sounds is independent of EEG phase in common frequency bands	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; oscillation; phase; entrainment; delta-band; alpha-band; auditory; detection threshold	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION	Low-frequency oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are thought to reflect periodic excitability changes of large neural networks. Consistent with this notion, detection probability of near-threshold somatosensory, visual, and auditory targets has been reported to co-vary with the phase of oscillations in the EEG. In audition, entrainment of delta-oscillations to the periodic occurrence of sounds has been suggested to function as a mechanism of attentional selection. Here, we examine in humans whether the detection of brief near-threshold sounds in quiet depends on the phase of EEG oscillations. When stimuli were presented at irregular intervals, we did not find a systematic relationship between detection probability and phase. When stimuli were presented at regular intervals (2-s), reaction times were significantly shorter and we observed phase entrainment of EEG oscillations corresponding to the frequency of stimulus presentation (0.5 Hz), revealing an adjustment of the system to the regular stimulation. The amplitude of the entrained oscillation was higher for hits than for misses, suggesting a link between entrainment and stimulus detection. However, detection was independent of phase at frequencies >= 1 Hz. Furthermore, we show that when the data are analyzed using acausal, though common, algorithms, an apparent "entrainment" of the delta-phase to presented stimuli emerges and detection probability appears to depend on delta-phase, similar to reports in the literature. We show that these effects are artifacts from phase distortion at stimulus onset by contamination with the event-related potential, which differs markedly for hits and misses. This highlights the need to carefully deal with this common problem, since otherwise it might bias and mislead this exciting field of research.

Task and Spatial Frequency Modulations of Object Processing: An EEG Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; GAMMA BAND RESPONSES; TIME-COURSE; BASIC-LEVEL; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; EFFECT SIZE; CATEGORIZATION; PERCEPTION; FACE; RECOGNITION	Visual object processing may follow a coarse-to-fine sequence imposed by fast processing of low spatial frequencies (LSF) and slow processing of high spatial frequencies (HSF). Objects can be categorized at varying levels of specificity: the superordinate (e.g. animal), the basic (e.g. dog), or the subordinate (e.g. Border Collie). We tested whether superordinate and more specific categorization depend on different spatial frequency ranges, and whether any such dependencies might be revealed by or influence signals recorded using EEG. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency (TF) analysis to examine the time course of object processing while participants performed either a grammatical gender-classification task (which generally forces basic-level categorization) or a living/non-living judgement (superordinate categorization) on everyday, real-life objects. Objects were filtered to contain only HSF or LSF. We found a greater positivity and greater negativity for HSF than for LSF pictures in the P1 and N1 respectively, but no effects of task on either component. A later, fronto-central negativity (N350) was more negative in the gender-classification task than the superordinate categorization task, which may indicate that this component relates to semantic or syntactic processing. We found no significant effects of task or spatial frequency on evoked or total gamma band responses. Our results demonstrate early differences in processing of HSF and LSF content that were not modulated by categorization task, with later responses reflecting such higher-level cognitive factors.

In this experiment, EEG measures were employed to assess for transfer of emotional functions across three 3-member equivalence classes in an extension of Dougher, Auguston, Markham, Greenway, & Wulfert's (1994) seminal work on the transfer of arousal functions. Specifically, 12 human participants were trained in the following match-to-sample performances A1 = B1, A2 = B2, A3 = B3 and B1 = C1, B2 = C2, B3 = C3. After successfully testing for the emergence of symmetry relations (B1 = A1, B2 = A2, B3 = A3 and C1 = B1, C2 = B2, C3 = B3), visual images depicting emotionally positive and emotionally negative content were presented with A1 and A3, respectively, using a mixed stimulus pairing-compounding procedure. A2 was paired with emotionally neutral images. Next, EEG data were recorded as participants were exposed to a forced-choice recognition task with stimuli A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3 and three novel stimuli A4, B4 and C4. Results yielded differential EEG effects for stimuli paired directly with emotional versus neutral images. Critically, differential EEG effects were also recorded across the C stimuli that were equivalently related to the A stimulus set. The EEG data coincide with previous reports of emotion-specific EEG effects, indicating that the initial emotional impact of a stimulus may emerge based on direct stimulus pairing and derived stimulus relations.

Methods: To this end we developed a multistage signal processing methodology comprising blind source separation coupled with a neural network based feature extraction and classification method. Results: Changes in the amplitude and phase of brain sources estimates in the VLF band between rest and task were enhanced with increased task difficulty, but remained lower than those experienced in higher frequency bands. The slow wave variations were also significantly correlated with task performance measures, and hence with the level of task-directed attention. Conclusions: These findings suggest that besides their prominent sensitivity to external stimulation, VLFOs also contribute to the cortical ongoing background activity which may not be specifically related to task-specific attention and performance. Significance: Our work provides important insight into the association between VLF brain activity and conventional EEG frequency bands, and presents a novel framework for assessing neural activity during various mental conditions and psychiatric states.

Besides a crucial role of oscillatory activity in the emergence of other neurological and psychiatric diseases, recent evidence indicates a key role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This review summarizes the current knowledge on pathological alterations of oscillatory brain activity in association with liver dysfunction and HE in the context of spontaneous brain activity, motor symptoms, sensory processing, and attention. The existing literature demonstrates a prominent slowing of the frequency of oscillatory activity as shown for spontaneous brain activity at rest, with respect to deficits of motor behavior and motor symptoms, and in the context of visual attention processes. The observed slowing extends across different subsystems of the brain and has been confirmed across different frequency bands, providing evidence for ubiquitous changes of oscillatory activity in HE. For example, the frequency of cortico-muscular coherence in HE patients appears at the frequency of the mini-asterixis (<= 12 Hz), while cirrhotics without overt signs of HE show coherence similar to healthy subjects, i.e. at 13-30 Hz. Interestingly, the so-called critical flicker frequency (CFF) as a measure of the processing of an oscillating visual stimulus has emerged as a useful tool to quantify HE disease severity, correlating with behavioral and neurophysiological alterations. Moreover, the CFF reliably distinguishes patients with manifest HE from cirrhotics without any signs of HE and healthy controls using a cut-off frequency of 39 Hz. In conclusion, oscillatory activity is globally slowed in HE in close association with HE symptoms and disease severity. Although the underlying causal mechanisms are not yet understood, these results indicate that pathological changes of oscillatory activity play an important role in the pathophysiology of HE.

Emotional and non-emotional pathways to impulsive behavior and addiction	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						impulsivity; emotion; addiction; decision-making; delay discounting; Go/No-go; UPPS-P; N2 ERP	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; GO/NO-GO; PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RISKY BEHAVIOR; COCAINE USERS; SUBSTANCE-USE; N2 COMPONENT; ERP	Impulsivity is tightly linked to addiction. However, there are several pathways by means of which impulsive individuals are more prone to become addicts, or to suffer an addiction more intensely and for a longer period. One of those pathways involves an inadequate appraisal or regulation of positive and negative emotions, leading to lack of control over hazardous behaviors, and inappropriate decisions. In the present work, we assessed cocaine-dependent individuals (CDI; n = 20), pathological gamblers (PG; n = 21), and healthy controls (HC; n = 23) in trait impulsivity measures (UPPS-P model's dimensions), and decision-making tasks (Go/No-go; delay-discounting task). During the Go/No-go task, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded, and Go/No-go stimuli-evoked potentials (ERP) were extracted. Theory-driven ERP analyses focused on the No-go > Go difference in the N2 ERP. Our results show that negative urgency is one of the several psychological features that distinguish addicts from HC. Nevertheless, among the dimensions of trait impulsivity, negative urgency is unique at independently covarying with gambling over-pathologization in the PG sample. Cocaine-dependent individuals performed more poorly than gamblers in the Go/No-go task, and showed abnormal Go/No-go stimuli-evoked potentials. The difference between the No-go stimulus-evoked N2, and the Go one was attenuated by severity and intensity of chronic cocaine use. Emotional dimensions of impulsivity, however, did not influence Go/No-go performance.

The effects of elevated endogenous GABA levels on movement-related network oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; GABA; Tiagabine; Beta rhythm; Event-related desynchronisation; Gamma oscillations; Motor cortex	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; UPTAKE INHIBITOR; TIAGABINE; FREQUENCY; RECEPTORS; TRANSPORTER	The EEG/MEG signal is generated primarily by the summation of the post-synaptic potentials of cortical principal cells. At a microcircuit level, these glutamatergic principal cells are reciprocally connected to GABAergic interneurons and cortical oscillations are thought to be dependent on the balance of excitation and inhibition between these cell types. To investigate the dependence of movement-related cortical oscillations on excitation-inhibition balance, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks GABA Transporter 1 (GAT-1), the GABA uptake transporter and increases endogenous GABA activity. In a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design, in 15 healthy participants we administered either 15 mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalograms, while the participants performed a movement task, prior to, one hour post, three hour post and five hour post tiagabine ingestion. Using time-frequency analysis of beamformer source reconstructions, we quantified the baseline level of beta activity (15-30 Hz), the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR), beta event-related desynchronisation (beta-ERD) and movement-related gamma synchronisation (MRGS) (60-90 Hz). Our results demonstrated that tiagabine, and hence elevated endogenous GABA levels causes, an elevation of baseline beta power, enhanced beta-ERD and reduced PMBR, but no modulation of MRGS. Comparing our results to recent literature (Hall et al., 2011) we suggest that beta-ERD may be a GABA(A) receptor mediated process while PMBR may be GABA(B) receptor mediated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A better understanding of the PA is needed in order to generate improved methods for reducing its effect in EEG-fMRI experiments. Here we performed a study aimed at identifying the relative contributions of three putative sources of the PA (cardiac-pulse-driven head rotation, the Hall effect due to pulsatile blood flow and pulse-driven expansion of the scalp) to its amplitude and variability. EEG recordings were made from 6 subjects lying in a 3 T scanner. Accelerometers were fixed on the forehead and temple to monitor head motion. A bite-bar and vacuum cushion were used to restrain the head, thus greatly attenuating the contribution of cardiac-driven head rotation to the PA, while an insulating layer placed between the head and the EEG electrodes was used to eliminate the Hall voltage contribution. Using the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the PA averaged over leads and time as a measure of the PA amplitude, we found that head restraint and insulating layer reduced the PA by 61% and 42%, respectively, when compared with the PA induced with the subject relaxed, indicating that cardiac-pulse-driven head rotation is the dominant source of the PA. With both the insulating layer and head restraint in place, the PA was reduced in RMS amplitude by 78% compared with the relaxed condition, the remaining PA contribution resulting from scalp expansion or residual head motion. The variance of the PA across cardiac cycles was more strongly reduced by the insulating layer than the head restraint, indicating that the flow-induced Hall voltage makes a larger contribution than pulse-driven head rotation to the variability of the PA.

A relatively selective trigeminal stimulus, CO2, and a relatively selective olfactory stimulus, H2S, were delivered with an olfactometer to young, healthy volunteers. The analysis was performed in a classical (5-electrode, main ERPs peaks) and modern approach (high topographical resolution, inverse solution, source localization). Results of microstate segmentation highlighted 5 maps that generally described the two processes at cerebral level. The trigeminal response differed from the olfactory response up to 300 ms after stimulus onset. In this time range, source analysis pointed out that the olfactory stimulation involved olfactory related areas, while trigeminal stimulation involved noxious/somatosensoiy specific brain areas. Moreover, from 300 ms on our data showed a similarity between the two processes. Statistical parametrical mapping of the differences between conditions suggested greater activation in a specific motor/sniffing network for the CO2 stimulation (probably related to a regulation of the potential noxious stimulus) and a greater activation of the ipsilateral primary olfactory cortex for H2S.

Participants were assessed from age 17 through 29 for lifetime externalizing (EXT) disorders. EEG comparisons from three topographic regions were examined for P3 amplitude and TF-PCs at delta and theta frequency ranges. Significant P3 amplitude reductions were found in those with EXT for both regional and site-Pz analyses, with stronger effects observed the greater the EXT comorbidity. Reductions were also observed in all eight TF-PCs extracted, with a delta component yielding frontal effects not apparent in the time domain. Overall, results suggest that these brain measures continue, at age 29, to provide effective indices of EXT that potentially tap a neural substrate related to behavioral disinhibition.

A video-set for experimental assessment of emotions during social interaction: validation and first data on neuronal effects	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHIATRIE PSYCHOLOGIE UND PSYCHOTHERAPIE			German	Article						Emotional videos; social stimuli; social anxiety; event related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHEMATIC FACES; RESPONSES; ANXIETY; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; AMYGDALA; STRESS; SCALE; EYE	Social interactions are complex and frequently trigger positive and negative emotional reactions. Several psychopathologies are characterized by disordered social interaction patterns. Experimental approaches in neuroscience employ emotional faces allowing high control over stimulus and presentation timing and thereby maximizing the internal validity of these studies. The flip side of this approach is lower external validity because of poor mapping of the complexity of social interaction. In the present study we propose a compromise between internal and external validity in the study of social interactions. We present a set of video clips, 'E.Vids' in which ten actors each make eight short positive, negative and neutral statements towards the observer, resulting in 240 film clips. Data from a web-based validation study (N = 310) show that a broad spectrum of socially relevant (e. g., pride, approval, disapproval, embarrassment) and basic emotions (e. g., anger, happiness) is activated and that positive, neutral, and negative sentences are reliably discriminated on valence and arousal dimensions. An EEG study (N = 23) further demonstrates enhanced negativity on right frontotemporal slow wave potentials for negative relative to neutral sentences. E.Vids could inspire behavioral and neuroscientific study of social interaction in German speaking countries and could be used to characterize social deficits in several psychopathologies.

Varying task demands in the visual oddball paradigm: Implications for task design and results interpretation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Function magnetic resonance imaging; Visual oddball; Task design; Target detection; Decision making	TARGET DETECTION TASK; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; CYTOARCHITECTONIC AREAS; CINGULATE CORTEX; BOLD-RESPONSE; BRAIN IMAGES; RARE TARGET; STIMULI	We investigate the effects of variations in response requirements on BOLD activation in a visual oddball task and consider implications for fMRI task designs. Sixteen healthy subjects completed 3 runs of a visual oddball task: passive, count and respond. Besides expected activation patterns during passive viewing, we identified joint activations, but more importantly crucial differences between the count and respond versions of the task. Middle frontal gyrus activation was seen in the respond but not the count condition suggesting that this region is associated with action execution rather than the decision-making aspect of the task. In addition, activation observed in the central opercular cortex and parietal operculum in the respond (but not count) condition is likely to reflect integration of the sensory, decision and response processes. We also observed activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA) during count as well as respond. Since the count condition requires no motor planning or response our data provide evidence for an SMA involvement in decision-making. Our study clearly shows that the count and respond versions of the visual oddball task result in different patterns of BOLD activation that could both be attributed to 'target detection' if information on the respective other condition was not available. We also show that considering the elements of a complex task is crucial when transferring it from one imaging modality to another and that a motor response is not always necessary in fMRI studies when the task has been set up appropriately.

Cognitive function has been found to be a better predictor of functional outcome than symptom levels. Changed mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects abnormalities of early auditory processing in schizophrenia. Up to now, no studies for the effects of aripiprazole on MMN in schizophrenia have been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: Subjects included 26 patients with schizophrenia, and 26 controls. Psychopathology was rated in patients with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline, after 4- and 8-week treatments with aripiprazole. Auditory stimuli for ERP consisted of 100 millisecond/1000 Hz standards, intermixed with 100 millisecond/1500 Hz frequency deviants and 250 millisecond/1000 Hz duration deviants. EEG was recorded at Fz. BESA 5.1.8 was used to perform data analysis. MMN waveforms were obtained by subtracting waveforms elicited by standards from waveforms elicited by frequency-or duration-deviant stimuli. Aripiprazole decreased all PANSS. Patients showed smaller mean amplitudes of frequency and duration MMN at baseline than did controls. A repeated measure ANOVA with sessions (i.e., baseline, 4- and 8-week treatments) and MMN type (frequency vs. duration) as within-subject factors revealed no significant MMN type or MMN type x session main effect for MMN amplitudes. Session main effect was significant. LSD tests demonstrated significant differences between MMN amplitudes at 8 weeks and those at both baseline and 4 weeks. There was significant negative correlation between changes in amplitudes of frequency and duration MMN and changes in PANSS total scores at baseline and follow-up periods. Conclusions: Aripiprazole improved the amplitudes of MMN. MMN offers objective evidence that treatment with the aripiprazole may ameliorate preattentive deficits in schizophrenia.

The fate of object memory traces under change detection and change blindness	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Long-term memory (LTM); Short-term memory (STM); Attention; Inattentional blindness; Awareness; Consciousness	RECOGNITION MEMORY; VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS; EXPLICIT MEMORY; NATURAL SCENES; AWARENESS; IMPLICIT; BRAIN; RETRIEVAL; DISSOCIATION; INFORMATION	Observers often fail to detect substantial changes in a visual scene. This so-called change blindness is often taken as evidence that visual representations are sparse and volatile. This notion rests on the assumption that the failure to detect a change implies that representations of the changing objects are lost all together. However, recent evidence suggests that under change blindness, object memory representations may be formed and stored, but not retrieved. This study investigated the fate of object memory representations when changes go unnoticed. Participants were presented with scenes consisting of real world objects, one of which changed on each trial, while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants were first asked to localize where the change had occurred. In an additional recognition task, participants then discriminated old objects, either from the pre-change or the post-change scene, from entirely new objects. Neural traces of object memories were studied by comparing ERPs for old and novel objects. Participants performed poorly in the detection task and often failed to recognize objects from the scene, especially pre-change objects. However, a robust old/novel effect was observed in the ERP, even when participants were change blind and did not recognize the old object. This implicit memory trace was found both for pre-change and post-change objects. These findings suggest that object memories are stored even under change blindness. Thus, visual representations may not be as sparse and volatile as previously thought. Rather, change blindness may point to a failure to retrieve and use these representations for change detection.

Multimodal imaging reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of recollection	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic; Recollection; PFC; Precuneus; Multimodal; MEG; fMRI	ANTERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATE POSTERIOR NEGATIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL CHANGES; EPISODIC MEMORY; PARIETAL CORTEX; RETRIEVAL; FMRI; EEG; ERP; MEG	Functional MRI research suggests that different frontal and parietal cortical regions support strategic processes that are engaged at different stages of recollection, from pre-retrieval processing of a cue to post-retrieval maintenance and evaluation of recollected information. Whereas some of these regions respond in a domain-general way, other regions are sensitive to the type of information being recollected. However, the low temporal resolution of fMRI cannot distinguish component processes at the time-scale at which recollection occurs. We therefore combined fMRI with the excellent temporal resolution of source localised EEG/MEG to investigate the spatiotemporal neural dynamics of recollection. fMRI and EEG/MEG data were collected from the same participants in two sessions while they retrieved different types of episodic information. This multimodal imaging approach revealed striking consistency between the regions identified with fMRI and EEG/MEG, providing novel evidence of how these brain areas interact over time to support source recollection. For domain-general recollection, results from both modalities converged in showing the strongest activations in medial parietal cortex, which according to EEG/MEG was reliable at a late retrieval stage. Domain-specific source recollection increased fMRI and EEG/MEG activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, which EEG/MEG indicated also to be recruited during a post-recollection stage. The findings suggest that although medial parietal and left lateral prefrontal regions mediate functionally different retrieval processes, they are both engaged at a late stage of episodic retrieval.

In two experiments we examined whether such information can be activated in an anticipatory fashion. In Experiment 1, listeners' eye movements were tracked while they were listening to sentences that were predictive of a specific critical word (e.g., "moon" in "In 1969 Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon"). 500 ms before the acoustic onset of the critical word, participants were shown four-object displays featuring three unrelated distractor objects and a critical object, which was either the target object (e.g., moon), an object with a similar shape (e.g., tomato), or an unrelated control object (e.g., rice). In a time window before shape information from the spoken target word could be retrieved, participants already tended to fixate both the target and the shape competitors more often than they fixated the control objects, indicating that they had anticipatorily activated the shape of the upcoming word's referent. This was confirmed in Experiment 2, which was an ERP experiment without picture displays. Participants listened to the same lead-in sentences as in Experiment 1. The sentence-final words corresponded to the predictable target, the shape competitor, or the unrelated control object (yielding, for instance, "In 1969 Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon/tomato/rice"). N400 amplitude in response to the final words was significantly attenuated in the shape-related compared to the unrelated condition. Taken together, these results suggest that listeners can activate perceptual attributes of objects before they are referred to in an utterance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it remains unclear whether the corticospinal excitability is actually correlated with ERD. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between the ERD magnitude and the excitability of primary motor cortex (M1) and spinal motoneurons. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and spinal motoneuronal excitability was tested by F-waves using peripheral nerve stimulation. Results showed that large ERD during motor imagery was associated with significantly increased F-wave persistence and reduced SICI, but no significant changes in ICF and the response average of F-wave amplitudes. Our findings suggest that ERD magnitude during motor imagery represents the instantaneous excitability of both M1 and spinal motoneurons. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that ERD-based BCI with motor imagery task increases corticospinal excitability as changes accompanying actual movements.

Integration Operations during Irony Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ERP EVIDENCE; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; DISCOURSE; SENTENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL	The combined knowledge of word meanings and grammatical rules does not allow a listener to grasp the intended meaning of a speaker's utterance. Pragmatic inferences on the part of the listener are also required. The present work focuses on the processing of ironic utterances (imagine a slow day being described as "really productive'') because these clearly require the listener to go beyond the linguistic code. Such utterances are advantageous experimentally because they can serve as their own controls in the form of literal sentences (now imagine an active day being described as "really productive'') as we employ techniques from electrophysiology (EEG). Importantly, the results confirm previous ERP findings showing that irony processing elicits an enhancement of the P600 component (Regel et al., 2011). More original are the findings drawn from Time Frequency Analysis (TFA) and especially the increase of power in the gamma band in the 280-400 time-window, which points to an integration among different streams of information relatively early in the comprehension of an irony. This represents a departure from traditional accounts of language processing which generally view pragmatic inferences as late-arriving. We propose that these results indicate that unification operations between the linguistic code and contextual information play a critical role throughout the course of irony processing and earlier than previously thought.

Stimulation must affect differently brain networks in sleep versus wake, but these differences have yet to be quantified. We recorded cortical activity in stage 2 (SII) sleep and wake using EEG while a tone was intermittently played. Zero-lag correlation measured input to pairs of sensors in the network; cross-correlation and phase-lag index measured pairwise corticocortical connectivity. Our analysis revealed that under baseline conditions, the cortical network, in particular the central regions of the frontoparietal cortex, interact at a characteristic latency of 50ms, but only during wake, not sleep. Nonsalient auditory stimulation causes far greater perturbation of connectivity from baseline in sleep than wake, both in the response to common input and corticocortical connectivity. The findings have key implications for sensory processing.

A condition known as congenital amusia is characterized by musical difficulties, notably in the detection of gross musical violations. However, there has been increasing evidence that individuals with the disorder show preserved musical ability when probed using implicit methods. To further characterize the degree to which amusic individuals show evidence of latent sensitivity to musical structure, particularly in the context of stimuli that are ecologically valid, electrophysiological recordings were taken from a sample of amusic and control participants as they listened to real melodies. To encourage them to pay attention to the music, participants were asked to detect occasional notes in a different timbre. Using a computational model of auditory expectation to identify points of varying levels of expectedness in these melodies (in units of information content (IC), a measure which has an inverse relationship with probability), ERP analysis investigated the extent to which the amusic brain differs from that of controls when processing notes of high IC (low probability) as compared to low IC ones (high probability). The data revealed a novel effect that was highly comparable in both groups: Notes with high IC reliably elicited a delayed P2 component relative to notes with low IC, suggesting that amusic individuals, like controls, found these notes more difficult to evaluate. However, notes with high IC were also characterized by an early frontal negativity in controls that was attenuated in amusic individuals. A correlation of this early negative effect with the ability to make accurate note expectedness judgments (previous data collected from a subset of the current sample) was shown to be present in typical individuals but compromised in individuals with amusia: a finding in line with evidence of a close relationship between the amplitude of such a response and explicit knowledge of musical deviance.

Poststimulus undershoots in cerebral blood flow and BOLD fMRI responses are modulated by poststimulus neuronal activity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; event-related synchronization; rebound; alpha power; neurovascular-coupling	CALIBRATED FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEGATIVE BOLD; MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNAL; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS	fMRI is the foremost technique for noninvasive measurement of human brain function. However, its utility is limited by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response. Though the primary peak of the hemodynamic response is modulated by neuronal activity, the origin of the typically negative poststimulus signal is poorly understood and its amplitude assumed to covary with the primary response. We use simultaneous recordings of EEG with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) fMRI during unilateral median nerve stimulation to show that the poststimulus fMRI signal is neuronally modulated. We observe high spatial agreement between concurrent BOLD and CBF responses to median nerve stimulation, with primary signal increases in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and primary signal decreases in ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. During the poststimulus period, the amplitude and directionality (positive/negative) of the BOLD signal in both contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex depends on the poststimulus synchrony of 8-13 Hz EEG neuronal activity, which is often considered to reflect cortical inhibition, along with concordant changes in CBF and metabolism. Therefore we present conclusive evidence that the fMRI time course represents a hemodynamic signature of at least two distinct temporal phases of neuronal activity, substantially improving understanding of the origin of the BOLD response and increasing the potential measurements of brain function provided by fMRI. We suggest that the poststimulus EEG and fMRI responses may be required for the resetting of the entire sensory network to enable a return to resting-state activity levels.

J	Richter, N; Schroger, E; Rubsamen, R				Richter, Nicole; Schroeger, Erich; Ruebsamen, Rudolf			Differences in evoked potentials during the active processing of sound location and motion	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Sound motion; Sound localization; Inter-hemispheric differences	AUDITORY MOTION; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; RECORDINGS REVEAL; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT; NEURONS; PARIETAL; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; INFORMATION	Difference in the processing of motion and static sounds in the human cortex was studied by electroencephalography with subjects performing an active discrimination task. Sound bursts were presented in the acoustic free-field between 47 degrees to the left and 47 degrees to the right under three different stimulus conditions: (i) static, (ii) leftward motion, and (iii) rightward motion. In an active oddball design, subject was asked to detect target stimuli which were randomly embedded within a stream of frequently occurring non-target events (i.e. 'standards') and rare non-target stimuli (i.e. 'deviants'). The respective acoustic stimuli were presented in blocks with each stimulus type presented in either of three stimulus conditions: as target, as non-target, or as standard. The analysis focussed on the event related potentials evoked by the different stimulus types under the respective standard condition. Same as in previous studies, all three different acoustic stimuli elicited the obligatory P1/N1/P2 complex in the range of 50-200 ms. However, comparisons of ERPs elicited by static stimuli and both kinds of motion stimuli yielded differences as early as similar to 100 ms after stimulus-onset, i.e. at the level of the exogenous N1 and P2 components. Differences in signal amplitudes were also found in a time window 300-400 ms ('d300-400 ms' component in 'motion-minus-static' difference wave). For motion stimuli, the N1 amplitudes were larger over the hemisphere contralateral to the origin of motion, while for static stimuli N1 amplitudes over both hemispheres were in the same range. Contrary to the N1 component, the ERP in the 'd300-400 ms' time period showed stronger responses over the hemisphere contralateral to motion termination, with the static stimuli again yielding equal bilateral amplitudes. For the P2 component a motion-specific effect with larger signal amplitudes over the left hemisphere was found compared to static stimuli. The presently documented N1 components comply with the results of previous studies on auditory space processing and suggest a contralateral dominance during the process of cortical integration of spatial acoustic information. Additionally, the cortical activity in the 'd300-400 ms' time period indicates, that in addition to the motion origin (as reflected by the N1) also the direction of motion (leftward/rightward motion) or rather motion termination is cortically encoded. These electrophysiological results are in accordance with the 'snap shot' hypothesis, assuming that auditory motion processing is not based on a genuine motion-sensitive system, but rather on a comparison process of spatial positions of motion origin (onset) and motion termination (offset). Still, specificities of the present P2 component provides evidence for additional motion-specific processes possibly associated with the evaluation of motion-specific attributes, i.e. motion direction and/or velocity which is preponderant in the left hemisphere.

Low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta, <7 Hz) are dominant in children but become less prominent in the adult brain, where higher-frequency alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) dominate the mature brain rhythm. However, this assessment of developmental effects with EEG power mapping is restricted to the scalp level and blind to the information flow between brain regions, thus limiting insights about brain development. In contrast dynamic source synchronization provides a tool to study inter-regional directionality on the cortical and sub-cortical source level. In this study we investigated functional and directed connectivities (information flow) with renormalized partial directed coherence during resting state EEG (eyes open and eyes closed) recordings in 17 school-aged children and 17 young adults. First, we found higher spectral mean source power in children relative to adults, irrespective of the examined frequency band and resting state. We further found that coherence values were stronger in adults compared to children in all frequency bands. The directed within-group coherence analysis indicated information flow from frontal to parietal sources in children, while information flow from parietal to frontal was observed in adults. In addition, significant thalamocortical connectivity was unidirectional (i.e., outflow to cortical regions) in adults, but bidirectional in children. Group comparison confirmed the results of the single subject analyses for both functional and directed connectivities. Our results suggest that both functional and directed connectivities are sensitive to brain maturation as the distribution and directionality of functional connections differ between the developing and adult brains.

Driving brain signals have been collected by a 19-channel electroencephalogram recording system. The driving pathway has been selected with no obstacles, a set of indicators are used to inform the subjects when they had to turn left or right by means of keyboard left and right arrows. Subsequently in order to remove artifacts, preprocessing is performed on data to achieve high accuracy. Features of signals are extracted by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Absolute power of FFT is used as a basic feature. Scalar Feature selection method is applied to reduce feature dimension. Thereafter dimension-reduced features are fed to Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) recognizing different brain potentials stimulated by turning to left and right. The performances of HNN are evaluated by considering five conditions; before feature extraction, after feature extraction, before reduction of features, after analyzing reduced features and finally subject-wise Hopfield performances respectively. An increase occurred in each level and continued until it has reached its highest 97.6% of accuracy on last condition.

Therefore, it is of interest to come up with a system that can augment a searcher's vision, in relation to speed, enabling the searcher to find the target faster than through normal means. Audition and vision are important for both communicative and informational purposes and therefore neurological signatures related to such abilities can greater increase cognitive infocommunicative devices. The P300 neurological response is a well known event-related potential that identifies the recognition of a target in such a search task. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) technology has previously been used to detect the P300 signature in response to target recognition during a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). Following the oddball paradigm, this study uses the 14-electrode Emotiv EPOC to detect the P300 in eight subjects performing a novel Where's Waldo target recognition task with the success criterion to optimize their completion time. In this paradigm, the number of targets and distractors are varied following a geometric distribution in order to have the participants engage in the task throughout the session. Although the Emotiv EPOC is crude in comparison to other EEG systems such as those with 256 electrodes, our results show better search times compared to baseline, and thus proves the feasibility of augmented vision even with such a limited system.

EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task, presented to 12 participants with a random mix of 15% oddball targets and 85% frequent non-target letters over 265 trials. Wavelet coherence of individual trials was shown to distinguish frequent and oddball trials. Averaged wavelet coherence showed significant differences: oddball targets showed higher delta-theta activity whereas frequent background stimuli showed higher gamma activity. Increased gamma coherence appeared to be related to expectation of the targets with our analysis showing an R-2 of 0.935 for the relationship between averaged sections of gamma coherence and the number of intervening (frequent) trials since the last oddball.

We start this review by showing that experimental studies in humans and monkeys have reached a consensus on the facts that sensorimotor beta power is low during movement, transiently increases after movement end (the "beta rebound") and tonically increases during object grasping. Recently, a new surge of studies exploiting more complex sensorimotor tasks including multiple events, such as instructed delay tasks, reveal novel characteristics of beta oscillatory activity. We therefore proceed by critically reviewing also this literature to understand whether modulations of beta oscillations in task epochs other than those during and after movement are consistent across studies, and whether they can be reconciled with a role for beta oscillations in sensorimotor transmission. We indeed find that there are additional processes that also strongly affect sensorimotor beta oscillations, such as visual cue anticipation and processing, fitting with the view that beta oscillations reflect heightened sensorimotor transmission beyond somatosensation. However, there are differences among studies, which may be interpreted more readily if we assume multiple processes, whose effects on the overall measured beta power overlap in time. We conclude that beta oscillations observed in sensorimotor cortex may serve large-scale communication between sensorimotor and other areas and the periphery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Besides, the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to play a pivotal role in the sensori-discriminative aspects of pain perception but the analgesic effect of cTBS applied over S1 remains controversial. To investigate cTBS-induced analgesia we characterized, in two separate experiments, the effect of cTBS applied either over M1 or S1 on the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and perception elicited by nociceptive (CO2 laser stimulation) and non-nociceptive (transcutaneous electrical stimulation) somatosensory stimuli. All stimuli were delivered to the ipsilateral and contralateral hand. We found that both cTBS applied over M1 and cTBS applied over S1 significantly reduced the percept elicited by nociceptive stimuli delivered to the contralateral hand as compared to similar stimulation of the ipsilateral hand. In contrast, cTBS did not modulate the perception of non-nociceptive stimuli. Surprisingly, this side-dependent analgesic effect of cTBS was not reflected in the amplitude modulation of nociceptive ERPs. Indeed, both nociceptive (N160, N240 and P360 waves) and late-latency non-nociceptive (N140 and P200 waves) ERPs elicited by stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral hands were similarly reduced after cTBS, suggesting an unspecific effect, possibly due to habituation or reduced alertness. In conclusion, cTBS applied over M1 and S1 reduces similarly the perception of nociceptive inputs originating from the contralateral hand, but this analgesic effect is not reflected in the magnitude of nociceptive ERPs.

In this chapter, we describe some of the key goals, caveats, and pitfalls of the evaluation of consciousness in non-communicating patients. First, we will address the importance of neurological and behavioral examination, and then briefly outline the current developments of functional brain-imaging tools able to provide important additional evidence. Current approaches include: (i) active paradigms in which a patient is asked to perform a specific cognitive task; (ii) "resting state" conditions in which the spontaneous patterns of brain activity can be instructive of patients conscious state; and (iii) passive paradigms in which cortical functional connectivity can be explored by recording, for instance, EEG in response to focal transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses.

Less well understood is how neurophysiological changes relate to tactile discrimination performance in middle adulthood. A tactile discrimination task was conducted while ERPs were measured in three groups of healthy adults aged 20 to 66 years. Accuracy was lowest in late middle adulthood (5666 years) while somatosensory ERP components (P50, N70, P100, N140) were comparable across age groups. The cognitive P300 revealed age-related differences in scalp distribution typical for older adults to already be present in late middle adulthood. Increased recruitment of frontal cognitive processes was positively related to performance in later middle adulthood. Our results further the understanding of age-related differences in tactile perception during middle adulthood and the importance of cognitive processes to compensate for age-related decline.

Here, we replicate this finding in an independent sample of 59 subjects and investigate the contribution of optical factors (pupil size and luminance) to the age-related slowdown and to individual differences in visual processing speed. We conducted two experiments. In experiment 1 we recorded EEG from subjects aged 18-79. Subjects viewed images of faces and phase scrambled noise textures under nine luminance conditions, ranging from 0.59 to 60.8 cd/m(2). We manipulated luminance using neutral density filters. In experiment 2, 10 young subjects (age < 35) viewed similar stimuli through pinholes ranging from 1 to 5 mm. In both experiments, subjects were tested twice. We found a 1 ms/year slowdown in visual processing that was independent of luminance. Aging effects became visible around 125 ms post stimulus and did not affect the onsets of the face texture ERR differences. Furthermore, luminance modulated the entire ERR time-course from 60 to 500 ms. Luminance effects peaked in the N170 time window and were independent of age. Importantly, senile miosis and individual differences in pupil size did not account for aging differences and inter subject variability in processing speed. The pinhole manipulation also failed to match the ERPs of old subjects to those of young subjects. Overall, our results strongly suggest that early ERPs to faces (<200 ms) are delayed by aging and that these delays are of cortical, rather than optical origin. Our results also demonstrate that even late ERPs to faces are modulated by low-level factors.

Methods: Using a within subject design and a strict subject selection procedure, we tested in High (Highs) and Low (Lows) hypnotically suggestible individuals whether hypnotic suggestions of sensory and affective hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia differentially affected subjective ratings of laser-induced pain and nociceptive-related brain activity in the time- and time-frequency domain. Results: Hypnotic modulation of pain intensity and unpleasantness affected subjective ratings of laser-induced pain only in Highs. Such modulation was more specific for unpleasantness manipulation and more evident for suggestions of hyperalgesia. Importantly, Highs and Lows showed increase and decrease of P2a and P2b wave amplitudes and gamma band power, respectively. Conclusions: Hypnotic suggestions exerted a top-down modulatory effect on both evoked and induced-cortical brain responses triggered by selective nociceptive laser inputs. Furthermore, correlation analyses indicated that gamma power modulation and suggestions of hyperalgesia may reflect the process of allocating control resources to salient and threatening sensory-affective dimensions of pain.

EEG recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a target event. Subjects performed two sessions: in the first the regularity of the predictive sequence was implicit, while in the second this regularity was made explicit. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. Both the implicit and explicit sessions showed shorter reaction times and peak P3b latencies for predicted versus random targets, although to a greater extent in the explicit session. In both sessions the middle and last most-informative stimuli of the three-standard predictive sequence induced a significant larger P3b compared with randomized standards. The findings show that local contextual information is processed implicitly, but that this modulation was significantly greater when subjects were explicitly instructed to attend to target-predictive contextual information. The findings suggest that top-down attentional networks have a role in modulating the extent to which contextual information is utilized.

Studies using scalp EEG and intracranial electrical recordings have provided much of our current knowledge regarding the frequency and temporal specificity of these sensorimotor rhythms and their relationship to various movement parameters, however with limitations in identifying the underlying neural sources, and the variety of motor behaviors that can be studied, respectively. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, combined with spatial filtering source reconstruction methods, provide an ideal non-invasive method for the localization of sensorimotor rhythms and for describing their precise time course during a variety of motor tasks. This review describes the application of MEG to the study of oscillatory activity in the human sensorimotor cortex, including advances in localization techniques and recent contributions of MEG to our understanding of the functional role of these oscillations in both adult and developmental populations.

Generally, more pronounced sex-dependent differences are noted with increased task difficulty or with increased levels of intranasal irritation produced by the stimulus. Whether differences between the sexes arise from differences in chemosensory sensitivity of the two intranasal sensory systems involved or from differences in cognitive processing associated with emotional evaluation of the stimulants is still not known. We used simultaneous and complementary measures of electrophysiological (EEG), psychophysiological, and psychological responses to stimuli varying in intranasal irritation and odorousness to investigate whether sex differences in the processing of intranasal irritation are mediated by varying sensitivity of the involved sensory systems or by differences in cognitive and/or emotional evaluation of the irritants. Women perceived all stimulants more irritating and they exhibited larger amplitudes of the late positive deflection of the event-related potential than men. No significant differences in sensory sensitivity, anxiety, and arousal responses could be detected. Our findings suggest that men and women process intranasal irritation differently. Importantly, the differences cannot be explained by variation in sensory sensitivity to irritants, differences in anxiety, or differences in physiological arousal. We propose that women allocate more attention to potentially noxious stimuli than men do, which eventually causes differences in cognitive appraisal and subjective perception.

This requires use of appropriate preclinical models that accurately depict outcome measures used in humans. Whereas behavioural animal studies classically involve reports related to nociceptive thresholds of, for example, withdrawal, electrophysiological recordings of spinal neurones that receive convergent input from primary afferents permits investigation of suprathreshold events and exploration of the full-range coding of different stimuli. We explored the central processing of nociceptive inputs in a novel parallel investigation between rats and humans. Using radiant laser pulses, we first compared the electrophysiological responses of deep wide dynamic range and superficial nociceptive-specific neurones in the rat dorsal horn with human psychophysics and cortical responses. Secondly, we explored the effects of spatial summation using laser pulses of identical energy and different size. We observed 3 main findings. Firstly, both rodent and human data confirmed that neodymium-yttrium aluminium perovskite laser stimulation is a nociceptive-selective stimulus that never activates Ab afferents. Secondly, graded laser stimulation elicited similarly graded electrophysiological and behavioural responses in both species. Thirdly, there was a significant degree of spatial summation of laser nociceptive input. The remarkable similarity in rodent and human coding indicates that responses of rat dorsal horn neurones can translate to human nociceptive processing. These findings suggest that recordings of spinal neuronal activity elicited by laser stimuli could be a valuable predictive measure of human pain perception.

This specific model postulates that AP is driven by a perceptual encoding ability (i.e., pitch memory) plus an associative memory component (i.e., pitch labeling). To test these predictions, during EEG measurements AP and non-AP (NAP) musicians were passively exposed to piano tones (first component of the model) and additionally instructed to judge whether combinations of tones and labels were conceptually associated or not (second component of the model). Auditory-evoked N1/P2 potentials did not reveal differences between the two groups, thus indicating that AP is not necessarily driven by a differential pitch encoding ability at the processing level of the auditory cortex. Otherwise, AP musicians performed the conceptual association task with an order of magnitude better accuracy and shorter RTs than NAP musicians did, this result clearly pointing to distinctive conceptual associations in AP possessors. Most notably, this behavioral superiority was reflected by an increased N400 effect and accompanied by a subsequent late positive component, the latter not being distinguishable in NAP musicians.

Method: For review, PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Google Scholar searches identified six studies and six subsequent publications. In addition to five studies focusing on children with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV)-diagnosed ADHD, one study reports on adults. Results: SCP protocols utilize unipolar-electrode placement at Cz, randomized bidirectional signal regulation, feedback/transfer trials, and discrete feedback/rewards. Results demonstrated learning of SCP self-regulation, moderate to large within group effect sizes for core ADHD symptom reduction, and enhancement of event-related potentials/electroencephalogram components. Neurophysiological and session variables were predictive of treatment outcome, but open questions of specific and nonspecific effects remain. Study limitations and future directions are discussed. Conclusion: SCP is an efficacious and standardized neurofeedback protocol that addresses behavioral and neurophysiological deficits in ADHD.

As the structures and activities of the brain vary with each individual, contributing channels should be chosen based on original records of BCIs. Phase measurement is an important approach in EEG analyses, but seldom used for channel selections. In this paper, the phase locking and concentrating value-based recursive feature elimination approach (PLCV-RFE) is proposed to produce robust-EEG channel selections in a P300 speller. The PLCV-RFE, deriving from the phase resetting mechanism, measures the phase relation between EEGs and ranks channels by the recursive strategy. Data recorded from 32 electrodes on 9 subjects are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the PLCV-RFE substantially reduces channel sets and improves recognition accuracies significantly. Moreover, compared with other state-of-the-art feature selection methods (SSNRSF and SVM-RFE), the PLCV-RFE achieves better performance. Thus the phase measurement is available in the channel selection of BCI and it may be an evidence to indirectly support that phase resetting is at least one reason for ERP generations.

The target patient population is prone to fatigue, so reducing or removing this training step could increase the amount of time available to the subject for actual BCI use. We present an expectation maximization approach that trains the classifier in an unsupervised manner. A general classifier is created from a set of multiple subjects and it is then refined using the subject's unlabeled data and knowledge from the language domain. The method was tested offline on a data set of 15 healthy subjects and achieved similar performance to fully supervised methods for all subjects. This suggests that this method could be used in the place of the training step for BCI systems.

Therefore, temporal/spectral filtering which can be very effective to counteract the unfavorable influence of noises is usually used as a supplement. This work integrates the CSP spatial filters with complex channel-specific finite impulse response (FIR) filters in a natural and intuitive manner. Each hybrid spatial-FIR filter is of high-order, data-driven and is unique to its corresponding channel. They are derived by introducing multiple time delays and regularization into conventional CSP. The general framework of the method follows that of CSP but performs better, as proven in single-trial classification tasks like event-related potential detection and motor imagery.

Here we contrasted these two conditions during food-cue presentation while acquiring event-related potentials (ERPs) and subjective craving ratings. Female participants (n = 25) were presented with either high-calorie (HC) or low-calorie (LC) food images under instructions to imagine either immediate (NOW) or long-term effects (LATER) of consumption. On subjective ratings for HC foods, the LATER perspective reduced cravings as compared to the NOW perspective. For LC foods, by contrast, craving increased under the LATER perspective. Early ERPs (occipital N1, 150-200 ms) were sensitive to food type but not to perspective. Late ERPs (late positive potential, LPP, 350-550 ms) were larger in the HC-LATER condition than in all other conditions, possibly indicating that a cognitive focus on negative long-term consequences induced negative arousal. This enhancement for HC-LATER attenuated to the level of the LC conditions during the later slow wave (550-3000 ms), but amplitude in the HC-NOW condition was larger than in all other conditions, possibly due to a delayed appetitive response. Across all conditions, LPP amplitudes were positively correlated with self-reported emotional eating. In sum, results reveal that regulation effects are secondary to an early attentional analysis of food type and dynamically evolve over time. Adopting a long-term perspective on eating might promote a healthier food choice across a range of food types.

J	Messerotti Benvenuti, S; Bianchin, M; Angrilli, A				Messerotti Benvenuti, Simone; Bianchin, Marta; Angrilli, Alessandro			Posture affects emotional responses: A Head Down Bed Rest and ERP study	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Body position; Emotion; ERP; P300; P3; Late positive potential	SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; STIMULI; MICROGRAVITY; HUMANS; SPACE; P300	Body posture, mainly represented by horizontal bed rest, has been found to be associated with cortical inhibition, altered perceptual and cognitive processing. In the present research, the influence of Head Down Bed Rest (HDBR) - a condition also termed simulated microgravity - on emotional responses has been studied. Twenty-two male subjects were randomly assigned to either Sitting Control or HDBR group. After 3-h, subjects attended to a passive viewing emotional task in which 75 IAPS slides, divided into 25 pleasant, 25 neutral and 25 unpleasant, were presented in random order for 6 s each, while EEG was recorded from F7, F8 and Pz locations. Results showed in Sitting Controls the expected greater P300 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to pleasant and unpleasant compared with neutral slides, an effect which indicates greater processing of emotional arousing stimuli. The HDBR group showed smaller non-significant differences among all emotional conditions in both ERP components. Arousal and valence subjective evaluations, typically less sensitive to experimental manipulation, did not differentiate groups. The observed ability of HDBR to inhibit cortical emotional responses raises an important issue on the risk that astronauts underestimate a dangerous/threatening situation or that long-term bedridden inpatients develop depressive symptoms.

Nonhuman primate model of schizophrenia using a noninvasive EEG method	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						brain; psychiatry; neurology; monkey; medicine	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; KETAMINE; DISCRIMINATION; PHENCYCLIDINE; ANTAGONIST; RECEPTORS; COGNITION; ERPS; P3A	There is growing evidence that impaired sensory-processing significantly contributes to the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia. For example, the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a event-related potentials (ERPs), neurophysiological indices of sensory and cognitive function, are reduced in schizophrenia patients and may be used as biomarkers of the disease. In agreement with glutamatergic theories of schizophrenia, NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, elicit many symptoms of schizophrenia when administered to normal subjects, including reductions in the MMN and the P3a. We sought to develop a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of schizophrenia based on NMDA-receptor blockade using subanesthetic administration of ketamine. This provided neurophysiological measures of sensory and cognitive function that were directly comparable to those recorded from humans. We first developed methods that allowed recording of ERPs from humans and rhesus macaques and found homologous MMN and P3a ERPs during an auditory oddball paradigm. We then investigated the effect of ketamine on these ERPs in macaques. As found in humans with schizophrenia, as well as in normal subjects given ketamine, we observed a significant decrease in amplitude of both ERPs. Our findings suggest the potential of a pharmacologically induced model of schizophrenia in NHPs that can pave the way for EEG-guided investigations into cellular mechanisms and therapies. Furthermore, given the established link between these ERPs, the glutamatergic system, and deficits in other neuropsychiatric disorders, our model can be used to investigate a wide range of pathologies.

Measurement of Attention during Movement: Acquisition of Ambulatory EEG and Cognitive Performance from Healthy Young Adults	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			GAIT; ARTIFACT; WALKING; RISK	Non-invasive methods of recording human electrocortical brain dynamics during normal daily activities would have far-reaching clinical benefits. The literature suggests a strong link between gait and cognition, where attention is seen to play a central role. This study investigated if clinically useful electrophysiological measures of attention can be collected using an auditory oddball task in ecological/non-clinic environments through analysis of the amplitude and latency of auditory P3 event related potentials (ERPs). Electrophysiological (EEG, EOG, EMG) recordings were taken for 7 healthy subjects while presented with an auditory oddball task. Data was recorded in control, static (seated) and dynamic (fixed cycling) experimental conditions. Recordings were also taken for two subjects during treadmill walking. P3 ERPs were calculated and data analysis showed that peak amplitude and component latency remained stable across all experimental conditions. For the Cz electrode position there were 0.2-2% P3 amplitude and 3-9% P3 latency differences. P3 amplitude and latency also remained stable between experimental conditions for all electrode locations. This result opens up the possibility to quantitatively investigate the interaction between gait and attention during the ageing process but also in movement disorders such as freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.

The unresponsive wakefulness syndrome-vegetative state, the minimally conscious state plus and minus, and the functional locked-in syndrome have been defined using new neuroimaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques have all promoted important discoveries in the field of disorders of consciousness. This has led to a better understanding of these patients' condition and to the development of new prognosis, therapeutic, and communication tools. However, low sensitivity and artifacts problems need to be solved to bring these new technologies to the single-patient level; they also need to be studied in larger scale and randomized control trials. In addition, new ethics questions have arisen and need to be investigated.

Here we report this robust effect is diminished and even reversed when face stimuli are processed unconsciously. We measured visual-evoked potentials to neutral faces either visible or rendered invisible by an inter-ocular suppression. In visible condition, we observed a larger N1 to inverted than upright faces, which replicated the traditional FIE-N1. When those faces became invisible, however, neural responses to the inverted faces were greatly reduced compared to visible condition, whereas those to the invisible upright faces were relatively preserved. Consequently, N1 amplitudes were found to be larger in upright, rather than inverted, faces in invisible condition, which was opposite to the traditional FIE-N1 (upright < inverted) in visible condition. Those results highlighted a special mechanism in the brain for the processing of the upright, but not inverted, face (e.g. fusiform face area) that retains vigorous responses even when the face becomes invisible.

The differential susceptibility to environmental influences model posits that heightened biological sensitivity and reactivity in the individual can predict different outcomes for better or for worse, depending on environmental influences outside (i.e., exogenous) of the individual. In this article, we extend this existing model and argue that the environment can also be conceptualized as a unique set of dynamic conditions and influences operating within (i.e., endogenous) the individual that are orthogonal to some biological sensitivity factors. In this new model, continuous brain electrical activity at rest constitutes one endogenous environmental condition that can vary (leftward to rightward) and influence gene expression to confer different outcomes, for better (sociability) or for worse (shyness). We then discuss how this model can be tested, as well as its potential implications for theory, development, and practice.

Recent attempts at identifying neural correlates of WM capacity decline have focused on the maintenance phase of WM. Here, we investigate neural mechanisms during the encoding phase as another potential mechanism contributing to adult age differences in WM capacity. We used electroencephalography to track neural activity during encoding and maintenance on a millisecond timescale in 35 younger and 35 older adults performing a visual-spatial WM task. As predicted, we observed pronounced age differences in ERP indicators of WM encoding: Younger adults showed attentional selection during item encoding (N2pc component), but this selection mechanism was greatly attenuated in older adults. Conversely, older adults showed more pronounced signs of early perceptual stimulus processing (N1 component) than younger adults. The amplitude modulation of the N1 component predicted WM capacity in older adults, whereas the attentional amplitude modulation of the N2pc component predicted WM capacity in younger adults. Our findings suggest that adult age differences in mechanisms of WM encoding contribute to adult age differences in limits of visual-spatial WM capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, less is known about if and how sensory and motor information are integrated in the subsequent process of response evaluation. We used a modified Simon Task to investigate how these streams of information are integrated in response evaluation processes, applying an in-depth neurophysiological analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), time-frequency decomposition and sLORETA. The results show that response evaluation processes are differentially modulated by afferent proprioceptive information and efference copies. While the influence of proprioceptive information is mediated via oscillations in different frequency bands, efference copy based information about the motor execution is specifically mediated via oscillations in the theta frequency band. Stages of visual perception and attention were not modulated by the interaction of proprioception and motor efference copies. Brain areas modulated by the interactive effects of proprioceptive and efference copy based information included the middle frontal gyrus and the supplementary motor area (SMA), suggesting that these areas integrate sensory information for the purpose of response evaluation. The results show how motor response evaluation processes are modulated by information about both the execution and the location of a response.

The successful extraction of the relevant signals becomes more and more challenging due to increasing complexities in acquisition techniques and questions addressed. Here, automated signal processing and machine learning tools can help to process the data, e.g., to separate signal and noise. With the presented software pySPACE (http://pyspace.github.io/pyspace), signal processing algorithms can be compared and applied automatically on time series data, either with the aim of finding a suitable preprocessing, or of training supervised algorithms to classify the data. pySPACE originally has been built to process multi-sensor windowed time series data, like event-related potentials from the electroencephalogram (EEG). The software provides automated data handling, distributed processing, modular build-up of signal processing chains and tools for visualization and performance evaluation. Included in the software are various algorithms like temporal and spatial filters, feature generation and selection, classification algorithms, and evaluation schemes. Further, interfaces to other signal processing tools are provided and, since pySPACE is a modular framework, it can be extended with new algorithms according to individual needs. In the presented work, the structural hierarchies are described. It is illustrated how users and developers can interface the software and execute offline and online modes. Configuration of pySPACE is realized with the YAML format, so that programming skills are not mandatory for usage.

It further allows to define own algorithms, or to integrate and use already existing libraries.

Therefore, event-related coherence of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity between selective frontal and parietal electrode pairs of ten subjects was measured during the performance of a mental rotation task consisting of rotation of letters, hands and scenes. Statistical analysis showed an increased coherence of frontal and parietal electrode pairs for the condition LETTER in comparison to the other conditions in the alpha(1)- (85-10 Hz) and alpha(2)-band (10, 5-12 Hz) supporting the notion of different mental rotation mechanisms for externally and internally represented objects. Additionally decreased coherence of the frontal and parietal electrode pairs was found for the rotation angles 30 degrees to 150 degrees in comparison to the 0 degrees and 180 degrees rotations for the alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-band as well as the gamma frequency band (30-45 Hz). It is assumed that this decrease of synchronization reflects the mental rotation process implying that the mental rotation process of 180 differs from the rotation process of all other rotation angles.

Here, the event-related potential (ERR) mismatch negativity (MMN), a sensitive indicator of preattentive auditory change detection, was used to tap into the underlying mechanism of cortical representation of auditory spatial information. We characterized the MMN response affected by the degree of spatial deviance in lateral acoustic space using a passive oddball paradigm. Two stimulation conditions (SCs)-specifically focusing on the investigation of the mid- and far-lateral acoustic space-were considered: (1) 65 degrees left standard position with deviant positions at 70, 75, and 80 degrees; and (2) 95 degrees left standard position with deviant positions at 90, 85, and 80 degrees. Additionally, behavioral data on the minimum audible angle (MAA) were acquired for the respective standard positions (65, 95 degrees left) to quantify spatial discrimination in separating distinct sound sources. The two measurements disclosed the linkage between the (preattentive) MMN response and the (attentive) behavioral threshold. At 65 degrees spatial deviations as small as 5 degrees reliably elicited MMNs. Thereby, the MMN amplitudes monotonously increased as a function of spatial deviation. At 95 degrees, spatial deviations of 15 degrees were necessary to elicit a valid MMN. The behavioral data, however, yielded no difference in mean MAA thresholds for position 65 and 95 degrees. The different effects of laterality on MMN responses and MAA thresholds suggest a role of spatial selective attention mechanisms particularly relevant in active discrimination of neighboring sound sources, especially in the lateral acoustic space.

This effect was investigated by recording and analyzing ERPs as well as induced gamma oscillations. The race modulation occurred post the stage of structural processing revealed by N170. Larger P2 component and induced gamma activity for own-race than other-race faces could be associated with more elaborate processing on the basis of configural computation due to more experience that we have for own-race faces.

A fundamental requirement is that these neurophysiological parameters show a high level of stability over time. Previous studies have shown that the reliability of diverse parameters of the P3 component (latency and amplitude) ranges between moderate and high. However, few studies have paid attention to the retest reliability of the P3 topography in groups or individuals. Considering that changes in P3 topography have been related to different pathologies and healthy aging, the main objective of this article was to evaluate in a longitudinal study (two sessions) the reliability of P3 topography in a group and at the individual level. Results: The correlation between sessions for P3 topography in the grand average of groups was high (r = 0.977, p<0.001). The within-subject correlation values ranged from 0.626 to 0.981 (mean: 0.888). In the between-subjects topography comparisons, the correlation was always lower for comparisons between different subjects than for within-subjects correlations in the first session but not in the second session. Conclusions: The present study shows that P3 topography is highly reliable for group analysis (comprising the same subjects) in different sessions. The results also confirmed that retest reliability for individual P3 maps is suitable for follow-up studies for a particular subject. Moreover, P3 topography appears to be a specific marker considering that the betweensubjects correlations were lower than the within-subject correlations. However, P3 topography appears more similar between subjects in the second session, demonstrating that is modulated by experience. Possible clinical applications of all these results are discussed.

Currently, many brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have successfully helped patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities to regain independence. In order to translate this neural engineering success to hearing aid applications, we must be able to capture brain waves across the population reliably in cortical regions that have not previously been incorporated in these systems before, for example, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right temporoparietal junction. Here, we present a brain-state classification framework that incorporates individual anatomical information and accounts for potential anatomical and functional differences across subjects by applying appropriate cortical weighting functions prior to the classification stage. Using an inverse imaging approach, use simulated EEG data to show that our method can outperform the traditional brain-state classification approach that trains only on individual subject's data without considering data available at a population level.

Many of these systems are based on the analysis of Event Related Potentials (ERPs) such as P300. P300 speller is one of the common BCI systems which attract a lot of attention; however, there are still a lot of flaws in these systems which should be considered. Since ERPs such as P300 signals have a very low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), single trial analysis of these signals is difficult and in many papers, denoising methods such as synchronous averaging were proposed to reduce random noise; however, it reduces the communication rate greatly. Another major problem in many BCI applications is the numerous number of channels needed to record EEG signals in order to have a reliable system. In this paper, a new method is presented to detect P300 signals through single channel data analysis and also it reaches an average accuracy of 65% in single trial P300 detection.

Besides tremor, also some cognitive features have been implicated in ET and PD. There is recent evidence that a common genetic mutation occurs in ET and PD. Saccadic eye movements could provide an easily quantifiable procedure to help in the differential diagnosis in early PD and ET. Being able to distinguish early on the two diseases may help in tailoring therapy. Cortical control of saccades and antisaccades as they pertain to the potential discrimination of PD and ET is reviewed. Imaging and electrophysiological studies are highlighted; however, there are still few studies. Hopefully this review will stimulate further research, in particular in the direction of differences and similarities in the neural circuits involved in PD and ET.

The recent development of connectivity approaches able to consistently describe the temporal evolution of large dimension connectivity networks, in a fully multivariate way, represents a tool that can be used to extract novel information about the processes at the basis of memory functions. In this paper, we applied such advanced approach in combination with the use of state-of-the-art graph theory indexes, computed on the connectivity networks estimated from high density electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded in a group of healthy adults during the Sternberg Task. The results show how this approach is able to return a characterization of the main phases of the investigated memory task which is also sensitive to the increased length of the numerical string to be memorized.

However, there are few studies using psychophysiological methods published that describe the effects of krill oil on brain function. We investigated the influence of ingestion of krill oil on cognitive function in elderly subjects by using near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study design was adopted. Forty-five healthy elderly males aged 61-72 years were assigned to receive 12 weeks of treatment with: medium-chain triglycerides as placebo; krill oil, which is rich in n-3 PUFAs incorporated in phosphatidylcholine; or sardine oil, which is abundant in n-3 PUFAs incorporated in triglycerides. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the cerebral cortex during memory and calculation tasks were measured. The P300 component of event-related potentials was also measured during a working memory task. Results: During the working memory task, changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the krill oil and sardine oil groups were significantly greater than those in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. The differential value for P300 latency in the krill oil group was significantly lower than that in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. With regard to the calculation task, changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the krill oil group were significantly greater than those in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that n-3 PUFAs activate cognitive function in the elderly. This is especially the case with krill oil, in which the majority of n-3 PUFAs are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, causing it to be more effective than sardine oil, in which n-3 PUFAs are present as triglycerides.

J	Fukuda, H; Hiwaki, O				Fukuda, Hiroshi; Hiwaki, Osamu			Brain activity evoked by motor inhibition before volitional finger movement	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						motor inhibition; motor readiness potential; movement-related cortical potential; voluntary movement	STOP-SIGNAL TASK; COMPONENTS; ERP; CONFLICT; GO	The present study investigated the brain activity that accompanied motor inhibition before movement in human volitional finger movement. Seven individuals were instructed to press a force sensor with the right index finger. The time to begin this movement was indicated with a clock making a 4-s revolution. The time at which the clock hand passed the 3 o'clock position was adopted as the go-signal in the go task. In the series of trials, the task, we designated as prestop task, was performed with a red light-emitting diode stop-signal presented randomly at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 s before the go-signal. Cerebral potentials from the scalp were recorded using a 20-channel electroencephalography system. In the go task without the stop-signal, clear movement-related cortical potentials were observed. In the prestop tasks with the stop-signal, the participants were able to inhibit finger movement. A positive electroencephalography potential distributed at the midline frontocentral scalp 400 ms after the stop-signal was observed only in the prestop task. This suggests that the observed positive component is associated with the interruption of motor intent, as well as the revision of motor planning, in the motor cortices before the movement.

Participants judged whether or not the two objects were "same'' or "different'' on either the color dimension (color task) or the shape dimension (shape task). The unattended irrelevant dimension of the objects was either congruent (same-same; different-different) or incongruent (same-different). ERP data showed a main effect of color congruency in the time window 190-260 ms post-stimulus presentation and a main effect of shape congruency in the time window 220-280 ms post-stimulus presentation in both color and shape tasks. The interaction between color and shape congruency in the ERP data occurred in a later time window than the two main effects, indicating that mismatches in task-relevant and task-irrelevant dimensions were processed automatically and independently before a response was selected. The fact that the interference of the task-irrelevant dimension occurred after mismatch detection, supports a confluence model of processing.

J	Zhang, L; Peng, WW; Zhang, ZG; Hu, L				Zhang, Li; Peng, Weiwei; Zhang, Zhiguo; Hu, Li			Distinct Features of Auditory Steady-State Responses as Compared to Transient Event-Related Potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CLICK TRAINS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EEG RESPONSES; SPINE SURGERY; GAMMA-BAND; BRAIN; COMPONENTS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Transient event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state responses (SSRs) have been popularly employed to investigate the function of the human brain, but their relationship still remains a matter of debate. Some researchers believed that SSRs could be explained by the linear summation of successive transient ERPs (superposition hypothesis), while others believed that SSRs were the result of the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the periodic repetition of a sensory stimulus (oscillatory entrainment hypothesis). In the present study, taking auditory modality as an example, we aimed to clarify the distinct features of SSRs, evoked by the 40-Hz and 60-Hz periodic auditory stimulation, as compared to transient ERPs, evoked by a single click. We observed that (1) SSRs were mainly generated by phase synchronization, while late latency responses (LLRs) in transient ERPs were mainly generated by power enhancement; (2) scalp topographies of LLRs in transient ERPs were markedly different from those of SSRs; (3) the powers of both 40-Hz and 60-Hz SSRs were significantly correlated, while they were not significantly correlated with the N1 power in transient ERPs; (4) whereas SSRs were dominantly modulated by stimulus intensity, middle latency responses (MLRs) were not significantly modulated by both stimulus intensity and subjective loudness judgment, and LLRs were significantly modulated by subjective loudness judgment even within the same stimulus intensity. All these findings indicated that high-frequency SSRs were different from both MLRs and LLRs in transient ERPs, thus supporting the possibility of oscillatory entrainment hypothesis to the generation of SSRs. Therefore, SSRs could be used to explore distinct neural responses as compared to transient ERPs, and help us reveal novel and reliable neural mechanisms of the human brain.

EEG signals were recorded from 26 volunteers. Multi-resolution analysis was used as a tool for signal approximation and modeling. A custom scaling-wavelet function pair and their bi-orthogonal complements were built by resembling the waveform of the scaling function to the excitatory post-synaptic potential. In order to distinguish the familiar unfamiliar face evoked potentials, a Fisher's linear classifier was used with discriminative approximation coefficients obtained from active electrodes which are selected by the wrapper method. The algorithm was also executed with spline, Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet wavelets for comparison. The classification performance of proposed wavelet is the first among the other wavelets with 69.7% accuracy and it is also first in the total number of highest success of individual subjects with 31% of the subjects which is double of the result of the second wavelet in the rank.

Warning signals serve the facilitation of detection of visual objects. We investigated how warning signals and signaled objects integrate into multimodal objects revealed by early evoked brain potentials. We asked whether locus of attention and stimulus intensity modulates this effect. 15 participants performed a driving and a redundant target paradigm task while EEG was recorded from scalp electrodes. We presented audio/visual/bimodal stimuli either with low or with middle intensity. We found that non-attended low intensity multisensory changes caused difference in attentional processing as early as 88 msec, on the other hand attended middle intensity multisensory stimuli led to an enhancement of an early visual event related potential component, namely the C1. These results suggest that attention and stimulus intensity interact in multisensory perception. Our results raise attention to how warning signals and signaled objects integrate. Consequently a warning system that is capable of providing simultaneous and spatially consequent signals is proposed.

Results revealed indications for a dynamic interplay between bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms. Here we used a more naturalistic task to examine temporal signatures of attentional mechanisms on fine and coarse time scales. Subjects had to inspect digitized copies of 60 paintings, each shown for 40s. We simultaneously measured oculomotor behavior and electrophysiological correlates of brain activity to compare early and late intervals (1) of inspection time of each picture (picture viewing) and (2) of the full experiment (time on task). For picture viewing, we found an increase in fixation duration and a decrease of saccadic amplitude while these parameters did not change with time on task. Furthermore, early in picture viewing we observed higher spatial and temporal similarity of gaze behavior. Analyzing electrical brain activity revealed changes in three components (C1, Ni and P2) of the eye fixation-related potential (EFRP); during picture viewing; no variation was obtained for the power in the frontal beta- and in the theta activity. Time on task analyses demonstrated no effects on the EFRP amplitudes but an increase of power in the frontal theta and beta band activity. Thus, behavioral and electrophysiological measures similarly show characteristic changes during picture viewing, indicating a shifting balance of its underlying (bottom-up and top-down) attentional mechanisms. Time on task also modulated top-down attention but probably represents a different attentional mechanism.

Electrophysiological signatures are a promising avenue for earlier diagnosis. In the present study, we investigated an ERP component associated with visual working memory capacity, the contralateral delay activity (CDA). Our participants were undiagnosed and supposedly healthy members of the community, but were defined to be at-risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on performance from a brief, standardized neuropsychological test. We found that older adults at-risk for MCI had a reduced visual working memory capacity and reduced differentiation of the CDA. In a second experiment, we found that the P300, a well-characterized ERP component shown to be useful in determining conversion from MCI to AD, showed reduced amplitude in our at-risk group. Together, these findings suggest that electrophysiological signatures may be especially sensitive markers of the very earliest stages of AD.

Decoding Speech Perception by Native and Non-Native Speakers Using Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; LANGUAGE; REORGANIZATION; NEUROFEEDBACK; COMPONENTS; STIMULI; VOICE; P300; FMRI	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that use real-time analysis of neuroimaging data to determine the mental state of their user for purposes such as providing neurofeedback. Here, we investigate the feasibility of a BCI based on speech perception. Multivariate pattern classification methods were applied to single-trial EEG data collected during speech perception by native and non-native speakers. Two principal questions were asked: 1) Can differences in the perceived categories of pairs of phonemes be decoded at the single-trial level? 2) Can these same categorical differences be decoded across participants, within or between native-language groups? Results indicated that classification performance progressively increased with respect to the categorical status (within, boundary or across) of the stimulus contrast, and was also influenced by the native language of individual participants. Classifier performance showed strong relationships with traditional event-related potential measures and behavioral responses. The results of the cross-participant analysis indicated an overall increase in average classifier performance when trained on data from all participants (native and non-native). A second cross-participant classifier trained only on data from native speakers led to an overall improvement in performance for native speakers, but a reduction in performance for non-native speakers. We also found that the native language of a given participant could be decoded on the basis of EEG data with accuracy above 80%. These results indicate that electrophysiological responses underlying speech perception can be decoded at the single-trial level, and that decoding performance systematically reflects graded changes in the responses related to the phonological status of the stimuli. This approach could be used in extensions of the BCI paradigm to support perceptual learning during second language acquisition.	[Brandmeyer, Alex; Farquhar, Jason D.

Here we compared neural activity elicited by varying perceptions of the same physical image-a bistable moving image in which perception spontaneously alternates between dissociated fragments and a single, unified object. A time-frequency analysis of EEG changes associated with the perceptual switch from object to fragment and vice versa revealed a greater decrease in alpha (8-12 Hz) accompanying the switch to object percept than to fragment percept. Recordings of event-related potentials elicited by irrelevant probes superimposed on the moving image revealed an enhanced positivity between 184 and 212 ms when the probes were contained within the boundaries of the perceived unitary object. The topography of the positivity (P2) in this latency range elicited by probes during object perception was distinct from the topography elicited by probes during fragment perception, suggesting that the neural processing of probes differed as a function of perceptual state. Two source localization algorithms estimated the neural generator of this object-related difference to lie in the lateral occipital cortex, a region long associated with object perception. These data suggest that perceived objects attract attention, incorporate visual elements occurring within their boundaries into unified object representations, and enhance the visual processing of elements occurring within their boundaries. Importantly, the perceived object in this case emerged	[Flevaris, Anastasia V.; Martinez, Antigona; Hillyard, Steven A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Martinez, Antigona] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Schizophrenia Res Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA		Flevaris, AV (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.	ani.flevaris@gmail.com	Martinez, Antigona/X-2317-2019	Martinez, Antigona/0000-0003-4806-5199	NIMH [1P50MH86385, T32MH020002-13]; NSF [BCS-1029084]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [P50MH086385, T32MH020002] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	This work was supported by an NIMH grant (1P50MH86385), an NSF grant (BCS-1029084), and an NIMH institutional training grant (T32MH020002-13).		157	16	16	1	12	ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC	ROCKVILLE	12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA	1534-7362			J VISION	J.

Conversely, at other times the target may be perceived in the periphery prior to fixation. There is ample behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to suggest that in some constrained visual-search tasks, targets are detected prior to fixational eye movements. However, limited human data are available during unconstrained search to determine the time course of detection, the brain areas involved, and the neural correlates of failures to detect a foveated target. Here, we recorded and analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during free-viewing visual search, varying the task difficulty to compare neural signatures for detected and unreported ("missed") targets. When carefully controlled to remove eye-movement-related potentials, saccade-locked EEG shows that: (a) "Easy" targets may be detected as early as 150 ms prior to foveation, as indicated by a premotor potential associated with a button response; (b) object-discriminating occipital activity emerges during the saccade to target; and (c) success and failures to detect a target are accompanied by a modulation in alpha-band power over fronto-central areas as well as altered saccade dynamics. Taken together, these data suggest that target detection during free viewing can begin prior to and continue during a saccade, with failure or success in reporting a target possibly resulting from inhibition or activation of fronto-central processing areas associated with saccade control.

Part of this process is the extraction of "gist," a global first impression. It is unclear, however, how the human visual system computes this information. Here, we show that, when human observers categorize global information in real-world scenes, the brain exhibits strong sensitivity to low-level summary statistics. Subjects rated a specific instance of a global scene property, naturalness, for a large set of natural scenes while EEG was recorded. For each individual scene, we derived two physiologically plausible summary statistics by spatially pooling local contrast filter outputs: contrast energy (CE), indexing contrast strength, and spatial coherence (SC), indexing scene fragmentation. We show that behavioral performance is directly related to these statistics, with naturalness rating being influenced in particular by SC. At the neural level, both statistics parametrically modulated single-trial event-related potential amplitudes during an early, transient window (100-150 ms), but SC continued to influence activity levels later in time (up to 250 ms). In addition, the magnitude of neural activity that discriminated between man-made versus natural ratings of individual trials was related to SC, but not CE. These results suggest that global scene information may be computed by spatial pooling of responses from early visual areas (e. g., LGN or V1). The increased sensitivity over time to SC in particular, which reflects scene fragmentation, suggests that this statistic is actively exploited to estimate scene naturalness.	[Groen, Iris I.

The unstable bridge from stimulus processing to correct responding in Parkinson's disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Action selection; Basal ganglia; Parkinson's disease; P300; N-E; N-120	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASAL GANGLIA; ACTION SELECTION; ERROR-DETECTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; REACTION-TIME; WAVE-FORMS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; MOVEMENT	It has been assumed that the basal ganglia implement links between stimulus (S) processing and motor response (R). It has also been proposed that the P3b component of the event-related EEG potential, which is usually as large in R- as in S-locked averages over trials, is a candidate marker to reveal integrity of S-R links. Therefore, the P3 complex (consisting of P3a and P3b) was here measured in averages over trials time-locked either to S or to the key-press R. P3b was expected to be equally large in healthy participants' R- and S-locked averages but to be smaller in R-locked than S-locked averages of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n=12 each), reflecting the loss of S-R links in PD. It has been further assumed that the basal ganglia extract unambiguous results from complex signal patterns thereby resolving discrepancies between competing responses. If so, signals arriving at PD patients' cortex may still be discrepant and produce conflicts, as indicated by error-negativity (N-E)-type components even with PD patients' correct responses. As expected, healthy persons had equal S- and R- locked P3b amplitudes and topographies, and PD patients had smaller P3b amplitudes in R-locked than S-locked averages. This latter result was due to an R-related fronto-central negative shift, overlapping PD patients' P3b in the final 100 ms before overt responding. This negativity might indicate response conflict even with correct responses. In line with this interpretation, PD patients had an N-E-type signal in error trials not only in R-locked averages, like healthy participants, but in S-locked averages as well. These findings support the discrepancy-resolving hypothesis of the basal ganglia and suggest that the overlap of P3b by N-E-type components, related both to S and R, may reflect a major pathophysiological feature in Parkinson's disease.

We presented our electroencephalography (EEG) study participants with derived and inflected words of variable lexical frequencies against their monomorphemic base forms in a passive oddball paradigm, along with acoustically matched pseudowords. Sensor space and distributed source modelling results showed that at 100-150 msec after the suffix onset, derived words elicited larger responses than inflected words. Furthermore, real derived words showed advantage over pseudo-derivations and frequent derivations elicited larger activation than less frequent ones. This pattern of results is fully in line with previous research that explained lexical MMN enhancement by an activation of strongly connected word-specific long-term memory circuits, and thus suggests stronger lexicalisation for frequently used complex words. At the same time, a strikingly different pattern was found for inflectional forms: higher response amplitude for pseudo-inflections than for real inflected words, with no clear frequency effects. This is fully in line with previous MMN results on combinatorial processing of (morpho)syntactic stimuli: higher response to ungrammatical morpheme strings than grammatical ones, which does not depend on the string's surface frequency. This pattern suggests that, for inflectional forms, combinatorial processing route dominates over whole-form storage and access. In sum, our results suggest that derivations are more likely to form unitary representations than inflections which are likely to be processed combinatorially, and imply at least partially distinct brain mechanisms for the processing and representation of these two types of morphology. These dynamic mechanisms, underpinned by perisylvian networks, are activated rapidly, at 100-150 msec after the information arrives at the input, and in a largely automatic fashion, possibly providing neural basis for the first-pass morphological processing of spoken words.

We review evidence on attention to action, drawing on sets of converging evidence from neuropsychological patients through to studies of the time course and neural locus of action-based cueing of attention in normal observers. We show that the presence of action relations between stimuli helps reduce visual extinction in patients with limited attention to the contralesional side of space, while the first saccades made by normal observers and early perceptual and attentional responses measured using electroencephalography/event-related potentials are modulated by preparation of action and by seeing objects being grasped correctly or incorrectly for action. With both normal observers and patients, there is evidence for two components to these effects based on both visual perceptual and motor-based responses. While the perceptual responses reflect factors such as the visual familiarity of the action-related information, the motor response component is determined by factors such as the alignment of the objects with the observer's effectors and not by the visual familiarity of the stimuli. In addition to this, we suggest that action relations between stimuli can be coded pre-attentively, in the absence of attention to the stimulus, and action relations cue perceptual and motor responses rapidly and automatically. At present, formal theories of visual attention are not set up to account for these action-related effects; we suggest ways that theories could be expected to enable action effects to be incorporated.

Neural correlates of uncertain decision making: ERP evidence from the Iowa Gambling Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						uncertain decision making; Iowa GamblingTask; emotion; ERP; somatic marker hypothesis	SOMATIC MARKER HYPOTHESIS; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; PERFORMANCE; ASYMMETRIES; FAILURE; CORTEX; REWARD; DAMAGE; GAINS; BAD	In our daily life, it is very common to make decisions in uncertain situations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used in laboratory studies because of its good simulation of uncertainty in real life activities. The present study aimed to examine the neural correlates of uncertain decision making with the IGT. Twenty-six university students completed this study. An adapted IGT was administered to them, and the EEG data were recorded. The adapted IGT we used allowed us to analyze the choice evaluation, response selection, and feedback evaluation stages of uncertain decision making within the same paradigm. In the choice evaluation stage, the advantageous decks evoked larger P3 amplitude in the left hemisphere, while the disadvantageous decks evoked larger P3 in the right hemisphere. In the response selection stage, the response of "pass" (the card was not turned over; the participants neither won nor lost money) evoked larger negativity preceding the response compared to that of "play" (the card was turned over; the participant either won or lost money). In the feedback evaluation stage, feedback-related negativity (FRN) was only sensitive to the valence (win/loss) but not the magnitude (large/small) of the out come, and P3 was sensitive to both the valence and the magnitude of the out come. These results were consistent with the notion that a positive somatic state was represented in the left hemisphere and a negative somatic state was represented in the right hemisphere. There were also anticipatory ERP effects that guided the participants' responses and provided evidence for the somatic marker hypothesis with more precise timing.

J	Hepler, J; Albarracin, D				Hepler, Justin; Albarracin, Dolores			Complete unconscious control: Using (in)action primes to demonstrate completely unconscious activation of inhibitory control mechanisms	COGNITION			English	Article						Unconscious; Inhibition; Self-control; EEG; Inaction	GENERAL ACTION; INACTION GOALS; MOTOR; CONFLICT; PURSUIT; TASK; WILL	Although robust evidence indicates that action initiation can occur unconsciously and unintentionally, the literature on action inhibition suggests that inhibition requires both conscious thought and intentionality. In prior research demonstrating automatic inhibition in response to unconsciously processed stimuli, the unconscious stimuli had previously been consciously associated with an inhibitory response within the context of the experiment, and participants had consciously formed a goal to activate inhibition processes when presented with the stimuli (because task instructions required participants to engage in inhibition when the stimuli occurred). Therefore, prior work suggests that some amount of conscious thought and intentionality are required for inhibitory control. In the present research, we recorded event-related potentials during two go/no-go experiments in which participants were subliminally primed with general action/inaction concepts that had never been consciously associated with task-specific responses. We provide the first demonstration that inhibitory control processes can be modulated completely unconsciously and unintentionally. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dominant and subordinate associations of ambiguous words are considered to be processed in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. In the experiment, ambiguous words were followed by dominant or subordinate associations (manipulated between blocks) or by unrelated target words, and participants (N = 25) decided whether the words in each pair were related or not. Subordinate meaning blocks elicited greater changes in the magnetic fields relative to dominant ones over the right, but not the left hemisphere (LH) at 150-235 ms from target onset, a time window corresponding to the M/N170 M/EEG component. Beamforming analysis localized the differential right hemisphere (RH) activity at the perisylvian area, including the homologue regions of Broca's and Wernicke's. At a later stage (235-390 ms) there was no significant difference between the two meaning conditions. We suggest that the RH language regions assist the LH in integrating subordinate disambiguating clues to preceding context during the M170 time window. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abnormal task modulation of oscillatory neural activity in schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; oscillations; alpha; beta; AX-CPT; cognitive; motor preparation	CONTEXT-PROCESSING DEFICITS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CHANGING PLANS; MOTOR SYSTEMS	Schizophrenia patients have deficits in cognitive function that are a core feature of the disorder. AX-CPT is commonly used to study cognition in schizophrenia, and patients have characteristic pattern of behavioral and ERP response. In AX-CPT subjects respond when a flashed cue "A" is followed by a target "X," ignoring other letter combinations. Patients show reduced hit rate to "go" trials, and increased false alarms to sequences that require inhibition of a prepotent response. EEG recordings show reduced sensory (P1/N1), as well as later cognitive components (N2, P3, CNV). Behavioral deficits correlate most strongly with sensory dysfunction. Oscillatory analyses provide critical information regarding sensory/cognitive processing over and above standard ERP analyses. Recent analyses of induced oscillatory activity in single trials during AX-CPT in healthy volunteers showed characteristic response patterns in theta, alpha, and beta frequencies tied to specific sensory and cognitive processes. Alpha and beta modulated during the trials and beta modulation over the frontal cortex correlated with reaction time. In this study, EEG data was obtained from 18 schizophrenia patients and 13 controls during AX-CPT performance, and single trial decomposition of the signal yielded power in the target wavelengths. Significant task-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed in both alpha and beta frequency bands over parieto-occipital cortex related to sensory encoding of the cue. This modulation was reduced in patients for beta, but not for alpha. In addition, significant beta ERD was observed over motor cortex, related to motor preparation for the response, and was also reduced in patients. These findings demonstrate impaired dynamic modulation of beta frequency rhythms in schizophrenia, and suggest that failures of oscillatory activity may underlie impaired sensory information processing in schizophrenia that in turn contributes to cognitive deficits.

A multimenu system based on the P300 component as a time saving procedure for communication with a brain-computer interface	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; P300; spelling; semantic organization	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BCI SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; SPELLER; HEALTHY; USERS; HEAD; ALS	The present study investigates a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) spelling procedure based on the P300 evoked potential. It uses a small matrix of words arranged in a tree-shaped organization ("multimenu"), and allows the user to build phrases one word at a time, instead of letter by letter. Experiments were performed in two sessions on a group of seven healthy volunteers. In the former, the "multimenu" was tested with a total of 60 choices: 30 "externally-imposed" selections and 30 "free-choice" selections. In the latter, 3 x 3 matrices were compared with 6 x 6 matrices. Each matrix was composed of letters or words, for a total of four matrices. Differences in classifier accuracy, bit rate and amplitude of the evoked P300 were evaluated. Average accuracy in all subjects was 87% with no differences between the selection methods. The 3 x 3 "multimenu" obtained the same level of classifier accuracy as the 6 x 6 matrices, even with a significantly lower amplitude of the P300. Bit rate was increased when using the 3 x 3 matrices compared to the 6 x 6 ones. The "multimenu" system was equally effective, but faster than conventional, letter based matrices. By improving the speed of communication, this method can be of help to patients with severe difficulties in communication.

Modeling Ketamine Effects on Synaptic Plasticity During the Mismatch Negativity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						Bayesian model selection; dynamic causal modeling; effective connectivity; mismatch negativity; NMDA receptor	DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; EVOKED-RESPONSES; FREE-ENERGY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NMDA RECEPTORS; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN	This paper presents a model-based investigation of mechanisms underlying the reduction of mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes under the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine. We applied dynamic causal modeling and Bayesian model selection to data from a recent ketamine study of the roving MMN paradigm, using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our modeling was guided by a predictive coding framework that unifies contemporary "adaptation" and "model adjustment" MMN theories. Comparing a series of dynamic causal models that allowed for different expressions of neuronal adaptation and synaptic plasticity, we obtained 3 major results: 1) We replicated previous results that both adaptation and short-term plasticity are necessary to explain MMN generation per se; 2) we found significant ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity, but not adaptation, and a selective ketamine effect on the forward connection from left primary auditory cortex to superior temporal gyrus; 3) this model-based estimate of ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity correlated significantly with ratings of ketamine-induced impairments in cognition and control. Our modeling approach thus suggests a concrete mechanism for ketamine effects on MMN that correlates with drug-induced psychopathology. More generally, this demonstrates the potential of modeling for inferring on synaptic physiology, and its pharmacological modulation, from electroencephalography data.

Given that chromatic stimulus information is processed rapidly and automatically by the visual system, how can hypnotic suggestions affect perceived colors in a seemingly immediate fashion? We studied the mechanisms of such color alterations by measuring electroencephalography in two highly suggestible participants as they perceived briefly presented visual shapes under posthypnotic color alternation suggestions such as "all the squares are blue''. One participant consistently reported seeing the suggested colors. Her reports correlated with enhanced evoked upper beta-band activity (22 Hz) 70-120 ms after stimulus in response to the shapes mentioned in the suggestion. This effect was not observed in a control condition where the participants merely tried to simulate the effects of the suggestion on behavior. The second participant neither reported color alterations nor showed the evoked beta activity, although her subjective experience and event-related potentials were changed by the suggestions. The results indicate a preconscious mechanism that first compares early visual input with a memory representation of the suggestion and consequently triggers the color alteration process in response to the objects specified by the suggestion. Conscious color experience is not purely the result of bottom-up processing but it can be modulated, at least in some individuals, by top-down factors such as hypnotic suggestions.

Enhancement and suppression in the visual field under perceptual load	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						attention; perceptual load; steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); N1	SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; POTENTIALS REVEAL; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSES; MACAQUE; MODULATION; DILUTION; NEURONS; OBJECTS	The perceptual load theory of attention proposes that the degree to which visual distractors are processed is a function of the attentional demands of a task-greater demands increase filtering of irrelevant distractors. The spatial configuration of such filtering is unknown. Here, we used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in conjunction with time-domain event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the distribution of load-induced distractor suppression and task-relevant enhancement in the visual field. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while subjects performed a foveal go/no-go task that varied in perceptual load. Load dependent distractor suppression was assessed by presenting a contrast reversing ring at one of three eccentricities (2, 6, or 11 degrees) during performance of the go/no-go task. Rings contrast reversed at 8.3 Hz, allowing load-dependent changes in distractor processing to be tracked in the frequency domain. ERPs were calculated to the onset of stimuli in the load task to examine load-dependent modulation of task-relevant processing. Results showed that the amplitude of the distractor SSVEP (8.3 Hz) was attenuated under high perceptual load (relative to low load) at the most proximal (2 degrees) eccentricity but not at more eccentric locations (6 or 11 degrees). Task-relevant ERPs revealed a significant increase in N1 amplitude under high load. These results are consistent with a center surround configuration of load-induced enhancement and suppression in the visual field.

By combining behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, we investigated the mechanisms of the interaction and information integration between different spatial frequency bands. The observers performed a scene categorization task on hybrid images that were generated by combining the low spatial frequency (LSF) component of one image with the high spatial frequency (HSF) component of another image. The results showed that the recognition of the HSF component was interfered by the non-attended LSF component at semantic level. The strength of the semantic interference was modulated by the physical similarity between the LSF and HSF components. Analyses of the EEG data revealed an early anterior N1 component (122 ms from stimulus onset) that was related to the observed interaction of the semantic and physical information between the LSF and HSF components. These findings demonstrate that the semantic information from different spatial frequency bands can be integrated at early stage of the perceptual processing. This early integration is likely to occur at frontal areas in order to initiate top-down facilitation.

J	Cordones, I; Gomez, CM; Escudero, M				Cordones, Isabel; Gomez, Carlos M.; Escudero, Miguel			Cortical Dynamics during the Preparation of Antisaccadic and Prosaccadic Eye Movements in Humans in a Gap Paradigm	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; WORKING-MEMORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; EXPRESS SACCADES; BLIND SEPARATION; FIXATION POINT; REACTION-TIMES; ANTI-SACCADES	To compare the cortical dynamics of different oculomotor tasks, EEG and eye movements were recorded in 21 volunteers. Using a comprehensive approach, subjects were asked to perform saccadic tasks, which included a saccadic eye movement to a peripheral target (prosaccadic), a movement to the opposite side (antisaccadic), or maintain the gaze fixed (no-go). In mixed trials, prosaccadic, antisaccadic and no-go tasks were indicated by a color square (S1) present for 1900-2500 ms (instructive period). S1 disappeared for 370 ms (gap) and a black dot at 8 deg at right or left indicated the beginning of the task. Reaction times, amplitude of eye movements and number of errors were greatest in antisaccadic tasks, suggesting a greater difficulty. The EEG showed a contingent negativity variation (CNV) that increased progressively along the instructive period and suddenly during the gap: higher in antisaccadic, followed by prosaccadic and no-go tasks. Principal component analysis (PCA) disentangled fronto-central and occipital CNV-related and fronto-central gap-related components. The instructive period was characterized by fronto-central and occipital beta desynchronization (ERD) higher in antisaccadic than in no-go and parieto-occipital alpha synchronization higher in no-go than in antisaccadic tasks. During the gap, parieto-occipital beta and alpha ERD were higher in antisaccadic compared to no-go. The gap was further characterized by a fronto-central increase of inter-trial coherence in theta: highest during antisaccadic, followed by prosaccadic and no-go tasks. This phase locking in theta was also accompanied by theta ERS, which was significantly higher in antisaccadic than in the other two tasks. In PCA of spectral power two main components had dynamics similar to those extracted from voltage data, suggesting cross-frequency coupling. These results suggest that the more difficult saccadic tasks are associated with top-down control mediated by frontal cortex, while simpler tasks rely more on bottom-up control mediated by posterior cortices.

Motivational incentives and methylphenidate enhance electrophysiological correlates of error monitoring in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ADHD; electrophysiology; error monitoring; motivation; methylphenidate; stimulant medication	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ANTISACCADE TASK; ADHD; ERP; NEGATIVITY; MODULATION; AWARENESS	Background: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterised by developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and/or inattention and are particularly impaired when performing tasks that require a high level of cognitive control. Methylphenidate (MPH) and motivational incentives may help improve cognitive control by enhancing the ability to monitor response accuracy and regulate performance accordingly. Methods: Twenty-eight children with DSM-IV ADHD (combined type) aged 9-15 years and pairwisematched typically developing children (CTRL) performed a go/no-go task in which the incentives attached to performance on no-go trials were manipulated. The ADHD group performed the task off and on their usual dose of MPH. CTRL children performed the task twice but were never medicated. EEG data were recorded simultaneously and two electrophysiological indices of error monitoring, the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were measured. Amplitudes of each ERP were compared between diagnostic groups (CTRL, ADHD), medication days (Off MPH, On MPH) and motivational conditions (baseline -low incentive, reward, response cost). Results: Error rates were lower in the reward and response cost conditions compared with baseline across diagnostic groups and medication days. ERN and Pe amplitudes were significantly reduced in ADHD compared with CTRL, and were significantly enhanced by MPH. Incentives significantly increased ERN and Pe amplitudes in the ADHD group but had no effect in CTRL. The effects of incentives did not interact with the effects of MPH on either ERP. Effect sizes were computed and revealed larger effects of MPH than incentives on ERN and Pe amplitudes. Conclusions: The findings reveal independent effects of motivational incentives and MPH on two electrophysiological markers of error monitoring in children with ADHD, suggesting that each may be important tools for enhancing or restoring cognitive control in these children.

EEG band powers for characterizing user engagement in P300-BCI	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	An asynchronous P300-based brain computer interface (BCI) allows users to operate the BCI at their own pace by being able to detect a user's engagement. In our previous work, band powers has been shown to be able to provide additional information for characterizing user engagement and yielded better performance compared to the use of only the amplitudes of event-related potentials. In this follow up study, 19 subjects participated in an experiment which was designed to further evaluate additional predictors of user engagement using band powers. In addition to the regular P300 attended condition, two not-engaged conditions were considered: one with the P300 stimulus matrix still shown (control 1) and the other with stimulus covered by a blank screen (control 2). Alpha and beta band activities decreased in the order of control 2, control 1 and attended. Furthermore, the attended condition had lower delta activity compared to the control conditions. Classification results indicated that band powers were better at differentiating attended and control 2 conditions. Using band powers as additional features resulted in a moderate to moderately large (dz= 0.52 to 0.74) improvement over the classification of the two conditions.

J	Basar, E				Basar, Erol			A review of gamma oscillations in healthy subjects and in cognitive impairment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Gamma oscillations; Cognition; Bipolar disorders; Schizophrenia; Memory	AUDITORY HALLUCINATION SYMPTOMS; EVENT-RELATED COHERENCE; 40 HZ-EEG; BIPOLAR DISORDER; BAND RESPONSES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS	This review describes a wide range of functional correlates of gamma oscillations in whole-brain work, in neuroethology, sensory-cognitive dynamics, emotion, and cognitive impairment. This survey opens a new window towards understanding the brain's gamma activity. Gamma responses are selectively distributed in the whole brain, and do not reflect only a unique, specific function of the nervous system. Sensory responses from cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and reticular formations in animal and human brains, and also cognitive responses, were described by several authors. According to reviewed results, it becomes obvious that cognitive disorders, and medication which influence the transmitter release change entirely the understanding of the big picture in cognitive processes. Gamma activity is evoked or induced by different sensory stimuli or cognitive tasks. Thus, it is argued that gamma-band synchronization is an elementary and fundamental process in whole-brain operation. In conclusion, reasoning and suggestions for understanding gamma activity are highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Oscillatory Underpinnings of Mismatch Negativity and Their Relationship with Cognitive Function in Patients with Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; GENERATION; KETAMINE; DURATION; DELTA; SCALE	Background: Impairments in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail. Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia. Method: 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN. Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking (PL) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering. A comprehensive battery (CANTAB) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning. Results: Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (95% CI 0.18 - 0.77). Patients showed significantly lower EEG power (95% CI -1.02 - -0.014) in the similar to 4-7 Hz frequency range (theta band) between 170 and 210 ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB. However, MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures, medication dose, social functioning or neurocognitive performance. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes, it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes. Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery.

Brisk heart rate and EEG changes during execution and withholding of cue-paced foot motor imagery	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor imagery; beta ERD; HR response; orienting reflex	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVOKED CARDIAC RESPONSE; CONSCIOUS INTENTION; MOVEMENT DIRECTION; TIME; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; BRADYCARDIA; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Cue-paced motor imagery (MI) is a frequently used mental strategy to realize a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Recently it has been reported that two MI tasks can be separated with a high accuracy within the first second after cue presentation onset. To investigate this phenomenon in detail we studied the dynamics of motor cortex beta oscillations in EEG and the changes in heart rate (HR) during visual cue-paced foot MI using a go (execution of imagery) vs. nogo (withholding of imagery) paradigm in 16 healthy subjects. Both execution and withholding of MI resulted in a brisk centrally localized beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) with a maximum at similar to 400 ms and a concomitant HR deceleration. We found that response patterns within the first second after stimulation differed between conditions. The ERD was significantly larger in go as compared to nogo. In contrast the HR deceleration was somewhat smaller and followed by an acceleration in go as compared to nogo. These findings suggest that the early beta ERD reflects visually induced preparatory activity in motor cortex networks. Both the early beta ERD and the HR deceleration are the result of automatic operating process that are likely part of the orienting reflex (OR). Of interest, however, is that the preparatory cortical activity is strengthened and the Hr modulated already within the first second after stimulation during the execution of MI. The subtraction of the HR time course of the nogo from the go condition revealed a slight HR acceleration in the first seconds most likely due to the increased mental effort associated with the imagery process.

We gain purchase on this problem by focusing on globally synchronous fields in within-trial evoked brain activity, rather than on localized peaks in the trial-averaged evoked response (ER). We analyzed data from three measurement modalities, each with different spatial resolutions: magnetoencephalogram (MEG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG). We first characterized the ER in terms of summation of phase and amplitude components over trials. Both contributed to the ER, as expected, but the ER topography was dominated by the phase component. This means the observed topography of cross-trial phase will not necessarily reflect the phase topography within trials. To assess the organization of within-trial phase, traveling wave (TW) components were quantified by computing the phase gradient. TWs were intermittent but ubiquitous in the within-trial evoked brain activity. At most task-relevant times and frequencies, the within-trial phase topography was described better by a TW than by the trial-average of phase. The trial-average of the TW components also reproduced the topography of the ER; we suggest that the ER topography arises, in large part, as an average over TW behaviors. These findings were consistent across the three measurement modalities. We conclude that, while phase is critical to understanding the topography of event-related activity, the preliminary step of collating cortical signals across trials can obscure the TW components in brain activity and lead to an underestimation of the coherent motion of cortical fields.

The proposed system was based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), which had a correlation with processing of afferent inflow in human somatosensory system, and attentional effect which modulated the ERD/ERS. The experiments were carried out on nine subjects (without experience in selective sensation), and six of them showed a discrimination accuracy above 80%, three of them above 95%. Comparative experiments with motor imagery (with and without presence of stimulation) were also carried out, which further showed the feasibility of selective sensation as an alternative BCI task complementary to motor imagery. Specifically there was significant improvement (P<0.01) from near 65% in motor imagery (with and without presence of stimulation) to above 80% in selective sensation on some subjects. The proposed BCI modality might well cooperate with existing BCI modalities in the literature in enlarging the widespread usage of BCI system.

Three references, the average reference (AR), the mean mastoid (MM), and a new infinity zero reference (IR), were comparatively investigated via ERPs, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM), and LORETA. Specifically, for the N1 (170-190ms), the SPSM results showed an anterior distribution for MM, a posterior distribution for IR, and both anterior and posterior distributions for AR. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by LORETA is consistent with SPSM of IR. These results indicated that the newly developed IR could provide increased accuracy; thus, we recommend IR for future ERP studies.

In practice, there are often additional brain damages besides the one directly causing LiS. These damages can lead to cognitive impairment, which substantially complicates the diagnosis of LiS. At the level of behavior, therefore, the disease can be confused with akinetic mutism, vegetative state (syn. unresponsive wakefulness state) and some other conditions. Using instrumental methods in addition to behavioral diagnostics helps to avoid diagnostic errors and to improve prognosis of rehabilitation of such patients. These methods, which include measurements of brain electric or magnetic fields, electrical potential of muscles, blood flow and oxygen consumption in the brain, are reviewed in this paper.

For rigor, the study is conducted with 16 BCI-naive healthy subjects in an experimental setup based on five Japanese hiragana characters in an offline processing mode. In our previous studies the spatial auditory stimuli related P300 responses resulted with encouragingly separable target vs. non-target latencies in averaged responses, yet that finding was not well reproduced in the online BCI single trial based settings. We present the case study indicating that the auditory spatial unimodal paradigm classification accuracy can be enhanced with an AUC based feature selection approach, as far as BCI-naive healthy subjects are concerned.

Repetition suppression of the rat auditory evoked potential at brief stimulus intervals	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory evoked potential; Repetition suppression; Habituation; Adaptation; Rat	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENSORY MEMORY; PARIETOTEMPORAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; STARTLE RESPONSE; N1 WAVE; HABITUATION; LATENCY; FREQUENCY; HUMANS	An important prerequisite for the development of animal models of human auditory evoked potentials (AEP) is the accurate identification of homology. Prior research has revealed some remarkably similar response properties between rat and human AEPs, although there remains little consensus regarding the nature or validity of this correspondence. In the present study we seek to. extend this research by examining the response properties of rat AEP as a function of stimulus repetition and interval. The aim being to determine whether rat AEP components show the same paradoxical reversal of repetition suppression observed for the human N100 ASP component at brief stimulus intervals. To achieve this, AEPs were recorded epidurally at the vertex in the freely moving rat in response to acoustic stimuli presented at random stimulus intervals between 50 and 5000 ms. Using stimulation and analysis techniques to remove AEP waveform distortion due to overlapping AEP responses, the present results show that rat AEP components can be successfully resolved at intervals as brief as 50 ms. The results also demonstrate several fundamental types of correspondence between human and rat AEP components in terms of the sensitivity to stimulus interval and acoustic stimulus type. However the results found no evidence that rat ASP components show the reversal of repetition suppression at brief, relative to long, stimulus intervals as demonstrated for the N100 component in humans. The results are discussed in terms of EEG recording and ASP analysis procedures that provide promising avenues for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interaction with the environment also requires the allocation of attention. However, the effects of attention upon motor predictive processes remain unclear. Here we use a novel paradigm to investigate attention and motor prediction orthogonally. In an acquisition phase, high and low tones were associated with left and right key presses. In the following test phase, tones were presented at random and participants attended to only one ear whilst ignoring tones presented in the unattended ear. In the test phase a tone could therefore be presented at the attended or unattended ear, as well as being congruent or incongruent with prior action-effect learning. We demonstrated early and late effects of attention as well as a later independent motor prediction effect with a larger P3a for incongruent tones. Interestingly, we demonstrated an intermediate interaction, showing an action-effect negativity (N-AE) for tones which were unattended, whilst no motor prediction effect was found for attended tones. This interaction pattern suggests that attention and motor prediction are not opposing processes but can both operate to modulate prediction, providing valuable new insight into the relationship between attention and the effects of motor prediction.

Early visual and auditory processing rely on modality-specific attentional resources	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attentional resource; EEG; Intermodal attention; MEG; Steady-state response	INTERMODAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; SENSORY MODALITIES; COORDINATE SYSTEM; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL SURFACE; GENERIC METHOD	Many everyday situations require focusing on visual or auditory information while ignoring the other modality. Previous findings suggest an attentional mechanism that operates between sensory modalities and governs such states. To date, evidence is equivocal as to whether this Intermodar attention relies on a distribution of resources either common or specific to sensory modalities. We provide new insights by investigating consequences of a shift from simultaneous ('bimodal') attention to vision and audition to unimodal selective attention. Concurrently presented visual and auditory stimulus streams were frequency-tagged to elicit steady-state responses (SSRs) recorded simultaneously in electro- and magnetoencephalograms (EEG/MEG). After the shift, decreased amplitudes of the SSR corresponding to the unattended sensory stream indicated reduced processing. We did not observe an amplitude increase of the SSR corresponding to the attended sensory stream. These findings are incompatible with a common-resources account. A redistribution of attentional resources between vision and audition would result in simultaneous processing gain in the attended sensory modality and reduction in the unattended sensory modality. Our results favor a modality-specific-resources account, which allows for independent modulation of early cortical processing in each sensory modality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Single trial analysis of slow cortical potentials: a study on anticipation related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER COMMUNICATION; THOUGHT-TRANSLATION DEVICE; SELF-REGULATION; EEG; MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATIONS; HAND; CNV; ERP	Objective. Abundant literature suggests the use of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) in a wide spectrum of basic and applied neuroscience areas. Due to their low signal to noise ratio, these potentials are often studied using grand-average analysis, which conceals trial-to-trial information. Moreover, most of the single trial analysis methods in the literature are based on classical electroencephalogram (EEG) features ([1-30] Hz) and are likely to be unsuitable for SCPs that have different signal properties (such as having the signal's spectral content in the range [0.2-0.7] Hz). In this paper we provide insights into the selection of appropriate parameters for spectral and spatial filtering. Approach. We study anticipation related SCPs recorded using a web-browser application protocol and a full-band EEG (FbEEG) setup from 11 subjects on two different days. Main results. We first highlight the role of a bandpass with [0.1-1.0] Hz in comparison with common practices (e.g., either with full dc, just a lowpass, or with a minimal highpass cut-off around 0.05 Hz). Secondly, we suggest that a combination of spatial-smoothing filter and common average reference (CAR) is more suitable than the spatial filters often reported in the literature (e.g., re-referencing to an electrode, Laplacian or CAR alone). Thirdly, with the help of these preprocessing steps, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of linear classifiers across several days (AUC of 0.88 +/- 0.05 on average with a minimum of 0.81 +/- 0.03 and a maximum of 0.97 +/- 0.01). We also report the possibility of further improvements using a Bayesian fusion technique applied to electrode-specific classifiers. Significance. We believe the suggested spatial and spectral preprocessing methods are advantageous for grand-average and single trial analysis of SCPs obtained from EEG, MEG as well as for electrocorticogram. The use of these methods will impact basic neurophysiological studies as well as the use of SCPs in the design of neuroprosthetics.

J	Gebuis, T; Reynvoet, B				Gebuis, Titia; Reynvoet, Bert			The neural mechanisms underlying passive and active processing of numerosity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERP; Numerosity; Approximate number system; Continuous sensory properties	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NUMBER; DISCRIMINATION; QUANTITY; CHILDREN; SIZE; ACUITY; LENGTH; MODEL; AREA	To investigate the difference in passive viewing and active processing of numerosity, we presented participants arrays of dots and concurrently measured their EEG. In the first condition, participants naive to the subject under study passively viewed the dot-arrays. In the second condition, the participants were informed about the changes in numerosity and had to actively process numerosity. The visual properties of the dot-arrays were controlled and could therefore not explain possible numerosity related effects. The results revealed no numerosity related effects in the passive and active conditions. Instead, when the data was reorganised according to visual cue size (surface or diameter, etc.), strong effects of the visual cues were present at lateral occipital and parietal electrode sites. These electrode sites and time windows correspond to the ERP components often suggested to support numerosity processes. Furthermore, a larger central-parietal P3 amplitude effect was present for active versus passive numerosity processing. This result was not influenced by numerosity itself and could not be explained by response processing. It therefore appears to reflect general cognitive processes. Together, our results show that we do not (automatically) extract numerosity from a visual scene during passive or active processing of numerosity. Instead, these results are consistent with the notion that we rely on the continuous sensory properties of numerosity stimuli to make numerosity judgments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To provide a more direct link to emergent perceptual states we have used holistic EEG/ERP paradigms where the moment of perceptual "discovery'' of a global pattern was variable. Using a rapid visual presentation of short-lived Mooney objects we found an increase of gamma-band activity locked to perceptual events. Additional experiments using dynamic Mooney stimuli showed that gamma activity increases well before the report of an emergent holistic percept. To confirm these findings in a data driven manner we have further used a support vector machine classification approach to distinguish between perceptual vs. non perceptual states, based on time-frequency features. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were all above 95%. Modulations in the 30-75 Hz range were larger for perception states. Interestingly, phase synchrony was larger for perception states for high frequency bands. By focusing on global gestalt mechanisms instead of local processing we conclude that gamma-band activity and synchrony provide a signature of holistic perceptual states of variable onset, which are separable from sensory and motor processing.

Methods: Repeat intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings were performed with 12 epilepsy patients, at >= 1 day intervals, using a passive odd-ball paradigm with steady-state tones. Time-frequency matching pursuit analysis was used to quantify changes in gamma-band power relative to pre-stimulus baseline. Test-retest reliability was estimated based on within-subject comparisons (paired t-test, McNemar's test) and correlations (Spearman rank correlations, intra-class correlations) across sessions, adjusting for within-session variability. Reliability estimates of gamma-band response robustness, spatial concordance, and reproducibility were compared with corresponding measurements from concurrent auditory evoked N1 responses. Results: All patients showed increases in gamma-band power, 50-120 ms post-stimulus onset, that were highly robust across recordings, comparable to the evoked N1 responses. Gamma-band responses occurred regardless of patients' performance on behavioral tests of auditory processing, medication changes, seizure focus, or duration of test-retest interval. Test-retest reproducibility was greatest for the timing of peak power changes in the high-gamma range (65-150 Hz). Reliability of low-gamma responses and evoked N1 responses improved at higher signal-to-noise levels. Conclusions: Early cortical auditory gamma-band responses are robust, spatially concordant, and reproducible over time. Significance: These test-retest ECoG results confirm the reliability of auditory gamma-band responses, supporting their utility as objective measures of cortical processing in clinical and research studies.

On the Quantization of Time-Varying Phase Synchrony Patterns into Distinct Functional Connectivity Microstates (FC mu states) in a Multi-trial Visual ERP Paradigm	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Mining brain dynamics; Functional connectomics; Microstates; Symbolic dynamics	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LABILE BRAIN; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; INFORMATION; NETWORK; ORIGIN; TRANSITIONS	The analysis of functional brain connectivity has been supported by various techniques encompassing spatiotemporal interactions between distinct areas and enabling the description of network organization. Different brain states are known to be associated with specific connectivity patterns. We introduce here the concept of functional connectivity microstates (FC mu states) as short lasting connectivity patterns resulting from the discretization of temporal variations in connectivity and mediating a parsimonious representation of coordinated activity in the brain. Modifying a well-established framework for mining brain dynamics, we show that a small sized repertoire of FC mu states can be derived so as to encapsulate both the inter-subject and inter-trial response variability and further provide novel insights into cognition. The main practical advantage of our approach lies in the fact that time-varying connectivity analysis can be simplified significantly by considering each FC mu state as prototypical connectivity pattern, and this is achieved without sacrificing the temporal aspects of dynamics. Multi-trial datasets from a visual ERP experiment were employed so as to provide a proof of concept, while phase synchrony was emphasized in the description of connectivity structure. The power of FC mu states in knowledge discovery is demonstrated through the application of network topology descriptors. Their time-evolution and association with event-related responses is explored.	[Dimitriadis, S. I.] Univ Patras, Dept Phys, Elect Lab, Patras 26500, Greece; [Dimitriadis, S. I.; Laskaris, N.

However, when name labeling was used in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) by which users can choose people with their faces, preserved P300 response to the previous target might be problematic because of the effect of memory. Our study utilized categorical labels of occupation instead of name labels, and investigated the effects of task-relevancy, face exposure and category labels in face selection task. Participants were required to judge whether each stimulus was a target or not. Results showed that although it was consistent with the name-label situation that P300 was enhanced by task-relevant targets, repeated exposure to previous target didn't increase P300 in category-label situation in contrast to the previous study. These results suggest that categorical labeling is more appropriate for BCIs, because task-relevant target face elicits larger P300 than other faces.

Native speakers of Dutch silently read Dutch sentences with and without gapping while their EEG was recorded. A left anterior negativity (LAN) was found at the first possible position at which the gapped verb could be detected, at least, for in participants who performed poorly in an end-of-sentence acceptability judgment task. This suggests that some readers do not anticipate the gapped verb, but infer the gapped verb in a bottom-up fashion, resulting in a LAN. Second, a P600 effect was observed for gapping versus no-gapping conditions, the early part of which was unaffected by plausibility. This suggests that the semantic and syntactic integration of a gapped verb is a relatively late process, and involves mechanisms similar to integrating a wh-phrase object with its verb.

J	Schendan, HE; Ganis, G				Schendan, Haline E.; Ganis, Giorgio			Face-specificity is robust across diverse stimuli and individual people, even when interstimulus variance is zero	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensation; Perception; EEG; ERP; Cognition; Individual differences; Learning; Memory; Normal volunteers	PERCEPTUAL VARIANCE; HUMAN BRAIN; N170; ACCOUNT; CORTEX	The N170 is a brain electrical potential proposed to index the earliest time of categorical perception of faces in occipitotemporal visual areas implicated in face cognition, being more negative for faces than nonface objects between 120 and 200ms. The interstimulus variance (ISV) account instead explained N170 face-specificity as an artifact due to objects varying more visually than faces. Ganis, Smith, and Schendan (2012) tested this account directly, finding that N170 face-specificity remains even when ISV is eliminated. Here, N170 peak amplitude and face-specificity is quantified for individual stimuli and participants, revealing that the right hemisphere N170 is especially sensitive to stimulus variability. Further, ISV contributes 0 to 37% to N170 face-specificity. These findings provide evidence for optimizing face processing science. The paradigm can apply to any research in which ISV may be uncontrolled (e.g., category comparisons).

The aim of the present study was to examine the time course of attention deployment after a brief presentation of stimulus arrays of different heterogeneity. Targets in less heterogeneous, grouped contexts yielded higher accuracy and larger N2pc amplitudes than targets in more heterogeneous, random contexts, indicating more efficient selection in the former. Subsequently presented probes yielded shorter reaction times and a larger posterior positivity when presented at the target location. This advantage was more pronounced after grouped compared to random contexts at the shorter compared to the longer interstimulus interval. The results show that less heterogeneous contexts that allow for grouping not only enhance processing of stimuli within that context, but have a sustained effect on visual attention.

To this effect, stimuli of naked men and women with visible primary sexual characteristics, as well as dressed bodies, were presented to 20 heterosexual male and female participants while acquiring high resolution EEG data. The stimuli were either consciously detectable (supraliminal presentations) or were rendered non-conscious through backward masking (subliminal presentations). The N1 event-related potential component was significantly enhanced in participants when they viewed naked compared to dressed bodies under supraliminal viewing conditions. More importantly, naked bodies of the opposite sex produced a significantly greater N1 component compared to dressed bodies during subliminal presentations, when participants were not aware of the stimulus presented. A source localization algorithm computed on the N1 showed that the response for naked bodies in the supraliminal viewing condition was stronger in body processing areas, primary visual areas and additional structures related to emotion processing. By contrast, in the subliminal viewing condition, only visual and body processing areas were found to be activated. These results suggest that naked bodies and primary sexual characteristics are processed early in time (i.e., <200 ms) and activate key brain structures even when they are not consciously detected. It appears that, similarly to what has been reported for emotional faces, sexual features benefit from automatic and rapid processing, most likely due to their high relevance for the individual and their importance for the species in terms of reproductive success.

During a fixation, two component processes can be distinguished: visual encoding and selection of the next fixation target. We aimed to distinguish the neural correlates of these processes in the electrical brain activity prior to a saccade onset. Participants viewed color photographs of natural scenes, in preparation for a change detection task. Then, for each participant and each scene we computed an image heat map, with temperature representing the duration and density of fixations. The temperature difference between the start and end points of saccades was taken as a measure of the expected task-relevance of the information concentrated in specific regions of a scene. Visual encoding was evaluated according to whether subsequent change was correctly detected. Saccades with larger temperature difference were more likely to be followed by correct detection than ones with smaller temperature differences. The amplitude of presaccadic activity over anterior brain areas was larger for correct detection than for detection failure. This difference was observed for short "scrutinizing" but not for long "explorative" saccades, suggesting that presaccadic activity reflects top-down saccade guidance. Thus, successful encoding requires local scanning of scene regions which are expected to be task-relevant. Next, we evaluated fixation target selection. Saccades moving up in temperature were preceded by presaccadic activity of higher amplitude than those moving down. This finding suggests that presaccadic activity reflects attention deployed to the following fixation location. Our findings illustrate how presaccadic activity can elucidate concurrent brain processes related to the immediate goal of planning the next saccade and the larger-scale goal of constructing a robust representation of the visual scene.

However, wavelet entropy will be largely influenced by the noise usually existed in signals, especially in physiological signals. With aim to get more stable entropy calculation, a windowed wavelet entropy approach is proposed. In this paper, we systemically studied the difference between wavelet entropy and approximate entropy, which has yet not been studied in detail before. The conducted comparison with various signals reveals that wavelet entropy can measure the signal complexity like approximate entropy. Moreover, the relative wavelet entropy can be used to measure the dissimilarity between two signals. Compared to the original wavelet entropy approach, the comparison result also shows that the proposed window approach can get smoother and more stable calculation for both wavelet entropy and relative wavelet entropy, which is more meaningful to measure signal regularity and dissimilarity. The application to the time series recorded from a patient having the intracranial hypertension reveals that the new approach can clearly differentiate the normal and hypertension states, which may serve as a promising tool for prediction of intracranial pressure in future.

However, despite numerous studies demonstrating that contextual information facilitates both syntactic and lexical-semantic processing, there exists no direct evidence pertaining to the neural correlates of the prediction process itself. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), this study found that brain activity was modulated by whether or not a specific noun could be predicted, given a picture prime. Specifically, before the noun was presented, predictive contexts triggered enhanced activation in left mid-temporal cortex (implicated in lexical access), ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (previously associated with top-down processing), and visual cortex (hypothesized to index the preactivation of predicted form features), successively. This finding suggests that predictive language processing recruits a top-down network where predicted words are activated at different levels of representation, from more 'abstract' lexical-semantic representations in temporal cortex, all the way down to visual word form features. The same brain regions that exhibited enhanced activation for predictive contexts before the onset of the noun showed effects of congruence during the target word. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to directly investigate the anticipatory stage of predictive language processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, we use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) patterns associated with motor imagery; however, instead of providing a binary classification output, we utilize posterior probabilities extracted from LDA classifier as the continuous-valued outputs to control a rehabilitation robot. Passive velocity field control (PVFC) is used as the underlying robot controller to map instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement to the speed of contour following tasks. In other words, PVFC changes the speed of contour following tasks with respect to intention levels of motor imagery. PVFC also allows decoupling of the task and the speed of the task from each other, and ensures coupled stability of the overall robot patient system. The proposed framework is implemented on ASSISTON-MOBILE-a series elastic actuator based on a holonomic mobile platform, and feasibility studies with healthy volunteers have been conducted test effectiveness of the proposed approach. Giving patients online control over the speed of the task, the proposed approach ensures active involvement of patients throughout exercise routines and has the potential to increase the efficacy of robot assisted therapies.

NEURON 58; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; EEG-DATA; ARTIFACT IDENTIFICATION	Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings are a rich source of information about the neural dynamics underlying cognitive processes in the brain, with excellent temporal and good spatial resolution. In recent years there have been considerable advances in MEG hardware developments and methods. Sophisticated analysis techniques are now routinely applied and continuously improved, leading to fascinating insights into the intricate dynamics of neural processes. However, the rapidly increasing level of complexity of the different steps in a MEG study make it difficult for novices, and sometimes even for experts, to stay aware of possible limitations and caveats. Furthermore, the complexity of MEG data acquisition and data analysis requires special attention when describing MEG studies in publications, in order to facilitate interpretation and reproduction of the results. This manuscript aims at making recommendations for a number of important data acquisition and data analysis steps and suggests details that should be specified in manuscripts reporting MEG studies. These recommendations will hopefully serve as guidelines that help to strengthen the position of the MEG research community within the field of neuroscience, and may foster discussion in order to further enhance the quality and impact of MEG research.

The present electrophysiological study was conducted to determine the mechanisms which modulated the performances in inter-and intramodal conditions. Participants were asked to categorise as short or long empty intervals marked by auditory (A) and/or visual (V) signals (intramodal intervals: AA, VV; intermodal intervals: AV, VA). Behavioural data revealed that the performances were higher for the AA intervals than for the three other intervals and lower for inter-compared to intramodal intervals. Electrophysiological results indicated that the CNV amplitude recorded at fronto-central electrodes increased significantly until the end of the presentation of the long intervals in the AA conditions, while no significant change in the time course of this component was observed for the other three modalities of presentation. They also indicated that the N1 and P2 amplitudes recorded after the presentation of the signals which delimited the beginning of the intervals were higher for the inter-(AV/VA) compared to the intramodal intervals (AA/VV). The time course of the CNV revealed that the high performances observed with AA intervals would be related to the effectiveness of the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of the ongoing interval. The greater amplitude of the N1 and P2 components during the intermodal intervals suggests that the weak performances observed in these conditions would be caused by an attentional bias induced by the cognitive load and the necessity to switch between modalities.

Since bilinguals outnumber unilinguals around the globe, studying the neurological underpinnings of translation may have far-reaching theoretical and clinical implications. This paper reviews nine imaging studies on translation employing EEG, ERP, fMRI, fNIR(CWS), PET, and direct electrostimulation. The evidence is analyzed in the light of six clinically-based hypotheses on the neurofunctional organization and neuroanatomical location of translation routes. Although the imaging data is inconclusive and contradictory in certain aspects, it indicates that (i) which specific neural substrates are involved in translation seems to depend on the type of source unit-words, sentences, suprasentential texts- and the direction of translation; (ii) the left hemisphere is either predominantly or exclusively involved in the translation of all three types of units; (iii) Broca's area seems to play a role in all translation tasks; and (iv) no specific regions have been identified which are exclusive to translation processes.

A cued gambling task was used to examine whether the FN is sensitive to possible outcomes on a given trial, or the range of outcomes across trials. On 50% of trials, participants could break even or lose money; on remaining trials, participants could win or break even. Breaking even was an unfavorable outcome relative to all possibilities in the current task, but the best possible outcome on 50% of trials. Results indicated that breaking even elicited an FN in both contexts, and reward feedback was uniquely associated with an enhanced positivity. Results suggest that the magnitude of the FN depends on all possible outcomes within the current task and are consistent with the view that the FN reflects reward-related neural activity.

The PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil does not affect auditory sensory gating in rats and humans	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory gating; Translational; PDE5; Vardenafil; Basic auditory information processing; EEG	OBJECT RECOGNITION MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY; EVOKED POTENTIALS; SILDENAFIL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P50; DEFICIT; COGNITION; CONSOLIDATION	Sensory gating is an adaptive mechanism of the brain to prevent overstimulation. Patients suffering from clinical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia exhibit a deficit in gating, which indicates not only an impairment in basic information processing that might contribute to the cognitive problems seen in these patients. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) have been shown to improve cognition in rodents in various behavioural tasks and might consequently be an interesting target for cognition enhancement. However, the effects of PDE5-Is on sensory gating are not known yet. This work aims to study the effects of PDE5 inhibition on auditory sensory gating in rats and humans. In the rat study, vehicle or 0.3-3 mg/kg of the PDE5-I vardenafil was given orally 30 min before testing and electrode locations were the vertex, hippocampus and the striatum. The human subjects received placebo, 10-20 mg vardenafil 85 min before testing and sensory gating was measured at the cortex (Fz, Fcz and Cz) electrodes. Significant gating was only found for the N1 component in rats while all three peaks P1, N1 and P2 showed gating in humans, i.e. the response to the second sound click was decreased as compared with the first for these deflections. Administration of vardenafil did neither have an effect on sensory gating in rats nor in humans. These findings imply that positive effects of PDE5 inhibition on cognition are not mediated by more early phases of information processing.	[Reneerkens, O. A. H.; Sambeth, A.; Van Duinen, M.

J	Choi, BJ; Jo, SH				Choi, Bongjae; Jo, Sungho			A Low-Cost EEG System-Based Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface for Humanoid Robot Navigation and Recognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BCI; CLASSIFICATION; RHYTHM	This paper describes a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) technique that combines the P300 potential, the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), and event related de-synchronization (ERD) to solve a complicated multi-task problem consisting of humanoid robot navigation and control along with object recognition using a low-cost BCI system. Our approach enables subjects to control the navigation and exploration of a humanoid robot and recognize a desired object among candidates. This study aims to demonstrate the possibility of a hybrid BCI based on a low-cost system for a realistic and complex task. It also shows that the use of a simple image processing technique, combined with BCI, can further aid in making these complex tasks simpler. An experimental scenario is proposed in which a subject remotely controls a humanoid robot in a properly sized maze. The subject sees what the surrogate robot sees through visual feedback and can navigate the surrogate robot. While navigating, the robot encounters objects located in the maze. It then recognizes if the encountered object is of interest to the subject. The subject communicates with the robot through SSVEP and ERD-based BCIs to navigate and explore with the robot, and P300-based BCI to allow the surrogate robot recognize their favorites. Using several evaluation metrics, the performances of five subjects navigating the robot were quite comparable to manual keyboard control. During object recognition mode, favorite objects were successfully selected from two to four choices. Subjects conducted humanoid navigation and recognition tasks as if they embodied the robot. Analysis of the data supports the potential usefulness of the proposed hybrid BCI system for extended applications. This work presents an important implication for the future work that a hybridization of simple BCI protocols provide extended controllability to carry out complicated tasks even with a low-cost system.

J	Carrus, E; Pearce, MT; Bhattacharya, J				Carrus, Elisa; Pearce, Marcus T.; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Melodic pitch expectation interacts with neural responses to syntactic but not semantic violations	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Melody; Language; Interaction; Syntax; Semantics	BRAIN RESPONSES; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BROCAS AREA; MUSIC; LANGUAGE; INTEGRATION; INDEPENDENCE; AGREEMENT; CHILDREN; GENDER	Current behavioural and electrophysiological evidence suggests that music and language syntactic processing depends on at least partly shared neural resources. Existing studies using a simultaneous presentation paradigm are limited to the effects of violations of harmonic structure in Western tonal music on processing of single syntactic or semantic violations. Because melody is a universal property of music as it is emphasized also by non-western musical traditions, it is fundamental to investigate interactions between melodic expectation and language processing. The present study investigates the effect of melodically unexpected notes on neural responses elicited by linguistic violations. Sentences with or without a violation in the last word were presented on screen simultaneously with melodies whose last note had a high- or low-probability, as estimated by a computational model of melodic expectation. Violations in language could be syntactic, semantic or combined. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants occasionally responded to language stimuli. Confirming previous studies, low-probability notes elicited an enhanced Ni compared to high-probability notes. Further, syntactic violations elicited a left anterior negativity (LAN) and P600 component, and semantic violations elicited an N400. Combined violations elicited components which resembled neural responses to both syntactic and semantic incongruities. The LAN amplitude was decreased when language syntactic violations were presented simultaneously with low-probability notes compared to when they were presented with high-probability notes. The N400 was not influenced by the note-probability. These findings show support for the neural interaction between language and music processing, including novel evidence for melodic processing which can be incorporated in a computational framework of melodic expectation.

Early and late stages of visual processing in individuals in prodromal state and first episode schizophrenia: An ERP study	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Prodromal state; P300; N1; P1; Schizophrenia	ULTRA-HIGH RISK; NEURAL ANOMALIES; P300 AMPLITUDE; PSYCHOSIS; SYMPTOMS; DEFICITS; SCALE	Background: P300 deficits in schizophrenia patients are well established, especially in the auditory modality. Several studies have also reported P300 abnormalities in schizophrenia in visual tasks, but these findings are inconsistent. Furthermore, reports on P300 in visual modality in prodromal subjects are very limited. While P300 indexes relatively late and complex cognitive functions such as context updating in working memory, sensory-evoked components such as the P1/N1 primarily index early stages of perceptual processing. Several previous studies suggest that P300 reduction in schizophrenia patients may be dissociable from these earlier components. Therefore, in this study, we measured the P300 component as well as the P1/N1 in a visual odd-ball paradigm in prodromal subjects and first episode schizophrenia patients, and compared them with those of healthy controls. Method: Visual P300 and P1/N1 were obtained from prodromal (PRO, n=23), first episode schizophrenia patients (SZ, n=17), and healthy control subjects (HC, n=31), who silently counted infrequent target stimuli ("X") amid standard stimuli ("Y") presented on the screen while 64-channel EEG was recorded. Results: Both PRO and SZ subjects showed reduced P300 amplitudes and delayed P300 peak latencies in comparison to control subjects. On the other hand, N1 amplitude was significantly reduced only in SZ but not in PRO. Increased severity of positive symptoms was significantly associated with smaller P300 amplitude in PRO. Conclusions: These results suggest that visual P300 is affected already at the prodromal stage and could be a marker of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B. V.

This study investigated speech perception difficulties in adults with dyslexia using behavioural and neural measurements with stimuli along a place-of-articulation continuum with well-defined allophonic boundaries. Adults without dyslexia served as control participants. Methods: Categorical perception of a/b(sic) - d(sic)/place-of-articulation continuum was evaluated using both identification and discrimination tasks. In addition to these behavioural measures, mismatch negativity (MMN) was recorded for stimuli that came from either similar or different phoneme categories. Results: The adults with dyslexia exhibited less consistent labelling than controls, but no heightened sensitivity to allophonic contrasts was observed at the behavioural level. Neural measurements revealed that stimuli from different phoneme categories elicited MMNs in both the adults with dyslexia and controls, whereas stimuli from the same category elicited an MMN in the adults with dyslexia only. Conclusion: The finding that adults with dyslexia have heightened sensitivity to allophonic contrasts in the form of neural activation supports the allophonic explanation of dyslexia. Significance: Sensitivity to allophonic contrasts may be a valuable marker for dyslexia. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The impact of task relevance and degree of distraction on stimulus processing	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Selective attention; Working memory; Cognitive control; P100; N170; ADHD	TOP-DOWN CONTROL; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SEARCH; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GERMAN VALIDATION	Background: The impact of task relevance on event-related potential amplitudes of early visual processing was previously demonstrated. Study designs, however, differ greatly, not allowing simultaneous investigation of how both degree of distraction and task relevance influence processing variations. In our study, we combined different features of previous tasks. We used a modified 1-back task in which task relevant and task irrelevant stimuli were alternately presented. The task irrelevant stimuli could be from the same or from a different category as the task relevant stimuli, thereby producing high and low distracting task irrelevant stimuli. In addition, the paradigm comprised a passive viewing condition. Thus, our paradigm enabled us to compare the processing of task relevant stimuli, task irrelevant stimuli with differing degrees of distraction, and passively viewed stimuli. EEG data from twenty participants was collected and mean P100 and N170 amplitudes were analyzed. Furthermore, a potential connection of stimulus processing and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated. Results: Our results show a modulation of peak N170 amplitudes by task relevance. N170 amplitudes to task relevant stimuli were significantly higher than to high distracting task irrelevant or passively viewed stimuli. In addition, amplitudes to low distracting task irrelevant stimuli were significantly higher than to high distracting stimuli. N170 amplitudes to passively viewed stimuli were not significantly different from either kind of task irrelevant stimuli. Participants with more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity showed decreased N170 amplitudes across all task conditions. On a behavioral level, lower N170 enhancement efficiency was significantly correlated with false alarm responses. Conclusions: Our results point to a processing enhancement of task relevant stimuli. Unlike P100 amplitudes, N170 amplitudes were strongly influenced by enhancement and enhancement efficiency seemed to have direct behavioral consequences. These findings have potential implications for models of clinical disorders affecting selective attention, especially ADHD.

J	Kranczioch, C; Dhinakaran, J				Kranczioch, Cornelia; Dhinakaran, Janani			The role of temporal context and expectancy in resource allocation to and perception of rapid serial events	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Attentional awakening; P3; ERP; Resource allocation; Probability; Rapid serial visual presentation	ATTENTIONAL BLINK; VISUAL PRESENTATION; POTENTIALS	The perception of target events presented in a rapid stream of non-targets is impaired for early target positions, but then gradually improves, a phenomenon known as attentional awakening. This phenomenon has been associated with better resource allocation. It is unclear though whether improved resource allocation and attentional awakening are a consequence of the temporal context, that is, the position of the target event in the stimulus stream, or are due to a simple expectancy or foreperiod effect. Expectancy is an alternative explanation of attentional awakening because it depends on the a posteriori probabilities, which will increase with target position when all target positions are equally likely. To differentiate between the expectancy and the temporal context account the a priori (objective) probability of target position was defined such that the a posteriori probability would be high for early and late, and low for intermediate target positions. EEG was collected and the P3 ERP evoked by target events was derived as an indicator of resource allocation. A robust attentional awakening effect was observed. The relationships between measures of performance and P3 amplitude, and respectively target position, a priori, and a posteriori probability were analyzed. Results showed that in contrast to target position, a posteriori probability had little impact on performance and did not moderate the association between P3 amplitude and performance. Results also indicated that in spite of the evident role of target position on resource allocation and the perception of target events in rapid stimulus streams, target position is likely not the only variable these are affected by. Nevertheless, the findings of the present study suggest that whereas the temporal context of a rapid serial event is a key player for resource allocation to and perception of the event, expectancy seems of very little consequence.

Eighteen adults were recruited for this study. In the ERP experiments, the participants were required to identify 2D figures with mental rotation. The results showed the differences between the high-achieving (HA) and low-achieving (LA) spatial ability participants in their use of mental rotation for identifying 2D figures. At 300-380 ms, the HA participants showed higher brain activity in the right hemisphere than in other brain areas, whereas the LA participants showed activity in the whole brain. At 520 to 620 ms, the areas of brain activity were in the opposite hemisphere for the HA and LA participants. The highest brain activity was shown in the left hemisphere of the HA participants and in the right hemisphere for the LA participants at 520 to 620 ms. The implication of this study is that right hemisphere specialization for mental rotation might appear in early cognitive processing, but in late cognitive processing, the left hemisphere specialization form of mental rotation might show an advantage.

The processing of early-versus late-acquired words was compared with that of high-frequency versus low-frequency words. Participants were asked to perform an orthographic task while EEG was recorded from 128 sites. RTs showed an effect of both word AoA and lexical frequency. ERPs revealed a neuro-functional dissociation between AoA and frequency effects in early word processing. AoA modulated the amplitude of left occipito-temporal selection-negativity, suggesting an effect of AoA on early orthographic and lexical access and revealing the crucial role of AoA in determining how words are neurally represented in the ventral pathway. Lexical frequency modulated the amplitude of left anterior negativity, providing evidence for the involvement of the left inferior frontal cortex in the processing of low-frequency words.

J	Manuel, AL; Bernasconi, F; Spierer, L				Manuel, Aurelie L.; Bernasconi, Fosco; Spierer, Lucas			Plastic modifications within inhibitory control networks induced by practicing a stop-signal task: An electrical neuroimaging study	CORTEX			English	Article						Inhibitory control; Plasticity; EEG source estimation; Stop-signal task; Learning	INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; ACTIVATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR	Introduction: Inhibitory control refers to our ability to suppress ongoing motor, affective or cognitive processes and mostly depends on a fronto-basal brain network. Inhibitory control deficits participate in the emergence of several prominent psychiatric conditions, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or addiction. The rehabilitation of these pathologies might therefore benefit from training-based behavioral interventions aiming at improving inhibitory control proficiency and normalizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. The development of an efficient inhibitory control training regimen first requires determining the effects of practicing inhibition tasks. Methods: We addressed this question by contrasting behavioral performance and electrical neuroimaging analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from humans at the beginning versus the end of 1 h of practice on a stop-signal task (SST) involving the withholding of responses when a stop signal was presented during a speeded auditory discrimination task. Results: Practicing a short SST improved behavioral performance. Electrophysiologically, ERPs differed topographically at 200 msec post-stimulus onset, indicative of the engagement of distinct brain network with learning. Source estimations localized this effect within the inferior frontal gyrus, the pre-supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia. Conclusion: Our collective results indicate that behavioral and brain responses during an inhibitory control task are subject to fast plastic changes and provide evidence that high-order fronto-basal executive networks can be modified by practicing a SST.

Among current BCIs, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI has drawn great attention due to its characteristics of easy preparation, high information transfer rate (ITR), high accuracy, and low cost. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are electrophysiological responses reflecting the underlying neural activities which are dependent upon subject's physiological states (e.g., emotion, attention, etc.) and usually variant among different individuals. The development of classification approaches to account for each individual's difference in SSVEP is needed but was seldom reported. Methods: This paper presents a multiclass support vector machine (SVM)-based classification approach for gaze-target detections in a phase-tagged SSVEP-based BCI. In the training steps, the amplitude and phase features of SSVEP from off-line recordings were used to train a multiclass SVM for each subject. In the on-line application study, effective epochs which contained sufficient SSVEP information of gaze targets were first determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, and the amplitude and phase features of effective epochs were subsequently inputted to the multiclass SVM to recognize user's gaze targets. Results: The on-line performance using the proposed approach has achieved high accuracy (89.88 +/- 4.76%), fast responding time (effective epoch length = 1.13 +/- 0.02 s), and the information transfer rate (ITR) was 50.91 +/- 8.70 bits/min. Conclusions: The multiclass SVM-based classification approach has been successfully implemented to improve the classification accuracy in a phase-tagged SSVEP-based BCI. The present study has shown the multiclass SVM can be effectively adapted to each subject's SSVEPs to discriminate SSVEP phase information from gazing at different gazed targets.

This study used slow cortical potentials (SCPs) to elaborate the time course of cognitive processing during temporal discounting. Depending on their strength of discounting, subjects were categorised as low and high impulsive. Low impulsives, but not high impulsives, showed faster reaction times for making decisions when the delayed reward was of high amount than when it was of low amount. Both low impulsives and high impulsives chose the delayed reward more often when its amount was high than when it was low, but this behavior was more pronounced for low impulsives. Moreover, only low impulsives showed more negative SCPs for low than for high amounts. All three measures indicated that only low impulsives experienced extended conflict for delayed low amounts than for high amounts. Additionally, the SCPs of low impulsives were more sensitive to the delay of the delayed reward than those of high impulsives, extending seconds after the response. This indicates that they continued evaluating their choices even after the decision. Altogether, the present study demonstrated that SCPs are sensitive to decision-related resource allocation during inter-temporal decision-making. Resource allocation depended both on the choice situation and on impulsivity. Furthermore, the time course of SCPs suggested that decision-related processes occurred both prior to and after the response.

The beneficial motor effects of STN DBS are likely due to modulation of BG output to frontal cortical regions associated with motor control, but the underlying neurophysiology of STN DBS effects, especially at the level of the cortex, is not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of STN DBS on motor disability and visual working memory, a cognitive process supported by pFC. We tested 10 PD participants off medications, ON and OFF stimulation, along with 20 normal controls on a visual working memory task while simultaneously recording cortical EEG. In the OFF state, PD patients had poor motor function, were slower and less accurate in performing the working memory task, and had greater amplitudes and shorter latencies of the N200 ERP response. DBS improved clinical motor function, reduced N200 amplitudes, and increased N200 latencies but had little effect on working memory performance. We conclude that STN DBS normalizes neurophysiological activity in fronto striatal circuits and this may independently affect motor and cognitive function.

The role of outcome expectations in the generation of the feedback-related negativity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						FRN; Expectations; ERP; Outcome	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG DYNAMICS; EXPECTANCY; THETA; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; DOPAMINE	The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is thought to index activity within the midbrain dopaminergic reward-learning system, with larger FRN magnitudes observed when outcomes are worse than expected. This view holds that the FRN is an index of neural activity coding for prediction errors, and reflects activity that can be used to adaptively alter future performance. Untested to date, however, is a key prediction of this view: the FRN should not appear in response to negative outcomes when outcome expectations are not allowed to develop. The current study tests this assumption by eliciting FRNs to win and loss feedback in conditions of participant choice, participant observation of computer choice, and, critically, simple presentation of win or loss feedback in the absence of a predictive choice cue. Whereas FRNs were observed in each of the conditions in which there was time for an expectation to develop, no FRN was observed in conditions without sufficient time for the development of an expectation. These results provide empirical support for an untested but central tenet of the reinforcement learning account of the genesis of the FRN.	[Bismark, Andrew W.; Whitworth, Nicole M.; Allen, John J.

J	Li, XO; Yan, YN; Wei, WS				Li, Xiaoou; Yan, Yuning; Wei, Wenshi			Identifying Patients with Poststroke Mild Cognitive Impairment by Pattern Recognition of Working Memory Load-Related ERP	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; CONNECTIVITY; DETERMINANTS; NETWORKS; DEMENTIA; STROKE	The early detection of subjects with probable cognitive deficits is crucial for effective appliance of treatment strategies. This paper explored a methodology used to discriminate between evoked related potential signals of stroke patients and their matched control subjects in a visual working memory paradigm. The proposed algorithm, which combined independent component analysis and orthogonal empirical mode decomposition, was applied to extract independent sources. Four types of target stimulus features including P300 peak latency, P300 peak amplitude, root mean square, and theta frequency band power were chosen. Evolutionary multiple kernel support vector machine (EMK-SVM) based on genetic programming was investigated to classify stroke patients and healthy controls. Based on 5-fold cross-validation runs, EMK-SVM provided better classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Comparing stroke patients with healthy controls using the proposed algorithm, we achieved the maximum classification accuracies of 91.76% and 82.23% for 0-back and 1-back tasks, respectively. Overall, the experimental results showed that the proposed method was effective. The approach in this study may eventually lead to a reliable tool for identifying suitable brain impairment candidates and assessing cognitive function.

The visual stimuli yielded a sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), suggesting that the maintenance of sequences of coloured stimuli engaged structures similar to those involved in the maintenance of simultaneous visual displays. On the other hand, maintenance of acoustic sequences produced a sustained negativity at fronto-central sites. This component is named the Sustained Anterior Negativity (SAN). The amplitude of the SAN increased with increasing load in ASTM and predicted individual differences in the performance. There was no SAN in a control condition with the same auditory stimuli but no memory task, nor one associated with visual memory. These results suggest that the SAN is an index of brain activity related to the maintenance of representations in ASTM that is distinct from the maintenance of representations in VSTM.

While research on the influence of biologically-based variables on creativity has a long history, the advent of modern techniques for investigating brain structure and function in the past two decades have resulted in an exponential increase in the number of neuroscientific studies that have explored creativity. The field of creative neurocognition is a rapidly growing area of research that can appear chaotic and inaccessible because of the heterogeneity associated with the creativity construct and the many approaches through which it can be examined. There are also significant methodological and conceptual problems that are specific to the neuroscientific study of creativity that pose considerable limitations on our capacity to make true advances in understanding the brain basis of creativity. This article explores three key issues that need to be addressed so that barriers in the way of relevant progress being made within the field can be avoided.

However, bivariate phase synchrony is not sufficient for complex system analysis such as the brain where the bivariate relationships do not always reflect the underlying network structure. Recently, multivariate extensions of bivariate phase synchrony has been of interest in investigating the interactions within a group of oscillators. Current extensions are based on either averaging all possible pairwise synchrony values or eigen decomposition of a matrix of bivariate synchronization indices to estimate multivariate synchrony using the entropy of the normalized eigenvalues. All of these approaches are sensitive to the accuracy of the bivariate synchrony indices, cause loss of information, computationally complex and are indirect ways to quantify the multivariate synchrony. In this paper, we propose a novel and direct measure to estimate the multivariate phase synchrony by forming direction vectors in a multidimensional hyperspherical coordinate system. The proposed method is evaluated through application to electroencephalogram (EEG) data containing error-related negativity (ERN) related to cognitive control. We compare the new measure with existing methods and show its effectiveness in quantifying multivariate synchronization of different brain regions.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) and sensory auditory processing in children aged 9-12 years presenting with putative antecedents of schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; High-risk; Psychopathology; Development; Cognition; Biomarker	PSYCHOTIC-LIKE EXPERIENCES; ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GENERATION; DEFICITS; BRAIN; METAANALYSIS; DYSFUNCTION; MATURATION	Identification of markers of abnormal brain function in children at-risk of schizophrenia may inform early intervention and prevention programs. Individuals with schizophrenia are characterised by attenuation of MMN amplitude, which indexes automatic auditory sensory processing. The current aim was to examine whether children who may be at increased risk of schizophrenia due to their presenting multiple putative antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz) are similarly characterised by MMN amplitude reductions, relative to typically developing (TD) children. EEG was recorded from 22 ASz and 24 TD children aged 9 to 12 years (matched on age, sex, and IQ) during a passive auditory oddball task (15% duration deviant). ASz children were those presenting: (1) speech and/or motor development lags/problems; (2) social, emotional, or behavioural problems in the clinical range; and (3) psychotic-like experiences. TD children presented no antecedents, and had no family history of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. MMN amplitude, but not latency, was significantly greater at frontal sites in the ASz group than in the TD group. Although the MMN exhibited by the children at risk of schizophrenia was unlike that of their typically developing peers, it also differed from the reduced MMN amplitude observed in adults with schizophrenia. This may reflect developmental and disease effects in a pre-prodromal phase of psychosis onset. Longitudinal follow-up is necessary to establish the developmental trajectory of MMN in at-risk children. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In spite of continuous improvements, errors in movement decoding are still a major problem of current BMI systems. If the difference between the decoded and intended movements becomes noticeable, it may lead to an execution error. Outcome errors, where subjects fail to reach a certain movement goal, are also present during online BMI operation. Detecting such errors can be beneficial for BMI operation: (i) errors can be corrected online after being detected and (ii) adaptive BMI decoding algorithm can be updated to make fewer errors in the future. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we show that error events can be detected from human electrocorticography (ECoG) during a continuous task with high precision, given a temporal tolerance of 300-400 milliseconds. We quantified the error detection accuracy and showed that, using only a small subset of 262 ECoG electrodes, 82% of detection information for outcome error and 74% of detection information for execution error available from all ECoG electrodes could be retained. Conclusions/Significance: The error detection method presented here could be used to correct errors made during BMI operation or to adapt a BMI algorithm to make fewer errors in the future. Furthermore, our results indicate that smaller ECoG implant could be used for error detection. Reducing the size of an ECoG electrode implant used for BMI decoding and error detection could significantly reduce the medical risk of implantation.

Following a user-centered approach, we investigated event-related potentials (ERR) elicited in different modalities for use in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Such systems could provide her with an alternative communication channel. To investigate the most viable modality for achieving BCI based communication, classic oddball paradigms (1 rare and 1 frequent stimulus, ratio 1:5) in the visual, auditory and tactile modality were conducted (2 runs per modality). Classifiers were built on one run and tested offline on another run (and vice versa). In these paradigms, the tactile modality was clearly superior to other modalities, displaying high offline accuracy even when classification was performed on single trials only. Consequently, we tested the tactile paradigm online and the patient successfully selected targets without any error. Furthermore, we investigated use of the visual or tactile modality for different BCI systems with more than two selection options. In the visual modality, several BCI paradigms were tested offline. Neither matrix-based nor so-called gaze-independent paradigms constituted a means of control. These results may thus question the gaze-independence of current gaze-independent approaches to BCI. A tactile four-choice BCI resulted in high offline classification accuracies. Yet, online use raised various issues. Although performance was clearly above chance, practical daily life use appeared unlikely when compared to other communication approaches (e.g., partner scanning). Our results emphasize the need for user-centered design in BCI development including identification of the best stimulus modality for a particular user. Finally, the paper discusses feasibility of EEG-based BCI systems for patients in classic locked-in state and compares BCI to other AT solutions that we also tested during the study.

Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently applications for entertainment have also been developed. Brain Painting allows the user creative expression through painting pictures. Objective: The second, revised prototype of the BCI Brain Painting application was evaluated in its target function - free painting - and compared to the P300 spelling application by four end users with severe disabilities. Methods: According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), usability was evaluated in terms of effectiveness (accuracy), efficiency (information transfer rate (ITR)), utility metric, subjective workload (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX)) and user satisfaction (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST) 2.0 and Assistive Technology Device Predisposition Assessment (ATD PA), Device Form). Results: The results revealed high performance levels (M >= 80% accuracy) in the free painting and the copy painting conditions, ITRs (4.47-6.65 bits/min) comparable to other P300 applications and only low to moderate workload levels (5-49 of 100), thereby proving that the complex task of free painting did neither impair performance nor impose insurmountable workload. Users were satisfied with the BCI Brain Painting application. Main obstacles for use in daily life were the system operability and the EEG cap, particularly the need of extensive support for adjustment. Conclusion: The P300 Brain Painting application can be operated with high effectiveness and efficiency. End users with severe motor paralysis would like to use the application in daily life. User-friendliness, specifically ease of use, is a mandatory necessity when bringing BCI to end users. Early and active involvement of users and iterative user-centered evaluation enable developers to work toward this goal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrophysiological correlates of auditory change detection and change deafness in complex auditory scenes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory change blindness; Deviance; ERP; MLR; Saliency network; Mismatch	SPATIAL ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CHANGE BLINDNESS; INFORMATIONAL MASKING; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; CORTEX; PITCH; PERCEPTION; AWARENESS	Change deafness describes the failure to perceive even intense changes within complex auditory input, if the listener does not attend to the changing sound. Remarkably, previous psychophysical data provide evidence that this effect occurs independently of successful stimulus encoding, indicating that undetected changes are processed to some extent in auditory cortex. Here we investigated cortical representations of detected and undetected auditory changes using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and a change deafness paradigm. We applied a one-shot change detection task, in which participants listened successively to three complex auditory scenes, each of them consisting of six simultaneously presented auditory streams. Listeners had to decide whether all scenes were identical or whether the pitch of one stream was changed between the last two presentations. Our data show significantly increased middle-latency Nb responses for both detected and undetected changes as compared to no-change trials. In contrast, only successfully detected changes were associated with a later mismatch response in auditory cortex, followed by increased N2, P3a and P3b responses, originating from hierarchically higher non-sensory brain regions. These results strengthen the view that undetected changes are successfully encoded at sensory level in auditory cortex, but fail to trigger later change-related cortical responses that lead to conscious perception of change.

Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) has been proposed as a promising susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, and a previous study has suggested that it is associated with P300 deficits in schizophrenia. Methods: We examined the role of variation in DISC1 polymorphisms on the P300 endophenotype in a large sample of patients with schizophrenia or psychotic bipolar disorder (n = 149), their unaffected relatives (n = 130), and unrelated healthy controls (n = 208) using linear regression and haplotype analysis. Results: Significant associations between P300 amplitude and latency and DISC1 polymorphisms/haplotypes were found. Those homozygous for the A allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs821597 displayed significantly reduced P300 amplitudes in comparison with homozygous for the G allele (P = .009) and the heterozygous group (P = .018). Haplotype analysis showed a significant association for DISC1 haplotypes (rs3738401 vertical bar rs6675281 vertical bar rs821597 vertical bar rs821616 vertical bar rs967244 vertical bar rs980989) and P300 latency. Haplotype GCGTCG and ACGTTT were associated with shorter latencies. Discussion: The P300 waveform appears to be modulated by variation in individual SNPs and haplotypes of DISC1. Because DISC1 is involved in neurodevelopment, one hypothesis is that disruption in neural connectivity impairs cognitive processes illustrated by P300 deficits observed in this sample.

BRAINnet: A STANDARDIZED GLOBAL HUMAN BRAIN PROJECT	TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Standardization; Databases; Genomics; Imaging; Brain disorders; International human brain project		The BRAINnet Foundation goal is to understand mental illness as a human brain disease and to ultimately discover how to prevent and cure these illnesses; this is accomplished through open electronic sharing and continued expansion of a global database of human brain data in health and disease across the life span. It is a 501(c) 3 US-Based Tax Exempt Research Foundation, with these unique features: (i) standardized protocols and assessment platforms so that data can be pooled across disorders, sites, and studies and (ii) multiple types of data spanning clinical, behavioral, physiological, imaging, and genomic domains in the same subjects. These domains align with those of NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), (iii) open sharing of data without needing to contribute new data, and (iv) network of collaborating researchers, for seeking grant support to carry out studies, drawing on existing data and standardized methods. The BRAINnet methods span self-report scales, computerized behavioral measures of cognition and emotion, physiology (EEG, ERP, and concurrent autonomic recordings), magnetic resonance imaging (structural, functional, and diffusion tensor imaging), and salivary or blood draws for genotyping. Currently, data are available for 5,092 healthy subjects and others from specific disorders. Recent outcomes from the published studies using BRAINnet data demonstrate how the standardized approach is a quality and efficient way to take a lead in initiatives being forged in psychiatry and neuroscience, such as NIMH's RDoC, to identify biomarkers that will make a difference in understanding the cause of mental illness, tailoring current treatments, and developing novel ones.

Modelling Trial-by-Trial Changes in the Mismatch Negativity	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE; AUDITORY CHANGE DETECTION; MEMORY-TRACE FORMATION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; SENSORY MEMORY; DEVIANCE DETECTION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; POPULATION CODES; VISUAL-CORTEX; POTENTIAL ERP	The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a differential brain response to violations of learned regularities. It has been used to demonstrate that the brain learns the statistical structure of its environment and predicts future sensory inputs. However, the algorithmic nature of these computations and the underlying neurobiological implementation remain controversial. This article introduces a mathematical framework with which competing ideas about the computational quantities indexed by MMN responses can be formalized and tested against single-trial EEG data. This framework was applied to five major theories of the MMN, comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude. Three of these theories (predictive coding, model adjustment, and novelty detection) were formalized by linking the MMN to different manifestations of the same computational mechanism: approximate Bayesian inference according to the free-energy principle. We thereby propose a unifying view on three distinct theories of the MMN. The relative plausibility of each theory was assessed against empirical single-trial MMN amplitudes acquired from eight healthy volunteers in a roving oddball experiment. Models based on the free-energy principle provided more plausible explanations of trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude than models representing the two more traditional theories (change detection and adaptation). Our results suggest that the MMN reflects approximate Bayesian learning of sensory regularities, and that the MMN-generating process adjusts a probabilistic model of the environment according to prediction errors.

However, the jury is still out on the question: to what degree are neuronal systems that subserve acquisition of semantic knowledge, such as sensory-motor networks, involved in its representation and processing? We will begin with a critical evaluation of the main behavioral and neuroimaging methods with respect to their capability to define the functional roles of specific brain areas. Any behavioral or neuroscientific measure is a conflation of representations and processes. Hence, a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological interactions as well as time-course information is required to define the functional roles of brain areas. This will guide our review of the empirical literature. Most research in this area has been done on semantics of concrete words, where clear theoretical frameworks for an involvement of sensory-motor systems in semantics exist. Most of this evidence still stems from correlational studies that are ambiguous with respect to the behavioral relevance of effects. Evidence for causal effects of sensory-motor systems on semantic processes is still scarce but evolving. Relatively few neuroscientific studies so far have investigated the embodiment of abstract semantics for words, numbers, and arithmetic facts. Here, some correlational evidence exists, but data on causality are mostly absent. We conclude that neuroimaging data, just as behavioral data, have so far not disentangled the fundamental link between process and representation. Future studies should therefore put more emphasis on the effects of task and context on semantic processing. Strong conclusions can only be drawn from a combination of methods that provide time-course information, determine the connectivity among poly- or amodal and sensory-motor areas, link behavioral with neuroimaging measures, and allow causal inferences. We will conclude with suggestions on how this could be accomplished in future research.

According to the Cognitive-Energetic Model (CEM), children with AD/HD are unable to effectively modulate their energetic state, leading to task underperformance. Using an Eriksen flanker task with varying event-rates, the current study compared the ability of typically-developing children and children with AD/HD to modulate their energetic state. In line with the CEM, it was predicted that children with AD/HD would underperform in the fast and slow event-rates. Results indicated that the groups did not differ in commission errors (i.e., incorrect responses). However, children with AD/HD made more omission errors to incongruent stimuli at the fast and slow event-rates, compared to controls. N2 amplitude was significantly larger for the AD/HD than control group in the slow event-rate. It is concluded that the energetic state modulation dysfunction in children with AD/HD results in an inability to attend to the task, as opposed to an inability to perform the task itself. Furthermore, these task performance differences did not manifest in either the N2 or P3 ERP components. Therefore, inattention in children with AD/HD may have its locus in response preparation, as opposed to stimulus processing, but more research is required to validate these conjectures.

A new and faster paradigm was adopted to look for differences between 2 groups of subjects. Twenty-eight subjects with chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus and 33 matched healthy controls were included in the study. Brain electrical activity mapping of multi-feature MMN paradigm was recorded from 32 surface scalp electrodes. Three MMN parameters for five deviants consisting frequency, intensity, duration, location and silent gap were compared between the two groups. The MMN amplitude, latency and area under the curve over a region of interest comprising: F3, F4, Fz, FC3, FC4, FCz, and Cz were computed to provide better signal to noise ratio. These three measures could differentiate the cognitive processing disturbances in tinnitus sufferers. The MMN topographic maps revealed significant differences in amplitude and area under the curve for frequency, duration and silent gap deviants in tinnitus subjects compared to NH controls. The current study provides electrophysiological evidence supporting the theory that the pre-attentive and automatic central auditory processing is impaired in individuals with chronic tinnitus. Considering the advantages offered by the MMN paradigm used here, these data might be a useful reference point for the assessment of sensory memory in tinnitus patients and it can be applied with reliability and success in treatment monitoring.

J	Hesdorffer, DC; Tomson, T				Hesdorffer, Dale C.; Tomson, Torbjorn			Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Potential Role of Antiepileptic Drugs	CNS DRUGS			English	Review							NEWLY-DIAGNOSED EPILEPSY; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE; RISK-FACTORS; UNEXPLAINED DEATH; SUDEP; LAMOTRIGINE; CARBAMAZEPINE; ARRHYTHMIA; MORTALITY	Among people with epilepsy, there is a 20-fold higher risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly compared with the general population. This phenomenon is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and the term is used when sudden death occurs in an otherwise reasonably healthy person with epilepsy and the autopsy is unrevealing. In most cases, SUDEP occurs during sleep and is unwitnessed. Risk factors for SUDEP include the presence or number of generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS), nocturnal seizures, young age at epilepsy onset, longer duration of epilepsy, dementia, absence of cerebrovascular disease, asthma, male gender, symptomatic aetiology of epilepsy and alcohol abuse. Suggested factors predisposing to SUDEP have included long-QT-related mutations, impaired serotonergic brain stem control of respiration, altered autonomic control and seizures with a pronounced postictal suppression and respiratory compromise. Final events that may lead up to SUDEP are a postictal CNS shutdown with pronounced EEG suppression, ictal or postictal apnoea, and ictal cardiac arrhythmia. It is unknown whether antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modify the risk for SUDEP. Studies have consistently found that the presence or number of GTCS is associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. Since continued presence of GTCS clearly necessitates the use of AEDs, both factors must be taken into account to determine whether one or both increases the risk for SUDEP. Some studies suggest that AEDs, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, may increase the risk of SUDEP, but rarely adjust for GTCS. Other studies, which have found that AEDs are associated with a decreased SUDEP risk, either adjust for the number of GTCS or are meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Studies assessing the impact of AEDs on the risk for SUDEP are limited because SUDEP is a rare event, making randomized clinical trials impossible to conduct. Observational studies focus on whether or not an AED was prescribed. When postmortem AED concentrations are assessed they are usually low or absent, perhaps due to sampling in deceased individuals, making it difficult to fully resolve whether AEDs increase or decrease SUDEP risk. Despite these caveats, the evidence suggests that AEDs are not associated with an increased risk for SUDEP on a population level, although some individuals may be susceptible to effects of AEDs. Recent evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses provides strong support for AED treatment as mono- or polytherapy to increase seizure control and protect against SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy. For patients for whom seizure control is unattainable, supervision or monitoring may prevent SUDEP, though this has never been formally tested.

We present ten social phobic subjects with three individually selected groups of words representing unconscious conflict, conscious symptom experience, and Osgood Semantic negative valence words used as a control word group. The unconscious conflict and conscious symptom words, presented subliminally and supraliminally, act as primes preceding the conscious symptom and control words presented as supraliminal targets. With alpha power as a marker of inhibitory brain activity, we show that unconscious conflict primes, only when presented subliminally, have a unique inhibitory effect on conscious symptom targets. This effect is absent when the unconscious conflict primes are presented supraliminally, or when the target is the control words. Unconscious conflict prime effects were found to correlate with a measure of repressiveness in a similar previous study (Shevrin et al., 1992, 1996). Conscious symptom primes have no inhibitory effect when presented subliminally. Inhibitory effects with conscious symptom primes are present, but only when the primes are supraliminal, and they did not correlate with repressiveness in a previous study (Shevrin et al., 1992, 1996). We conclude that while the inhibition following supraliminal conscious symptom primes is due to conscious threat bias, the inhibition following subliminal unconscious conflict primes provides a neurological blueprint for dynamic repression: it is only activated subliminally by an individual's unconscious conflict and has an inhibitory effect specific only to the conscious symptom. These novel findings constitute neuroscientific evidence for the psychoanalytic concepts of unconscious conflict and repression, while extending neuroscience theory and methods into the realm of personal, psychological meaning.

J	Meyer, GF; Harrison, NR; Wuerger, SM				Meyer, Georg F.; Harrison, Neil R.; Wuerger, Sophie M.			The time course of auditory-visual processing of speech and body actions: Evidence for the simultaneous activation of an extended neural network for semantic processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Multisensory; Biological motion; Speech; Semantic processing; EEG	BIOLOGICAL-MOTION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BIMODAL SPEECH; HUMANS; IDENTIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; CONGRUENCE; RESPONSES	An extensive network of cortical areas is involved in multisensory object and action recognition. This network draws on inferior frontal, posterior temporal, and parietal areas; activity is modulated by familiarity and the semantic congruency of auditory and visual component signals even if semantic incongruences are created by combining visual and auditory signals representing very different signal categories, such as speech and whole body actions. Here we present results from a high-density ERP study designed to examine the time-course and source location of responses to semantically congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech and body actions to explore whether the network involved in action recognition consists of a hierarchy of sequentially activated processing modules or a network of simultaneously active processing sites. We report two main results: 1) There are no significant early differences in the processing of congruent and incongruent audiovisual action sequences. The earliest difference between congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli occurs between 240 and 280 ms after stimulus onset in the left temporal region. Between 340 and 420 ms, semantic congruence modulates responses in central and right frontal areas. Late differences (after 460 ms) occur bilaterally in frontal areas. 2) Source localisation (dipole modelling and LORETA) reveals that an extended network encompassing inferior frontal, temporal, parasaggital, and superior parietal sites are simultaneously active between 180 and 420 ms to process auditory-visual action sequences. Early activation (before 120 ms) can be explained by activity in mainly sensory cortices. The simultaneous activation of an extended network between 180 and 420 ms is consistent with models that posit parallel processing of complex action sequences in frontal, temporal and parietal areas rather than models that postulate hierarchical processing in a sequence of brain regions.
