In this paper, we propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal model for estimating ERP components from multichannel EEG recorded under multiple experimental conditions. The model isolates the spatially and temporally overlapping ERP components by utilizing their phase-locking structure and the inter-condition non-stationarity structure of their amplitudes and latencies. Critically, unlike in previous multilinear algorithms, the non-phase-locked background EEGs are modeled as spatially correlated and non-isotropic signals. A variational algorithm was developed for approximate Bayesian inference of the proposed model, with the effective number of ERP components automatically determined as a part of the algorithm. The Utility of the algorithm is demonstrated with applications to synthetic data and the EEG data collected from 13 subjects during a face inversion experiment. The results show that our algorithm more accurately and reliably estimates the spatio-temporal patterns, amplitudes, and latencies of the underlying ERP components in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Currently used diagnostic approaches include the traditional neuropsychological tests, and recently more objective biomarkers, such as those obtained from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), magnetic imaging resonance (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Electroencephalography (EEG), a lower cost and non-invasive alternative, has been previously tried but with mixed success. In this effort, we attempt a more comprehensive analysis and comparison of machine learning approaches using EEG based features to determine diagnostic utility of the EEG. We compared support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), CART trees, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and AdaBoost on various sets of features extracted from event related potentials (ERP) of the EEG. Our analysis suggests that there is indeed diagnostically useful information in the ERP of the EEG for early diagnosis of AD.

This chapter summarizes the investigation of timing and time perception using scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique that measures brain electrical potentials on a millisecond time scale. Over the past several decades, much has been learned about interval timing through the examination of the characteristic features of averaged EEG signals (i.e., event-related potentials, ERPs) elicited in timing paradigms. For example, the mismatch negativity (MMN) and omission potential (OP) have been used to study implicit and explicit timing, respectively, the P300 has been used to investigate temporal memory updating, and the contingent negative variation (CNV) has been used as an index of temporal decision making. In sum, EEG measures provide biomarkers of temporal processing that allow researchers to probe the cognitive and neural substrates underlying time perception.

Process of parameter setting for EA is also explored. A concept of bounded or controlled search space is proposed to identify the best range for search space. Statistical analysis over the simulation results has been performed to quantitatively identify the range and its control parameter. Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) are implemented for the design of AF. Testing of AF has been done through consideration of two types of noise (white noise and ongoing EEG noise) over three ERP signals (Simulated Visual Evoked Potential, Real Evoked Potential and Real Sensorimotor Evoked Potential).

For this reason, the current study on clinical brain research and brain machine interface (BMI) uses EEG signal in many applications. Due to the significant noise in EEG, signal processing to enhance signal to noise power ratio (SNR) is necessary for EEG research. The typical method is averaging many trials of ERP (event related potential) signal that represents a brain response of a particular stimulus or a task. The averaging, however, is very sensitive to timing error. In this study, we propose a time delay estimation based on simplified maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. The simulation result shows the performance of proposed scheme provides better performance than conventional schemes employing averaged signal as a reference.

ERPLAB is closely integrated with EEG LAB, a popular open-source toolbox that provides many EEG preprocessing steps and an excellent user interface design. ERPLAB adds to EEGLAB's EEG processing functions, providing additional tools for filtering, artifact detection, re-referencing, and sorting of events, among others. ERPLAB also provides robust tools for averaging EEG segments together to create averaged ERPs, for creating difference waves and other recombinations of ERP waveforms through algebraic expressions, for filtering and rereferencing the averaged ERPs, for plotting ERP waveforms and scalp maps, and for quantifying several types of amplitudes and latencies. ERPLAB's tools can be accessed either from an easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from MATLAB scripts, and a command history function makes it easy for users with no programming experience to write scripts. Consequently, ERPLAB provides both ease of use and virtually unlimited power and flexibility, making it appropriate for the analysis of both simple and complex ERP experiments. Several forms of documentation are available, including a detailed user's guide, a step-by-step tutorial, a scripting guide, and a set of video-based demonstrations.

A wavelet based algorithm for the identification of oscillatory event-related potential components	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Single-trial EEG; Wavelet asymmetry; N170 ERP detection	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TRANSFORM; SIGNAL; INTERFACE; TIME	Event related potentials (ERPs) are very feeble alterations in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) and their detection is a challenging problem. Based on the unique time-based parameters derived from wavelet coefficients and the asymmetry property of wavelets a novel algorithm to separate ERP components in single-trial EEG data is described. Though illustrated as a specific application to N170 ERP detection, the algorithm is a generalized approach that can be easily adapted to isolate different kinds of ERP components. The algorithm detected the N170 ERP component with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate that the asymmetry method is more accurate than the matching wavelet algorithm and t-CWT method by 48.67 and 8.03 percent, respectively. This paper provides an off-line demonstration of the algorithm and considers issues related to the extension of the algorithm to real-time applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The EFRP method allows one to synchronize eye tracking with electroencephalographic (EEG) recording to precisely capture users' neural activity at the exact time at which they start to cognitively process a stimulus (e.g., event on the screen). This complements and overcomes some of the shortcomings of the traditional event related potential (ERP) method, which can only stamp the time at which a stimulus is presented to a user. Thus, we propose a method conjecture of the superiority of EFRP over ERP for capturing the cognitive processing of a stimulus when such cognitive processing is not necessarily synchronized with the time at which the stimulus appears. We illustrate the EFRP method with an experiment in a natural IS use context in which we asked users to read an industry report while email pop-up notifications arrived on their screen. The results support our proposed hypotheses and show three distinct neural processes associated with 1) the attentional reaction to email pop-up notification, 2) the cognitive processing of the email pop-up notification, and 3) the motor planning activity involved in opening or not the email. Furthermore, further analyses of the data gathered in the experiment serve to validate our method conjecture about the superiority of the EFRP method over the ERP in natural IS use contexts. In addition to the experiment, our study discusses important IS research questions that could be pursued with the aid of EFRP, and describes a set of guidelines to help IS researchers use this method.

BAYESIAN DETECTION OF SINGLE-TRIAL EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAY 04-09, 2014	Florence, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		EEG; event-related potentials (ERP); MCMC; Gaussian process	SUBCOMPONENTS	The goal of this paper is to build a detector of event-related potentials (ERP) in single-trial EEG data. This problem can be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem, where the parameter of interest is the time of occurrence of the ERP. This type of detector has clinical applications (study of schizophrenia, fatigue), or applications in brain-computer-interfaces. However, the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and lack of understanding of the noise generating process make this a challenging task. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach, samples are drawn from the posterior of the parameter of interest using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Different noise covariances from Gaussian processes are tested. We show that it is possible to pick up the ERP signal in spite of the poor SNR with an appropriate choice of noise covariance structure.

Utilizing the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) in a passive oddball adaptation paradigm, we compared event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by unattended shape changes and unattended numerosity changes. We controlled visual stimulus properties in a stringent manner. Unattended changes in shape elicited significant, gradual adaptation effects in the range of early visual components, indicating the fast and automatic processing of shapes. Changes in numerosity did not elicit significant changes in these early ERP components. The lack of early numberspecific effects was qualified by a significant interaction between Shape and Number conditions. Number change elicited gradual ERP effects only on late ERP components. We conclude that numerosity is a higherlevel property assembled from naturally correlating perceptual cues and hence, it is identified later in the cognitive processing stream. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Vareka, L; Bruha, P; Moucek, R				Vareka, Lukas; Bruha, Petr; Moucek, Roman			Event-related potential datasets based on a three-stimulus paradigm	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; P300; Three-stimulus paradigm; Visual stimulation; LED		Background: The event-related potentials technique is widely used in cognitive neuroscience research. The P300 waveform has been explored in many research articles because of its wide applications, such as lie detection or brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, very few datasets are publicly available. Therefore, most researchers use only their private datasets for their analysis. This leads to minimally comparable results, particularly in brain-computer research interfaces. Here we present electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) data. The data were obtained from 20 healthy subjects and was acquired using an odd-ball hardware stimulator. The visual stimulation was based on a three-stimulus paradigm and included target, non-target and distracter stimuli. The data and collected metadata are shared in the EEG/ERP Portal. Findings: The paper also describes the process and validation results of the presented data. The data were validated using two different methods. The first method evaluated the data by measuring the percentage of artifacts. The second method tested if the expectation of the experimental results was fulfilled (i.e., if the target trials contained the P300 component). The validation proved that most datasets were suitable for subsequent analysis. Conclusions: The presented datasets together with their metadata provide researchers with an opportunity to study the P300 component from different perspectives. Furthermore, they can be used for BCI research.

As a first step towards better understanding this interpretation process, our research focuses on quantitative monitoring of interpreters' brain responses associated with geoscientific target spotting. This paper presents a method that profiles brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG) to detect P300-like responses that are associated with target spotting for complex geoscientific data. In our experiment, eight interpreters with varying levels of expertise and experience were asked to detect features, which are likely to be copper-gold rich porphyry systems within magnetic geophysical data. The target features appear in noisy background and often have incomplete shape. Magnetic images with targets and without targets were shown to participants using the "oddball" paradigm. Event related potentials were obtained by averaging the,EEG epochs across multiple trials and the results show delayed P3 response to the targets, likely due to the complexity of the task. EEG epochs were classified and the results show reliable single trial classification of EEG responses with an average accuracy of 83%. The result demonstrated the usability of the P300-like responses to quantify the geoscientific target spotting performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We review here the most recent developments in the utility of EEG in the diagnosis of ADHD, with emphasis on the most commonly used and emerging EEG metrics and their reliability in diagnostic classification. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD and the complexity of information available from the EEG signals, we suggest that considerable benefits are to be gained from multivariate analyses and a focus towards understanding of the neural generators of EEG. We conclude that while EEG cannot currently be used as a diagnostic tool, vast developments in analytical and technological tools in its domain anticipate future progress in its utility in the clinical setting.

The aim of this study is to explore the response inhibition mechanisms in the left-hand and right-hand responses by using ERP and ERSP results obtained from the EEG data of different subjects. The inhibition efficiency of the right-hand response and left-hand response appears to be independent of each other as there is no significant difference between them. From these results, the inhibition mechanisms corresponding to these two regions of the brain may be viewed as statistically independent processes. Further, we inferred that the response inhibition mechanisms for both left-hand and right-hand responses have approximately the same spectral power observation analysis and we conclude that these processes are statistically independent of each other.

ERPs are time-locked brain potentials that occur in response to cognitive, motor or perceptual events. The events used by Davis were sounds, and in the decades that followed her landmark study ERP research significantly contributed to the knowledge of auditory perception and neurophysiology we have today. ERPs are very well suited to study neural responses to sound stimuli, since the researcher can monitor the brain's registration of sound edges and spectral changes in sound on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis. In this overview we will introduce basic concepts of auditory ERP research.

Recent neuroscience studies show that lack of self-control can be attributed to lesions in the right prefrontal region of the brain, suggesting a strong linkage between self-control and neural processes. In this study, we tested neural correlates between self-control and decision making in the context of information security using electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs). Our results show that while both left and right hemispheres of the brain are involved in decision making, the subjects with low self-control evoked lower level of neural activities in the right hemisphere and made riskier decisions than the subjects with high self-control. This study validates a new paradigm for using EEG/ERP to study information security related phenomena, and opens a new path for studying decision making neural correlates using scenario based approach.

ANCs are implemented with least mean square (LMS), normalized least mean square (NLMS), recursive least square (RLS) and evolutionary algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) techniques, genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization technique. Performance of this algorithm is evaluated in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and template ERP, and mean value. Testing of their noise attenuation capability is done on EEG contaminated with white noise at different SNR levels. A comparative study of the performance of conventional gradient based methods like LMS, NLMS and RLS, and swarm intelligence based PSO, BFO, GA and ABC techniques is made which reveals that PSO technique gives better performance in average cases of noisy environment with minimum computational complexity.

Specifically, by creating a transient interference with the normal activity of a target region and measuring changes in an electrophysiological signal, we can establish a causal link between the stimulated brain area or network and the electrophysiological signal that we record. If target brain areas are functionally defined with prior fMRI scan, TMS could be used to link the fMRI activations with evoked potentials recorded. However, conducting such experiments presents significant technical challenges given the high amplitude artifacts introduced into the EEG signal by the magnetic pulse, and the difficulty to successfully target areas that were functionally defined by fMRI. Here we describe a methodology for combining these three common tools: TMS, EEG, and fMRI. We explain how to guide the stimulator's coil to the desired target area using anatomical or functional MRI data, how to record EEG during concurrent TMS, how to design an ERP study suitable for EEG-TMS combination and how to extract reliable ERP from the recorded data. We will provide representative results from a previously published study, in which fMRI-guided TMS was used concurrently with EEG to show that the face-selective N1 and the body-selective N1 component of the ERP are associated with distinct neural networks in extrastriate cortex. This method allows us to combine the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of TMS and EEG and therefore obtain a comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of various cognitive processes.

However, the concept empathy encompasses several socio-emotional and behavioral components underpinned by interacting brain circuits. This study examined empathic arousal and social understanding in individuals with ASD and matched controls by combining pressure pain thresholds (PPT) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (study 1) and electroencephalography/event-related potentials and eye-tracking responses (study 2) to empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting physical bodily injuries. Results indicate that participants with ASD had lower PPT than controls. When viewing body parts being accidentally injured, increased hemodynamic responses in the somatosensory cortex (SI/SII) but decreased responses in the anterior mid-cingulate and anterior insula as well as heightened N2 but preserved late-positive potentials (LPP) were detected in ASD participants. When viewing a person intentionally hurting another, decreased hemodynamic responses in the medial prefrontal cortex and reduced LPP were observed in the ASD group. PPT was a mediator for the SI/SII response in predicting subjective unpleasantness ratings to others' pain. Both ASD and control groups had comparable mu suppression, indicative of typical sensorimotor resonance. The findings demonstrate that, in addition to reduced pain thresholds, individuals with ASD exhibit heightened empathic arousal but impaired social understanding when perceiving others' distress.

However, the dynamics of cognitive events associated with inference making have been largely neglected. Using electroencephalography, the present study aims at describing the rapid sequence of processes involved in performing transitive inference (A B; B C therefore "A C"; with AB meaning "A is to the left of B"). The results indicate that when the second premise can be integrated into the first one (e.g. A B; (B C) under bar) its processing elicits a P3b component. In contrast, when the second premise cannot be integrated into the first premise (e.g. A B; (D C) under bar), a P600-like components is elicited. These ERP components are discussed with respect to cognitive expectations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the temporal evolution of the topography of the average Event Related Potential (ERP) and we calculate the Fisher score of the sequence by taking the gradient of the trained model parameters given the sequence. In this context, the average Event Related Potential (ERP) is described as a sequence of topographies and the Fisher score describes how this sequence deviates from the learned HMM. This alternative modeling of the ERP is used to fuse EEG information, as expressed by the temporal evolution of the topography, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We use Canonical Partial Least Squares (CPLS) for the fusion of the Fisher score with fMRI features. In order to test the effectiveness of this method, we compare the results of this methodology with the results of CPLS using the average ERP signal of a single channel. Using this methodology we are able to derive components that co-vary between EEG and fMRI and present significant differences between the two tasks. The results indicate that this descriptor effectively characterizes the temporal evolution of the ERP topography and can be used for fusing EEG and fMRI for the discrimination of the brain activity on different tasks.

This study introduces an aggregation of sparse linear discriminant analyses (ASLDA) to overcome these problems. In the ASLDA, multiple sparse discriminant vectors are learned from differently l(1)-regularized least-squares regressions by exploiting the equivalence between LDA and least-squares regression, and are subsequently aggregated to form an ensemble classifier, which could not only implement automatic feature selection for dimensionality reduction to alleviate curse-of-dimensionality, but also decrease the variance to improve generalization capacity for new test samples. Extensive investigation and comparison are carried out among the ASLDA, the ordinary LDA and other competing ERP classification algorithms, based on different three ERP datasets. Experimental results indicate that the ASLDA yields better overall performance for single-trial ERP classification when insufficient training samples are available.

To increase classification accuracy, spatial filters are used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the brain signals and thereby facilitate the detection and classification of evoked or event-related potentials. While canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has previously been used to construct spatial filters that increase classification accuracy for BCIs based on visual evoked potentials, we show in this paper, how CCA can also be used for spatial filtering of event-related potentials like P300. We also evaluate the use of CCA for spatial filtering on other data with evoked and event-related potentials and show that CCA performs consistently better than other standard spatial filtering methods.

Human EEG Uncovers Latent Generalizable Rule Structure during Learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prefrontal cortex; task-set; reinforcement learning; rules; EEG	COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; TASK; MECHANISMS; SWITCH; RESOLUTION; DYNAMICS; ERP	Human cognition is flexible and adaptive, affording the ability to detect and leverage complex structure inherent in the environment and generalize this structure to novel situations. Behavioral studies show that humans impute structure into simple learning problems, even when this tendency affords no behavioral advantage. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the neural dynamics indicative of such incidental latent structure. Event-related potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex, typically observed for instructed task rules, were stratified according to individual participants' constructed rule sets. Moreover, this individualized latent rule structure could be independently decoded from multielectrode pattern classification. Both neural markers were predictive of participants' ability to subsequently generalize rule structure to new contexts. These EEG dynamics reveal that the human brain spontaneously constructs hierarchically structured representations during learning of simple task rules.	[Collins, Anne G.

Musicianship facilitates the processing of Western music chords-An ERP and behavioral study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory processing; Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERP); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Music	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COMPLEX-SOUND; PITCH DISCRIMINATION; SPECTRAL COMPLEXITY; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EVOKED RESPONSES; ENHANCEMENT; CHILDREN; REPRESENTATION	The present study addressed the effects of musicianship on neural and behavioral discrimination of Western music chords. In abstract oddball paradigms, minor chords and inverted major chords were presented in the context of major chords to musician and non-musician participants in a passive listening task (with EEG recordings) and in an active discrimination task. Both sinusoidal sounds and harmonically rich piano sounds were used. Musicians outperformed non-musicians in the discrimination task. Change-related mismatch negativity (MMN) was evoked to minor and inverted major chords in musicians only, and N1 amplitude was larger in musicians than non-musicians. While MMN was absent in non-musicians, both groups showed decreased N1 in response to minor compared to major chords. The results indicate that processing of complex musical stimuli is enhanced in musicians both behaviorally and neurally, but that major-minor chord categorization is present to some extent also in the absence of music training.

Millions consume caffeine and simultaneously use their mobile phone (MP) during everyday activities. However, it is not known whether and how MP-emitted electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can modulate known psychoactive effects of caffeine. Here we investigated behavioral and neural correlates of caffeine and simultaneous MP exposure in a third generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) signal modulation scheme. Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERP) in an oddball paradigm to frequent standard (p = 0.8) and rare target (p = 02) stimuli in a placebo controlled, double blind, within-subject protocol in four experimental sessions: 1) no caffeine and no MP, 2) caffeine only, 3) MP only, and 4) caffeine and MP. The subjects' task was to discriminate between standard and target stimuli and respond to the latter by pressing a button while reaction time (RT) and EEG were recorded. To provide a complete analysis of any possible caffeine and/or MP treatment effects that may have occurred, we analyzed the P300 ERP wave using four different ERP measures: 1) peak latency, 2) peak amplitude, 3) 50% fractional area latency (FAL) and 4) area under the curve (AUC). Results: Caffeine significantly shortened RT and decreased AUC of the P300 component compared to the control or the UMTS MP alone conditions. However, no effects were observed on RT or P300 in the UMTS MP exposure sessions, neither alone nor in combination with caffeine. Conclusion: Overall, the present results did not demonstrate any interactive or synergistic effects of caffeine and UMTS MP like EMF exposure on basic neural or cognitive measures. However, we found that caffeine consistently enhanced behavioral and ERP measures of visual target detection, showing that present results were obtained using a pharmacologically validated, consistent and replicable methodology.

Although much research has been devoted to the P300 signal, its source within the human brain remains unclear. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is often used in ERP studies because it directly reflects neurological responses to external stimulus. However, owing to the low spatial resolution of EEG, many surface or intracranial electrodes are required to estimate the signal source. We have attempted to develop a new signal source estimation method using only one signal electrode, which utilizes the switching voltage divider technology for simultaneous measurement of the potential and location of the signal source; i. e., whether the signal source is far from or near the signal electrode. This signal source estimation method may improve the low spatial resolution of EEG. Using our proposed method, we measured the ERPs of subjects participating in an oddball paradigm using auditory stimuli. The results suggest that the P300 component of an ERP is generated in a region deep within the brain.

Methods: ERP data were recorded during a computerised facial expression task in 11 HD participants and 11 matched controls. Expression (scrambled, neutral, happy, angry, disgust) classification accuracy and intensity were assessed. Relationships between ERP indices and clinical disease characteristics were also examined. Results: Accuracy was significantly lower for HD relative to controls, due to reduced performance for neutral, angry and disgust (but not happy) faces. Intensity ratings did not differ between groups. HD participants displayed significantly reduced visual processing amplitudes extending across pre-face (P100) and face-specific (N170) processing periods, whereas subsequent emotion processing amplitudes (N250) were similar across groups. Face-specific and emotion-specific derivations of the N170 and N250 ('neutral minus scrambled' and 'each emotion minus neutral', respectively) did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the facial emotion recognition performance deficits in HD are primarily related to neural degeneration underlying 'generalised' visual processing, rather than face or emotional specific processing. Significance: ERPs are a useful tool to separate functionally discreet impairments in HD, and provide an important avenue for biomarker application that could more-selectively track disease progression.

Latency correction of event-related potentials between different experimental protocols	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		brain-computer interface; event-related potentials; transfer learning	COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; P300; COMMUNICATION	Objective. A fundamental issue in EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) studies is the amount of data required to have an accurate ERP model. This also impacts the time required to train a classifier for a brain-computer interface (BCI). This issue is mainly due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the large fluctuations of the EEG caused by several sources of variability. One of these sources is directly related to the experimental protocol or application designed, and may affect the amplitude or latency of ERPs. This usually prevents BCI classifiers from generalizing among different experimental protocols. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the amplitude and the latency variations among different experimental protocols based on the same type of ERP. Approach. We present a method to analyze and compensate for the latency variations in BCI applications. The algorithm has been tested on two widely used ERPs (P300 and observation error potentials), in three experimental protocols in each case. We report the ERP analysis and single-trial classification. Main results. The results obtained show that the designed experimental protocols significantly affect the latency of the recorded potentials but not the amplitudes. Significance. These results show how the use of latency-corrected data can be used to generalize the BCIs, reducing the calibration time when facing a new experimental protocol.

Yet the existing software packages are not optimized for the unique requirements of analyzing artifactprone ERP data from infants. We developed a new graphical user interface that enables an efficient implementation of a two-stage approach to the analysis of infant ERPs. In the first stage, video records of infant behavior are synchronized with ERPs at the level of individual trials to reject epochs with noncompliant behavior and other artifacts. In the second stage, the interface calls MATLAB and EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, Journal of Neuroscience Methods 134(1): 9-21, 2004) functions for further preprocessing of the ERP signal itself (i.e., filtering, artifact removal, interpolation, and rereferencing). Finally, methods are included for data visualization and analysis by using bootstrapped group averages. Analyses of simulated and real EEG data demonstrated that the proposed approach can be effectively used to establish task compliance, remove various types of artifacts, and perform representative visualizations and statistical comparisons of ERPs. The interface is available for download from http://www.uta.fi/med/icl/methods/eeg.html in a format that is widely applicable to ERP studies with special populations and open for further editing by users.

Response-Related Potentials during Semantic Priming: The Effect of a Speeded Button Response Task on ERPs	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REACTION-TIME; FACILITATION; RETRIEVAL; MEMORY; EEG	This study examines the influence of a button response task on the event-related potential (ERP) in a semantic priming experiment. Of particular interest is the N400 component. In many semantic priming studies, subjects are asked to respond to a stimulus as fast and accurately as possible by pressing a button. Response time (RT) is recorded in parallel with an electroencephalogram (EEG) for ERP analysis. In this case, the response occurs in the time window used for ERP analysis and response-related components may overlap with stimulus-locked ones such as the N400. This has led to a recommendation against such a design, although the issue has not been explored in depth. Since studies keep being published that disregard this issue, a more detailed examination of influence of response-related potentials on the ERP is needed. Two experiments were performed in which subjects pressed one of two buttons with their dominant hand in response to word-pairs with varying association strength (AS), indicating a personal judgement of association between the two words. In the first experiment, subjects were instructed to respond as fast and accurately as possible. In the second experiment, subjects delayed their button response to enforce a one second interval between the onset of the target word and the button response. Results show that in the first experiment a P3 component and motor-related potentials (MRPs) overlap with the N400 component, which can cause a misinterpretation of the latter. In order to study the N400 component, the button response should be delayed to avoid contamination of the ERP with response-related components.

J	Horvath, J				Horvath, Janos			Probing the sensory effects of involuntary attention change by ERPs to auditory transients	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Normal volunteers; Distraction; Hearing; Sensation/Perception; EEG/ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EFFECT SIZE; DISTRACTION; MODULATION; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; STIMULI; NOVELTY	An auditory selective attention set allows one to enhance the processing of goal-relevant sound events, which is reflected by the enhancement of the N1 event-related potential (ERP). The present study investigated whether the sensory consequences of distraction (i.e., involuntary attention changes triggered by infrequent sensory events) can be revealed as the removal of this attentional ERP enhancement. Continuous tones featuring occasional gaps were presented, and participants performed a gap-detection task. Independently from gaps, abrupt pitch changes (glides) were introduced, either rarely or frequently, in separate conditions. Whereas rare glides preceding gaps by 150 ms strongly impacted gap-detection performance and gap-related N1 amplitudes, their impact on gaps following rare glides by 650 ms was significantly smaller in both measures. This result demonstrates the utility of N1 in probing the sensory impact of auditory distraction.

Adults with (n = 21) and without (n = 20) ASD performed a lexical decision task on emotion and neutral words while their brain activity was recorded. Both groups showed faster responses to emotion words compared to neutral, suggesting intact early processing of emotion in ASD. In the ERPs, the control group showed a typical late positive component (LPC) at 400-600 ms for emotion words compared to neutral, while the ASD group showed no LPC. The between-group difference in LPC amplitude was significant, suggesting that emotion words were processed differently by individuals with ASD, although their behavioral performance was similar to that of typical individuals.

We aimed to measure the effects of mindfulness based cognitive-behavioral therapy (MBCT) in BD on emotional processing, as measured by event related potentials (ERP) and by heart rate variability (HRV). ERP and HRV were recorded during the completion of a visual matching task, which included object matching, affect matching, and affect labeling. Individuals with BD (n = 12) were compared with controls (n = 9) to obtain baseline data prior to the individuals with BD undergoing an 8-week MBCT intervention. ERP and HRV recording was repeated after the MBCT intervention in BD. Participants with BD had exaggerated ERP N170 amplitude and increased HRV HF peak compared to controls, particularly during the affect matching condition. After an 8-week MBCT intervention, participants with BD showed attenuation of ERP N170 amplitude and reduced HRV HF peak. Our findings support findings from the literature emphasizing that emotional processing in BD is altered, and suggesting that MBCT may improve emotional processing in BD.

In an effort to make ERP components more specific to distinct underlying neural substrates, recorded EEG signals were firstly dissolved into multiple independent components (ICs) using independent component analysis (ICA). Thereafter, individual ICs with prominent sensory- or cognitive-related ERP components were selected to separately reconstruct scalp EEG signals at representative channels, from which ERP waveforms were built, respectively. Statistical comparisons on amplitudes of stimulus-locked ERP components, i.e., prefrontal P2 and N2, parietal P3, bilateral occipital P1 and N1, revealed significant reduced P3 amplitude in error trials than in correct trials. In addition, significant evident ERN was also observed in error trials but not in correct trials. Considering the temporal locus of semantic conflict in the present task, we concluded that reduced P3 amplitude in error trials reflect impaired resolving process of semantic conflict, which further lead to a performance error in the Stroop color-word matching task.

Sitt et al. assess the suitability of putative electrophysiological markers of consciousness for distinguishing patients in a vegetative state from those in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Low-frequency power, EEG complexity, and information exchange constitute reliable, partially independent, markers of consciousness.In recent years, numerous electrophysiological signatures of consciousness have been proposed. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of these electroencephalography markers by quantifying their efficiency in differentiating patients in a vegetative state from those in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Capitalizing on a review of previous experiments and current theories, we identify a series of measures that can be organized into four dimensions: (i) event-related potentials versus ongoing electroencephalography activity; (ii) local dynamics versus inter-electrode information exchange; (iii) spectral patterns versus information complexity; and (iv) average versus fluctuations over the recording session. We analysed a large set of 181 high-density electroencephalography recordings acquired in a 30 minutes protocol. We show that low-frequency power, electroencephalography complexity, and information exchange constitute the most reliable signatures of the conscious state. When combined, these measures synergize to allow an automatic classification of patients' state of consciousness.

EEG signatures of arm isometric exertions in preparation, planning and execution	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related (de-)synchronisation (ERD/ERS); Event-related potentials (ERP); Isometric force; Planning; Execution; EEG	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; FORCE; DIRECTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION	The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity patterns in humans during motor behaviour provide insight into normal motor control processes and for diagnostic and rehabilitation applications. While the patterns preceding brisk voluntary movements, and especially movement execution, are well described, there are few EEG studies that address the cortical activation patterns seen in isometric exertions and their planning. In this paper, we report on time and time-frequency EEG signatures in experiments in normal subjects (n = 8), using multichannel EEG during motor preparation, planning and execution of directional centre-out arm isometric exertions performed at the wrist in the horizontal plane, in response to instruction-delay visual cues. Our observations suggest that isometric force exertions are accompanied by transient and sustained event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related (de-)synchronisations (ERD/ERS), comparable to those of a movement task. Furthermore, the ERPs and ERD/ERS are also observed during preparation and planning of the isometric task. Comparison of earlobe-referenced and surface Laplacian ERPs indicates the contribution of superficial sources in supplementary and pre-motor (FCz), parietal (CPz) and primary motor cortical areas (C-1 and FC1) to ERPs (primarily negative peaks in frontal and positive peaks in parietal areas), but contribution of deep sources to sustained time-domain potentials (negativity in planning and positivity in execution). Transient and sustained ERD patterns in mu and beta frequency bands of ear-lobe-referenced and surface Laplacian EEG indicate the contribution of both superficial and deep sources to ERD/ERS. As no physical displacement happens during the task, we can infer that the underlying mechanisms of motor-related ERPs and ERD/ERS patterns do not only depend on change in limb coordinate or muscle-length-dependent ascending sensory information and are primary generated by motor preparation, direction-dependent planning and execution of isometric motor tasks. The results contribute to our understanding of the functions of different brain regions during voluntary motor tasks and their activity signatures in EEG can shed light on the relationships between large-scale recordings such as EEG and other recordings such as single unit activity and fMRI in this context.

Juvenile exposure to ketamine causes delayed emergence of EEG abnormalities during adulthood in mice	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						NMDA; Gamma; Oscillations; Schizophrenia; Theta; Drug-abuse	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; POSSIBLE ANIMAL-MODEL; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; APOPTOTIC NEURODEGENERATION; RAT BEHAVIOR; CELL-DEATH; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; MEMORY	Background: Increased susceptibility to cognitive impairment or psychosis in adulthood is associated with adolescent drug abuse. Studies in adults have identified impairments in attention and memory, and changes in EEG, as common consequences of ketamine abuse. In contrast, the effects of ketamine on the juvenile brain have not been extensively tested. This is a significant omission, since abuse of ketamine is often observed within this age group. Objectives: Juvenile mice (4-6 weeks of age) were administered ketamine (20 mg/kg) for 14 days. EEG was assessed in response to auditory stimulation both at one week following ketamine exposure at 7 weeks of age (juvenile) and again at 12 weeks of age (adult). EEG was analyzed for baseline activity, event-related power and event-related potentials (ERPs). Results: While no effects of ketamine exposure were observed during the juvenile period, significant reductions in amplitude of the P20 ERP component and event-related gamma power were seen following ketamine when re-tested as adults. In contrast, reductions in event-related theta were seen in ketamine-exposed mice at both time points. Conclusions: Age related deficits in electrophysiological components such as P20 or event-related gamma may be due to an interruption of normal neural maturation. Reduction of NMDAR signaling during adolescence leads to delayed-onset disruption of gamma oscillations and the P20 component of the ERP. Further, delayed onset of impairment following adolescent ketamine abuse suggests that methods could be developed to detect and treat the early effects of drug exposure prior to the onset of disability.

Predicting the clinical outcome of stimulant medication in pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: data from quantitative electroencephalography, event-related potentials, and a go/no-go test	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						ADHD; stimulants; predictions; clinical outcome; QEEG; ERP; go/no-go test	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXCESS-BETA ACTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; RELEASE METHYLPHENIDATE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CHILDREN; ADHD; RELIABILITY; ADULTS	Background: We searched for predictors of the clinical outcome of stimulant medication in pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emphasizing variables from quantitative electroencephalography, event-related potentials (ERPs), and behavioral data from a visual go/no-go test. Methods: Nineteen-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the resting state in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions and during performance of the cued go/no-go task in 98 medication-naive ADHD patients aged 7-17 years and in 90 controls with the same age and sex distribution as the patients. For patients, the recording was followed by a systematic trial on stimulant medication lasting at least 4 weeks. Based on data from rating scales and interviews, two psychologists who were blind to the electrophysiological results independently rated the patients as responders (REs) (N= 74) or non-responders (non-REs) (N= 24). Using a logistic regression model, comparisons were made between REs and non-REs on the EEG spectra, ERPs (cue P3, contingent negative variation, and P3 no-go of the ERP waves and independent components [ICs] extracted from these waves), reaction time, reaction time variability, number of commission and omission errors, intelligence quotient, age, sex, ADHD subtype, and comorbidities. Results: The two groups differed significantly on eight of the variables, with effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from 0.49 to 0.76. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only three of these variables were significantly associated with clinical outcome. The amplitude of the IC cue P3, which has a parietal-occipital distribution, was normal in REs but significantly smaller in non-REs, whereas the centrally distributed IC P3 no-go early was smaller in REs than in non-REs and controls. In addition, the REs had more power in the EEG theta band. A quartile-based index was calculated using these three variables. The group with the lowest scores comprised only 36% REs; response rates in the three other groups were 83%, 86%, and 89%. Conclusion: The clinical outcome of stimulant medication was best predicted by electrophysiological parameters. The brain dysfunctions of the REs appear to be primarily associated with prefrontal lobe hypoactivation. The non-REs were deviant from the controls in parietal-occipital functions.

Since the majority of human population falls precisely into the aforementioned intermediate category, it is important to study it more extensively. DESIGN: In this work we examined the influence of the individual personality characteristic ambiversion on sensorimotor and cognitive information processing by studying the auditory Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) of healthy volunteers in auditory mental and sensorimotor discrimination task conditions. The volunteers completed Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and were divided into introverts, ambiverts and extraverts. We compared the N1 and P3 amplitudes and latencies of ERP components between introvert, ambivert and extravert subgroups. For sensorimotor task series we calculated two response time parameters: the onset of response movement activity and the moment of maximal push force power. Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The ambivert N1 amplitude was enhanced compared to the same ERP components of the extravert and the introvert subgroups. Our results revealed increase of P3 amplitudes for extravert subgroup in all passive, sensorimotor and mental task conditions. The ambivert showed higher P3 amplitude in comparison with introverts and extraverts predominantly in mental task series. Our data revealed activation differences in sensory and cognitive information processing related to extraversion and the ERP analysis confirmed that the personality characteristic ambiversion influences the N1 and P3 amplitudes of ERP components. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that ambiversion has its EEG reflection in the auditory ERP components and supports that ambiversion must not be neglected and should be researched further as independent personality characteristic compared to the relevant extremes.

P300-speller has a 6x6 character matrix and requires at least 12 flashes to input one character. This restricts increasing of the information transfer rate (ITR) by decreasing the number of flashes. In this paper, a novel spelling system is proposed to reduce the number of flashes by sequential stimulation of images. In order to determine the command, the proposed system utilizes two kinds of the event-related brain potentials (ERP), N100 and P300 whereas P300-speller utilizes only P300. Thanks to using both N100 and P300, the proposed system achieves higher accuracy and faster spelling speed than P300-speller. Our experiment by ten subjects showed that ITR of the proposed system is an average of 0.25bit/sec improved compared to P300-speller.

J	Miller, S; Zhang, Y				Miller, Sharon; Zhang, Yang			Validation of the cochlear implant artifact correction tool for auditory electrophysiology	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related potential (ERP); Independent component analysis (ICA); Cochlear implant artifact correction (CIAC)	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPEECH; ATTENUATION; PLASTICITY; DYNAMICS; USERS	Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) collected from cochlear implant (CI) users are often contaminated by large electrical device-related artifacts. Using independent component analysis (ICA), the artifacts can be manually identified and removed, and the ERP responses can be reconstructed from the remaining components. Viola et al. [17] recently developed an efficient algorithm that uses spatial and temporal statistics of the components to automate CI artifact removal. The purpose of this study was to perform an independent validation of the algorithm. We further assessed whether the ERP responses were stable over the course of one year when analyzed manually or using the semi-automated approach. To achieve these aims, we collected EEG data from 6 adult CI users at two sessions, with one year between each session. We compared their ERP responses reconstructed using the algorithm and the manual approach. We found no significant differences when comparing the two approaches to removing CI artifact across sessions, validating the use of the semi-automated method. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Emotion processing in words: a test of the neural re-use hypothesis using surface and intracranial EEG	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reading; emotion; disgust; ERP; word recognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; ERP ANALYSIS; DISGUST; BRAIN; TASK; INSULA; RECOGNITION; ADJECTIVES	This study investigates the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional information processing during reading using a combination of surface and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Two different theoretical views were opposed. According to the standard psycholinguistic perspective, emotional responses to words are generated within the reading network itself subsequent to semantic activation. According to the neural re-use perspective, brain regions that are involved in processing emotional information contained in other stimuli (faces, pictures, smells) might be in charge of the processing of emotional information in words as well. We focused on a specific emotion-disgust-which has a clear locus in the brain, the anterior insula. Surface EEG showed differences between disgust and neutral words as early as 200 ms. Source localization suggested a cortical generator of the emotion effect in the left anterior insula. These findings were corroborated through the intracranial recordings of two epileptic patients with depth electrodes in insular and orbitofrontal areas. Both electrodes showed effects of disgust in reading as early as 200 ms. The early emotion effect in a brain region (insula) that responds to specific emotions in a variety of situations and stimuli clearly challenges classic sequential theories of reading in favor of the neural re-use perspective.

Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used-i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.

Auditory event-related potentials and alpha oscillations in the psychosis prodrome: Neuronal generator patterns during a novelty oddball task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-Related Potentials (ERP); Current Source Density (CSD); Principal Components Analysis (PCA); Novelty oddball; Mismatch Negativity (MMN); Time-frequency analysis; Alpha ERD; Clinical High-Risk (CHR)	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; SOURCE DENSITY CSD; WORD RECOGNITION MEMORY; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; P300 AMPLITUDE; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; NEURAL SYNCHRONY	Prior research suggests that event-related potentials (ERP) obtained during active and passive auditory paradigms, which have demonstrated abnormal neurocognitive function in schizophrenia, may provide helpful tools in predicting transition to psychosis. In addition to ERP measures, reduced modulations of EEG alpha, reflecting top-down control required to inhibit irrelevant information, have revealed attentional deficits in schizophrenia and its prodromal stage. Employing a three-stimulus novelty oddball task, nose-referenced 48-channel ERPs were recorded from 22 clinical high-risk (CHR) patients and 20 healthy controls detecting target tones (12% probability, 500 Hz; button press) among nontargets (76%, 350 Hz) and novel sounds (12%). After current source density (CSD) transformation of EEG epochs (-200 to 1000 ms), event-related spectral perturbations were obtained for each site up to 30 Hz and 800 ms after stimulus onset, and simplified by unrestricted time-frequency (TF) principal components analysis (PCA). Alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) as measured by TF factor 610-9 (spectral peak latency at 610 ms and 9 Hz; 31.9% variance) was prominent over right posterior regions for targets, and markedly reduced in CHR patients compared to controls, particularly in three patients who later developed psychosis. In contrast, low-frequency event-related synchronization (ERS) distinctly linked to novels (260-1; 16.0%; mid-frontal) and N1 sink across conditions (130-1; 3A%; centro-temporoparietal) did not differ between groups. Analogous time-domain CSD-ERP measures (temporal PCA), consisting of N1 sink, novelty mismatch negativity (MMN), novelty vertex source, novelty P3, P3b, and frontal response negativity, were robust and closely comparable between groups. Novelty MMN at FCz was, however, absent in the three converters. In agreement with prior findings, alpha ERD and MMN may hold particular promise for predicting transition to psychosis among CHR patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, color-naming latency on threat-related words will be expected in athletes of combat sports on the Stroop task compared to athletes of non-combat sports; in other words, it is expected that there will be increased interference effect of threat-relevant stimuli on the Stroop task. In this context, participants will be shown neutral and threat-relevant stimuli randomly, and it will be investigated that whether the P300 wave of EEG show differences in response to threat-related words. After EEG data analysis, which were collected from four participants, it is found that ERP responses within the 280-400 ms time window, the amplitude of the total area of threat-related words is larger than neutral words for the group who are active in combat sports.

Previous work on ASTM showed that the amplitude of the SAN increased in negativity as the number of maintained items increases. The aim of the current study was to measure the SAN and observe its behavior beyond the point of saturation of auditory short-term memory. We used atonal pure tones in sequences of 2, 4, 6, or 8 t. Our results showed that the amplitude of SAN increased in negativity from 2 to 4 items and then levelled off from 4 to 8 items. Behavioral results suggested that the average span in the task was slightly below 3, which was consistent with the observed plateau in the electrophysiological results. Furthermore, the amplitude of the SAN predicted individual differences in auditory memory capacity. The results support the hypothesis that the SAN is an electrophysiological index of brain activity specifically related to the maintenance of auditory information in ASTM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

PIT effects may play an important role in substance use disorders, but little is known about the brain mechanisms that underlie these effects in alcohol consumers. We report behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data from a group of social drinkers (n = 31) who performed a PIT task in which they chose between two instrumental responses in pursuit of beer and chocolate reinforcers while their EEG reactivity to beer, chocolate and neutral pictorial cues was recorded. We examined two markers of the motivational salience of the pictures: the P300 and slow wave event-related potentials (ERPs). Results demonstrated a behavioral PIT effect: responding for beer was increased when a beer picture was presented. Analyses of ERP amplitudes demonstrated significantly larger slow potentials evoked by beer cues at various electrode clusters. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant correlations between behavioral PIT effects, electrophysiological reactivity to the cues, and individual differences in drinking behaviour. Our findings are the first to demonstrate a PIT effect for beer, accompanied by increased slow potentials in response to beer cues, in social drinkers. The lack of relationship between behavioral and EEG measures, and between these measures and individual differences in drinking behaviour may be attributed to methodological features of the PIT task and to characteristics of our sample.

We posit that EEG techniques can be extremely useful for a direct measurement of brain electrophysiological activity related to human consciousness for their unsurpassable high temporal resolution (milliseconds). This activity can be expressed in terms of event-related potentials as well as changes of EEG rhythms of interest, for example the dominant alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz). The results of our studies, and those of several independent groups, lead support to the hypothesis that these techniques provide important insights about the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization and the regulation of neuromodulatory systems (e.g. dopaminergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic, etc.) at the basis of brain arousal and consciousness in healthy subjects and in patients with impairment of the consciousness. A possible interaction of these mechanisms and the drugs administered to patients with consciousness disorders is discussed.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Independent component analysis; Linear transform model; Mapping coefficient	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN RESPONSES; EEG; DECOMPOSITION; PROJECTION; MUSIC	Background: It is well-known that data of event-related potentials (ERPs) conform to the linear transform model (LTM). For group-level ERP data processing using principal/independent component analysis (PCA/ICA), ERP data of different experimental conditions and different participants are often concatenated. It is theoretically assumed that different experimental conditions and different participants possess the same LTM. However, how to validate the assumption has been seldom reported in terms of signal processing methods. New method: When ICA decomposition is globally optimized for ERP data of one stimulus, we gain the ratio between two coefficients mapping a source in brain to two points along the scalp. Based on such a ratio, we defined a relative mapping coefficient (RMC). If RMCs between two conditions for an ERP are not significantly different in practice, mapping coefficients of this ERP between the two conditions are statistically identical. Results: We examined whether the same LTM of ERP data could be applied for two different stimulus types of fearful and happy facial expressions. They were used in an ignore oddball paradigm in adult human participants. We found no significant difference in LTMs (based on ICASSO) of N170 responses to the fearful and the happy faces in terms of RMCs of N170. Comparison with existing method(s): We found no methods for straightforward comparison. Conclusions: The proposed RMC in light of ICA decomposition is an effective approach for validating the similarity of LTMs of ERPs between experimental conditions. This is very fundamental to apply group-level PCA/ICA to process ERP data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have pointed to the after-effects of tDCS on both motor and cognitive performance, and there appears to be potential for using tDCS in a variety of clinical applications. However, little is known about the real-time effects of tDCS on rhythmic cortical activity in humans due to the technical challenges of simultaneously obtaining electrophysiological data during ongoing stimulation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of tDCS in humans are not well understood. We have conducted a simultaneous tDCS-EEG study in a group of healthy human subjects. Significant acute and persistent changes in spontaneous neural activity and event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during and after the application of high-definition tDCS over the left sensorimotor cortex. Both anodal and cathodal stimulation resulted in acute global changes in broadband cortical activity which were significantly different than the changes observed in response to sham stimulation. For the group of eight subjects studied, broadband individual changes in spontaneous activity during stimulation were apparent both locally and globally. In addition, we found that high-definition tDCS of the left sensorimotor cortex can induce significant ipsilateral and contralateral changes in event-related desynchronization and ERS during motor imagination following the end of the stimulation period. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high-resolution EEG during high-definition tDCS and provide evidence that tDCS in humans directly modulates rhythmic cortical synchronization during and after its administration.

EEG study on affective valence elicited by novel and familiar pictures using ERD/ERS and SVM-RFE	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Affective valence; EEG; ERD/ERS; Habituation; SVM-RFE	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; HABITUATION; EMOTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPETITION; AROUSAL; REFLEX; THETA	EEG signals have been widely explored in emotional processing analyses, both in time and frequency domains. However, in such studies, habituation phenomenon is barely considered in the discrimination of different emotional responses. In this work, spectral features of the event-related potentials (ERPs) are studied by means of event-related desynchronization/synchronization computation. In order to determine the most relevant ERP features for distinguishing how positive and negative affective valences are processed within the brain, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination is employed. The proposed approach was applied for investigating in which way the familiarity of stimuli affects the affective valence processing as well as which frequency bands and scalp regions are more involved in this process. In a group composed of young adult women, results prove that parietooccipital region and theta band are especially involved in the processing of novelty in emotional stimuli. Furthermore, the proposed method has shown to perform successfully using a moderated number of trials.	[Hidalgo-Munoz, A.

The neural mechanism of this phenomenon may help to clarify the determinants of decision-making. In this study, thirty-nine young adults finished a risky gambling task by choosing between a high- and a low-risk option in each trial during electroencephalographic data collection. We found that risk-taking strategies significantly modulated mean amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) component P3, particularly at the central scalp. The event-related spectral perturbation and the inter-trial coherence measurements of the independent component analysis (ICA) data indicated that the "stay" vs. "switch" electrophysiological difference associated with subsequent decision-making was mainly due to fronto-central theta and left/right mu independent components. Event-related cross-coherence results suggested that the neural information of action monitoring and updating emerged in the fronto-central cortex and propagated to sensorimotor area for further behavior adjustment. Based on these findings of ERP and event-related oscillation (ERO) measures, we propose a neural model of the influence of current outcomes on future decisions.

However, strong individual differences make it challenging to develop a generic single-trial ERP classifier that performs well for all subjects. Usually some subject-specific training samples need to be collected in an initial calibration session to customize the classifier. However, if implemented into an actual BCI system, then this calibration process would decrease the utility of the system, potentially decreasing its usability. In this paper we propose a Transfer Learning approach for reducing the amount of subject-specific data in online single-trial ERP classifier calibration, and an Active Transfer Learning approach for offline calibration. By applying these approaches to data from a Visually-Evoked Potential EEG experiment, we demonstrate that they improve the classification performance, given the same number of labeled subject-specific training samples. In other words, these approaches can also attain a desired level of classification accuracy with less labeling effort when compared to a randomly selected training set.

Here, we examined the impact of breathlessness on emotional picture processing. The continuous EEG was recorded while volunteers viewed positive/neutral/negative emotional pictures under conditions of resistive-load-induced breathlessness, auditory noise, and an unloaded baseline. Breathlessness attenuated P1 and early posterior negativity (EPN) ERP amplitudes, irrespective of picture valence. Moreover, as expected, larger amplitudes for positive and negative pictures relative to neutral pictures were found for EPN and the late positive potential (LPP) ERPs, which were not affected by breathlessness. The results suggest that breathlessness impacts on the early attention-related neural processing of picture stimuli without influencing the later cognitive processing of emotional contents.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the acute effects of tDCS on cortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with an affective disorder. Eighteen patients diagnosed with an affective disorder and experiencing a depressive episode participated in a sham-controlled study of tDCS, each receiving a session of active (2 mA for 20 minutes) and sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The effects of tDCS on EEG activity were assessed after each session using event-related potentials (ERP) and measurement of spectral activity during a visual working memory (VWM) task. We observed task and intervention dependent effects on both ERPs and task-related alpha and theta activity, where active compared to sham stimulation resulted in a significant reduction in the N2 amplitude and reduced theta activity over frontal areas during memory retrieval. In summary a single session of anodal tDCS stimulation to the left DLPFC during a major depressive episode resulted in modulated brain activity evident in task-related EEG. Effects on the N2 and frontal theta activity likely reflect modulated activity in the medial frontal cortex and hence indicate that the after-effects of tDCS extend beyond the direct focal effects to the left DLPFC.

PSPs and ERPs: Applying the dynamics of post-synaptic potentials to individual units in simulation of temporally extended Event-Related Potential reading data	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Parallel distributed processing; ERPs; N400; Visual word recognition; Repetition effects; Post-synaptic potentials; Neural computation	WORD RECOGNITION; REPETITION; MODEL; REPRESENTATIONS; COMPONENT; N400; EEG	The Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) framework is built on neural-style computation, and is thus well-suited for simulating the neural implementation of cognition. However, relatively little cognitive modeling work has concerned neural measures, instead focusing on behavior. Here, we extend a PDP model of reading-related components in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) to simulation of the N400 repetition effect. We accomplish this by incorporating the dynamics of cortical post-synaptic potentials the source of the ERP signal into the model. Simulations demonstrate that application of these dynamics is critical for model elicitation of repetition effects in the time and frequency domains. We conclude that by advancing a neurocomputational understanding of repetition effects, we are able to posit an interpretation of their source that is both explicitly specified and mechanistically different from the well-accepted cognitive one.

The amplitude of the potentials is in the range of single microvolts. Unfortunately, the precision of such potential measures is low, because of existing "body" noises. Additionally, other brain activities and even human emotion variations can distort the result. Therefore, further researches of electrical properties must be continued. Today's measurement methods of olfactory evoked potentials need several repetition cycles to obtain average values of the necessary potential. Because it is necessary to take into account olfactory weariness (attenuation), a repetition frequency is low and as a consequence, a patient survey is long (usually 20 - 30 min. using existing equipment).

Although the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) has been widely explored, the importance of induced components and the precise oscillations of EEG signal have been ignored. In the present study, we conducted the event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) of the EEG oscillatory activities relevant to the color change detection mechanisms under unintentional condition. The results showed that the deviant stimuli elicited larger ERS than standards in the delta band. The ERD responses were bigger to deviant stimuli than that to standards in the beta band. These data provided new evidence to unintentional automatic visual change detection.

Here, we propose an integrated learning and inference approach that takes advantage of a commercial high-density EEG cap, to estimate the BCG contribution in noisy EEG recordings from inside the MR scanner. To estimate reliably the full-scalp BCG artifacts, a near-optimal subset (20 out of 256) of channels first was identified using a modified recording setup. In subsequent recordings inside the MR scanner, BCG-only signal from this subset of channels was used to generate continuous estimates of the full-scalp BCG artifacts via inference, from which the intended EEG signal was recovered. The reconstruction of the EEG was performed with both a direct subtraction and an optimization scheme. We evaluated the performance on both synthetic and real contaminated recordings, and compared it to the benchmark Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method. In the challenging non-event-related-potential (non-ERP) EEG studies, our reconstruction can yield more than fourteen-fold improvement in reducing the normalized RMS error of EEG signals, compared to OBS.

Many evidences suggest that abnormalities in the event-related brain potentials (ERPs), resting state electroencephalography (EEG) and synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons may reflect core pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Abnormalities in amplitude and latency of the ERPs reflecting aberrations in gating and difficulties in the detection of changes in auditory stimuli, as well as defects in stimuli evaluation and integration of information are common in patients with schizophrenia. This chapter highlights the findings of electrophysiological studies in schizophrenia dealing with early sensory perception and attention, automatic sensory detection of stimuli changes and cognitive evaluation and integration of information, relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning hallucinations and delusions. Results of electrophysiological studies investigating the neural correlates of positive symptoms suggest aberrant intrinsic organization of functional brain networks.

Nineteen healthy volunteers received transdermal placebo and buprenorphine in a cross-over study. Drug plasma concentrations and ERPs after electrical stimulation at the median nerve with intensity adjusted to pain detection threshold were recorded until 144hrs after administration. Placebo and concentration-effect models were fitted to data using non-linear mixed-effects modelling implemented in NONMEM (V7.2.0.). Pharmacodynamic models were developed to adequately describe both placebo and buprenorphine ERP data. Models predicted significant placebo effects, but did not predict significant effects related to buprenorphine concentration. Models revealed that ERPs varied both between subjects and between study occasions. ERPs were found to be reproducible within subjects and occasions as population variance was found to be eight times higher than the unexplained variances. Between-subject variance accounted for more than 75% of the population variance. In conclusion, pharmacodynamic modelling was successfully implemented to allow for placebo and variability correction in ERP of experimental pain. Improved outcome of ERP studies can be expected if variation between subjects and study occasions can be identified and described.

This signal was further analyzed using the logistic regression method to investigate children's working memory ability. This study involved 54 children aged 10 to 12 years old who were given computer-based visual stimuli while their working memory activities were simultaneously recorded using the Neurofax 9200 EEG acquisition machine. Redundant noises and artifacts were removed using wavelet algorithm and ICA techniques. The EEG signals were segmented to obtain the average mean of single-trial ERP and necessary input for the logistic regression classifier. Results indicated that the resultant parameters as well as biological data were significant in predicting whether a child had working impairment or not. Moreover, the signal's sensitivity value was more than the specificity value. In conclusion, our results indicated the working memory impairment in children tends to worsen with age.

However, recent approaches have conceptualized this frontocentral ERP component as reflecting at least partially a reward positivity associated with activation in reward-related brain regions, in line with fMRI studies investigating feedback processing in the context of reward evaluation. To discover convergence of electrophysiological and BOLD responses elicited by performance feedback, we concurrently recorded EEG and fMRI during a time-estimation task. The ERP showed relatively more negative amplitudes to negative than to positive feedback. Conventional analyses of fMRI data revealed activation of a number of areas, including ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex to positive versus negative feedback. Most importantly, when using single-trial amplitudes of electrophysiological feedback signals to estimate hemodynamic responses, we found feedback-related BOLD-responses in ventral striatum, midcingulate, and midfrontal cortices to positive but not to negative feedback associated with feedback signals in the time range of the FRN. Specifically, activation in these areas increased as amplitudes became more positive. These findings suggest that, in the time-estimation task, a positivity elicited by reward is associated with brain activation in several reward-related brain regions and is driving differential ERP responses in the time range of the FRN.

Intensive research efforts for specific and sensitive biological markers, or biomarkers, for psychopathology as objective alternatives to the current paradigm are ongoing. While biomarker research in psychiatry has focused largely on functional neuroimaging methods for identifying the neural functions that associate with psychopathology, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been viewed, historically, as offering little specific brain source information, as scalp appearance is only loosely correlated to its brain source dynamics. However, ongoing advances in signal processing of EEG data can now deliver functional EEG brain-imaging with distinctly improved spatial, as well as fine temporal, resolution. One computational approach proving particularly useful for EEG cortical brain imaging is independent component analysis (ICA). ICA decomposition can be used to identify distinct cortical source activities that are sensitive and specific to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Given its practical research advantages, relatively low cost, and ease of use, EEG-imaging is now both feasible and attractive, in particular for studies involving the large samples required by genetically informative designs to characterize causal pathways to psychopathology. The completely non-invasive nature of EEG data acquisition, coupled with ongoing advances in dry, wireless, and wearable EEG technology, makes EEG-imaging increasingly attractive and appropriate for psychiatric research, including the study of developmentally young samples. Applied to large genetically and developmentally informative samples, EEG imaging can advance the search for robust diagnostic biomarkers and phenotypes in psychiatry.

In this study we combined EEG and fMRI to investigate the structures involved in the processing of different sound pressure levels (SPLs). Methods: EEG data were recorded simultaneously with fMRI from 16 healthy volunteers using MR compatible devices at 3 T. Tones with different SPLs were delivered to the volunteers and the N1/P2 amplitudes were included as covariates in the fMRI data analysis in order to compare the structures activated with high and low SPLs. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ROI analysis were also performed. Additionally, source localisation analysis was performed on the EEG data. Results: The integration of averaged ERP parameters into the fMRI analysis showed an extended map of areas exhibiting covariation with the BOLD signal related to the auditory stimuli. The ANOVA and ROI analyses also revealed additional brain areas other than the primary auditory cortex (PAC) which were active with the auditory stimulation at different SPLs. The source localisation analyses showed additional sources apart from the PAC which were active with the high SPLs. Discussion: The PAC and the insula play an important role in the processing of different SPLs. In the fMRI analysis, additional activation was found in the anterior cingulate cortex, opercular and orbito-frontal cortices with high SPLs. A strong response of the visual cortex was also found with the high SPLs, suggesting the presence of cross-modal effects.	[Neuner, Irene; Arrubla, Jorge; Warbrick, Tracy; Boers, Frank; Shah, N.

Additionally, P3 amplitude and latency is altered in neurological diseases and can be pharmacologically modulated. As P3-like ERPs can be recorded in rodents, it may serve as a potential translational biomarker of value for drug discovery. Here we investigated whether a positive allosteric modulator of alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, NS9283, and the psychostimulant modafinil could modulate P3-like ERPs in healthy adult rats performing an auditory oddball discrimination task. ERPs were recorded with electroencephalography electrodes implanted into mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and auditory cortex (AC). P3-like ERPs were detected in all brain regions, displaying larger amplitudes in target trials compared to non-target trials. Administration of modafinil (64 mg/kg) decreased P3-like ERP latency in MD thalamus and AC, whereas NS9283 augmented P3-like ERP amplitude in MD thalamus at 0.3 mg/kg and in AC at 3.0 mg/kg. Additionally, N1 pre-attention peak amplitude in MD thalamus was increased with 03 mg/kg NS9283. Neither of the compounds enhanced task performance. Rather, modafinil lowered correct rejections in non-target trials. In summary, our findings reveal pharmacological modulation of the rat P3-like ERP in cortical and subcortical regions by modafinil and NS9283. These findings encourage further exploration of the rat P3-like ERP in order to promote the understanding of its meaning within cognition, as well as its applicability as a translatable biomarker in drug development.

P300 waveform and dopamine transporter availability: a controlled EEG and SPECT study in medication-naive patients with schizophrenia and a meta-analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Dopamine transporter; ERP; medication-naive schizophrenia; meta-analysis; P300 waveform; single photon emission computerized tomography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY P300; DRUG-NAIVE; LATENCY PROLONGATION; HIGH-RISK; ABNORMAL P300; AGE; REDUCTION; PSYCHOSIS; AMPLITUDE	Background. Reduced P300 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and latency prolongation have been reported in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. However, the influence of antipsychotics (and dopamine) on ERP measures are poorly understood and medication confounding remains a possibility. Method. We explored ERP differences between 36 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 138 healthy controls and examined whether P300 performance was related to dopamine transporter (DAT) availability, both without the confounding effects of medication. We also conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the available literature, synthesizing the results of three comparable published articles and our local study. Results. No overall significant difference was found in mean P300 ERP between patients and controls in latency or in amplitude. There was a significant gender effect, with females showing greater P300 amplitude than males. A difference between patients and controls in P300 latency was evident with ageing, with latency increasing faster in patients. No effect of DAT availability on P300 latency or amplitude was detected. The meta-analysis computed the latency pooled standardized effect size (PSES; Cohen's d) of -0.13 and the amplitude PSES (Cohen's d) of 0.48, with patients showing a significant reduction in amplitude. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the P300 ERP is not altered in the early stages of schizophrenia before medication is introduced, and the DAT availability does not influence the P300 ERP amplitude or latency. P300 ERP amplitude reduction could be an indicator of the progression of illness and chronicity.	[Chen, K. C.; Lee, I. H.; Yang, Y. K.; Chang, W. H.; Chen, P. S.; Lu, R.

However, this method usually suffers from poor EEG quality, especially for evoked potentials (ERPs), due to specific artifacts. As such, the use of EEG-informed fMRI analysis in the context of cognitive studies has particularly focused on optimizing narrow ERP time windows of interest, which ignores the rich diverse temporal information of the EEG signal. Here, we propose to use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to investigate the neural cascade occurring during face recognition in 14 healthy volunteers by using the successive ERP peaks recorded during the cognitive part of this process. N170, N400 and P600 peaks, commonly associated with face recognition, were successfully and reproducibly identified for each trial and each subject by using a group independent component analysis (ICA). For the first time we use this group ICA to extract several independent components (IC) corresponding to the sequence of activation and used single-trial peaks as modulation parameters in a general linear model (GLM) of fMRI data. We obtained an occipital-temporal-frontal stream of BOLD signal modulation, in accordance with the three successive IC-ERPs providing an unprecedented spatio-temporal characterization of the whole cognitive process as defined by BOLD signal modulation. By using this approach, the pattern of EEG-informed BOLD modulation provided improved characterization of the network involved than the fMRI-only analysis or the source reconstruction of the three ERPs; the latter techniques showing only two regions in common localized in the occipital lobe.

In the present study we used EEG to identify neural markers of this process. We presented participants with many and few disabler conditionals for which retrieval of disabling conditions was likely or unlikely. As in classic behavioral studies we observed that participants accepted the standard MP conclusion less for conditionals with many disablers. The key finding was that the presentation of the standard MP conclusion also resulted in a more pronounced N2 and less pronounced P3b for the many disabler conditionals. This specific N2/P3b pattern has been linked to the violation and satisfaction of expectations, respectively. Thereby, the present ERP findings support the idea that disabler retrieval lowers reasoners' expectations that the standard MP conclusion can be drawn. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The P1 and N1 components of the visual ERP are sensitive to different attentional modulations, suggesting that different aspects of stimulus processing can be modeled with these ERP parameters. As such, different patterns of BOLD covariation for P1 and N1 informed regressors would be expected; however, current findings are equivocal. We investigate the effects of variations in attention on P1 and N1 informed BOLD activation in a visual oddball task. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were recorded from 13 healthy participants during three conditions of a visual oddball task: Passive, Count, and Respond. We show that the P1 and N1 components of the visual ERP can be used in the integration-by-prediction method of EEG-fMRI data integration to highlight brain regions related to target detection and response production. Our data suggest that the P1 component of the ERP reflects changes in sensory encoding of stimulus features and is more informative for the Passive and Count conditions. The N1, on the other hand, was more informative for the Respond condition, suggesting that it can be used to model the processing of stimulus, meaning specifically discriminating one type of stimulus from another, and processes involved in integrating sensory information with response selection. Our results show that an understanding of the underlying electrophysiology is necessary for a thorough interpretation of EEG-informed fMRI analysis.

EEG signals are generally a mixture of neural activity from broad areas, some of which may not be related to the task targeted by BMI, hence impairing BMI performance. NIRS has an inherent time delay as it measures blood flow, which therefore detracts from practical real-time BMI utility. To try to improve real environment EEG-NIRS-based BMIs, we propose here a novel methodology in which the subjects' mental states are decoded from cortical currents estimated from EEG, with the help of information from NIRS. Using a Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy (VBMEG) methodology, we incorporated a novel form of NIRS-based prior to capture event related desynchronization from isolated current sources on the cortical surface. Then, we applied a Bayesian logistic regression technique to decode subjects' mental states from further sparsified current sources. Applying our methodology to a spatial attention task, we found our EEG-NIRS-based decoder exhibited significant performance improvement over decoding methods based on EEG sensor signals alone. The advancement of our methodology, decoding from current sources sparsely isolated on the cortex, was also supported by neuroscientific considerations; intraparietal sulcus, a region known to be involved in spatial attention, was a key responsible region in our task. These results suggest that our methodology is not only a practical option for EEG-NIRS-based BMI applications, but also a potential tool to investigate brain activity in non-laboratory and naturalistic environments.

Moreover, in order to achieve a portable and more compact BMI for practical applications, it is also desirable to use a system capable of accurate classification using information from as few EEG channels as possible. In the present work, we propose a method for classifying P300 ERPs using a combination of Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and amultiobjective hybrid real-binary Particle Swarm Optimization (MHPSO) algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm searches for the set of EEG channels and classifier parameters that simultaneously maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the number of used channels. The performance of the method is assessed through offline analyses on datasets of auditory ERPs from sound discrimination experiments. The proposed method achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by traditional methods while also using fewer channels. It was also found that the number of channels used for classification can be significantly reduced without greatly compromising the classification accuracy.

ERP and adaptive autoregressive identification with spectral power decomposition to study rapid auditory processing in infants	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			FREQUENCY	The ability to process rapidly-occurring auditory stimuli plays an important role in the mechanisms of language acquisition. For this reason, the research community has begun to investigate infant auditory processing, particularly using the Event Related Potentials (ERP) technique. In this paper we approach this issue by means of time domain and time-frequency domain analysis. For the latter, we propose the use of Adaptive Autoregressive (AAR) identification with spectral power decomposition. Results show EEG delta-theta oscillation enhancement related to the processing of acoustic frequency and duration changes, suggesting that, as expected, power modulation encodes rapid auditory processing (RAP) in infants and that the time-frequency analysis method proposed is able to identify this modulation.

Multichannel EEG signal recording analysis based on Cross Frequency Coupling method	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN ENGINEERING (INTER-ENG 2013)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Interdisciplinarity in Engineering (INTER-ENG)	OCT 10-11, 2013	Tarqu Mures, ROMANIA	Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures		EEG signals; multichannel recording; cross frequency coupling; phase amplitude coupling	PHASE; OSCILLATIONS	Cross-frequency coupling (CFCo) could be important to study task-relevant manner changes in time series (TS). CFCo might also serve as an instrument to distinguish between oscillatory states and interrelations in signals, and to exhibit characteristic changes. Presenting the use of phase-amplitude type Cross Frequency Coupling, named Phase-Amplitude-Coupling (PAC) is the objective of this presentation. PAC describes the statistical dependence between the phase of a low-frequency brain rhythm and the amplitude (or power) of the higher-frequency component of electrical activity in the brain. Two other varieties of signal coupling are possible. These are the cross-frequency phase synchronization (phase-phase CFCo) and cross-frequency amplitude envelope correlation (amplitude-amplitude CFCo). These procedures should be efficient to study possible mechanism to regulate interrelation of the multichannel recorded EEG signals. As it is known, EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Interdependence of the different frequency range EEG signals, must be studied to understand internal behaviour of signals generated by different cortical areas. The paper is based on multichannel EEG recordings. It is possible to detect correlations between distal cortical regions during different task related events as Event Related Potentials (ERP). Correlation factor of left-right hemisphere's signals, recorded in biologically symmetric scalp positions are important in ERP studies. The Hilbert transform based method is also involved to have a way to analyze the interrelations of different brain region activities. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd	[Marton, L.

The purpose of this study was to synthesize previous event-related potential (ERP) findings and determine whether patients with PD have significant abnormalities in the P300 wave compared to controls. We performed a systematic literature search for studies published between 1980 and 2013 that reported P300 measurements in patients with PD and controls. Effect size estimates were computed using the restricted maximum likelihood model. We identified 14 ERP studies that analyzed P300 amplitude (461 PD and 355 controls), and 11 ERP studies that analyzed latency (320 PD and 282 controls). Patients with PD had reduced P300 amplitudes compared to controls, but this difference was non significant at midline electrodes (n = 14, ES -0.16; z = -1.55, p = 0.122). However, P300 amplitude was significantly reduced when analyzing the Pz electrode independently (n = 7, ES -0.48, z = -3.92, p < 0.001). No significant differences between cases and controls in P300 latency were observed at the midline electrodes (n = 11, ES 0.11, z = 0.64, p = 0.524). This meta-analysis included non-peer reviewed literature and ERP stimuli with varying levels of emotional salience, which may have introduced bias into the analysis. There is no robust evidence that P300 latency alterations are present in patients with PD; however, there are indications of reduced amplitude at Pz relative to controls. Reductions in amplitude may be associated with reduced neural resources allocated to contextual updating, selective attention, and neural inhibition mechanisms.

Understanding the underlying processes is difficult because the precise time instant of this endogenous reversal event needs to be known but is difficult to measure. Presenting ambiguous figures discontinuously and using stimulus onset as estimation of the reversal event increased temporal resolution and provided a series of well-confirmed EEG signatures. In the current EEG study we used this 'onset paradigm' for the first time with Boring's old/young woman stimulus. We found an early occipital event-related potential (ERP) correlate of reversals between the perception of the old woman and the perception of the young woman that fits well with previous ERP findings. This component was not followed by the often-reported occipito-parietal Reversal Negativity at 260 ms, but instead by an occipito-temporal N170, that is typically reported with face stimuli. We interpret our results as follows: ambiguity conflicts take place during processing of stimulus elements in early visual areas roughly 130 ms after stimulus onset. The disambiguation of these elements and their assembly to object 'gestalts' result from an interplay between early visual and object-specific brain areas in a temporal window between 130 and 260 ms after stimulus onset. In the particular case of Boring's old/young woman the processes of element disambiguation and gestalt construction are already finished at 170 ms and, thus, 90 ms earlier than in the case of ambiguous geometric figures (eg Necker cube or Schroeder staircase) or of binocular rivalrous gratings.

Stone Age weapon use can be traced through deep time. Studying aspects thereof might have implications for how we think about the evolution of the human brain and the thinking processes that make us human. A pilot EEG-ERP (electroencephalography, event-related potential) study was conducted to evaluate changes in the volume of neural energy that is required between simple, replicated spear-throwing and arrow-shooting tasks. When participants engaged in the experimental tasks, we recorded consistent, and statistically significant higher levels of activity in delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands across the parietal, frontal midline and orbitofrontal cortices of the human brain. Based on our sample size of only four individuals, these results are considered preliminary, but they indicate the potential for similar studies in the future.	[Williams, Victoria M.

Here, it is investigated whether lexical prosody influences the decomposition of spoken compound words. In order to explore the neurophysiological correlates (event-related potentials, ERP) of a compound prosody, German native speakers had to judge the number agreement between numerals and nouns which did or did not agree in 50% of the cases. Importantly, the nouns carried either a compound or non-compound (single noun) prosody. The compound prosody led to increased reaction times (RTs) and reduced judgement accuracy. Critically, number violations for words with a compound prosody elicited an increased ERP negativity that was delayed by about 600ms relative to a left-anterior negativity elicited by number violations for a single noun prosody. The ERP effect for the compound prosody preceded the according behavioural response by about 200ms and the ERP peak latency effect correlated with the RT effect. These findings suggest that the ERP effect for the compound prosody could be functionally related to the accurate judgement performance for the compound prosody. The results suggest, more generally, that prosody plays a critical role in auditory compound comprehension and morphological processing.

J	Hsu, YF; Hamalainen, JA; Waszak, F				Hsu, Yi-Fang; Hamalainen, Jarmo A.; Waszak, Florian			Repetition suppression comprises both attention-independent and attention-dependent processes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Repetition suppression; Adaptation; Prediction; Attention; Electroencephalography (EEG)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STIMULUS REPETITION; NEURAL ADAPTATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL-NEURONS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX	Repetition suppression, a robust phenomenon of reduction in neural responses to stimulus repetition, is suggested to consist of a combination of bottom-up adaptation and top-down prediction effects. However, there is little consensus on how repetition suppression is related to attention in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. It is probably because fMRI integrates neural activity related to adaptation and prediction effects which are respectively attention-independent and attention-dependent. Here we orthogonally manipulated stimulus repetition and attention in a target detection task while participants' electroencephalography (EEG; was recorded. In Experiment 1, we found a significant repetition effect on N1 amplitude regardless of attention whereas the repetition effect on P2 amplitude was attention-dependent In Experiment 2 where the attentiona manipulation was more stringent than that in Experiment 1, we replicated a significant repetition effect on N1 amplitude regardless of attention, whereas the repetition effect on P2 amplitude was eliminated. The results show that repetition suppression comprises both attention-independent and attention-dependent components. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Eldridge, J; Lane, AE; Belkin, M; Dennis, S				Eldridge, Justin; Lane, Alison E.; Belkin, Mikhail; Dennis, Simon			Robust features for the automatic identification of autism spectrum disorder in children	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Event-related potential; EEG; Classification	DIAGNOSTIC OBSERVATION SCHEDULE; RATING-SCALE; BLINK RATE; COHERENCE; CONNECTIVITY; POTENTIALS; ARTIFACTS; VALIDITY; SUBTYPES	Background: It is commonly reported that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit hyper-reactivity or hypo-reactivity to sensory stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to study neural sensory reactivity, suggesting that statistical analysis of EEG recordings is a potential means of automatic classification of the disorder. EEG recordings taken from children, however, are frequently contaminated with large amounts of noise, making analysis difficult. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic extraction of noise-robust EEG features, which serve to quantify neural sensory reactivity. We show the efficacy of a system for the classification of ASD using these features. Methods: An oddball paradigm was used to elicit event-related potentials from a group of 19 ASD children and 30 typically developing children. EEG recordings were taken and robust features were extracted. A support vector machine, logistic regression, and a naive Bayes classifier were used to classify the children as having ASD or being typically developing. Results: A classification accuracy of 79% was achieved, making our method competitive with other automatic diagnosis methods based on EEG. Additionally, we found that classification performance is reduced if eye blink artifacts are removed during preprocessing. Conclusions: This study shows that robust EEG features that quantify neural sensory reactivity are useful for the classification of ASD. We showed that noise-robust features are crucial for our analysis, and observe that traditional preprocessing methods may lead to poor classification performance in the face of a large amount of noise. Further exploration of alternative preprocessing methods is warranted.

Although event related potentials (ERPs) have revealed the existence of differences after correct and incorrect decisions, it is not known whether there is a trial-by-trial representation of the accuracy of the decision. We recorded the electroencephalographic activity (EEG) while participants performed a perceptual discrimination task, with two levels of difficulty, in which they received immediate feedback. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to reveal two components that convey trial-by-trial representations of the correctness of the decisions. Firstly, the performance monitoring-related negativity (PM-N), a negative deflection whose amplitude is higher (more negative) after incorrect trials. Secondly, the performance monitoring-related positivity (PM-P), a positive deflection whose amplitude is higher after incorrect trials. During the time periods corresponding to these components, trials can be accurately categorized as correct or incorrect by looking at the EEG activity; this categorization is more accurate when based on the PM-P. We further show that the difficulty of the discrimination task has a different effect on each component: after easy trials the latency of the PM-N is shorter and the amplitude of the PM-P is higher than after difficult trials. Consistent with previous interpretations of performance-related ERPs, these results suggest a functional differentiation between these components. The PM-N could be related to an automatic error detection system, responsible for fast behavioral corrections of ongoing actions, while the PM-P could reflect the difference between expected and actual outcomes and be related to long-term changes in the decision process.

REWARD CONTINGENCIES AND THE RECALIBRATION OF TASK MONITORING AND REWARD SYSTEMS: A HIGH-DENSITY ELECTRICAL MAPPING STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reward; punishment; task monitoring; EEG; ERP; motivation	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PREDICTION; ERROR; ACTIVATION; MAGNITUDE; POSITIVITY; PUNISHMENT	Task execution almost always occurs in the context of reward-seeking or punishment-avoiding behavior. As such, ongoing task-monitoring systems are influenced by reward anticipation systems. In turn, when a task has been executed either successfully or unsuccessfully, future iterations of that task will be re-titrated on the basis of the task outcome. Here, we examined the neural underpinnings of the task-monitoring and reward-evaluation systems to better understand how they govern reward-seeking behavior. Twenty-three healthy adult participants performed a task where they accrued points that equated to real world value (gift cards) by responding as rapidly as possible within an allotted timeframe, while success rate was titrated online by changing the duration of the timeframe dependent on participant performance. Informative cues initiated each trial, indicating the probability of potential reward or loss (four levels from very low to very high). We manipulated feedback by first informing participants of task success/failure, after which a second feedback signal indicated actual magnitude of reward/loss. High-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings allowed for examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) to the informative cues and in turn, to both feedback signals. Distinct ERP components associated with reward cues, task-preparatory and task-monitoring processes,and reward feedback processes were identified. Unsurprisingly, participants displayed increased ERP amplitudes associated with task-preparatory processes following cues that predicted higher chances of reward. They also rapidly updated reward and loss prediction information dependent on task performance after the first feedback signal. Finally, upon reward receipt, initial reward probability was no longer taken into account. Rather, ERP measures suggested that only the magnitude of actual reward or loss was now processed. Reward and task-monitoring processes are clearly dissociable, but interact across very fast timescales to update reward predictions as information about task success or failure is accrued. Careful delineation of these processes will be useful in future investigations in clinical groups where such processes are suspected of having gone awry. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the time-frequency representation of ERPs by higher-order tensors are usually large-scale, which prevents the popularity of most tensor factorization algorithms. To overcome this issue, we introduce a non-negative canonical polyadic decomposition (NCPD) based on low-rank approximation (LRA) and hierarchical alternating least square (HALS) techniques. We applied NCPD (LRAHALS and benchmark HALS) and CPD to extract multi-domain features of a visual ERP. The features and components extracted by LRAHALS NCPD and HALS NCPD were very similar, but LRAHALS NCPD was 70 times faster than HALS NCPD. Moreover, the desired multi-domain feature of the ERP by NCPD showed a significant group difference (control versus depressed participants) and a difference in emotion processing (fearful versus happy faces). This was more satisfactory than that by CPD, which revealed only a group difference.

In general, the information transfer rates of current BCI systems with single-trial EEG are generally lower than those with averaging EEG. In recent years, the concept of collaborative EEG analyses has been proposed with the purpose of improving the BCI performances with collaborative single-trial EEGs of individuals. In this paper, a collaborative BCI system is developed based on P300 evoked potentials. The collaborative BCI system with Global Positioning System (GPS) can be operated with three subjects by using three wearable EEG recording devices and wireless communications. As the results, the P300 waveforms could be observed and it was found that the collaborative P300 analyses could improve the BCI performances than individual P300 analyses. The result of this study is to be applied to P300-based big data mining and life log indexing, in particular, in outdoor environment.

We used a sliding short-time FFT decomposition of the EEG at Cz for each trial to assess prestimulus EEG activity in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. We determined the phase of each 2 Hz narrow-band contributing to these four broad bands at 125 ms before each stimulus onset, and for the first time, avoided contamination from poststimulus EEG activity. This phase value was extrapolated 125 ms to obtain the phase at stimulus onset, combined into the broad-band phase, and used to sort trials into four phase groups for each of the four broad bands. For each band, ERPs were derived for each phase from the raw EEG activity at 19 sites. Data sets from each band were separately decomposed using temporal Principal Components Analyses with unrestricted VARIMAX rotation to extract N1-1, PN, P2, P3, SW and LP components. Each component was analysed as a function of EEG phase at stimulus onset in the context of a simple conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). The predicted non-random occurrence of phase-defined brain states was confirmed. The preferred states of negativity, negative driving, and waxing were each associated with more efficient stimulus processing, as reflected in amplitude differences of the components. The present results confirm the existence of preferred brain states and their impact on the efficiency of brain dynamics in perceptual and cognitive processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Dopamine has been assumed to play a central role for this decline. Dopamine, however, is also essential for the maintenance of motivation for a longer period of time and is therefore a core factor for mental fatigue. Combining these two findings, we tested to what degree older adults are more prone to performance loss due to increasing time on task than younger adults. Twelve younger and twelve older participants performed an inhibition of return task for 80 min. Performance declined in the older participants but not in the young. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG, however, showed distinct changes with time on task primarily for young participants. The dissociation between behavioral and ERP results indicates that changes in ERPs of the young participants could reflect adaptations to the task rather than fatigue. This is evident from very distinct changes of the posterior N1 component in this group. The failing (or rather unspecific) adaptation to the task in older adults might have been a consequence of lacking frontal executive control functions reflected in a massive reduction of the N2 component of the ERP, relative to the young participants.

Perhaps the most interesting approach is to combine wireless EEG and virtual reality, where one can create and manipulate realistic multimodal environments. However EEG recording during locomotion in a virtual reality lab is exposed to several types of electrical noise generating hardware. In the current paper we present two studies. In the first we turned on and off possible sources of electrical noise. We found that although electrical noise is present in the data, it is typically localized above the frequency ranges of brain related activity. In the second study we measured event related potential changes to a simple visual stimulus using wireless and wired setup in a virtual reality room and in a psychophysiology lab. We found that the shape of the N1, an early component of visual processing is not affected by the type of signal transmission but importantly its latency is different in the two labs.

EEG correlates that indicate mechanisms of information processing, however, are hardly accessible since discrete time stamps that are necessary for this approach are commonly not available in natural situations. However, eye blinks may close this gap. Eye blinks are assumed to mark distinct points in information processing, necessary to segment the incoming data stream. By using mobile EEG in a simulated working situation we demonstrate that eye-blink-related potentials provide reliable information about cognitive processing in distinct working environments. During cognitive tasks, an increase in the fronto-central N2 component as well as evoked theta activity can be shown, both indices of enhanced cognitive control. The posterior P3 is reduced during physical tasks (sorting of boxes), probably reflecting the more continuous nature of this task. The data are discussed within a model of dopaminergic modulation of blink activity that involves both task specific aspects like executive control and modulating influences of motivation or fatigue.

UNIFORMITY AND NONUNIFORMITY OF NEURAL ACTIVITIES CORRELATED TO DIFFERENT INSIGHT PROBLEM SOLVING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						insight; problem solving; event-related potential; cognitive conflict; right hemisphere	ACTIVATION; AHA; INFORMATION; DECOMPOSITION; WORDS; EEG	Previous studies on the neural basis of insight reflected weak consistency except for the anterior cingulate cortex. The present work adopted the semantic and homophonic punny riddle to explore the uniformity and nonuniformity of neural activities correlated to different insight problem solving. Results showed that in the early period of insight solving, the semantic and homophonic punny riddles induced a common N350-500 over the central scalp. However, during -400 to 0 ms before the riddles were solved, the semantic punny riddles induced a positive event-related potential (ERP) deflection over the temporal cortex for retrieving the extensive semantic information, while the homophonic punny riddles induced a positive ERP deflection over the temporal cortex and a negative one in the left frontal cortex which might reflect the semantic and phonological information processing respectively. Our study indicated that different insight problem solving should have the same cognitive process of detecting cognitive conflicts, but have different ways to solve the conflicts. (C) 2014 IBRO.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the t-CWT were assessed and compared to a variety of competing procedures using simulated EEG data at six low signal-to-noise ratios. Results show that the t-CWT combines high sensitivity and specificity with favorable PPV and NPV. Applying the t-CWT to authentic EEG data obtained from 14 healthy participants confirmed its high sensitivity. The t-CWT may thus be well suited for the assessment of weak ERPs in single-subject settings.	[Real, Ruben G.

INFLUENCE OF LONG-TERM SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION PRACTICE ON EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN: AN ERP STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						meditation; mindfulness; emotion; ERP; affective images	ATTENTION; MINDFULNESS; AMYGDALA; EEG; MISMATCH; IMPROVES; STIMULI; IMPACT	Despite growing interest in meditation as a tool for alternative therapy of stress-related and psychosomatic diseases, brain mechanisms of beneficial influences of meditation practice on health and quality of life are still unclear. We propose that the key point is a persistent change in emotional functioning, specifically the modulation of the early appraisal of motivational significance of events. The main aim was to study the effects of long-term meditation practice on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during affective picture viewing. ERPs were recorded in 20 long-term Sahaja Yoga meditators and 20 control subjects without prior experience in meditation. The meditators' mid-latency (140-400 ms) ERPs were attenuated for both positive and negative pictures (i.e. there were no arousal-related increases in ERP positivity) and this effect was more prominent over the right hemisphere. However, we found no differences in the long latency (400-800 ms) responses to emotional images, associated with meditation practice. In addition we found stronger ERP negativity in the time window 200-300 ms for meditators compared to the controls, regardless of picture valence. We assume that long-term meditation practice enhances frontal top-down control over fast automatic salience detection, based on amygdala functions. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recalibration of inhibitory control systems during walking-related dual-task interference: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) Study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dual-task design; Event-related potentials; Gait; Inhibitory control; EEG; Mobile Brain-Body Imaging	GO NOGO TASKS; OLDER-ADULTS; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; TREADMILL WALKING; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; MOTOR TASK; GAIT	Walking while simultaneously performing cognitively demanding tasks such as talking or texting are typical complex behaviors in our daily routines. Little is known about neural mechanisms underlying cortical resource allocation during such mobile actions, largely due to portability limitations of conventional neuroimaging technologies. We applied an EEG-based Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) system that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity. We compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/NoGo response-inhibition task under conditions where participants (N = 18) sat in a stationary way, walked deliberately or walked briskly. This allowed for assessment of effects of increasing dual-task load (i.e. walking speed) on neural indices of inhibitory control. Stride time and variability were also measured during inhibitory task performance and compared to stride parameters without task performance, thereby assessing reciprocal dual-task effects on gait parameters. There were no task performance differences between sitting and either walking condition, indicating that participants could perform both tasks simultaneously without suffering dual-task costs. However, participants took longer strides under dual-task load, likely indicating an adaptive mechanism to reduce inter-task competition for cortical resources. We found robust differences in amplitude, latency and topography of ERP components (N2 and P3) associated with inhibitory control between the sitting and walking conditions. Considering that participants showed no dual-task performance costs, we suggest that observed neural alterations under increasing task-load represent adaptive recalibration of the inhibitory network towards a more controlled and effortful processing mode, thereby optimizing performance under dual-task situations.

The results show that the estimation of electromyography (EMG) from EEG is possible and this implies a great potential to use EEG signals for supporting human activities.

The aims of the present study are to investigate whether second language (L2) phonology is active during L1 reading, and to disentangle the contributions of orthography and phonology in reading aloud. To this end, Dutch-English bilinguals read aloud L1 target words primed by L2 words, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The onset of the primes was manipulated to disentangle the contributions of orthography and phonology (i.e. O+P+: kite - KUNST, 'art'; O+P-: knee - KUNST; O-P+: crime - KUNST; O-P-: mine - KUNST). Phonological but not orthographic overlap facilitated RTs. However, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed both orthographic and phonological priming starting 125 ms after target presentation. Taken together, we gained insights into the time course of cross-linguistic priming and demonstrated that L2 phonology is activated rapidly in an L1 environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, comprehension of novel metaphors was investigated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with the simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography (EEG)/event-related potentials (ERPs). For the first time, we investigated the effects of figurative language on early electrophysiological markers (P200, N400) and their functional relationship to cortical haemodynamic responses within the language network (Broca's area, Wemicke's area). To this end, 20 healthy subjects judged 120 sentences with respect to their meaningfulness, whereby phrases were either literal, metaphoric, or meaningless. Our results indicated a metaphorspecific P200 reduction and a linear increase of N400 amplitudes from literal over metaphoric to meaningless sentences. Moreover, there were metaphor related effects on haemodynamic responses accessed with NIRS, especially within the left lateral frontal cortex (Broca's area). Significant correlations between electrophysiological and haemodynamic responses indicated that P200 reductions during metaphor comprehension were associated with an increased recruitment of neural activity within left Wernicke's area, indicating a link between variations in neural activity and haemodynamic changes within Wernicke's area. This link may reflect processes related to interindividual differences regarding the ability to classify novel metaphors. The present study underlines the usefulness of simultaneous NIRS measurements in language paradigms - especially for investigating the functional significance of neurophysiological markers that have so far been rarely examined - as these measurements are easily and efficiently realizable and allow for a complementary examination of neural activity and associated metabolic changes in cortical areas.

However, the distinction could be visible on brain activity timing within the fronto-parietal network. In this study, we used Event-Related Potential (ERP) method to assess the temporal dynamics of object-related and non-object-related action processing. Although both meaningful, only object-related actions involve object motor features. Accordingly, perception of the two action types would show distinct neural correlates. Participants were presented with four movie types (ORA, Object-Related Action, NORA: Non-Object-Related Action and 2 control movies) and were instructed to perform tasks that required explicit or implicit action recognition (specific action recognition or color change detection). Movies were presented as Point-Light Display (PLD) and thus provided only information about gesture kinematics regardless of action type. ERP were computed during movie visual perception and analyzed as a function of movie type and task. The main result revealed a difference between ORA and NORA on the amplitude of the P3a component in the fronto-parietal region. The difference observed around 250 ms after movie onset do not likely origin from variation in low-level visual features or attention resource allocation. Instead, we suggest that it reflects incidental recruitment of object attributes during object-related action perception. The exact nature of these attributes is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, very few multimodal results address the coupling of these inhibition markers. In fMRI, response inhibition has been most consistently linked to activation of the anterior insula and inferior frontal cortex (IFC), often also the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). ERP work has established increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during NoGo compared to Go conditions in most Studies. Previous simultaneous EEG-fMRI imaging reported association of the N2/P3 complex with activation of areas like the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and anterior insula. In this study we investigated inhibitory control in 23 healthy young adults (mean age = 24.7, n = 17 for EEG during fMRI) using a combined Flanker/NoGo task during simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording. Separate fMRI and ERP analysis yielded higher activation in the anterior insula, IFG and ACC as well as increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during NoGo trials in accordance with the literature. Combined analysis modelling sequential N2 and P3 effects through joint parametric modulation revealed correlation of higher N2 amplitude with deactivation in parts of the default mode network (DMN) and the cingulate motor area (CMA) as well as correlation of higher central P3 amplitude with activation of the left anterior insula, IFG and posterior cingulate. The EEG-fMRI results resolve the localizations of these sequential activations. They suggest a general role for allocation of attentional resources and motor inhibition for N2 and link memory recollection and internal reflection to P3 amplitude, in addition to previously described response inhibition as reflected by the anterior insula.

Different colors of light lead to different adaptation and activation as determined by high-density EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Light adaptation is crucial for coping with the varying levels of ambient light. Using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated how adaptation to light of different colors affects brain responsiveness. In a within-subject design, sixteen young participants were adapted first to dim white light and then to blue, green, red, or white bright light (one color per session in a randomized order). Immediately after both dim and bright light adaptation, we presented brief light pulses and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs). We analyzed ERP response strengths and brain topographies and determined the underlying sources using electrical source imaging. Between 150 and 261 ms after stimulus onset, the global field power (GFP) was higher after dim than bright light adaptation. This effect was most pronounced with red light and localized in the frontal lobe, the fusiform gyrus, the occipital lobe and the cerebellum. After bright light adaptation, within the first 100 ms after light onset, stronger responses were found than after dim light adaptation for all colors except for red light. Differences between conditions were localized in the frontal lobe, the cingulate gyrus, and the cerebellum. These results indicate that very short-term EEG brain responses are influenced by prior light adaptation and the spectral quality of the light stimulus. We show that the early EEG responses are differently affected by adaptation to different colors of light which may contribute to known differences in performance and reaction times in cognitive tests.

SZ patients (n = 42) and non-psychiatric comparison subjects (n = 47) participated in a passive auditory duration oddball paradigm, eliciting a triphasic (Deviant-Standard) tone ERP difference complex, here termed the auditory deviance response (ADR), comprised of a mid-frontal mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a positivity, and re-orienting negativity (RON) peak sequence. To identify its cortical sources and to assess possible relationships between their response contributions and clinical SZ measures, we applied independent component analysis to the continuous 68-channel EEG data and clustered the resulting independent components (ICs) across subjects on spectral, ERP, and topographic similarities. Six IC clusters centered in right superior temporal, right inferior frontal, ventral mid-cingulate, anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal, and dorsal mid-cingulate cortex each made triphasic response contributions. Although correlations between measures of SZ clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning and standard (Fz) scalp-channel ADR peak measures were weak or absent, for at least four IC clusters one or more significant correlations emerged. In particular, differences in MMN peak amplitude in the right superior temporal IC cluster accounted for 48% of the variance in SZ-subject performance on tasks necessary for real-world functioning and medial orbitofrontal cluster P3a amplitude accounted for 40%/54% of SZ-subject variance in positive/negative symptoms. Thus, source-resolved auditory deviance response measures including MMN may be highly sensitive to SZ clinical, cognitive, and functional characteristics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigate how the cerebral processing of emotional trait adjectives is modulated by their perceived communicative sender in anticipation of an evaluation. 16 students were videotaped while they described themselves. They were told that a stranger would evaluate their personality based on this recording by endorsing trait adjectives. In a control condition a computer program supposedly randomly selected the adjectives. Actually, both conditions were random. A larger parietal N1 was found for adjectives in the supposedly human-generated condition. This indicates that more visual attention is allocated to the presented adjectives when putatively interacting with a human. Between 400 and 700 ms a fronto-central main effect of emotion was found. Positive, and in tendency also negative adjectives, led to a larger late positive potential (LPP) compared to neutral adjectives. A centro-parietal interaction in the LPP-window was due to larger LPP amplitudes for negative compared to neutral adjectives within the human sender condition. Larger LPP amplitudes are related to stimulus elaboration and memory consolidation. Participants responded more to emotional content particularly when presented in a meaningful human context. This was first observed in the early posterior negativity window (210-260 ms). But the significant interaction between sender and emotion reached only trend-level on post hoc tests. Our results specify differential effects of even implied communicative partners on emotional language processing. They show that anticipating evaluation by a communicative partner alone is sufficient to increase the relevance of particularly emotional adjectives, given a seemingly realistic interactive setting.

Early activation of Broca's area in grammar processing as revealed by the syntactic mismatch negativity and distributed source analysis	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						IFG; Syntax; MMN; ERP; Morphology; Broca	NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG DATA; LANGUAGE; LOCALIZATION; ARTIFACTS; ATTENTION; REMOVAL; FOCUS	Though activation of Broca's region in the combinatorial processing of symbols (language, music) has been revealed by neurometabolic studies, most previous neurophysiological research found the earliest grammar indices in the temporal cortex, with inferior-frontal generators becoming active at relatively late stages. We use the attention- and task-free syntactic mismatch negativity (sMMN) event-related potential (ERP) to measure rapid and automatic sensitivity of the human brain to grammatical information in participants' native language (French). Further, sources underlying the MMN were estimated by applying the Parametrical Empirical Bayesian (PEB) approach, with the Multiple Sparse Priors (MSP) technique. Results showed reliable grammar-related activation focused on Broca's region already in the 150-190 ms time window, providing robust documentation of its involvement in the first stages of syntactic processing.

J	Balas, B; Stevenson, K				Balas, Benjamin; Stevenson, Kate			Children's neural response to contrast-negated faces is species specific	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Face perception; Other-species recognition; Event-related potentials; Contrast Negation; Visual Experience; Early Childhood	RECOGNITION MEMORY; ERP EVIDENCE; OWN-AGE; PIGMENTATION; EYE; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; INVERSION; REVERSAL; ACCOUNT	Face recognition abilities develop dramatically during the first year of life, but comparatively little is known about the nature of face-specific perceptual development during early childhood. Face-specific effects of image appearance on recognition, including face inversion and contrast negation, are a useful means of understanding the functional properties of face perception developmentally. Here, we examined the generality of the impact of contrast negation on face perception during early childhood using event-related potentials (ERPs). Specifically, we recorded continuous electroencephalography (EEG) while adult participants and children between 4 and 6 years of age viewed human and non-human primate faces presented in either positive or negative contrast. We examined both the P100 and N170 components to determine whether or not sensitivity to contrast polarity was evident in face-sensitive components during early childhood and also whether or not that sensitivity was specific to species category. We found evidence of a species-specific effect of contrast negation at the N170, suggesting that by early childhood some aspects of face-specific processing have been restricted to a relatively narrow class of face stimuli. However, this effect is of the opposite sign relative to adults, suggesting that there is continued maturation of face-specific processing during childhood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50% when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.

Insights in applications and challenges	NERVENARZT			German	Article						Electroencephalography; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Methods; Artifacts; Data analysis	PULSE ARTIFACT; COMPONENT; NETWORK; CORTEX; ERP	The following article presents an introduction to simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) measurements which have undergone a huge development during the last few years. The idea behind combining both non-invasive methods is to join the excellent temporal resolution of EEG (ms) together with the superior spatial resolution of fMRI (mm). In this article the status quo of the method and perspectives regarding multimodal imaging are discussed. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements are affected by scanner and cardioballistic artifacts. We present common artifact subtraction methods in order to achieve a feasible data quality and outline what to consider when planning and recording EEG and fMRI simultaneously. Moreover, we discuss different analysis strategies. Combined EEG-fMRI measurements have already increased our knowledge about the underlying relationships between the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response and the EEG signal and are applied to answer widespread research questions. Simultaneous measurements are an essential part of multimodal imaging in investigating the underlying processing mechanisms of the brain as well as in advancing our understanding of neuropsychiatric diseases. Current developments in multimodal imaging focus on the combination of electrophysiological and MRI parameters within ultra-high field MRI as well as on positron emission tomography (PET) in a trimodal approach.

To investigate the mechanisms that monitor such predictions, we recorded scalp EEG as subjects learned to reproduce sequences of motions. Each sequence was seen and reproduced four successive times, with occasional deviant directions of motion inserted into otherwise-familiar and predictable sequences. To dissociate the neural activity associated with encoding new items from that associated with detecting sequence deviants, we measured ERPs to new, familiar, and deviant sequence items. Both new and deviant sequence items evoked enhanced P3 responses, with the ERP to deviant items encompassing both P300-like and Novelty P3-like subcomponents with distinct timing and topographies. These results confirm that the neural response to deviant items differs from that to new items, and that unpredicted events in newly-learned sequences are identified by processes similar to those monitoring stable sequential regularities.

Neurofeedback training for peak performance	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						neurofeedback; cognitive control; anxiety; ERPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG	Aim. One of the applications of the Neurofeedback methodology is peak performance in sport. The protocols of the neurofeedback are usually based on an assessment of the spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG in resting state conditions. The aim of the paper was to study whether the intensive neurofeedback training of a well-functioning Olympic athlete who has lost his performance confidence after injury in sport, could change the brain functioning reflected in changes in spontaneous EEG and event related potentials (ERPs). Case study. The case is presented of an Olympic athlete who has lost his performance confidence after injury in sport. He wanted to resume his activities by means of neurofeedback training. His QEEG/ERP parameters were assessed before and after 4 intensive sessions of neurotherapy. Dramatic and statistically significant changes that could not be explained by error measurement were observed in the patient. Conclusion. Neurofeedback training in the subject under study increased the amplitude of the monitoring component of ERPs generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, accompanied by an increase in beta activity over the medial prefrontal cortex. Taking these changes together, it can be concluded that that even a few sessions of neurofeedback in a high performance brain can significantly activate the prefrontal cortical areas associated with increasing confidence in sport performance.

J	Kopp, F				Kopp, Franziska			Audiovisual temporal fusion in 6-month-old infants	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Multisensoiy perception; Audiovisual; Infancy; ERP; Synchrony	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; INTERSENSORY PERCEPTION; VISUAL SPEECH; SYNCHRONY; WINDOW; ERP; ATTENTION; NOVELTY; RECALIBRATION	The aim of this study was to investigate neural dynamics of audiovisual temporal fusion processes in 6-month-old infants using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). In a habituation-test paradigm, infants did not show any behavioral signs of discrimination of an audiovisual asynchrony of 200 ms, indicating perceptual fusion. In a subsequent EEG experiment, audiovisual synchronous stimuli and stimuli with a visual delay of 200 ms were presented in random order. In contrast to the behavioral data, brain activity differed significantly between the two conditions. Critically, Ni and P2 latency delays were not observed between synchronous and fused items, contrary to previously observed N1 and P2 latency delays between synchrony and perceived asynchrony. Hence, temporal interaction processes in the infant brain between the two sensory modalities varied as a function of perceptual fusion versus asynchrony perception. The visual recognition components Pb and Nc were modulated prior to sound onset, emphasizing the importance of anticipatory visual events for the prediction of auditory signals. Results suggest mechanisms by which young infants predictively adjust their ongoing neural activity to the temporal synchrony relations to be expected between vision and audition.

The electrical activity of the brain along the scalp suffered from sleep apnea using Electroencephalogram (EEG) is addressed. The correlation between the EEG signals was compared to detect the features of sleep apnea. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Bivariate were adopted in this project to evaluate the extracted EEG signals. The performance of EMD has greatly improved when the number of samples was decreasing. The segmentation error analyzed in the Event Related Potential (ERP) reflected the occurrence of apnea. The delta power associated to the body autonomous system and homeostasis regulation is due to the drop of oxygen when sleep apnea happened. Using Hilbert Huang Transform, there is energy waveform in low frequencies when an apnea has happened. These can be linked to the delta power which relates to the body autonomous system and homeostasis regulation. The EMD, EEMD and Bivariate methods were compared to show key features linked with apnea for analysis purposes.

Difficulties in learning and recognizing the orthography of words can arise despite reiterative exposure to texts. This study aimed to investigate, in native Spanish-speaking late adolescents, how different levels of orthographic knowledge might result in behavioral and event-related brain potential differences during the recognition of orthographic errors. Forty-five healthy high school students were selected and divided into 3 equal groups (High, Medium, Low) according to their performance on a 5-test battery of orthographic knowledge. All participants performed an orthographic recognition task consisting of the sequential presentation of a picture (object, fruit, or animal) followed by a correctly, or incorrectly, written word (orthographic mismatch) that named the picture just shown. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording took place simultaneously. Behavioral results showed that the Low group had a significantly lower number of correct responses and increased reaction times while processing orthographical errors. Tests showed significant positive correlations between higher performance on the experimental task and faster and more accurate reading. The P150 and P450 components showed higher voltages in the High group when processing orthographic errors, whereas N170 seemed less lateralized to the left hemisphere in the lower orthographic performers. Also, trials with orthographic errors elicited a frontal P450 component that was only evident in the High group. The present results show that higher levels of orthographic knowledge correlate with high reading performance, likely because of faster and more accurate perceptual processing, better visual orthographic representations, and top-down supervision, as the event-related brain potential findings seem to suggest.

P300, a component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs), is a widely used feature component of EEG signal for BCI applications. However, single trial analysis is difficult since ERPs such as P300 signals have a very low signal to noise ratio, which bring down the communication rate. And the numerous number of channels needed to record EEG prevents the popularization of BCI applications due to the complexity and high cost of the system. In this paper, a new efficient method, extreme learning machine (ELM), is presented to detect P300 components using a single channel data from a visual stimuli Oddball paradigm experiment. It reaches an average accuracy above 85% and performs better than BPNN and SVM.

The classical oddball paradigm is usually used to evoke the P300 from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, EEG raw data are noisy which make the P300 detection very difficult. In this paper, we aim to detect the P300 wave as accurate as possible using appropriate feature extraction method combined with powerful classifier. We compared four methods: Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA) and Linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Each method is used with a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier and tested on EEG signals from three channels (FZ, CZ and PZ) of four healthy subjects. The results show that the P300 wave is efficiently detected in PZ channel using KPCA-SVM.

These ERPs are of ten recorded using passive or unspecific instructions. Patient data obtained this way are then compared to data from healthy participants, which are usually recorded using active instructions. The present study investigates the effect of attentive modulations and particularly the effect of activevs. passive instruction on the ERP components mismatch negativity (MMN) and N400. A sample of 18 healthy participants listened to three auditory paradigms: anoddball, aword priming, and a sentence paradigm. Each paradigm was presented three times with different instructions: ignoring auditory stimuli, passive listening, and focused attention on the auditory stimuli. After each task, the participants indicated their subjective effort. The N400 decreased from the focused task to the passive task, and was extinct in the ignore task. The MMN exhibited higher amplitudes in the focused and passive task compared to the ignore task. The data indicate an effect of attention on the supratemporal component of the MMN. Subjective effort was equally high in the passive and focused tasks but reduced in the ignore task. We conclude that passive listening during EEG recording is stressful and attenuates ERPs, which renders the interpretation of the results obtained in such conditions difficult.

The extent of misperception varies between different types of INS. The following paper comprised sections which will be aimed at studying the sleep EEG and compares it to subjective reports of sleep in individuals suffering from either psychophysiological insomnia or paradoxical insomnia and good sleeper controls. The EEG can be studied without any intervention (thus using the raw data) via either PSG or fine quantitative EEG analyses (power spectral analysis [PSA]), identifying EEG patterns as in the case of cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs) or by decorticating the EEG while scoring the different transient or phasic events (K-Complexes or sleep spindles). One can also act on the on-going EEG by delivering stimuli so to study their impact on cortical measures as in the case of event-related potential studies (ERPs). From the paucity of studies available using these different techniques, a general conclusion can be reached: sleep misperception is not an easy phenomenon to quantify and its clinical value is not well recognized. Still, while none of the techniques or EEG measures defined in the paper is available and/or recommended to diagnose insomnia, ERPs might be the most indicated technique to study hyperarousal and sleep quality. in different types of INS. More research shall also be dedicated to EEG patterns and transient phasic events as these EEG scoring techniques can offer a unique insight of sleep misperception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Brain Network Activation (BNA) Reveals Scopolamine-Induced Impairment of Visual Working Memory	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain Network Activation (BNA); Scopolamine; Cholinergic hypothesis; Working memory(WM); Dementia; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MATCHING-TO-SAMPLE; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; FACE REPRESENTATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG	The overarching goal of this event-related potential (ERP) study was to examine the effects of scopolamine on the dynamics of brain network activation using a novel ERP network analysis method known as Brain Network Activation (BNA). BNA was used for extracting group-common stimulus-activated network patterns elicited to matching probe stimuli in the context of a delayed matching-to-sample task following placebo and scopolamine treatments administered to healthy participants. The BNA extracted networks revealed the existence of two pathophysiological mechanisms following scopolamine, disconnection, and compensation. Specifically, weaker frontal theta and parietal alpha coupling was accompanied with enhanced fronto-centro-parietal theta activation relative to placebo. In addition, using the characteristic BNA network of each treatment as well as corresponding literature-guided selective subnetworks as combined biomarkers managed to differentiate between individual responses to each of the treatments. Behavioral effects associated with scopolamine included delayed response time and impaired response accuracy. These results indicate that the BNA method is sensitive to the effects of scopolamine on working memory and that it may potentially enable diagnosis and treatment assessment of dysfunctions associated with cholinergic deficiency.

When we search for two identical targets, however, we must continue the search after finding the first target and memorize its location. We used fixation-related potentials to investigate the neural correlates of different stages of the search, that is, before and after finding the first target. Having found the first target influenced subsequent distractor processing. Compared to distractor fixations before the first target fixation, a negative shift was observed for three subsequent distractor fixations. These results suggest that processing a target in continued search modulates the brain's response, either transiently by reflecting temporary working memory processes or permanently by reflecting working memory retention.

Reduced object related negativity response indicates impaired auditory scene analysis in adults with autistic spectrum disorder	PEERJ			English	Article						Autism; Auditory scene analysis; Object related negativity; Event related potential; Binaural processing; Electroencephalography; ORN; P400; Dichotic pitch	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; NEUROMAGNETIC RESPONSES; PERCEPTUAL SEGREGATION; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION; DICHOTIC PITCH; CHILDREN; INFORMATION; ABILITY	Auditory Scene Analysis provides a useful framework for understanding atypical auditory perception in autism. Specifically, a failure to segregate the incoming acoustic energy into distinct auditory objects might explain the aversive reaction autistic individuals have to certain auditory stimuli or environments. Previous research with non-autistic participants has demonstrated the presence of an Object Related Negativity (ORN) in the auditory event related potential that indexes pre-attentive processes associated with auditory scene analysis. Also evident is a later P400 component that is attention dependent and thought to be related to decision-making about auditory objects. We sought to determine whether there are differences between individuals with and without autism in the levels of processing indexed by these components. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure brain responses from a group of 16 autistic adults, and 16 age- and verbal-IQ-matched typically-developing adults. Auditory responses were elicited using lateralized dichotic pitch stimuli in which inter-aural timing differences create the illusory perception of a pitch that is spatially separated from a carrier noise stimulus. As in previous studies, control participants produced an ORN in response to the pitch stimuli. However, this component was significantly reduced in the participants with autism. In contrast, processing differences were not observed between the groups at the attention-dependent level (P400). These findings suggest that autistic individuals have difficulty segregating auditory stimuli into distinct auditory objects, and that this difficulty arises at an early pre-attentive level of processing.

Additional information on cognitive functions can be assessed when analyzing ERPs in the frequency domain and treating them as event-related oscillations (EROs). This procedure results in frequency spectra but lacks information about the temporal dynamics of EROs. Here, we describe a method-called time-frequency analysis-that allows analyzing both the frequency of an ERO and its evolution over time. In a brief tutorial, the reader will learn how to use wavelet analysis in order to compute time-frequency transforms of ERP data. Basic steps as well as potential artifacts are described. Rather than in terms of formulas, descriptions are in textual form (written text) with numerous figures illustrating the topics. Recommendations on how to present frequency and time-frequency data in journal articles are provided. Finally, we briefly review studies that have applied time-frequency analysis to mismatch negativity paradigms. The deviant stimulus of such a paradigm evokes an ERO in the theta frequency band that is stronger than for the standard stimulus. Conversely, the standard stimulus evokes a stronger gamma-band response than does the deviant. This is interpreted in the context of the so-called match-and-utilization model.

Empirical models of scalp-EEG responses using non-concurrent intracranial responses	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		EEG; ECoG; intracranial; spatial modeling; P300; ERP	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; P300 SPELLER PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; SIGNALS; HUMANS; ECOG; HOME; BCI	Objective. This study presents inter-subject models of scalp-recorded electroencephalographic (sEEG) event-related potentials (ERPs) using intracranially recorded ERPs from electrocorticography and stereotactic depth electrodes in the hippocampus, generally termed as intracranial EEG (iEEG). Approach. The participants were six patients with medically-intractable epilepsy that underwent temporary placement of intracranial electrode arrays to localize seizure foci. Participants performed one experimental session using a brain-computer interface matrix spelling paradigm controlled by sEEG prior to the iEEG electrode implantation, and one or more identical sessions controlled by iEEG after implantation. All participants were able to achieve excellent spelling accuracy using sEEG, four of the participants achieved roughly equivalent performance in the iEEG sessions, and all participants were significantly above chance accuracy for the iEEG sessions. The sERPs were modeled using a linear combination of iERPs using two different optimization criteria. Main results. The results indicate that sERPs can be accurately estimated from the iERPs for the patients that exhibited stable ERPs over the respective sessions, and that the transformed iERPs can be accurately classified with an sERP-derived classifier. Significance. The resulting models provide a new empirical representation of the formation and distribution of sERPs from underlying composite iERPs. These new insights provide a better understanding of ERP relationships and can potentially lead to the development of more robust signal processing methods for noninvasive EEG applications.

The N400 as an index of racial stereotype accessibility	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						N400; stereotyping; prejudice; P200; intergroup dynamics	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LEXICAL DECISION; IMPLICIT; PREJUDICE; RACE; BIAS; ASSOCIATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES	The current research examined the viability of the N400, an event-related potential (ERP) related to the detection of semantic incongruity, as an index of both stereotype accessibility and interracial prejudice. Participants' EEG was recorded while they completed a sequential priming task, in which negative or positive, stereotypically black (African American) or white (Caucasian American) traits followed the presentation of either a black or white face acting as a prime. ERP examination focused on the N400, but additionally examined N100 and P200 reactivity. Replicating and extending previous N400 stereotype research, results indicated that the N400 can indeed function as an index of stereotype accessibility in an interracial domain, as greater N400 reactivity was elicited by trials in which the face prime was incongruent with the target trait than when primes and traits matched. Furthermore, N400 activity was moderated by participants' self-reported explicit bias. More explicitly biased participants demonstrated greater N400 reactivity to stereotypically white traits following black faces than black traits following black faces. P200 activity was additionally associated with participants implicit biases, as more implicitly biased participants similarly demonstrated greater P200 reactivity to stereotypically white traits following black faces than black traits following black faces.

The present study aimed to assess and inform the taxonomic placement of TTM through an examination of its neural correlates. While research has consistently associated OCD with enhanced response monitoring, the present study investigated whether a similar neural process is associated with TTM. Undergraduates reporting TTM symptoms and controls performed a modified version of the flanker task, and their event-related potentials were examined for between-group differences in error-related negativity (ERN). Results confirm that individuals who have symptoms of hair pulling have significantly smaller ERNs than the control group. Smaller ERNs reflect decreased levels of response monitoring and support the idea that TTM is distinct from OCD.

Words that are located clearly on one of the three dimensions called "Evaluation", "Potency", and "Activity" were used as visual stimuli in a topographic event related potential study (ERP). Stimuli had been statistically defined in a group of 249 children (Skrandies, Jpn Psychol Res 53: 65-76, 2011). We investigated electrical brain activity in 19 healthy children with normal intelligence and reading skills between 11 and 15 years of age. Words that belonged to different semantic classes were presented at random on a monitor, and EEG was measured from 30 channels. Evoked potentials were computed offline for each semantic class. In the ERP data we observed significant effects of word class on component latency, field strength and topography. Similar as with adult subjects such effects occurred at small latency of about 115 ms after word presentation. The language-evoked components in children were similar but not identical to those reported previously for various groups of adults. Our data show that visually evoked brain activity is modulated by connotative meaning of the stimuli at early processing stages not only in adults but also in children.

The ERP results revealed that while adults showed a late positive potential (LPP) to emotional expressions that was enhanced to pain expressions, reflecting increased evaluation and emotional arousal to pain expressions, infants showed a negative component (Nc) to emotional expressions that was enhanced to angry expressions, reflecting increased allocation of attention to angry faces. Moreover, infants and adults showed opposite patterns in their frontal asymmetry responses to pain and anger, suggesting developmental differences in the motivational processes engendered by these facial expressions. These findings are discussed in the light of associated individual differences in infant temperament and adult dispositional empathy.

The Neural Dynamics of Face Detection in the Wild Revealed by MVPA	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRIAL EEG DYNAMICS; TIME-COURSE; SINGLE-TRIAL; HUMAN BRAIN; OBJECT; N170; PERCEPTION; ERP; SPEED; INFORMATION	Previous magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG) studies have suggested that face processing is extremely rapid, indeed faster than any other object category. Most studies, however, have been performed using centered, cropped stimuli presented on a blank background resulting in artificially low interstimulus variability. In contrast, the aim of the present study was to assess the underlying temporal dynamics of face detection presented in complex natural scenes. We recorded EEG activity while participants performed a rapid go/no-go categorization task in which they had to detect the presence of a human face. Subjects performed at ceiling (94.8% accuracy), and traditional event-related potential analyses revealed only modest modulations of the two main components classically associated with face processing (P100 and N170). A multivariate pattern analysis conducted across all EEG channels revealed that face category could, however, be readout very early, under 100 ms poststimulus onset. Decoding was linked to reaction time as early as 125 ms. Decoding accuracy did not increase monotonically; we report an increase during an initial 95-140 ms period followed by a plateau similar to 140 -185 ms-perhaps reflecting a transitory stabilization of the face information available-and a strong increase afterward. Further analyses conducted on individual images confirmed these phases, further suggesting that decoding accuracy may be initially driven by low-level stimulus properties. Such latencies appear to be surprisingly short given the complexity of the natural scenes and the large intraclass variability of the face stimuli used, suggesting that the visual system is highly optimized for the processing of natural scenes.

While EEG has a high temporal resolution, yet a low spatial resolution, MRI has the complete opposite, a high spatial resolution, yet a low temporal resolution. Obviously therefore, researchers have been searching for ways combining the two methodologies, for more than two decades. However, there are many issues that have to be solved before the methodologies can be successfully and, more importantly reliably, combined. Here, we give an overview of these issues, and present strategies that have been used over the past two decades to overcome them. We start with a general description of EEG and (f)MRI methodology, then present the difficulties involved in combining both methodologies, and lastly present and discuss the most popular strategies that have been used over the past two decades to solve these problems. We conclude that in spite of the many issues, the two methodologies can be combined successfully, provided that the correct procedures are followed.

Design: The raw EEG data were collected using a 64-channel system from 10 healthy adult subjects with normal hearing. The fricative stimuli were digitally edited versions of naturally produced syllables, /sa/ and /integral a/. The evoked responses were derived in unaided and aided conditions by using an alternating block design with a passive listening task. Peak latencies and amplitudes of the P1-N1-P2 components and the N1' and P2" peaks of the acoustic change complex (ACC) were analyzed. Results: The evoked N1 and N1' responses to the fricative sounds significantly differed in the unaided condition. The fricative contrast also elicited distinct N1-P2 responses in the aided condition. While the aided condition increased and delayed the N1 and ACC responses, significant differences in the P1-N1-P2 and ACC components were still observed, which would support fricative contrast perception at the cortical level. Conclusion: Despite significant alterations in the ERP responses by the aided condition, normal-hearing adult listeners showed distinct neural coding patterns for the voiceless fricative contrast, "s" and "sh," with or without a hearing aid.

Correction of the pulse artefact (PA) is a significant challenge since its amplitude is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field in which EEG is recorded. New method: We conducted a study in which different PA correction methods were applied to EEG data recorded inside a 9.4T scanner in order to retrieve visual P100 and auditory P300 evoked potentials. We explored different PA reduction methods, including the optimal basis set (OBS) method as well as objective and subjective component rejection using independent component analysis (ICA). Results: ICA followed by objective rejection of components is optimal for retrieving visual P100 and auditory P300 from EEG data recorded inside the scanner. Comparison with existing methods: Previous studies suggest that OBS or OBS followed by ICA are optimal for retrieving evoked potentials at 3 T. In our EEG data recorded at 9.4T OBS performed alone was not fully optimal for the identification of evoked potentials. OBS followed by ICA was partially effective. Conclusions: In this study ICA has been shown to be an important tool for correcting the PA in EEG data recorded at 9.4T, particularly when automated rejection of components is performed.

Supervised spatial filtering methods that enhance the discriminative information in EEG data are commonly used to improve single-trial ERP detection. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN is compared with three common classifiers: 1) Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; 2) multilayer perceptron (MLP); and 3) support vector machines. Prior to classification, the data were spatially filtered with xDAWN (for the maximization of the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio), common spatial pattern, or not spatially filtered. The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier. In addition, the nonlinear classifier MLP outperformed the linear methods. Finally, training based AUC maximization provided better performance than training based on the minimization of the mean square error. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the systems architecture is critical and both spatial filtering and classification must be considered together.

However, objective and quantitative outcome measures assessing cognitive workload have not been standardized for HMI research. The present study examines the efficacy of a simple event-related potential (ERP) measure of cortical effort during myoelectric control of a virtual limb for use as an outcome tool. Participants trained and tested on two methods of control, direct control (DC) and pattern recognition control (PRC), while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. Eighteen healthy participants with intact limbs were tested using DC and PRC under three conditions: passive viewing, easy, and hard. Novel auditory probes were presented at random intervals during testing, and significant task-difficulty effects were observed in the P200, P300, and a late positive potential (LPP), supporting the efficacy of ERPs as a cognitive workload measure in HMI tasks. LPP amplitude distinguished DC from PRC in the hard condition with higher amplitude in PRC, consistent with lower cognitive workload in PRC relative to DC for complex movements. Participants completed trials faster in the easy condition using DC relative to PRC, but completed trials more slowly using DC relative to PRC in the hard condition. The results provide promising support for ERPs as an outcome measure for cognitive workload in HMI research such as prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive devices, and can be used to evaluate and guide new technologies for more intuitive HMI control.

The 'standard hypothesis' postulates a fast but coarse screening of the stimulus valence in subcortical regions, the amygdala in particular, followed by a precise, cortically driven analysis. Recent electrophysiological studies reported differential effects of conditioned faces in prefrontal regions as early as 60-80 ms after target onset, suggesting considerably faster cortical processing than traditionally assumed. Evidence for rapid prefrontal evaluation was provided specifically for complex and evolutionarily significant stimuli, i.e. faces. Here we used simple gratings in a conditioning paradigm, testing the generalization of these results. Event-related potentials and source reconstruction identified rapid (60-80 ms) enhanced processing of affectively conditioned gratings in occipital as well as prefrontal areas. Our results support the assumption of a general fast feed-forward sweep of information, partially activating an interconnected network of affective processing encompassing sensory, subcortical and prefrontal cortex regions.

Does electroencephalogram phase variability account for reduced P3 brain potential in externalizing disorders?	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potential; Externalizing; P3; Phase-locking; Substance use; Theta	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTIC-INTERVIEW; PSYCHIATRIC-DIAGNOSIS; RISK MARKERS; AMPLITUDE; EEG; THETA; DELTA	Objective: Amplitude deficits of the P3 event-related potential (ERP) are associated with externalizing psychopathology but little is known about the nature of underlying brain electrical activity that accounts for this amplitude reduction. We sought to understand if group differences in task-induced phase-locking in electroencephalographic (EEG) delta and theta frequencies may account for P3-externalizing associations. Methods: Adult males (N = 410) completed a visual oddball task and frontal and parietal P3-related delta- and theta-band phase-invariant evoked energy and inter-trial phase-locking measures were investigated with respect to the externalizing spectrum, including substance dependence, adult antisociality, and childhood disruptive disorders. We hypothesized that P3-related phase-locking is weaker in externalizing-diagnosed individuals and this might mediate prior findings of reduced evoked P3 energy. Results: Reductions in both evoked energy and phase-locking, in both frequency bands, at both scalp sites, were associated with greater odds of externalizing diagnoses. Generally, adding phase-locking to evoked energy came with better prediction model fit. Moreover, reduced theta-band phase-locking partially mediated the effects of within-frequency evoked energy on externalizing prediction. Conclusions: Inter-trial phase-locking underlying P3 appears to be an important distinction between externalizing and control subjects. Significance: This cross-trial phase-variability for externalizing-diagnosed individuals might reflect deficient top-down "tuning'' by neuromodulatory systems.

The task required determining if a particular object could be retrieved when two visual words representing object features were presented. Both age groups had comparable accuracy although response times were longer in older adults. In both groups a left fronto-temporal negative potential occurred at around 750 ms during object retrieval, consistent with previous findings (Brier, Maguire, Tillman, Hart, & Kraut, 2008). In only older adults, a later positive frontal potential was found peaking between 800 and 1000 ms during no retrieval. These findings suggest younger and older adults employ comparable neural mechanisms when features clearly facilitate retrieval of an object memory, but when features yield no retrieval, older adults use additional neural resources to engage in a more effortful and exhaustive search prior to making a decision.

Despite widespread use in the investigation of emotional perception, expressive face and evocative scene stimuli are rarely assessed in the same experiment. Here, we evaluated self-reports of arousal and pleasantness, as well as early and late event-related potentials (e.g., N170, early posterior negativity [EPN], late positive potential [LPP]) as subjects viewed neutral and emotional faces and scenes, including contents representing anger, fear, and joy. Results demonstrate that emotional scenes were rated as more evocative than emotional faces, as only scenes produced elevated self-reports of arousal. In addition, viewing scenes resulted in more extreme ratings of pleasantness (and unpleasantness) than did faces. EEG results indicate that both expressive faces and emotional scenes evoke enhanced negativity in the N170 component, while the EPN and LPP components show significantly enhanced modulation only by scene, relative to face stimuli. These data suggest that viewing emotional scenes results in a more pronounced emotional experience that is associated with reliable modulation of visual event-related potentials that are implicated in emotional circuits in the brain.

The first aim is to investigate the effect of correct and incorrect responses that are obtained under Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) on event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The second aim is to test error negativity and error positivity models which developed to explore relationships between WCST and ERPs. The sample consisted of 30 university students (21 female, 9 male) aged 19-24 years. Computerized version of WCST was used. Stimulus presentation, recording, storage, and analysis were carried out using a 32 channel EEG/EP NeuroScan system. Amplitude and latency values for N1, N2, P2 and P3, peaks were investigated under three electrode locations (Fz, Cz, and Pz) and under correct and incorrect responses, separately. Behavioral results showed that duration for incorrect responses were higher than correct responses, on the other hand amount of correct responses were higher than incorrect responses. These results indicated that computerized version of the WCST has acceptable psychometric properties. Variance analyses for repeated measure design showed that response type main effect was significant on N2 latency, NI and N2 amplitude. Electrode location main effect was significant on latency and amplitude of NI. N2; amplitude of P2 and latency of P3. In addition the interaction effect was significant on latency and amplitude of N1, N2, and P2, and also P3 latency. Results exposed correct and incorrect responses which were obtained under WCST leads N2-P3 peaks form. It was concluded that early ERP components might be related to response, on the other hand late ERP components might be related to response evaluation process.

Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics underlying the perception of four basic emotions from complex scenes varying in valence and arousal (fear, disgust, happiness and sadness) with the millisecond time resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potentials were computed and each emotion showed a specific temporal profile, as revealed by distinct time segments of significant differences from the neutral scenes. Fear perception elicited significant activity at the earliest time segments, followed by disgust, happiness and sadness. Moreover, fear, disgust and happiness were characterized by two time segments of significant activity, whereas sadness showed only one long-latency time segment of activity. Multidimensional scaling was used to assess the correspondence between neural temporal dynamics and the subjective experience elicited by the four emotions in a subsequent behavioral task. We found a high coherence between these two classes of data, indicating that psychological categories defining emotions have a close correspondence at the brain level in terms of neural temporal dynamics. Finally, we localized the brain regions of time-dependent activity for each emotion and time segment with the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Fear and disgust showed widely distributed activations, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Happiness activated a number of areas mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas sadness showed a limited number of active areas at late latency. The present findings indicate that the neural signature of basic emotions can emerge as the byproduct of dynamic spatiotemporal brain networks as investigated with millisecond-range resolution, rather than in time-independent areas involved uniquely in the processing one specific emotion.

Frequency characteristics of cortical activity associated with perturbations to upright stability	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Phase resetting; Perturbation-evoked potential; Balance	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BALANCE REACTIONS; EEG; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; THETA; GENERATION; DYNAMICS; RESET	Cortical evoked potentials are evident in the control of whole-body balance reactions in response to transient instability. The focus of this work is VS continue to advance understanding of the potential cortical contributions to bipedal balance control. Temporally unpredictable postural perturbations evoke a negative potential (N1), which has drawn parallels to error-related negativity (ERN) as well as visual and auditory evoked N1 responses. The mechanism underlying the generation of event-related potentials (ERPs) has been a matter of debate for the past few decades. While the evoked model proposes that ERPs are generated by the addition of fixed latency and fixed polarity responses, the phase reorganization model suggests that ERPs are the result of stimulus-induced phase reorganization of the ongoing oscillations. Previous studies have suggested phase reorganization as a possible mechanism in auditory N1, visual N1 and error-related negativity (ERN). The purpose of the current study was to explore the frequency characteristics of the cortical responses to whole-body balance perturbations. Perturbations were evoked using a lean and release protocol. The results revealed a significant power increase and phase-locking of delta, theta, alpha, and beta band activity during perturbation-evoked NI. This may suggest that the stimulus-induced phase reorganization of the ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could account for the features of cortical ERPs in response to perturbation of upright stability.

Effect size estimates were computed from mean P300 latency measurements at midline electrodes between patients and unaffected controls using the random effects restricted maximum likelihood model. The effects of clinical and ERP/EEG methological variables were assessed in a moderator analysis. P300 latency was found to be significantly prolonged in patients with AD (and MCI) compared to unaffected controls. Shortened P300 latencies were observed when comparing patients with MCI to patients with AD. Clinically relevant differences in P300 latency effect sizes were associated with mean age, interstimulus interval, stimulus difference, target frequency, reference electrode, and sampling rate. The meta-analytic findings provide robust statistical evidence for the use of the auditory P300 latency subcomponent as a biological marker of prodromal AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the electrical activity of the brain is studied using Electroencephalogram (EEG). The data obtained was then decomposed using three methods; Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Bivariate EMD and finally Ensemble EMD. The Index of Orthogonatility (IO) was obtained which shows EMD performed the most poorly, EEMD the best and Bivariate in between. The performance of EMD greatly improves when the number of samples was greatly decreased and very high peaks and more complex parts of the signal were excluded in the analysis. Segmentation was also conducted and the segmentation error revealed when an Event Related Potential (ERP) has happened which is when apnea occurred.

Due to the portability and relative inexpensiveness of electroencephalography, the N400 event-related potential component has been proposed as a clinically valid means to identify preserved linguistic function in non-communicative patients. Across three experiments, we show that changes in both stimuli and task demands significantly influence the probability of detecting statistically significant N400 effects - that is, the difference in N400 amplitudes caused by the experimental manipulation. In terms of task demands, passively heard linguistic stimuli were significantly less likely to elicit N400 effects than task-relevant stimuli. Due to the inability of the majority of patients with disorders of consciousness to follow task commands, the insensitivity of passive listening would impede the identification of residual language abilities even when such abilities exist. In terms of stimuli, passively heard normatively associated word pairs produced the highest detection rate of N400 effects (50% of the participants), compared with semantically-similar word pairs (0%) and high-cloze sentences (17%). This result is consistent with a prediction error account of N400 magnitude, with highly predictable targets leading to smaller N400 waves, and therefore larger N400 effects. Overall, our data indicate that non-repeating normatively associated word pairs provide the highest probability of detecting single-subject N400s during passive listening, and may thereby provide a clinically viable means of assessing residual linguistic function. We also show that more liberal analyses may further increase the detection-rate, but at the potential cost of increased false alarms. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Physical plausibility of the spatial-kinematic relationship of human movement may play a major role in the top-down processing of human motion recognition. Here, we investigated the time course of scalp activation during observation of human gait in order to extract and use it on future integrated brain-computer interface using virtual reality (VR). We analyzed event related potentials (ERP), the event related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and the inter-trial coherence (ITC) from high-density EEG recording during video display onset (-200-600 ms) and the steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) inside the video of human walking 3D-animation in three conditions: Normal; Upside-down (inverted images); and Uncoordinated (pseudo-randomly mixed images). We found that early visual evoked response P120 was decreased in Upside-down condition. The N170 and P300b amplitudes were decreased in Uncoordinated condition. In Upside-down and Uncoordinated conditions, we found decreased alpha power and theta phase-locking. As regards gamma oscillation, power was increased during the Upside-down animation and decreased during the Uncoordinated animation. An SSVEP-like response oscillating at about 10 Hz was also described showing that the oscillating pattern is enhanced 300ms after the heel strike event only in the Normal but not in the Upside-down condition. Our results are consistent with most of previous point-light display studies, further supporting possible use of virtual reality for neurofeedback applications.

However, the exact temporal sequence of deficits of cortical biological motion processing in ASD has not been studied to date. We used 64-channel electroencephalography to study event-related potentials associated with human motion perception in 17 children and adolescents with ASD and 21 typical controls. A spatio-temporal source analysis was performed to assess the brain structures involved in these processes. We expected altered activity already during early stimulus processing and reduced activity during subsequent biological motion specific processes in ASD. In response to both, random and biological motion, the P100 amplitude was decreased suggesting unspecific deficits in visual processing, and the occipito-temporal N200 showed atypical lateralization in ASD suggesting altered hemispheric specialization. A slow positive deflection after 400 ms, reflecting top-down processes, and human motion-specific dipole activation differed slightly between groups, with reduced and more diffuse activation in the ASD-group. The latter could be an indicator of a disrupted neuronal network for biological motion processing in ADS. Furthermore, early visual processing (P100) seems to be correlated to biological motion-specific activation. This emphasizes the relevance of early sensory processing for higher order processing deficits in ASD.

In order to clarify the spatiotemporal characteristics of these deficits, a simultaneous EEG/functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed. Single-trial coupling was used to integrate temporal EEG information in the fMRI analyses and to correlate the trial by trial variation in the different event-related potential amplitudes with fMRI BOLD responses. The results demonstrated that during voluntary selection early electrophysiological responses (N2) were associated with responses in similar brain regions in healthy participants as well as in ADHD patients, e.g., in the medial-frontal cortex and the inferior parietal gyrus. However, ADHD patients presented significantly reduced N2-related BOLD responses compared to healthy controls especially in frontal areas. These results support the hypothesis that in ADHD patients executive deficits are accompanied by early dysfunctions, especially in frontal brain areas.

However, traditional malingering measures are known to be vulnerable to both manipulation and coaching. Consequently, recent research has attempted to identify physiological indices of cognitive functioning that are less susceptible to overt manipulation. While prior studies have explored the validity of physiological assessment of memory deficits, this study evaluates the effectiveness of a physiological measure of executive functioning. This study used EEG recording in conjunction with a three-stimulus oddball design to compare neural responses in simulated malingerers feigning cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and controls. Specifically, the study explored the efficacy of an event-related potential (ERP) known as P3a, which is believed to be an index of frontal lobe executive processes, specifically the attentional orienting response. The results of this study demonstrated that simulated malingerers did not produce a P3a response that was significantly different from control participants. Furthermore, the P3a in simulated malingerers did not demonstrate any of the properties reported in prior studies with TBI patients. Not only were malingerers unable to produce a significant change in their basic orienting response, but the very process of attempting to employ additional strategies to appear impaired produced other physiological markers of deception. Therefore, the P3a component appeared to be unaffected by an individual's motivation or overt performance, which suggests that it may have potential for development as a physiological measure for differentiating between malingerers and those with genuine TBI.

J	Kato, K; Miura, O				Kato, Kazuo; Miura, Osamu			Oscillatory neural activity associated with cognitive processes affected by spatial frequency	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						addition task; ERD/ERS; oscillatory neural activity; spatial frequency	ERP; SYNCHRONIZATION	The spatial frequency contained in visual objects is known to affect human psychophysiology. In our previous study, we showed that event-related potentials are affected by spatial frequency during a simple calculation task. In that study, however, we did not investigate the contribution of oscillatory neural activities. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the changes in oscillatory neural activity associated with cognitive processes, and to investigate how these signals are affected by the spatial frequency of a visual stimulus during simple calculation tasks. We investigate these issues by analyzing our previously collected electroencephalography (EEG) dataset using the same visual stimulus, tasks, subjects, and EEG recordings. In that study, four types of vertically striped visual stimuli were used. The visual stimuli contained embedded numbers (from 0 to 9) that possessed the following frequency (f) characteristics: white noise, 1/f, 1/f(2), and 1/f(3). The subjects were instructed to perform two tasks: 'add numbers' (addition task) and 'do not add numbers' (reference task). EEG data were recorded, and event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) for each visual stimulus were analyzed on the basis of the intertrial variances of wavelet coefficients for theta, alpha, low-beta, and gamma band activity. Eight healthy men (21-23 years) were recruited to participate in the study. Our results suggest the presence of a frequency discrimination function in the theta band activity in the fronto-central area at the latency of 198 ms during the addition task. The alpha-band ERD during completion of the reference task also showed a spatial frequency dependency. This phenomenon was observed in the left temporal-parietal area at a latency of 376 ms, and is thought to be related to the perceptual filter. We conclude that the observed changes in oscillatory neural activity associated with cognitive processes are affected by spatial frequency. (c) 2014 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Alterations in Early and Late Visually Evoked EEG Potentials in Asperger Observers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ATTENTION; QUOTIENT; P300; RECOGNITION; DISORDERS; CHILDREN; BRAIN	Background: Asperger Autism is a lifelong psychiatric condition with highly circumscribed interests and routines, problems in social cognition, verbal and nonverbal communication, and also perceptual abnormalities with sensory hypersensitivity. To objectify both lower-level visual and cognitive alterations we looked for differences in visual event-related potentials (EEG) between Asperger observers and matched controls while they observed simple checkerboard stimuli. Methods: In a balanced oddball paradigm checkerboards of two checksizes (0.6 degrees and 1.2 degrees) were presented with different frequencies. Participants counted the occurrence times of the rare fine or rare coarse checkerboards in different experimental conditions. We focused on early visual ERP differences as a function of checkerboard size and the classical P3b ERP component as an indicator of cognitive processing. Results: We found an early (100-200 ms after stimulus onset) occipital ERP effect of checkerboard size (dominant spatial frequency). This effect was weaker in the Asperger than in the control observers. Further a typical parietal/central oddball-P3b occurred at 500 ms with the rare checkerboards. The P3b showed a right-hemispheric lateralization, which was more prominent in Asperger than in control observers. Discussion: The difference in the early occipital ERP effect between the two groups may be a physiological marker of differences in the processing of small visual details in Asperger observers compared to normal controls. The stronger lateralization of the P3b in Asperger observers may indicate a stronger involvement of the right-hemispheric network of bottom-up attention. The lateralization of the P3b signal might be a compensatory consequence of the compromised early checksize effect. Higher-level analytical information processing units may need to compensate for difficulties in low-level signal analysis.

Research examining changes in nontarget P300 related to nontarget-to-nontarget interval (NNI) or sequential probability manipulations has produced inconsistent results, with some studies reporting no enhancement in nontarget P300 and others finding response profiles analogous to TTI effects. Our aim was to clarify these differences. All participants completed a specially designed auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task with manipulations of TTI and NNI while their EEG activity was recorded. P300 amplitudes were extracted using temporal PCA with Varimax rotation. P3b to targets and nontargets increased systematically as respective TTIs/NNIs increased, but this change did not differ between stimulus types. The Slow Wave did not show any effect of interval, but was more positive to targets than nontargets when interval was collapsed. P3b findings show that matching-stimulus interval effects are not restricted to targets, but discrepancies relative to previous research suggest that NNI effects in P3b may depend on additional processing of nontarget stimuli.

However, there is no previous study analyzing the delta responses in euthymic medication-free patients with bipolar disorder. Participants comprised of 22 euthymic medication-free patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar disorder and 21 healthy controls who were matched to the patients for sex, age, and education. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded at 30 electrode sites using an application of an auditory oddball paradigm. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-3.5 Hz) were measured. There was a significant inter-group difference in evoked and event-related delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) responses. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the event-related delta oscillatory responses of the bipolar patient group were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group over the temporo-parietal and occipital electrode sites. Euthymic bipolar patients showed reduced event-related delta oscillatory responses in comparison to healthy subjects under cognitive load. The decrease of delta oscillations may be a common phenomenon that can be observed in different neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive dysfunction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, saccadic dysfunctions in HD may be seen as a result of dysfunctional processes occurring at the oculomotor level prior to the execution of saccades, i.e., at a pre- saccadic level. Virtually nothing is known about possible changes in pre-saccadic processes in HD. Objective: This study examines pre-saccadic processing in pre-manifest HD gene mutation carriers (pre-HDs) by using clinically available EEG measures. Methods: Error rates, pre- saccadic EEG potentials and saccade onset EEG potentials were measured in 14 pre-HDs and case-matched controls performing prosaccades and antisaccades in a longitudinal study over a 15-month period. Results: The results show that pre-saccadic potentials were changed in pre-HDs, relative to controls and also revealed changes across the 15-month longitudinal period. In particular, pre- saccadic ERP in pre-HDs were characterized by lower amplitudes and longer latencies, which revealed longitudinal changes. These changes were observed for anti-saccades, but not for pro-saccades. Overt saccadic trajectories (potentials) were not different to those in controls, showing that pre- saccadic processes are sensitive to subtle changes in fronto-striatal networks in pre-HDs. Conclusions: Deficits in pre- saccadic processes prior the execution of an erroneous anti-saccade can be seen as an effect of dysfunctional cognitive control in HD. This may underlie saccadic abnormalities and hence a major phenotype of HD. Pre-saccadic EEG potentials preceding erroneous anti-saccades are sensitive to pre- manifest disease progression in HD.

The motor cost of telling lies: Electrocortical signatures and personality foundations of spontaneous deception	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Deception; Lying; Moral decision-making; Individual differences; Motor readiness	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; DETECTING DECEPTION; EXECUTIVE PROCESSES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MORAL COGNITION; P300 AMPLITUDE	Although universal, lying is generally considered immoral behavior. Most neuroscience studies on lying sanction or instruct deceptive behaviors and thus might fail to acknowledge the significance of lie-related moral conflicts. By combining electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with a novel paradigm in which participants decided freely whether to deceive another person, we have generated indices of the cognitive (reaction times and stimulus-locked event-related components) and moral (readiness potential and its correlations with deception-related personality traits) cost of spontaneous deception. Our data fail to support the consensus that deception is cognitively more demanding than truth telling, suggesting that spontaneous deception, as opposed to lying out of requirement, might not mandate additional cognitive workload. Interestingly, lying was associated with decreased motor readiness, an event-related potential (ERP) component that is linked to motor preparation of self-determined actions and modulated when we face moral dilemmas. Notably, this reduction was less extensive in manipulative participants and greater in those who cared highly about their impression management. Our study expands on previous findings on deception by associating a cortical marker of reduced preparation to act with individual differences in moral cognition.

To gain an insight into the neurobiological processes linked to facial affect recognition, we investigated both induced and evoked oscillatory activity by calculating the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and the Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) during facial affect recognition. Fearful and neutral faces as well as nonface patches were presented to 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls while EEG was recorded. The participants' task was to recognize facial expressions. Because previous findings with healthy controls showed that facial feature decoding was associated primarily with oscillatory activity in the theta band, we analyzed ERSP and ITC in this frequency band in the time interval of 140-200 ms, which corresponds to the N170 component. Event-related theta activity and phase-locking to facial expressions, but not to nonface patches, predicted emotion recognition performance in both controls and patients. Event-related changes in theta amplitude and phase-locking were found to be significantly weaker in patients compared with healthy controls, which is in line with previous investigations showing decreased neural synchronization in the low frequency bands in patients with schizophrenia. Neural synchrony is thought to underlie distributed information processing. Our results indicate a less effective functioning in the recognition process of facial features, which may contribute to a less effective social cognition in schizophrenia.

J	Lopez-Larraz, E; Montesano, L; Gil-Agudo, A; Minguez, J				Lopez-Larraz, Eduardo; Montesano, Luis; Gil-Agudo, Angel; Minguez, Javier			Continuous decoding of movement intention of upper limb self-initiated analytic movements from pre-movement EEG correlates	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Brain-machine interfaces; Event-related desynchronization; Motor-related cortical potentials; Analytic movements; Motor rehabilitation; Spinal cord injury; Automatic feature selection	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; SINGLE-TRIAL CLASSIFICATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; FOOT MOVEMENTS; POTENTIALS; INTERFACE; STROKE; HAND; REHABILITATION; SYNCHRONIZATION	Background: Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) have recently been integrated within motor rehabilitation therapies by actively involving the central nervous system (CNS) within the exercises. For instance, the online decoding of intention of motion of a limb from pre-movement EEG correlates is being used to convert passive rehabilitation strategies into active ones mediated by robotics. As early stages of upper limb motor rehabilitation usually focus on analytic single-joint mobilizations, this paper investigates the feasibility of building BMI decoders for these specific types of movements. Methods: Two different experiments were performed within this study. For the first one, six healthy subjects performed seven self-initiated upper-limb analytic movements, involving from proximal to distal articulations. For the second experiment, three spinal cord injury patients performed two of the previously studied movements with their healthy elbow and paralyzed wrist. In both cases EEG neural correlates such as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) were analyzed, as well as the accuracies of continuous decoders built using the pre-movement features of these correlates (i.e., the intention of motion was decoded before movement onset). Results: The studied movements could be decoded in both healthy subjects and patients. For healthy subjects there were significant differences in the EEG correlates and decoding accuracies, dependent on the moving joint. Percentages of correctly anticipated trials ranged from 75% to 40% (with chance level being around 20%), with better performances for proximal than for distal movements. For the movements studied for the SCI patients the accuracies were similar to the ones of the healthy subjects. Conclusions: This paper shows how it is possible to build continuous decoders to detect movement intention from EEG correlates for seven different upper-limb analytic movements. Furthermore we report differences in accuracies among movements, which might have an impact on the design of the rehabilitation technologies that will integrate this new type of information. The applicability of the decoders was shown in a clinical population, with similar performances between healthy subjects and patients.

Therefore, there is a critical need to understand how users perceive and respond to information security risks. Previous research on perceptions of information security risk has chiefly relied on self-reported measures. Although these studies are valuable, risk perceptions are often associated with feelings-such as fear or doubt-that are difficult to measure accurately using survey instruments. Additionally, it is unclear how these self-reported measures map to actual security behavior. This paper contributes to this topic by demonstrating that risk-taking behavior is effectively predicted using electroencephalography (EEG) via event-related potentials (ERPs). Using the Iowa Gambling Task, a widely used technique shown to be correlated with real-world risky behaviors, we show that the differences in neural responses to positive and negative feedback strongly predict users' information security behavior in a separate laboratory-based computing task. In addition, we compare the predictive validity of EEG measures to that of self-reported measures of information security risk perceptions. Our experiments show that self-reported measures are ineffective in predicting security behaviors under a condition in which information security is not salient. However, we show that, when security concerns become salient, self-reported measures do predict security behavior. Interestingly, EEG measures significantly predict behavior in both salient and non-salient conditions, which indicates that EEG measures are a robust predictor of security behavior.

Continuous Wavelet Application for the Assessment of Neural Potential Interaction during Time Discrimination Task	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION	The aim of the paper is to assess the interaction of the neural potentials during a time discrimination psychoacoustic task. Ten subjects participated in the experiment and were asked about the equality of two acoustic pulses: one reference of 500ms and one trial that varied from 420ms to 620ms. During the experimental procedure, Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Event Related Potential (ERP) signals were recorded. The analysis combines results from Continuous Wavelet signal processing and subjects responses which were analyzed based on psychoacoustic theory. The Wavelet Coherence metric index is employed to assess the interaction of neural potentials. The results indicate the points at which the duration of the trial pulse is equal to 560ms and 460ms as the minimum and maximum of the Wavelet Coherence metric index, respectively. This observation is valid in most electrodes, for all basic EEG rhythms, revealing in parallel the differentiation of the gamma rhythm, in relation to the others. These maximum and minimum values are correlated to the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in pulses duration, calculated by the psychoacoustic analysis.

To exemplify this, we construct an experimental EEG-ERP set-up with an interactive narrative that considers the dialectical relation between suspense and surprise as a function of expectancy, which in turn can be correlated to the P300-ERP component. We address the difficulties of designing a coherent narrative with a suitable level of closure while meeting the requirements of the ERP experimental procedures. We stress the necessity of fine-tuning the highly specific ERP paradigms necessary for the investigation of user experience in interactive narratives and storytelling.

Distinguishing lexical- versus discourse-level processing using event-related potentials	MEMORY & COGNITION			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Neurolinguistics; Co-reference; N400s; P600s	BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; REPETITION; SENTENCE; N400; COREFERENCE; CONTEXT; INTEGRATION; MODULATION	Two experiments examine the links between neural patterns in EEG (e.g., N400s, P600s) and their corresponding cognitive processes (e.g., lexical access, discourse integration) by varying the lexical and syntactic contexts of co-referential expressions. Experiment 1 examined coreferring expressions when they occurred within the same clause as their antecedents (John/Bill warmly dressed John). Experiment 2 examined between-clause co-referencing with expressions that also varied in lexical frequency (John/Weston went to the store so that John/Weston could buy milk). Evidence of facilitated lexical processing occurred after repeated names, which elicited smaller N400s, as compared with new names. N400s were also attenuated to a greater degree for low-frequency expressions than for high-frequency ones. Repeated names also triggered evidence of postlexical processing, but this emerged as larger P600s for within-clause co-referencing and delayed N400s for between-clause co-referencing. Together, these results suggest that linguistic processes can be distinguished through distinct ERP components or distinct temporal patterns.

The proposed method is based on two steps: (i) tensor decomposition for underdetermined source separation and (ii) signal extraction by Kalman filtering to recover the source dynamics. A tensor is constructed for each source by synchronizing on the "event" period of the corresponding signal and stacking different periods along the second dimension of the tensor. To cope with the interference from other sources that impede on the extraction of weak signals, two robust tensor decomposition methods are proposed and compared. Then, the state parameters used within a nonlinear dynamic model for the extraction of event-related sources from noisy mixtures are estimated from the loading matrices provided by the first step. The influence of different parameters on the robustness to outliers of the proposed method is examined by numerical simulations. Applied to clinical electroencephalogram (EEG), ECG and magnetocardiogram (MCG), the proposed method exhibits a significantly higher performance in terms of expected signal shape than classical source separation methods such as pi CA and FastICA.

Recent behavioral studies suggest, however, that emotional stimulus processing is critically dependent on attention toward emotional stimulus features. We set out to test this hypothesis using EEG measurements and a modified oddball paradigm. Unexpected emotional stimuli evoked amplitude variations of the P3a (an ERP marker of attention orienting) when attention was directed to emotional stimulus properties but not when non-emotional stimulus properties were attended to. We conclude that emotional stimulus processing is not unconditional, but dependent on top-down attentional control.

Methods: We investigated risk assessment and reward processing in 12 healthy male occasional gamblers (OG) and in 12 male problem gamblers (PG) with a combined EEG and fMRI approach to identify group-differences in successively activated brain regions during two stages within a quasi-realistic blackjack game. Results: Both groups did not differ in reaction times but event-related potentials in PG and OG produced significantly different amplitudes in middle and late time-windows during high-risk vs. low-risk decisions. Applying an fMRI-constrained regional source model during risk assessment resulted in larger source moments in PG in the high-risk vs. low-risk comparison in thalamic, orbitofrontal and superior frontal activations within the 600-800 ms time window. During reward processing, PG showed a trend to enhanced negativity in an early time window (100-150 ms) potentially related to higher rostral anterior cingulate activity and a trend to centro-parietal group-differences in a later time window (390-440 ms) accompanied by increased superior-frontal (i.e., premotor-related) source moments in PG vs. OG. Conclusions: We suggest that problem gambling is characterized by stronger cue-related craving during risk assessment. Reward processing is associated with early affective modulation followed by increased action preparation for ongoing gambling in PG.

Genetic Feature Selection for a P300 Brain Computer Interface	VI LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (CLAIB 2014)	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Latin American Biomedical Engineering Conference (CLAIB)	OCT 29-31, 2014	Parana, ARGENTINA	Reg Council Biomed Engn Latin America, Argentine Soc Bioengineering, Nacl Univ Entre Rios, Engn Sch, Int Federat Med & Biol Engn, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc		Brain Computer Interface; Features Selection; Genetic Algorithms; Fisher's Discriminant Analysis; P300		A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides a direct form of communication between a person and the outside world using brain signals, either to increase his/her integration in society or to provide a way to control the environment where he/she lives. BCIs are communication systems based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, such as event-related evoked potentials (ERP). P300 is one of there ERP. It is a peak that usually appears in the EEG signals around 300 ms in response to an infrequent stimulus. The BCI based on P300 is usually composed by different blocks: input (data acquisition), feature selection/extraction, classification, output (e. g. control commands) and, eventually, feedback. In this work, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed as a feature selection method before the classification stage, implemented using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). A dataset of input patterns was generated from a database of EEG recordings of healthy people, in order to train and test the proposed configuration. The addition of the GA as a feature selection method resulted in a significant improvement in classification performance (p < 0.001) and in a reduction of the amount of features needed to reach such performance (p < 0.001). The results of this work suggest that this configuration could be implemented in a portable BCI.	[Atum, Y. V.; Acevedo, R. C.] UNER, Fac Ingn, LIRINS, Oro Verde, Argentina; [Manresa, J. A.

Beauty is in the ease of the beholding: A neurophysiological test of the averageness theory of facial attractiveness	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Facial attractiveness; Averaging; Event-related potentials; Visual cortex	HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUSIFORM FACE AREA; TRIAL EEG DYNAMICS; EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY; INFANT PREFERENCES; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; OBJECT; RECOGNITION; SYMMETRY	Hundreds of studies have shown that people prefer attractive over unattractive faces. But what is an attractive face, and why is it preferred? Averageness theory claims that faces are perceived as being attractive when their facial configuration approximates the mathematical average facial configuration of the population. Conversely, faces that deviate from this average configuration are perceived as being unattractive. The theory predicts that both attractive and mathematically averaged faces should be processed more fluently than unattractive faces, whereas the averaged faces should be processed marginally more fluently than the attractive faces. We compared neurocognitive and behavioral responses to attractive, unattractive, and averaged human faces to test these predictions. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction times (RTs) from 48 adults while they discriminated between human and chimpanzee faces. The participants categorized averaged and high-attractive faces as being "human" faster than low-attractive faces. The posterior N170 (150-225 ms) face-evoked ERP component was smaller in response to high-attractive and averaged faces than to low-attractive faces. Single-trial electroencephalographic analysis indicated that this reduced ERP response arose from the engagement of fewer neural resources, and not from a change in the temporal consistency of how those resources were engaged. These findings provide novel evidence that faces are perceived as being attractive when they approximate a facial configuration close to the population average, and they suggest that processing fluency underlies preferences for attractive faces.

Moreover, due to a notable degree of complementarity between the two modalities, the combination of EEG and fMRI data has been actively sought in the last two decades. Although initially focused on epilepsy, EEG-fMRI applications were rapidly extended to the study of healthy brain function, yielding new insights into its underlying mechanisms and pathways. Nevertheless, EEG and fMRI have markedly different spatial and temporal resolutions, and probe neuronal activity through distinct biophysical processes, many aspects of which are still poorly understood. The remarkable conceptual and methodological challenges associated with EEG-fMRI integration have motivated the development of a wide range of analysis approaches over the years, each relying on more or less restrictive assumptions, and aiming to shed further light on the mechanisms of brain function along with those of the EEG-fMRI coupling itself. Here, we present a review of the most relevant EEG-fMRI integration approaches yet proposed for the study of brain function, supported by a general overview of our current understanding of the biophysical mechanisms coupling the signals obtained from the two modalities.

Combat veterans with comorbid PTSD and mild TBI exhibit a greater inhibitory processing ERP from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						N200; P300; Conflict monitoring; Response inhibition; Biomarker	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONCUSSED INDIVIDUALS; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; DEPRESSION; CONFLICT	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among combat personnel with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While patients with either PTSD or mTBI share abnormal activation of multiple frontal brain areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity during inhibitory processing may be particularly affected by PTSD. To further test this hypothesis, we recorded electroencephalography from 32 combat veterans with mTBI-17 of whom were also comorbid for PTSD (mTBI+PTSD) and 15 without PTSD (mTBI-only). Subjects performed the Stop Task, a validated inhibitory control task requiring inhibition of initiated motor responses. We observed a larger inhibitory processing eventrelated potential (ERP) in veterans with mTBI+PTSD, including greater N200 negativity. Furthermore, greater N200 negativity correlated with greater PTSD severity. This correlation was most dependent on contributions from the dorsal ACC. Support vector machine analysis demonstrated that N200 and P300 amplitudes objectively classified veterans into mTBI-only or mTBI+PTSD groups with 79.4% accuracy. Our results support a model where, in combat veterans with mTBI, larger ERPs from cingulate areas are associated with greater PTSD severity and likely related to difficulty controlling ongoing brain processes, including trauma-related thoughts and feelings.

Temporal factors affecting somatosensory-auditory interactions in speech processing	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						facial skin sensation; speech perception; speech production; electroencephalography; event-related potentials	MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; MODULATES ACTIVITY; PERCEPTION; INTEGRATION; CORTEX; HUMANS; SOUNDS; TOUCH; ORGANIZATION; POTENTIALS	Speech perception is known to rely on both auditory and visual information. However, sound-specific somatosensory input has been shown also to influence speech perceptual processing (Ito et al., 2009). In the present study, we addressed further the relationship between somatosensory information and speech perceptual processing by addressing the hypothesis that the temporal relationship between orofacial movement and sound processing contributes to somatosensory auditory interaction in speech perception. We examined the changes in event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to multisensory synchronous (simultaneous) and asynchronous (90 ms lag and lead) somatosensory and auditory stimulation compared to individual unisensory auditory and somatosensory stimulation alone. We used a robotic device to apply facial skin somatosensory deformations that were similar in timing and duration to those experienced in speech production. Following synchronous multisensory stimulation the amplitude of the ERP was reliably different from the two unisensory potentials. More importantly, the magnitude of the ERR difference varied as a function of the relative timing of the somatosensory auditory stimulation. Event-related activity change due to stimulus timing was seen between 160 and 220 ms following somatosensory onset, mostly around the parietal area. The results demonstrate a dynamic modulation of somatosensory auditory convergence and suggest the contribution of somatosensory information for speech processing process is dependent on the specific temporal order of sensory inputs in speech production.

We used a paired electro-encephalogram paradigm: pairs of participants performed an attention task, followed by feedback indicating monetary loss or gain on every trial. Participants were randomly allocated to the power-holder, subordinate or neutral group by creating different levels of control over how a joint monetary reward would be allocated. We found that power was associated with reduced behavioural accuracy. Event-related potential analysis showed that power-holders devoted less motivational resources to their targets than did subordinates or neutrals, but did not differ at the level of early conflict detection. Their feedback potential results showed a greater expectation of rewards but reduced subjective magnitude attributed to losses. Subordinates, on the other hand, were asymmetrically sensitive to power-holders' targets. They expected fewer rewards, but attributed greater significance to losses. Our study shows that power corrupts balanced co-operation with subordinates.

J	Cheng, YW; Chen, CY; Decety, J				Cheng, Yawei; Chen, Chenyi; Decety, Jean			An EEG/ERP investigation of the development of empathy in early and middle childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Childhood; Development; Empathy; EEG; ERP; Mu suppression	ELECTROCORTICAL REACTIVITY; EMOTION REGULATION; MORAL SENSITIVITY; BRAIN RESPONSES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; PAIN; FACES; MU; REAPPRAISAL; POTENTIALS	Empathic arousal is the first ontogenetic building block of empathy to appear during infancy and early childhood. As development progresses, empathic arousal becomes associated with an increasing ability to differentiate between self and other, which is a critical aspect of mature empathetic ability (Decety and Jackson, 2004). This allows for better regulation of contagious distress and understanding others mental states. In the current study, we recorded electroencephalographic event-related potentials and mu suppression induced by short visual animations that depicted painful situations in 57 typically developing children aged between 3 and 9 years as well as 15 young adults. Results indicate that the difference wave of an early automatic component (N200), indexing empathic arousal, showed an agerelated decrease in amplitude. In contrast, the difference wave of late-positive potentials (LPP), associated with cognitive appraisal, showed an age-related gain. Only early LPP was detected in children, whereas both early and late LPP were observed in adults. Furthermore, as compared with adults, children showed stronger mu suppression when viewing both painful and non-painful stimuli. These findings provide neurophysiological support for the development of empathy during childhood, as indicated by a gradual decrease in emotional arousal and an increase in cognitive appraisal with age.

The ERC method gives a quantitative index for measuring the diverse brain activation properties that represent the neural correlates of event-related responses. This analysis reveals distinct effects of facial attractiveness processing and also provides further information that could not have been achieved from event-related potential alone.

Our hypothesis is that in trials where pre- or peristimulus alpha phase is already aligned in a way that voltage positive alpha peaks develop seamlessly into the P-1, detection performance will be enhanced as compared to trials where alpha is not aligned. The findings supported our hypothesis and showed that target detection times for the subset of seamless alpha trials was significantly shorter than for trials that are not seamless. Our findings contradict the evoked model for the generation of early ERP components, which rests on the assumption of fixed latency, fixed polarity components. We found that in the non-seamless trials the 'candidate' component of the single trial P-1 was at the opposite polarity. Despite this fact, alpha phase locking was at the same high level as was observed for the seamless trials. Finally, we found that prestimulus alpha phase was aligned already in a time window preceding the P-1 by 400 ms. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Multisensory integration in schizophrenia: a behavioural and eventrelated potential study	COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; multisensory integration; ERP; race model	AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; SPEECH; FACILITATION; PERSPECTIVE; STIMULI; BINDING; HUMANS	IntroductionSuccessful processing of multisensory stimuli increases the likelihood of detection or identification of salient, biologically significant events faster and more efficiently than unisensory inputs. Schizophrenia (SZ) patients show deficits in unisensory processing, but it is unclear whether impairments are seen to multisensory stimuli, a process known as multisensory integration (MSI). We used behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) measures to examine MSI in SZ and healthy controls (HC).MethodsThirty-three SZ and 30 HC completed a target detection task with unisensory and multisensory stimuli. Reaction times (RT) were measured while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Two auditory (N100 and P200) and visual (P100 and N160) ERPs were examined. MSI was analysed in terms of violations of RT to the race model and by comparing ERPs in the MSI condition to the sum of the unisensory ERPs.ResultsBoth groups showed faster RT in MSI compared to unisensory conditions. SZ had non-significantly fewer violations of the race model compared to HC. SZ had significantly smaller amplitudes to unisensory visual N160 and auditory P100 relative to HC; there were no significant group differences on any ERP measure of MSI.ConclusionsSZ showed relatively intact MSI with subtle (non-significant) differences at the neural and behavioural levels compared to HC. Our results suggest that neural processes associated with MSI are not an additional source of impairment in SZ.

Sequential Unfolding of Appraisals: EEG Evidence for the Interaction of Novelty and Pleasantness	EMOTION			English	Article						EEG; IAPS; appraisal; novelty; intrinsic pleasantness	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; EMOTION; ERP; BRAIN; COMPONENT; AROUSAL; P3A; ARCHITECTURE; MECHANISMS	An important question in emotion research is what elicits emotions and causes variations in their quality and intensity. Appraisal theories propose a cognitive process through which stimuli are evaluated on a number of different criteria. The combination of results on these criteria determines which specific emotion is elicited. In the present study, we addressed several questions regarding the mechanisms underlying this process, specifically whether appraisal criteria are processed (a) in a fixed sequence, (b) independently of each other, and (c) by different neural structures or circuits. Two appraisal criteria, stimulus novelty and pleasantness, were manipulated with a 3-stimulus oddball paradigm with affective pictures. Electroencephalographic (EEG) markers for the appraisal processes were distinguished using a spatiotemporal clustering analysis. Consistent with theories that assume a fixed sequence of the appraisal process, the analyses revealed early effects of novelty on global field power and the topographical pattern of EEG activity, followed in time by effects involving pleasantness. Moreover, both measures showed significant interactions of novelty and pleasantness in late processing stages (650 ms-800 ms), indicating that the processing of pleasantness depends on the preceding appraisal of novelty. The results of spatiotemporal clustering suggest that the late processing of highly relevant stimuli is not based on a single mechanism, but consists of the initial activation of distinct neural processes to evaluate novel stimuli, followed by activation of different neural mechanisms for the combined evaluation of both novel and highly valenced (i.e., unpleasant or pleasant) stimuli (a distinction that is not apparent in conventional event-related potential measures).

The auditory brain-stem response to complex sounds: a potential biomarker for guiding treatment of psychosis	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						auditory brain-stem response; biomarkers; cognitive remediation; complex auditory brain-stem response; EEG; psychosis; schizophrenia		ognitive deficits limit psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. For many patients, cognitive remediation approaches have yielded encouraging results. Nevertheless, therapeutic response is variable, and outcome studies consistently identify individuals who respond minimally to these interventions. Biomarkers that can assist in identifying patients likely to benefit from particular forms of cognitive remediation are needed. Here, we describe an event-related potential (ERP) biomarker - the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) to complex sounds (cABR) - that appears to be particularly well-suited for predicting response to at least one form of cognitive remediation that targets auditory information processing. Uniquely, the cABR quantifies the fidelity of sound encoded at the level of the brainstem and midbrain. This ERP biomarker has revealed auditory processing abnormalities in various neurodevelopmental disorders, correlates with functioning across several cognitive domains, and appears to be responsive to targeted auditory training. We present preliminary cABR data from 18 schizophrenia patients and propose further investigation of this biomarker for predicting and tracking response to cognitive interventions	[Tarasenko, Melissa A.; Braff, David L.; Light, Gregory A.] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, MIRECC, Res Educ & Clin Ctr, VISN Mental Illness 22, La Jolla, CA USA; [Tarasenko, Melissa A.; Swerdlow, Neal R.; Braff, David L.; Light, Gregory A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Makeig, Scott] Univ Calif San Diego, Swartz Ctr Computat Neurosci, Inst Neural Computat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA		Light, GA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.	glight@ucsd.edu	Swerdlow, Neal/AAU-4912-2020; Light, Gregory/AAA-5696-2020		VISN-22 Mental Illness, Research, Education, and Clinical Center; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD); Veterans Medical Research Foundation; National Institutes of Mental Health [UL1TR000100, MH42228, MH065571, MH094151, MH093453, MH094320, MH081944, MH59803]	VISN-22 Mental Illness, Research, Education, and Clinical Center; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD)(NARSAD); Veterans Medical Research Foundation; National Institutes of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	The authors thank Erika Skoe for methodological consultation and Marlena Pela for assisting with data collection.

In line with these research efforts, the present study aims to investigate the processing of food stimuli (enriched by emotional stimuli) between patients diagnosed for anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy controls by means of electroencephalography. Twenty-two female adolescents (eleven AN patients vs. eleven healthy controls) were investigated. Positive event-related potentials "P300" and "late positive potential" (LPP) reflecting attentional processing (caused by motivationally relevant stimuli) were investigated during passive viewing of the food cue picture stream. This method was used for the first time in a sample of individuals with AN. As a main result, AN patients exhibited a higher amount of attentional bias in P300 and LPP, while watching food stimuli. Moreover, AN patients rated food stimuli as less pleasant. For a conclusion, there is substantial evidence pointing to an abnormal attentional brain reactivity to food pictures in AN. Therefore, food stimuli seem to be more motivationally relevant for AN patients than for healthy controls. By broadening existing knowledge, these findings might bear some implications for the treatment for AN. However, further research is recommended in order to confirm the results coming from rather limited data.

Affective impact and electrocortical correlates of a psychotherapeutic microintervention: An ERP study of cognitive restructuring	PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Article						cognitive restructuring; microintervention; depression; neuroscience; EEG	MENTAL-HEALTH TREATMENT; EMOTION REGULATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; DEPRESSION; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; DISORDERS; AMYGDALA; MOOD	Objective: Psychotherapy for depression emphasizes techniques that can help individuals regulate their moods. The present study investigated the affective impact and electrocortical correlates of cognitive restructuring, delivered as a 90-minute psychotherapeutic microintervention in a dysphoric sample. Method: Participants (N = 92) who reported either low or high levels of dysphoric symptoms were randomly assigned to the restructuring microintervention, a control intervention or a no-intervention condition. We obtained recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as mood self-ratings during an experimental session immediately after the psychotherapeutic microintervention and the control intervention in which a set of negatively valenced pictures (IAPS) was presented with different instructions. Results: Whereas the restructuring intervention group and the control intervention group reported both increases in positive and decreases in negative affect from pre- to post-intervention, the three groups differed significantly on ERP measures. Conclusions: Findings provide support for current models of mechanisms of action in cognitive therapies.

Humans pay more attention to human faces than other images. The purpose of this study is to verify the existence of particular attention to facial images and categorize the difference between attending to facial and non-facial images through a pair of different pictures as the targets. According to effects of visual stimuli such as color and luminance, the pictures modulated in greyscale (luminance-defined stimuli). Using a psychophysical task, EEG signals according to 10-20 standards in eight channels were recorded from 48 healthy volunteers. After the initial processing, ERP signal were elicited into two classes according to attention to the face and non -face images. In this study, the time window of the N170 component, was considered to extract new time features plus the N170 component; a negative peak in 170 milliseconds after stimulus onset. Optimum features were selected by t test criteria and classification was done by LDA, KNN and SVM classifiers. Validating the results was done by LOO cross validation criteria. Best result was obtained by SVM with 74.44% and was associated with frontal and parietal lobes.

Theta and delta band activity explain N2 and P3 ERP component activity in a go/no-go task	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Response inhibition; Time-frequency; EEG; Theta; Delta	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-FREQUENCY COMPONENTS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERROR-DETECTION; NEURAL SYSTEM; NOGO; CONFLICT	Objectives: Recent work indicates that the feedback negativity and P3 components from gambling feedback tasks can be understood as mixtures of functionally distinct processes occurring separately in theta and delta frequency bands. The current study was conducted to assess whether dissociable processes occurring in the theta and delta bands would similarly account for activity underlying N2 and P3 components in a go/no-go task. Methods: The current study measured EEG signals from 66 participants during a go/no-go task, and a time-frequency principal components analysis decomposition approach was used to extract theta and delta measures from condition averages. Results: Theta and delta measures separately increased in relation to response inhibition, and were uniquely related to the N2 and P3 components, as predicted. Conclusions: Findings support the view that the theta and delta measures indexed separable processes related to response inhibition, and better indexed the processes underlying N2 and P3 components in this go/no-go task. Significance: Theta and delta measures may index separable functional processes across other common ERP tasks, and may represent an improved target for research relative to standard time-domain components.

In the current study, we examined how the temporal complexity of an experience may govern the processes required for its retrieval. We recorded event-related potentials during episodic cued recall following pair associate learning of concurrently and sequentially presented object-picture pairs. Cued recall success effects over anterior and posterior areas were apparent in several time windows. In anterior locations, these recall success effects were similar for concurrently and sequentially encoded pairs. However, in posterior sites clustered over parietal scalp the effect was larger for the retrieval of sequentially encoded pairs. We suggest that anterior aspects of the mid-latency recall success effects may reflect working-with-memory operations or direct access recall processes, while more posterior aspects reflect recollective processes which are required for retrieval of episodes of greater temporal complexity.

Recent work has shown that 'hybrid' BCIs that combine different types of signals may be superior to their simpler counterparts. This paper introduces a new type of hybrid P300/SSVEP BCI with a four-choice system. We compared this new approach to conditions that used only a P300 or SSVEP BCI. In addition to collecting EEG and performance data based on offline and then online runs, we also used questionnaires to explore the subject's experiences with the different conditions. Results showed that subjects could use the hybrid BCI, and did not consider it more annoying, difficult or fatiguing than the P300 or SSVEP BCI. The hybrid condition improved performance relative to the SSVEP condition, but not the P300 condition. The hybrid condition did not elicit significant differences in the EEG measures compared here. These results validate this new BCI approach and provide support for future hybrid efforts.

During a simple visual oddball task, neural responses measured by electroencephalography (EEG) modulate primarily with attention, but source localization of the correlates is a challenge. In this study we use single-trial analysis of simultaneously-acquired scalp EEG and functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) data to investigate the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) correlates of modulations in task-related attention, and we unravel the temporal cascade of these transient activations. We hypothesize that activity in brain regions associated with various task-related cognitive processes modulates with attention, and that their involvements occur transiently in a specific order. We analyze the fMRI BOLD signal by first regressing out the variance linked to observed stimulus and behavioral events. We then correlate the residual variance with the trial-to-trial variation of EEG discriminating components for identical stimuli, estimated at a sequence of times during a trial. Post-stimulus and early in the trial, we find activations in right-lateralized frontal regions and lateral occipital cortex, areas that are often linked to task-dependent processes, such as attentional orienting, and decision certainty. After the behavioral response we see correlates in areas often associated with the default-mode network and introspective processing, including precuneus, angular gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex. Our results demonstrate that during simple tasks both task-dependent and default-mode networks are transiently engaged, with a distinct temporal ordering and millisecond timescale.

We examined how this competition is influenced by top-down knowledge using event-related potentials. Competition was manipulated by presenting visual search arrays in which the target or distractor was the only color singleton compared to displays in which both singletons were presented. Experiments 1 and 2 manipulated whether the observer knew the color of the target in advance. Experiment 3 ruled out low-level sensory explanations. Results show that, under conditions of competition, the distractor does not elicit an N2pc when the target color is known. However, the N2pc elicited by the target is reduced in the presence of a distractor. These findings suggest that top-down knowledge can prevent the capture of attention by distracting information, but this prior knowledge does not eliminate the competitive influence of the distractor on the target.

The sniffer proved to be useful for off-line analysis of the EEG and also for on-line applications, as Brain Computer-Interfaces (BCIs). Despite its limitations and packet losses at around 1.7% due to noise, the off-line analysis of the EEG successfully replicated results of the literature regarding the Event-Related (De) Synchronization (ERD/ERS) and Evoked Potentials (EPs) calculated for mental tasks. For on-line applications the sniffer was used to program a single-switch BCI for on-line classification of motor and no motor mental tasks with high success rate. Nowadays, the BrainNet36 (R) device is being used for EEG research at many Brazilian universities, therefore, we hope that this article may encourage on-line applications. Finally, as the sniffer operation is explained here with examples, this text may serve as a reference guide for potential user's.

Here we propose a new method to estimate the EEG sources of identified electrophysiological states that represent spontaneous activity, or are evoked by a stimulus, or caused by disease or disorder. Our method has the unique advantage of seamlessly integrating a statistical significance of the source estimate while efficiently eliminating artifacts (e.g., due to eye blinks, eye movements, bad electrodes). After determining the electrophysiological states in terms of stable topographies using established methods (e.g.: ICA, PCA, k-means, epoch average), we propose to estimate these states' time courses through spatial regression of a General Linear Model (GLM). These time courses are then used to find EEG sources that have a similar time-course (using temporal regression of a second GLM). We validate our method using both simulated and experimental data. Simulated data allows us to assess the difference between source maps obtained by the proposed method and those obtained by applying conventional source imaging of the state topographies. Moreover, we use data from 7 epileptic patients (9 distinct epileptic foci localized by intracranial EEG) and 2 healthy subjects performing an eyes-open/eyes-closed task to elicit activity in the alpha frequency range. Our results indicate that the proposed EEG source imaging method accurately localizes the sources for each of the electrical brain states. Furthermore, our method is particularly suited for estimating the sources of EEG resting states or otherwise weak spontaneous activity states, a problem not adequately solved before.

However, whether loss of facial movements alters the cortical circuits involved in processing tactile inputs from the hand remains unknown. In this prospective observational study we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure cortical activity evoked by tactile stimulation of the hands before and after botulinum toxin-A-induced facial paralysis. We found a reduction in the tactile event-related potentials (ERPs) 6 weeks after the treatment. This suggests that the limited paralysis of facial muscles induced during cosmetic interventions designed to smooth lines and wrinkles on the face is sufficient to alter the cortical processing of tactile inputs from the hand.

Here, we extended previous P300 research and explored TTI and NNI effects on the various ERP components elicited in an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task. We also examined whether a similar mechanism was underpinning interval effects in early ERP components (e.g., N1). Thirty participants completed a specially-designed variable-ISI equiprobable task whilst their EEG activity was recorded. Component amplitudes were extracted using temporal PCA with unrestricted Varimax rotation. As expected, N1, P2, and P3b amplitudes increased as TTI and NNI increased, however, Processing Negativity (PN) and Slow Wave (SW) did not show the same systematic change with interval increments. To determine the origin of interval effects in sequential processing, a multiple regression analysis was conducted on each ERP component including stimulus type, interval, and all preceding components as predictors. These analyses showed that matching-stimulus interval predicted N1, P3b, and weakly predicted P2, but not PN or SW; SW was determined by P3b only. These results suggest that N1, P3b, and to some extent, P2, are affected by a similar temporal mechanism. However, the dissimilar pattern of results obtained for sequential ERP components indicates that matching-stimulus intervals are not affecting all aspects of stimulus processing. This argues against a global mechanism, such as a pathway-specific refractory effect, and suggests that stimulus processing is occurring in parallel pathways, some of which are not affected by temporal manipulations of matching-stimulus interval.

We investigated the time course of sensory encoding and subsequent maintenance in memory via EEG. Twenty-nine healthy participants completed a facial emotion delayed match-to-sample task. P100, N170 and N250 ERPs were measured in response to the first stimulus, and evoked theta power (4-7 Hz) was measured during the delay interval. Negative facial expressions produced larger N170 amplitudes and greater theta power early in the delay. N170 amplitude correlated with theta power, however larger N170 amplitude coupled with greater theta power only predicted behavioural performance for one emotion condition (very happy) out of six tested (see Supplemental Data). These findings indicate that the N170 ERP may be sensitive to emotional facial expressions when task demands require encoding and retention of this information. Furthermore, sustained theta activity may represent continued attentional processing that supports short-term memory, especially of negative facial stimuli. Further study is needed to investigate the potential influence of these measures, and their interaction, on behavioural performance. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design: Interventional case-control repeated measurements design. Setting: Paediatric sleep laboratory in a hospital setting. Participants: Forty children with SDB and 40 healthy, age-and sex-matched children. Interventions: Adenotonsillectomy in children with SDB and no intervention in controls. Measurements and Results: Overnight polysomnography; electroencephalography (EEG) power variations within SEF respiratory cycles in the overall and frequency band-specific EEG within stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, slow wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Within both groups there was a decrease in EEG power during inspiration compared to expiration across all sleep stages. Compared to controls, RCREC in children with SDB in the overall EEG were significantly higher during REM and frequency band specific RCRECs were higher in the theta band of stage 2 and REM sleep, alpha band of SWS and REM sleep, and sigma band of REM sleep. This between-group difference was not significant postadenotonsillectomy. Conclusion: The presence of nonrandom respiratory cycle-related electroencephalographic changes (RCREC) in both healthy children and in children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) during NREM and REM sleep has been demonstrated. The RCREC values were higher in children with SDB, predominantly in REM sleep and this difference reduced after adenotonsillectomy.

This has been commonly studied through the N400 event-related potential (ERP), as a measure of facilitated lexical retrieval. However, the associative relationships in multi-word expressions (MWE) may enable the generation of a categorical expectation, leading to lexical retrieval before target word onset. Processing of the target word would thus reflect a target-identification mechanism, possibly indexed by a P3 ERP component. However, given their time overlap (200-500 ms post-stimulus onset), differentiating between N4001P3 ERP responses (averaged over multiple linguistically variable trials) is problematic. In the present study, we analyzed EEG data from a previous experiment, which compared ERP responses to highly expected words that were placed either in a MWE or a regular non-fixed compositional context, and to low predictability controls. We focused on oscillatory dynamics and regression analyses, in order to dissociate between the two contexts by modeling the electrophysiological response as a function of item-level parameters. A significant interaction between word position and condition was found in the regression model for power in a theta range (similar to 7-9 Hz), providing evidence for the presence of qualitative differences between conditions. Power levels within this band were lower for MWE than compositional contexts when the target word appeared later on in the sentence, confirming that in the former lexical retrieval would have taken place before word onset. On the other hand, gamma-power (similar to 50-70 Hz) was also modulated by predictability of the item in all conditions, which is interpreted as an index of a similar "matching" sub-step for both types of contexts, binding an expected representation and the external input.

MethodsWe assessed the effect of clonidine on event-related brain potential (ERP) reflections of bias and disengagement in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. An initial dose of 200-mu g clonidine was replaced by 100 mu g because of marked side effects. Twenty-one healthy male participants performed the visual-spatial cueing task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The behavioral output is the validity effect (benefit of cueing in terms of reaction time to targets). ERP indices for bias were the cue-related early directing attention negativity and late directing attention positivity, and the target-elicited P1 and N1 modulations by validity (validity-effect'). The ERP index for disengagement was the target-elicited late positive deflection' modulation by validity. Behavioral analyses were performed on 16 participants, electrophysiological analyses on a subset (n=9). ResultsClonidine attenuated the N1 effect, albeit in a subsample. Neither cue-elicited ERPs nor the behavioral validity effect were affected. Clonidine-induced blood pressure reduction was correlated with the reduction of the late positive deflection effect under clonidine. ConclusionClonidine attenuated the result of bias in a subsample and may have a modulating effect on disengagement. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Logemann, H. N. Alexander; Kenemans, J.

However, recent evidence suggests that EFs are unitary in children up to about 9 years of age. The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that peaks of the event-related potential (ERP) of specific EFs are related to behavioral performance, despite EFs being psychometrically indistinguishable in children. Specifically, N2 difference waveform (associated with cognitive control and response inhibition) and P3b peak (associated with updating of working memory) latent variables were created and entered into confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models with a unitary executive functioning factor. Children aged 7-9 years (N = 215) completed eight measures of inhibition, working memory, and shifting. A modified flanker task was also completed during which EEG data were recorded. The N2 difference wave form and P3b mean amplitude factors both significantly correlated with (and were predictors of) the executive functioning factor, but the P3b latency factor did not. These results provide evidence of the electrophysiological indices of EFs being observable before the associated behavioral constructs are distinguishable from each other. From this, it is possible that ERPs could be used as a sensitive measure of development in the context of evaluation for neuropsychological interventions.

This discrepancy is known as Developmental Disregard (DD). Though the phenomenon of DD has been well documented, its underlying cause is still under debate. DD has originally been explained based on principles of operant conditioning. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DD results from a diminished automaticity of movements, resulting in an increased cognitive load when using the affected hand. To investigate the amount of involved cognitive load we studied Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) preceding task-related motor responses during a single-hand capacity and a dual-hand performance task. It was hypothesised that children with DD show alterations related to long-latency ERP components when selecting a response with the affected upper limb, reflecting increased cognitive load in order to generate an adequate response and especially so within the dual-hand task. Methods: Fifteen children with unilateral CP participated in the study. One of the participants was excluded due to major visual impairments. Seven of the remaining participants displayed DD. The other seven children served as a control group. All participants performed two versions of a cue-target paradigm, a single-hand capacity and a dual-hand performance task. The ERP components linked to target presentation were inspected: the mid-latency P2 component and the consecutive long-latency N2b component. Results: In the dual-hand performance task children with DD showed an enhancement in mean amplitude of the long-latency N2b component when selecting a response with their affected hand. No differences were found regarding the amplitude of the mid-latency P2 component. No differences were observed regarding the single-hand capacity task. The control group did not display any differences in ERPs linked to target evaluation processes between both hands. Conclusion: These electrophysiological findings show that DD is associated with increased cognitive load when movements are prepared with the affected hand during a dual-hand performance task. These findings confirm behavioural observations, advance our insights on the neural substrate of DD and have implications for therapy.	[Zielinski, Ingar M.; Jongsma, Marijtje L. A.; Baas, C.

It consists of two phases of oxygen saturation dynamics: an initial slow decrease (normoxic phase) followed by a rapid drop (hypoxic phase) during which transitory neurological symptoms as well as slight impairment of integrated cerebral functions, such as emotional processing, can occur. This study investigated how breath holding affects emotional processing. To this aim we characterized the modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by emotional-laden pictures as a function of breath holding time course. We recorded ERPs during free breathing and breath holding performed in air by elite apnea divers. We modeled brain responses during free breathing with four independent components distributed over different brain areas derived by an approach based on the independent component analysis (ICASSO). We described ERP changes during breath holding by estimating amplitude scaling and time shifting of the same components (component adaptation analysis). Component 1 included the main EEG features of emotional processing, had a posterior localization and did not change during breath holding; component 2, localized over temporo-frontal regions, was present only in unpleasant stimuli responses and decreased during breath holding, with no differences between breath holding phases; component 3, localized on the fronto-central midline regions, showed phase-independent breath holding decreases; component 4, quite widespread but with frontal prevalence, decreased in parallel with the hypoxic trend. The spatial localization of these components was compatible with a set of processing modules that affects the automatic and intentional controls of attention. The reduction of unpleasant-related ERP components suggests that the evaluation of aversive and/or possibly dangerous situations might be altered during breath holding.

However, because of the confounding nature of familiarity, little is known concerning the neural mechanism involved in maternal face recognition. We had a rare opportunity to examine Mosuo preschool children who were raised in a matrilineal society in which mothers and aunts represent equally familiar faces to the children. The participants were exposed to photographs of their mother's face, aunt's face, and an unfamiliar female's faces during electroencephalography (EEG) recording. The EEG results showed that the mother's face elicited a more negative N1 component, a larger left N170 component, and a larger P300 component; both the mother's and aunt's faces elicited a larger right N170 component. These results suggest that the emotional attachment between mother and child has neural ramifications across three successive face processing stages that are distinguished from the neural effects of facial familiarity.

There is evidence that pre-information is actively used to facilitate these two aspects of the so-called "cocktail-party" problem. Here, a simulated multi-talker scenario was combined with electroencephalography to study scene analysis and allocation of attention in young and middle-aged adults. Sequences of short words (combinations of brief company names and stock price values) from four talkers at different locations were simultaneously presented, and the detection of target names and the discrimination between critical target values were assessed. Immediately prior to speech sequences, auditory pre-information was provided via cues that either prepared auditory scene analysis or attentional focusing, or non-specific pre-information was given. While performance was generally better in younger than older participants, both age groups benefited from auditory pre-information. The analysis of the cue-related event-related potentials revealed age-specific differences in the use of pre-cues: Younger adults showed a pronounced N2 component, suggesting early inhibition of concurrent speech stimuli; older adults exhibited a stronger late P3 component, suggesting increased resource allocation to process the pre-information. In sum, the results argue for an age-specific utilization of auditory pre-information to improve listening in complex dynamic auditory environments.

New method: We provide a theoretical comparison of the two approaches and present a new suite of data-driven analytic tools for the specific identification of the brain microstates in high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs). This suite includes four different analytic methods. We validated this approach through a series of theoretical simulations and an empirical investigation of a basic visual paradigm, the reversal checkerboard task. Results: Results indicate that the present suite of data-intensive analytic techniques, improves the spatiotemporal information one can garner about non-periodic brain microstates from high-density electrical neuroimaging data. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared to the existing methods (such as those based on k-clustering methods), the current micro-segmentation approach offers several advantages, including the data-driven (automatic) detection of non-periodic quasi-stable brain states. Conclusion: This suite of quantitative methods allows the automatic detection of event-related changes in the global pattern of brain activity, putatively reflecting changes in the underlying neural locus for information processing in the brain, and event-related changes in overall brain activation. In addition, within-subject and between-subject bootstrapping procedures provide a quantitative means of investigating how robust are the results of the micro-segmentation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The neural dynamics accompanying these coordination patterns are complex and rapid. By means of electroand magneto-encephalographic approaches, it has been possible to examine these dynamics during bimanual coordination with excellent temporal resolution, which complements other neuroimaging modalities with superb spatial resolution. This review focuses on EEG/MEG studies that unravel the processes involved in movement planning and execution, motor learning, and executive functions involved in task switching and dual tasking. Evidence is presented for a spatio-temporal reorganization of the neural networks within and between hemispheres to meet increased task difficulty demands, induced or spontaneous switches in coordination mode, or training-induced neuroplastic modulation in coordination dynamics. Future theoretical developments will benefit from the integration of research techniques unraveling neural activity at different time scales. Ultimately this work will contribute to a better understanding of how the human brain orchestrates complex behavior via the implementation of inter-and intra-hemispheric coordination networks.

But recent research has proved that selective attention is a mechanism that is not limited to a single sensory modality but can encompass or spread across multiple sensory systems. The present study investigated whether the crossmodal spatial attention influences the processing of social salient objects, i.e., human faces. The electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded and the event-related potentials (ERPs) method was used to examine whether and which stages of processing are modulated by crossmodal spatial attention. The results showed that the ERPs components P100, P300 and LC were affected by crossmodal spatial attention, but these effects were attenuated compare to the visual attention effect. This pattern of results suggests that for the social salient objects, crossmodal links in spatial attention may not only affect sensory-perceptual processes within modality-specific cortical regions, but also impact later post-perceptual processing stages.

A typical EEG experiment can produce a two-dimensional data matrix related to the human neuronal activity every millisecond, projected on the head surface at a spatial resolution of a few centimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, the EEG instrumentation has led to a flood of data and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. This paper summarizes the results of applying supervised machine learning (ML) methods to the problem of classifying emotional states of human subjects based on EEG. In particular, we compare six ML algorithms to distinguish event-related potentials, associated with the processing of different emotional valences, collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content. 98% inter-subject classification accuracy based on the majority of votes between all classifiers is the main achievement of this paper, which outperforms previous published results.

Costs in behavioral data and a significant reduction of the steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitude that was elicited by the foreground task lasted for several hundred milliseconds. We speculated that the differential effect in SSVEP amplitudes is preceded by the extraction of the emotional cue. Event related potential (ERP) studies to emotional and neutral complex images identified an early posterior negativity (EPN) as a robust neural signature of emotional cue extraction. The late positive potential (LPP) was related to in-depth processing of the emotional image. We extracted ERPs that were evoked by the onset of background images concurrently with the SSVEP that was elicited by the foreground task. Emotional compared to neutral background pictures evoked a more negative EPN at about 190 ms and a more positive LPP at about 700 ms after image onset. SSVEP amplitudes became significantly smaller with emotional background images after about 400 ms lasting for several hundred ms. Interestingly, we found no significant correlations between the three components, indicating that they act independently. Source localizations resulted in nonoverlapping cortical generators. Results suggest a cascade of perceptual processes: Extraction of the emotional cue preceded biasing of attentional resources away from the foreground task towards the emotional image for an evaluation of the picture content.

This knowledge is generally lacking in data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a temporal resolution on the scale of seconds so that possibilities to combine the two modalities are sought. Previous applications combining event-related potentials (ERPs) with simultaneous fMRI BOLD generally aimed at measuring known ERR components in single trials and correlate the resulting time series with the fMRI BOLD signal. While it is a valuable first step, this procedure cannot guarantee that variability of the chosen ERR component is specific for the targeted neurophysiological process on the group and single subject level. Here we introduce a newly developed data-driven analysis procedure that automatically selects task-specific electrophysiological independent components (ICs). We used single-trial simultaneous EEG/fMRI analysis of a visual Go/Nogo task to assess inhibition-related EEG components, their trial-to-trial amplitude variability, and the relationship between this variability and the fMRI. Single-trial EEG/fMRI analysis within a subgroup of 22 participants revealed positive correlations of fMRI BOLD signal with EEG-derived regressors in fronto-striatal regions which were more pronounced in an early compared to a late phase of task execution. In sum, selecting Nogo-related ICs in an automated, single subject procedure reveals fMRI-BOLD responses correlated to different phases of task execution. Furthermore, to illustrate utility and generalizability of the method beyond detecting the presence or absence of reliable inhibitory components in the EEG, we show that the IC selection can be extended to other events in the same dataset, e.g., the visual responses.

Counterfactuals provide two pieces of information: their literal meaning expresses a suppositional dependency between an antecedent (If the dice had been rigged...) and a consequent (... then the game would have been unfair). Their second, backgrounded meaning refers to the opposite state of affairs and suggests that, in fact, the dice were not rigged and the game was fair. Counterfactual antecedents are particularly intriguing because they set up a counterfactual world which is known to be false, but which is nevertheless kept to when evaluating the conditional's consequent. In the last years several event-related potential (ERP) studies have targeted the processing of counterfactual consequents, yet counterfactual antecedents have remained unstudied. We present an EEG/ERP investigation which employed German conditionals to compare subjunctive mood (which marks counterfactuality) with indicative mood at the critical point of mood disambiguation via auxiliary introduction in the conditional's antecedent. Conditional sentences were presented visually one word at a time. Participants completed an acceptability judgment and probe detection task which was not related to the critical manipulation of linguistic mood. ERPs at the point of mood disambiguation in the antecedent were compared between indicative and subjunctive. Our main finding is a transient negative deflection in frontal regions for subjunctive compared to indicative mood in a time-window of 450-600 ms. We discuss this novel finding in respect to working memory requirements for rule application and increased referential processing demands for the representation of counterfactuals' dual meaning. Our result suggests that the counterfactually implied dual meaning is processed without any delay at the earliest point where counterfactuality is marked by subjunctive mood.

Looking for a face in the crowd: Fixation-related potentials in an eye-movement visual search task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual search; EEG; Faces; Natural scenes; Oddball	SINGLE-TRIAL; SACCADE GENERATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LAMBDA WAVES; EEG; MODEL; BLINK; P300; TOPOGRAPHY; COMPONENTS	Despite the compelling contribution of the study of event related potentials (ERPs) and eye movements to cognitive neuroscience, these two approaches have largely evolved independently. We designed an eye-movement visual search paradigm that allowed us to concurrently record EEG and eye movements while subjects were asked to find a hidden target face in a crowded scene with distractor faces. Fixation event-related potentials (fERPs) to target and distractor stimuli showed the emergence of robust sensory components associated with the perception of stimuli and cognitive components associated with the detection of target faces. We compared those components with the ones obtained in a control task at fixation: qualitative similarities as well as differences in terms of scalp topography and latency emerged between the two. By using single trial analyses, fixations to target and distractors could be decoded from the EEG signals above chance level in 11 out of 12 subjects. Our results show that EEG signatures related to cognitive behavior develop across spatially unconstrained exploration of natural scenes and provide a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of target detection during natural search.

In previous studies low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used, with positive behavioral and electrophysiological results, for the experimental treatment in ASD. In this study we combined prefrontal rTMS sessions with electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) to prolong and reinforce TMS-induced EEG changes. The pilot trial recruited 42 children with ASD (similar to 14.5 years). Outcome measures included behavioral evaluations and reaction time test with event-related potential (ERP) recording. For the main goal of this exploratory study we used rTMS-neurofeedback combination (TMS-NFB, N = 20) and waitlist (WTL, N = 22) groups to examine effects of 18 sessions of integrated rTMS-NFB treatment or wait period) on behavioral responses, stimulus and response-locked ERPs, and other functional and clinical outcomes. The underlying hypothesis was that combined TMS-NFB will improve executive functions in autistic patients as compared to the WTL group. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were collected in pre- and post-treatment tests in both groups. Results of the study supported our hypothesis by demonstration of positive effects of combined TMS-NFB neurotherapy in active treatment group as compared to control WTL group, as the TMS-NFB group showed significant improvements in behavioral and functional outcomes as compared to the WTL group.

J	Abeles, IY; Gomez-Ramirez, M				Abeles, Ilana Y.; Gomez-Ramirez, Manuel			Impairments in Background and Event-Related Alpha-Band Oscillatory Activity in Patients with Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL EVOKED-RESPONSE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Studies show that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired responses to sensory stimuli, especially at the early stages of neural processing. In particular, patients' alpha-band (8-14 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) and visual P1 event-related potential (ERP) component tend to be significantly reduced, with P1 ERP deficits greater for visual stimuli biased towards the magnocellular system. In healthy controls, studies show that pre-stimulus alpha (background alpha) plays a pivotal role in sensory processing and behavior, largely by shaping the neural responses to incoming stimuli. Here, we address whether patients' ERD and P1 deficits stem from impairments in pre-stimulus alpha mechanisms. To address this question we recorded electrophysiological activity in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while they engaged in a visual discrimination task with low, medium, and high contrast stimuli. The results revealed a significant decrease in patients' ERDs, which was largely driven by reductions in pre-stimulus alpha. These reductions were most prominent in right-hemispheric areas. We also observed a systematic relationship between pre-stimulus alpha and the P1 component across different contrast levels. However, this relationship was only observed in healthy controls. Taken together, these findings highlight a substantial anomaly in patients' amplitude-based alpha background activity over visual areas. The results provide further support that pre-stimulus alpha activity plays an active role in perception by modulating the neural responses to incoming sensory inputs, a mechanism that seems to be compromised in schizophrenia.

Electrophysiological (EEG) evidence for reduced performance monitoring in euthymic bipolar disorder	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; bipolar disorder; ERN; error-related negativity; performance monitoring	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL SYSTEM; RATING-SCALE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CONFLICT; DEFICITS; ABNORMALITIES	ObjectivesApart from mood episodes, many cognitive deficits are present in bipolar disorder (BD). Performance monitoring is an important aspect of executive functioning and involves continuous monitoring of behavior and making subsequent changes when an error is made. On a neurophysiological level, the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related brain potential (ERP) generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), reflects this process of performance monitoring. Abnormal ERN amplitudes have been observed in many major psychiatric disorders. However, despite conflicting evidence regarding the role of the ACC in BD, no studies to date have investigated performance monitoring as reflected in the ERN in BD. MethodsSixteen patients with BD in a euthymic state and 14 matched healthy controls performed a speeded two-choice reaction-time paradigm (Flankers Task) while electroencephalogram (EEG) measures were obtained. Behavioral and ERP measurements were analyzed for the two groups. ResultsThe patients with BD, although euthymic, scored higher on depressive symptoms than healthy controls. While no behavioral group differences were found, patients with BD displayed lower ERN amplitudes than healthy controls when controlling for effects of residual mood. ConclusionsThe lower ERN amplitudes in the BD group reflect reduced performance monitoring and extend current knowledge of executive functioning in BD. Importantly, these findings go a long way to resolving the contradictory results regarding ACC involvement in BD by showing that taking into account residual mood may greatly influence error-related ACC activations and is critically important in understanding cognitive deficits in BD.

J	Rufener, KS; Liem, F; Meyer, M				Rufener, Katharina Simone; Liem, Franziskus; Meyer, Martin			Age-related differences in auditory evoked potentials as a function of task modulation during speech-nonspeech processing	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Aging; attention; EEG; N1; P2; speech	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; OLDER-ADULTS; LIFE-SPAN; STIMULI; SOUND; COMPONENT	Background: Healthy aging is typically associated with impairment in various cognitive abilities such as memory, selective attention or executive functions. Less well observed is the fact that also language functions in general and speech processing in particular seems to be affected by age. This impairment is partly caused by pathologies of the peripheral auditory nervous system and central auditory decline and in some part also by a cognitive decay. Aims: This crosssectional electroencephalography (EEG) study investigates temporally early electrophysiological correlates of auditory related selective attention in young (20-32 years) and older (60-74 years) healthy adults. Material and methods: In two independent tasks, we systematically modulate the subjects' focus of attention by presenting words and pseudowords as targets and white noise stimuli as distractors. Results: Behavioral data showed no difference in task accuracy between the two age samples irrespective of the modulation of attention. However, our work is the first to show that the N1- and the P2 component evoked by speech and nonspeech stimuli are specifically modulated in older adults and young adults depending on the subjects' focus of attention. Conclusion: This finding is particularly interesting in that the age-related differences in AEPs may be reflecting levels of processing that are not mirrored by the behavioral measurements.

The present study investigated whether PTSS are related to the electrocortical processing of unpleasant pictures in a sample of undergraduate students. Participants were instructed to judge whether images were unpleasant or neutral while an EEG was taken. The late positive potential (LPP) to unpleasant relative to neutral was more positive for people with high PTSS than with low PTSS. Additionally, a temporospatial principal components analysis (PCA) for the whole sample identified positivities that were directly correlated with PTSS. These results provide evidence that brain reactivity to unpleasant cues would predict PTSS intensity and thus be a biomarker of PTSS severity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The role of higher level mechanisms in such reversals remains unclear. We tested whether perceptual reversals of discontinuously presented Necker cube pairs depend on working memory resources by manipulating cognitive load while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). The ERPs showed early enhancements of negativity which were obtained in response to the first cube approximately 500 ms before perceived reversals. We found that working memory load influenced reversal-related brain responses in response to the second cube over occipital areas at the 150-300 ms post-stimulus and over central areas at P3 time window (300-500 ms), suggesting that it modulates intermediate visual processes. Interestingly, reversal rates remained unchanged by the working memory load. We propose that perceptual reversals in discontinuous presentation of ambiguous stimuli are governed by an early (well preceding pending reversals) mechanism, while the effects of load on the reversal related ERPs may reflect general top-down influences on visual processing, possibly mediated by the prefrontal cortex.

Despite great phenotypic heterogeneity and etiologic diversity in ASD, social dysfunction is the unifying feature of ASD. This chapter focuses on understanding the neural systems involved in the processing of social information and its disruption in ASD by reviewing the conceptual background and highlighting some recent advances. In addition, work investigating an alternative interpretation of autistic dysfunction, problems with interconnectivity, and consequent difficulties with complex information processing are addressed.

Here, using human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings combined with source reconstruction techniques, we study how oscillatory activity functionally organizes different neocortical regions during a tactile discrimination task near the limit of spatial acuity. While undergoing EEG recordings, blindfolded participants felt a linear three-dot array presented electromechanically, under computer control, and reported whether the central dot was offset to the left or right. The average brain response differed significantly for trials with correct and incorrect perceptual responses in the timeframe approximately between 130 and 175 ms. During trials with correct responses, source-level peak activity appeared in the left primary somatosensory cortex (SI) at around 45 ms, in the right lateral occipital complex (LOC) at 130 ms, in the right posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) at 160 ms, and finally in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at 175 ms. Spectral interdependency analysis of activity in these nodes showed two distinct distributed networks, a dominantly feedforward network in the beta band (12-30 Hz) that included all four nodes and a recurrent network in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) that linked SI, pIPS and dIPFC. Measures of network activity in both bands were correlated with the accuracy of task performance. These findings suggest that beta and gamma band oscillatory networks coordinate activity between neocortical regions mediating sensory and cognitive processing to arrive at tactile perceptual decisions.

However, it remains controversial how this development in cognitive capabilities is mediated by changes in cortical activity: both age-related increases and decreases of mediofrontal neural activity have been observed and interpreted as neural underpinnings of this functional development. To better understand this developmental process, we examined EEG theta activity in the mediofrontal region using a Go/No-go response control task. We found that both pre-stimulus baseline theta-power and theta-power during the response control task, without baseline-correction, decreased with age. Conversely, when task-related theta-power was baseline corrected (using a ratio method), it exhibited a positive developmental trajectory. The age-related theta-power increase was source-localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. This increase in theta activity also partially mediated age-related improvements in response control and was greatest in a condition that demanded greater effort. Theta activity in older children also showed greater temporal reliability across trials as measured by inter-trial phase-coherence. Interestingly, directly subtracting baseline activity from task-related activity did not yield significant developmental effects, which highlights the necessity of separating and contrasting the pre-stimulus baseline with task-related processing in the understanding of neurodevelopmental changes.

A recent event-related potential (ERP) study attributed this age-related pattern to an enhanced processing of the cue. Previous ERP research in young samples indicates that target and response processing are also affected by IOR, which makes interesting to study the ERP correlates of IOR from cue presentation to response execution. In this regard, in the present study stimulus-locked (cue-locked and target-locked) and response-locked ERPs were explored in healthy young and older participants. The behavioral results indicated preserved IOR in the older participants. The cue-locked ERPs could suggest that the older participants processed the cue as a warning signal to prepare for the upcoming target stimulus. Under IOR, target-locked ERPs of both age groups showed lower N1 amplitudes suggesting a suppression/inhibition of cued targets. During the P3 rising period, in young subjects a negative shift (Nd effect) to cued targets was observed in the lower visual field (LVF), and a positive shift (Pd effect) in the upper visual field. However, in the older group the Nd effect was absent suggesting a reduction of attentional resolution in the LVF. The older group showed enhanced motor activation to prepare correct responses, although IOR effects on response-locked lateralized readiness potential LRP indicated reduced response preparation to cued targets in both age groups. In general, results suggest that the older adults inhibit or reduce the visual processing of targets appearing at cued locations, and the preparation to respond to them, but with the added cost of allocating more attentional resources onto the cue and of maintaining a more effortful processing during the sequence of stimuli within the trial.

Sham/verum tACS with individually determined theta frequency was applied to the left parietal (target electrode=P3) or frontal (target electrode=F3) brain areas (return electrode above the right eyebrow). After sham and verum stimulation, 24 respondents solved a task measuring the scope of attention while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Verum tACS with the target electrode positioned over the left parietal brain area significantly increased WM storage capacity, as compared to sham tACS. No such influence was observed for tACS with the target electrode positioned over the left frontal area. Increased WM storage capacity was accompanied by event-related potential (ERP) P300 latency decrease in the left hemisphere.

Multi-trial evoked EEG and independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Independent component analysis; Magnetoencephalography; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ALGORITHMS; ARTIFACTS	Background: Independent component analysis (ICA) is increasingly used to decompose EEG data into components. The analysis is based on the assumption that the hidden components are statistically independent. Here, we investigate the use of ICA on evoked multi-trial non-stationary EEG data. We show that the multi-trial data do not fulfill the assumption of the independence of the hidden components. This discrepancy questions the use of ICA in analyzing evoked EEG. New method: To overcome the problem with the independence assumption, we introduce a novel way to preprocess multi-trial data. In this preprocessing, the hidden components gain a property which we call the null conditional mean (NCM). We show that this property is sufficient to make the ICA separation to work. The suggested methodology has the additional advantage that it suppresses the stimulus-evoked artifacts, such as the strong muscular artifacts in the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked EEG, which may otherwise prevent the use of ICA. Results: The theoretical results, which support the mean subtraction method, were proved. We also confirmed the efficiency of the method with several numerical simulations, which resembled TMS-EEG measurement data. Comparison with existing method: As compared with conventional ICA of multi-trial data, the results substantially improved when using NCM data. Conclusions: The proposed methodology facilitates in uncovering hidden components that, with other existing methods, easily remain uncovered in evoked EEG or MEG data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Simple visual stimulation was presented to 17 healthy subjects during EEG recording. An O-2 electrode was used for analysis with a 32 channel EEG sampling system. We used a segmentation of raw data in order to obtain the evoked potential. Prestimulus and poststimulus activities were filtered in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band. Later, four different events (blocked, time-locked, phase-locked, and eliminated) were separately averaged. Phase-locked sweeps were determined by application of inter-trial coherence analysis. The evaluation of the data shows that "time-locked and phase-locked sweeps" were the dominating pattern and not "the blocked pattern", which occurred only when the prestimulus alpha was high. In the analyses of EEG-EP sweeps, only 22 % of epochs showed (ERD). The ANOVA revealed significant differences between four different alpha responses (F(3,48) = 11.175; p < 0.001). Furthermore, alpha oscillations in time-locked responses were significantly higher than blocked (p < 0.0001). The analyses clearly demonstrate that important precaution is needed when using the ERD as a cognitive or pathological marker.

Materials and Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers (8 female, with mean age: 22.13 +/- 1.41) participated in the study. Recordings were carried out using NuAmps 40 channeled recording system, pneumatic stimulation unit (Somatosensory Stimulus Generator 4-D Neuroimaging), Embedded Microcontroller Stimulation Unit (EMISU), and additional equipment such as video recording system and analysis computer. Painless air pressure stimulation was applied at constant pressure rate to the fore and middle fingers of the right hand. Infrequent oddball stimulation was applied to one of the fingers (% 25 of the time). Continuous electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings were sorted into sleep phases according to the guidelines set by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Responses recorded from the C3 and C4 electrodes were examined as somatosensory regions of priority. Paired samples T-tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: N100, P200, N300, P450, N550, P900 Nlate wave forms were clearly observed for both frequent and infrequent stimuli in light and deep sleep. Responses to both target and non-target stimuli on the right hand were found to be similar to each other. Discussion: Brain responsiveness continues in sleep; however electrophysiological response pattern can vary. Furthermore as processes such as directed attention, stimulus discrimination and working memory cannot be voluntarily employed during sleep; responses to both kinds of stimuli are similar to one another.

Resting quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) activity has been shown to be heritable and reliable over time. However, QEEG research in patients with psychosis has shown inconsistent and even contradictory findings, and studies of at-risk populations are scarce. Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether resting QEEG activity represents a candidate endophenotype for psychosis. Method: QEEG activity at rest was compared in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta), between chronic patients with psychosis (N = 48), first episode patients (N = 46), at-risk populations ("at risk mental state", N = 33; healthy relatives of patients, N = 45), and healthy controls (N = 107). Results: Results showed that chronic patients had significantly increased resting QEEG amplitudes in delta and theta frequencies compared to healthy controls. However, first episode patients and at-risk populations did not differ from controls in these frequency bands. There were no group differences in alpha or beta frequency bands. Conclusion: Since no abnormalities were found in first episode patients, ARMS, or healthy relatives, resting QEEG activity in the frequency bands examined is unlikely to be related to genetic predisposition to psychosis. Rather than endophenotypes, the low frequency abnormalities observed in chronic patients are probably related to illness progression and/or to the long-term effects of treatments.

Simultaneous recording of MEG, EEG and intracerebral EEG during visual stimulation: From feasibility to single-trial analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; EEG; SEEG; Simultaneous recordings; Single-trial analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; COMPONENTS	Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and intracerebral stereotaxic EEG (SEEG) are the three neurophysiological recording techniques, which are thought to capture the same type of brain activity. Still, the relationships between non-invasive (EEG, MEG) and invasive (SEEG) signals remain to be further investigated. In early attempts at comparing SEEG with either EEG or MEG, the recordings were performed separately for each modality. However such an approach presents substantial limitations in terms of signal analysis. The goal of this technical note is to investigate the feasibility of simultaneously recording these three signal modalities (EEG, MEG and SEEG), and to provide strategies for analyzing this new kind of data. Intracerebral electrodes were implanted in a patient with intractable epilepsy for presurgical evaluation purposes. This patient was presented with a visual stimulation paradigm while the three types of signals were simultaneously recorded. The analysis started with a characterization of the MEG artifact caused by the SEEG equipment. Next, the average evoked activities were computed at the sensor level, and cortical source activations were estimated for both the EEG and MEG recordings; these were shown to be compatible with the spatiotemporal dynamics of the SEEG signals. In the average time-frequency domain, concordant patterns between the MEG/EEG and SEEG recordings were found below the 40 Hz level. Finally, a fine-grained coupling between the amplitudes of the three recording modalities was detected in the time domain, at the level of single evoked responses. Importantly, these correlations have shown a high level of spatial and temporal specificity. These findings provide a case for the ability of trimodal recordings (EEG, MEG, and SEEG) to reach a greater level of specificity in the investigation of brain signals and functions.

Recent advances in biophysical modelling and signal processing make it possible to exploit information from other imaging modalities like structural MRI that provide high spatial resolution to overcome this constraint(1). This is especially useful for investigations that require high resolution in the temporal as well as spatial domain. In addition, due to the easy application and low cost of EEG recordings, EEG is often the method of choice when working with populations, such as young children, that do not tolerate functional MRI scans well. However, in order to investigate which neural substrates are involved, anatomical information from structural MRI is still needed. Most EEG analysis packages work with standard head models that are based on adult anatomy. The accuracy of these models when used for children is limited(2), because the composition and spatial configuration of head tissues changes dramatically over development(3). In the present paper, we provide an overview of our recent work in utilizing head models based on individual structural MRI scans or age specific head models to reconstruct the cortical generators of high density EEG. This article describes how EEG recordings are acquired, processed, and analyzed with pediatric populations at the London Baby Lab, including laboratory setup, task design, EEG preprocessing, MRI processing, and EEG channel level and source analysis.

However, the temporal dynamics of anticipation processes in relation to brain activation are still not fully understood. A modified version of the monetary incentive delay task was administered during separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) sessions in the same 25 participants to assess anticipatory processes with a multi-modal neuroimaging set-up. During fMRI, gain and loss anticipation were both associated with heightened activation in ventral striatum and reward-related areas. EEG revealed most pronounced P300 amplitudes for gain anticipation, whereas CNV amplitudes distinguished neutral from gain and loss anticipation. Importantly, P300, but not CNV amplitudes, were correlated to neural activation in the ventral striatum for both gain and loss anticipation. Larger P300 amplitudes indicated higher ventral striatum blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response. Early stimulus evaluation processes indexed by EEG seem to be positively related to higher activation levels in the ventral striatum, indexed by fMRI, which are usually associated with reward processing. The current results, however, point towards a more general motivational mechanism processing salient stimuli during anticipation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1 by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual stimulation and rest periods. Methods: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow. Results: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in both groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations, visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention observed in individuals with NF1.

J	Lee, GT; Lee, C; Kim, KH; Jung, KY				Lee, Gwan-Taek; Lee, Chany; Kim, Kyung Hwan; Jung, Ki-Young			Regional and inter-regional theta oscillation during episodic novelty processing	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Recognition; Novelty; Theta rhythm	HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; RETRIEVAL; RESPONSES; ODDBALL; ERP	Recent event-related potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that novelty processing may be involved in processes that recognize the meaning of a novel sound, during which widespread cortical regions including the right prefrontal cortex are engaged. However, it remains unclear how those cortical regions are functionally integrated during novelty processing. Because theta oscillation has been assumed to have a crucial role in memory operations, we examined local and inter-regional neural synchrony of theta band activity during novelty processing. Fifteen right-handed healthy university students participated in this study. Subjects performed an auditory novelty oddball task that consisted of the random sequence of three types of stimuli such as a target (1000 Hz pure tone), novel (familiar environmental sounds such as dog bark, buzz, car crashing sound and so on), and standard sounds (950 Hz pure tone). Event-related spectra perturbation (ERSP) and the phase-locking value (PLV) were measured from human scalp EEG during task. Non-parametric statistical tests were applied to test for significant differences between stimulus novelty and stimulus targets in ERSP and PLV. The novelty P3 showed significant higher amplitude and shorter latency compared with target P3 in frontocentral regions. Overall, theta activity was significantly higher in the novel stimuli compared with the target stimuli. Specifically, the difference in theta power between novel and target stimuli was most significant in the right frontal region. This right frontal theta activity was accompanied by phase synchronization with the left temporal region. Our results imply that theta phase synchronization between right frontal and left temporal regions underlie the retrieval of memory traces for unexpected but familiar sounds from long term memory in addition to working memory retrieval or novelty encoding.

The application has been developed for 25 Japanese syllabary (hiragana) characters using a two-step input procedure, in order to create an easy-to-use BCI-speller interface. In the proposed procedure, the user first selects the representative letter of a subset, defining the second step. In the second step, the final choice is made. At each interfacing step, the user's intentional choices are classified based on the P300 event related potential (ERP) responses captured in the EEG, as in the classic oddball paradigm. The BCI experiment and EEG results of the pilot study confirm the effectiveness of the proposed spelling method. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While it has been assumed that the basal ganglia play an important role in initiating these processes, the role of the striatal microstructure for these processes remains to be uncovered. Previous studies in basal ganglia diseases could not elucidate the relevance of the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) microstructure unambiguously because structural alterations occur together with alterations in various neurotransmitter systems. We present and examine a possible model that allows the examination of MSN dysfunction unbiased by other modulations, i.e. a case of 'benign hereditary chorea' (BHC) in comparison to healthy controls. We apply event-related potentials (ERPs) to uncover the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms underlying post-error behavioral adaptation. The BHC patient revealed a smaller error-related negativity (ERN) together with almost absent behavioral adaptation after an error and generally more error-prone behavior. Performance monitoring processes unrelated to errors, as well as response inhibition processes, were not affected in the BHC patient. The results suggest that the striatal MSN microstructural integrity is more important for error-related behavioral adaptation than for other response monitoring processes unrelated to errors.

We furthermore compared ERD/ERS measures with clinical scores and movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) amplitudes. Methods: Electroencephalograms were recorded while 21 ALS patients and 19 controls performed two self-paced motor tasks: sniffing and right index finger flexion. Based on Wavelet analysis the alpha and beta frequency bands were selected for subsequent evaluation. Results: Patients generated significantly smaller resting alpha spectral power density (SPD) and smaller beta ERD compared to controls. Additionally patients exhibited merely unilateral post-movement ERS (beta rebound) whereas this phenomenon was bilateral in controls. ERD/ERS amplitudes did not correlate with corresponding MRCPs for either patients or controls. Conclusions: The smaller resting alpha SPD and beta ERD and asymmetrical appearance of beta ERS in patients compared to controls could be the result of pyramidal cell degeneration and/or corpus callosum involvement in ALS. Significance: These results support the notion of reduced movement preparation in ALS involving also areas outside the motor cortex. Furthermore post-movement cortical inhibition seems to be impaired in ALS. ERD/ERS and MRCP are found to be independent measures of cortical motor functions in ALS.

De-noising with a SOCK can improve the performance of event-related ICA	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); independent component analysis (ICA); automated classification; artifacts; denoising; filter; event related ICA; Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TIME-SERIES; FMRI; EEG; REDUCTION; EPILEPSY; MOTION; BOLD	Event-related ICA (eICA) is a partially data-driven analysis method for event-related fMRI that is particularly suited to analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI of patients with epilepsy. EEG-fMRI studies in epileptic patients are typically analyzed using the general linear model (GLM), often with assumption that the onset and offset of neuronal activity match EEG event onset and offset, the neuronal activation is sustained at a constant level throughout the epileptiform event and that associated fMRI signal changes follow the canonical HRF The eICA method allows for less constrained analyses capable of detecting early, non-canonical responses. A key step of eICA is the initial deconvolution which can be confounded by various sources of structured noise present in the fMRI signal. To help overcome this, we have extend the eICA procedure by utilizing a fully standalone and automated fMRI de-noising procedure to process the fMRI data from an EEG-fMRI acquisition prior to running eICA. Specifically we first apply ICA to the entire fMRI time-series and use a classifier to remove noise-related components. The automated objective de-noiser, "Spatially Organized Component Klassificator" (SOCK) is used; it has previously been shown to distinguish a substantial fraction of noise from true activation, without rejecting the latter, in resting-state fMRI. A second ICA is then performed, this time on the event-related response estimates derived from the denoised data (according to the usual eICA procedure). We hypothesize that SOCK + eICA has the potential to be more sensitive than eICA alone. We test the effectiveness of SOCK by comparing activation obtained in an eICA analysis of EEG-fMRI data with and without the use of SOCK for 14 patients with rolandic epilepsy who exhibited stereotypical IEDs arising from a focus in the rolandic fissure.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback; ADHD; EEG; spectral analysis; attention; brain-behavior-relationship; subtypes	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RESTING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; THETA ACTIVITY; NETWORK TEST; CHILDREN	Objective: In children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an increased theta/beta ratio in the resting EEG typically serves as a rationale to conduct theta/beta neurofeedback (NE) training. However this finding is increasingly challenged. As NF may rather target an active than a passive state, we studied the EEG in a condition that requires attention. Methods: In children with ADHD of the DSM-IV combined type (ADHD-C; N = 15) and of the predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-I; N = 9) and in typically developing children (N = 19), EEG spectral analysis was conducted for segments during the attention network test (ANT) without processing of stimuli and overt behavior. Frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, Cz, C4) and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) electrodes were included in the statistical analysis. To investigate if EEG spectral parameters are related to performance measures, correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Particularly in the ADHD-C group, higher theta and alpha activity was found with the most prominent effect in the upper-theta/lower-alpha (5.5-10.5 Hz) range. In the ADHD-I group, a significantly higher theta/beta ratio was observed at single electrodes (F3, Fz) and a tendency for a higher theta/beta ratio when considering all electrodes (large effect size). Higher 5.5-10.5 Hz activity was associated with higher reaction time variability with the effect most prominent in the ADHD-C group. A higher theta/beta ratio was associated with higher reaction times, particularly in the ADHD-I group. Conclusions: (1) In an attention demanding period, children with ADHD are characterized by an underactivated state in the EEG with subtype-specific differences. (2) The functional relevance of related EEG parameters is indicated by associations with performance (reaction time) measures. (3) Findings provide a rationale for applying NF protocols targeting theta (and alpha) activity and the theta/beta ratio in subgroups of children with ADHD.

Sensory Gain Outperforms Efficient Readout Mechanisms in Predicting Attention-Related Improvements in Behavior	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; contrast discrimination; contrast response function; EEG; efficient readout; sensory gain	VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MACAQUE AREA V4; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; BILATERAL STIMULUS ARRAYS; AUDITORY SIGNAL-DETECTION; INDEX FOCUSED ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NORMALIZATION MODEL	Spatial attention has been postulated to facilitate perceptual processing via several different mechanisms. For instance, attention can amplify neural responses in sensory areas (sensory gain), mediate neural variability (noise modulation), or alter the manner in which sensory signals are selectively read out by postsensory decision mechanisms (efficient readout). Even in the context of simple behavioral tasks, it is unclear how well each of these mechanisms can account for the relationship between attention-modulated changes in behavior and neural activity because few studies have systematically mapped changes between stimulus intensity, attentional focus, neural activity, and behavioral performance. Here, we used a combination of psychophysics, event-related potentials (ERPs), and quantitative modeling to explicitly link attention-related changes in perceptual sensitivity with changes in the ERP amplitudes recorded from human observers. Spatial attention led to a multiplicative increase in the amplitude of an early sensory ERP component (the P1, peaking similar to 80-130 ms poststimulus) and in the amplitude of the late positive deflection component (peaking similar to 230-330 ms poststimulus). A simple model based on signal detection theory demonstrates that these multiplicative gain changes were sufficient to account for attention-related improvements in perceptual sensitivity, without a need to invoke noise modulation. Moreover, combining the observed multiplicative gain with a postsensory readout mechanism resulted in a significantly poorer description of the observed behavioral data. We conclude that, at least in the context of relatively simple visual discrimination tasks, spatial attention modulates perceptual sensitivity primarily by modulating the gain of neural responses during early sensory processing	[Itthipuripat, Sirawaj; Serences, John T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ester, Edward F.; Deering, Sean; Serences, John T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA		Itthipuripat, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Neurosci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.	itthipuripat.sirawaj@gmail.com; jserences@ucsd.edu	Deering, Sean/K-6059-2017	Deering, Sean/0000-0001-9369-1282; Itthipuripat, Sirawaj/0000-0001-9302-0964	National Institutes of Health [R01-MH092345]; James S.

BCI based on electrophysiological signals has enabled communication, using auditory or visual stimuli to elicit event-related potentials (ERPs). The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS) could elicit a P300 wave, using a vibrotactile oddball paradigm for establishing somatosensory BCI-based communication. Six chronic LIS patients performed 2 electroencephalography (EEG)-based vibrotactile P300 oddball tasks. After a simple mental counting task of the target stimuli, participants were instructed to answer 5 questions by counting the vibration on either the right wrist for "yes" or the left wrist for "no." All participants were able to elicit a P300 wave using the vibrotactile oddball paradigm BCI task. In the counting task, 4 patients got accuracies of 100% (average above chance). In the communication task, one patient achieved 100% accuracy (average above chance). We have shown the feasibility of eliciting a P300 response using vibrotactile stimulation in patients with LIS. The present study provides evidence that this approach can be used for EEG-based BCI communications in this patient group. This is the first study to prove the feasibility of a BCI based on somatosensory (vibratory) stimulation in a group of brain-injured patients. Furthermore, this approach could be used for the detection of consciousness in non-communicating patients due to severe brain injuries.

With this purpose in mind, we compared the categorization of speech, music, and neutral sounds between professional musicians, simultaneous interpreters (SIs), and controls in response to morphed speech-noise, music-noise, and speech-music continua. Our hypothesis was that music and language expertise will strengthen the memory representations of prototypical sounds, which act as a perceptual magnet for morphed variants. This means that the prototype would "attract" variants. This so-called magnet effect should be manifested by an increased assignment of morphed items to the trained category, by a reduced maximal slope of the psychometric function, as well as by differential event-related brain responses reflecting memory comparison processes (i.e., N400 and P600 responses). As a main result, we provide first evidence for a domain-specific behavioral bias of musicians and SIs toward the trained categories, namely music and speech. In addition, SIs showed a bias toward musical items, indicating that interpreting training has a generic influence on the cognitive representation of spectrotemporal signals with similar acoustic properties to speech sounds. Notably, EEG measurements revealed clear distinct N400 and P600 responses to both prototypical and ambiguous items between the three groups at anterior, central, and posterior scalp sites. These differential N400 and P600 responses represent synchronous activity occurring across widely distributed brain networks, and indicate a dynamical recruitment of memory processes that vary as a function of training and expertise.

Information about the structure of natural language can be valuable for BCI communication systems, but few attempts have been made to incorporate this domain knowledge into the classifier. In this study, we treat BCI communication as a hidden Markov model (HMM) where hidden states are target characters and the EEG signal is the visible output. Using the Viterbi algorithm, language information can be incorporated in classification and errors can be corrected automatically. This method was first evaluated offline on a dataset of 15 healthy subjects who had a significant increase in bit rate from a previously published naive Bayes approach and an average 32% increase from standard classification with dynamic stopping. An online pilot study of five healthy subjects verified these results as the average bit rate achieved using the HMM method was significantly higher than that using the naive Bayes and standard methods. These findings strongly support the integration of domain-specific knowledge into BCI classification to improve system performance and accuracy.

However, the relation between attention and prediction remains undetermined given the conflation of these two mechanisms in the literature. To evaluate whether attention and prediction are dependent of each other, and if so, how these two top-down mechanisms may interact in sensory processing, we orthogonally manipulated attention and prediction in a target detection task. Participants were instructed to pay attention to one of two interleaved stimulus streams of predictable/unpredictable tone frequency. We found that attention and prediction interacted on the amplitude of the N1 ERP component. The N1 amplitude in the attended/predictable condition was larger than that in any of the other conditions. Dipole source localization analysis showed that the effect came from the activation in bilateral auditory areas. No significant effect was found in the P2 time window. Our results suggest that attention and prediction are dependent of each other. While attention might determine the overall cortical responsiveness to stimuli when prediction is involved, prediction might provide an anchor for the modulation of the synaptic input strengths which needs to be operated on the basis of attention.

This study investigated neural control of a postural-suprapostural procedure when postural focus strategy varied. Twelve adults concurrently conducted force-matching and maintained stabilometer stance with visual feedback on ankle movement (visual internal focus, VIF) and on stabilometer movement (visual external focus, VEF). Force-matching error, dynamics of ankle and stabilometer movements, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were registered. Postural control with VEF caused superior force-matching performance, more complex ankle movement, and stronger kinematic coupling between the ankle and stabilometer movements than postural control with VIF. The postural focus strategy also altered ERP temporal-spatial patterns. Postural control with VEF resulted in later N1 with less negativity around the bilateral fronto-central and contralateral sensorimotor areas, earlier P2 deflection with more positivity around the bilateral fronto-central and ipsilateral temporal areas, and late movement-related potential commencing in the left frontal-central area, as compared with postural control with VIF. The time-frequency distribution of the ERP principal component revealed phase-locked neural oscillations in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) rhythms. The delta and theta rhythms were more pronounced prior to the timing of P2 positive deflection, and beta rebound was greater after the completion of force-matching in VEF condition than VIF condition. This study is the first to reveal the neural correlation of postural focusing effect on a postural-suprapostural task. Postural control with VEF takes advantage of efficient task-switching to facilitate autonomous postural response, in agreement with the "constrained-action" hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Investigating the age-related "anterior shift" in the scalp distribution of the P3b component using principal component analysis	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; EEG/ERP; Aging; PCA; Anterior shift; P3	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; VOLUNTARY ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS; NOVELTY; P300	An age-related anterior shift in the distribution of the P3b is often reported. Temporospatial principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate the basis of this observation. ERPs were measured in young and old adults during a visual oddball task. PCA revealed two spatially distinct factors in both age groups, identified as the posterior P3b and anterior P3a. Young subjects generated a smaller P3a than P3b, while old subjects generated a P3a that did not differ in amplitude from their P3b. Rather than having a more anteriorly distributed P3b, old subjects produced a large, temporally overlapping P3a. The pattern of the age-related anterior shift in the P3 was similar for target and standard stimuli. The increase in the P3a in elderly adults may not represent a failure to habituate the novelty response, but may reflect greater reliance on executive control operations (P3a) to carry out the categorization/updating process (P3b).

Analysis of P300 containing EEG through three Non-Linear Methods	2014 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, COMPUTING SCIENCE AND AUTOMATIC CONTROL (CCE)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	Campeche, MEXICO			ERPs; P300; DFA; Phase synchronisation; Sample entropy		Along the electroencephalography signal one may identify several frequency intervals as well as negative and positive potentials which are related to conscience states (e.g. awake and asleep) and to neuronal processes such as the response to a variety of stimuli and their interpretation. The P300 is among the latter. The fact that these potentials are the result of the sum of several neurons activation, which are in turn shaped by cognitive processes, makes the EEG signal a good candidate for three types of non-linear analysis: DFA, sample entropy and phase synchronization. All 3 methods showed a higher information production rate and hemisphere synchronization for EEG segments containing P300, when applied to the recordings of 2 subjects from a BCI database. The most significant one was a gamma=0.83 for the electrode pair PO3-PO4. Given that the differences between both studied patterns (visual ERP with and without P300), the measures obtained in this paper may be used as viable characteristics for the identification of such patterns.

In EEG recording, the signal obtained is not entirely derived from the brain, but may be contaminated by other signals such as Electrooculogram (EOG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electromiogram (EMG). EEG signals that recorded, especially by electrodes located near the eyes, will be affected by EOG. So that necessary action is needed to eliminate or reduce these EEG signals artifacts.

Shallow orthographies with consistent grapheme/phoneme correspondences favor encoding via non-lexical pathways, where each grapheme is sequentially mapped to its corresponding phoneme. In contrast, deep orthographies with inconsistent grapheme/phoneme correspondences favor lexical pathways, where phonemes are retrieved from specialized memory structures. This hypothesis, however, lacks compelling empirical support. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of orthographic depth on reading route selection using a within subject design. Method: We presented the same pseudowords (PWs) to highly proficient bilinguals and manipulated the orthographic depth of PW reading by embedding them among two separated German or French language contexts, implicating respectively, shallow or deep orthography. High density electroencephalography was recorded during the task. Results: The topography of the ERPs to identical PWs differed 300-360 ms post-stimulus on set when the PWs were read in different orthographic depth context, indicating distinct brain networks engaged in reading during this time window. The brain sources underlying these topographic effects were located within left inferior frontal (German>French), parietal (French>German) and cingular areas (German>French). Conclusion: Reading in a shallow context favors non-lexical pathways, reflected in a stronger engagement of frontal phonological areas in the shallow versus the deep orthographic context. In contrast, reading PW in a deep orthographic context recruits less routine nonlexical pathways, reflected in a stronger engagement of visuo-attentional parietal areas in the deep versus shallow orthographic context. These collective results support a modulation of reading route by orthographic depth.

The localization of the active sources which are responsible for such activation is termed as brain source localization. This process of source estimation with the help of EEG which is also known as EEG inverse problem is helpful to understand physiological, pathological, mental, functional abnormalities and cognitive behaviour of the brain. This understanding leads for the specification for diagnoses of various brain disorders such as epilepsy and tumour. Different approaches are devised to exactly localize the active sources with minimum localization error, less complexity and more validation which include minimum norm, low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA, exact LORETA, Multiple Signal classifier, focal under determined system solution etc. This paper discusses and compares the ability of localizing the sources for two low resolution methods i.e., sLORETA and eLORETA respectively. The ERP data with visual stimulus is used for comparison at four different time instants for both methods (sLORETA and eLORETA) and then corresponding activation in terms of scalp map, slice view and cortex map is discussed.

Human adults were trained with TDT for a single session of 1.5 h and their ERPs were measured on the following day. Behavioral performance showed that, after a same amount of exposure of the trained and untrained conditions during EEG session, learning effects were specific to the trained background orientation but generalized across target locations. ERP data, however, revealed both target-location and background-orientation specific changes. While the behavioral background-orientation specificity mainly involved amplitude enhancement of early N2pc over occipital cortex, behavioral target-location generalization was associated with modulation of tempo-spatial configurations of the N2pc component (early-occipital vs. late-parietal/temporal pattern) and decrease of frontal P2 amplitudes for the trained relative to the untrained condition. The earliest visual component Cl did not show specific effects for either background orientation or target location. These results indicated different brain mechanisms underlying the behavioral specificity and generalization of TDT learning. Based on the present findings and literatures, we propose that perceptual learning may induce not only enhancement of relatively early visual selection of the trained target among distractors but also decreases of top-down attention originating from high-level brain center. The reactivation of top-down attention control in some conditions (e.g., the untrained target-location condition) may compensate for the specific effect induced by the early visual selective attention mechanism, leading to generalization or less specificity of perceptual learning in behavioral performance.

Plasticity in Developing Brain: Active Auditory Exposure Impacts Prelinguistic Acoustic Mapping	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						acoustic mapping; developmental plasticity; EEG/ERP; human infant; prelinguistic; training	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CRITICAL PERIOD; ONSET TIME; CORTEX; INFANTS; DISCRIMINATION; CHILDREN	A major task across infancy is the creation and tuning of the acoustic maps that allow efficient native language processing. This process crucially depends on ongoing neural plasticity and keen sensitivity to environmental cues. Development of sensory mapping has been widely studied in animal models, demonstrating that cortical representations of the sensory environment are continuously modified by experience. One critical period for optimizing human language mapping is early in the first year; however, the neural processes involved and the influence of passive compared with active experience are as yet incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that, while both active and passive acoustic experience from 4 to 7 months of age, using temporally modulated nonspeech stimuli, impacts acoustic mapping, active experience confers a significant advantage. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we show that active experience increases perceptual vigilance/attention to environmental acoustic stimuli (e.g., larger and faster P2 peaks) when compared with passive experience or maturation alone. Faster latencies are also seen for the change discrimination peak (N2*) that has been shown to be a robust infant predictor of later language through age 4 years. Sharpening is evident for both trained and untrained stimuli over and above that seen for maturation alone. Effects were also seen on ERP morphology for the active experience group with development of more complex waveforms more often seen in typically developing 12- to 24-month-old children. The promise of selectively "fine-tuning" acoustic mapping as it emerges has far-reaching implications for the amelioration and/or prevention of developmental language disorders.

Although the neural underpinnings of this function have been investigated for decades and critical error-related components in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), such as the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), have been characterised, our understanding of the relative contributions of key neurotransmitters to the generation of these components remains limited. The current study sought to determine the effects of pharmacological manipulation of the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmitter systems on key behavioural and event-related potential correlates of error processing. A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design was employed. Monoamine levels were manipulated using the clinically relevant drugs methylphenidate, atomoxetine and citalopram, in comparison to placebo. Under each of the four drug conditions, participants underwent EEG recording while performing a flanker task. Only methylphenidate produced significant improvement in performance accuracy, which was without concomitant slowing of reaction time. Methylphenidate also increased the amplitude of an early electrophysiological index of error processing, the ERN. Citalopram increased the amplitude of the correct-response negativity, another component associated with response processing. The effects of methylphenidate in this study are consistent with theoretical accounts positing catecholamine modulation of error monitoring. Our data suggest that enhancing catecholamine function has the potential to remediate the error-monitoring deficits that are seen in a wide range of psychiatric conditions.	[Barnes, Jessica J.

Neural responses to the violations of such expectations are observed in event related potentials (ERPs) measured using electroencephalography. Most previous ERR studies demonstrating sensitivity to musical violations used stimuli that were temporally regular and musically structured, with less-frequent deviant events that differed from a specific expectation in some feature such as pitch, harmony, or rhythm. Here, we asked whether expectancies about Western musical scale are strong enough to elicit ERR deviance components. Specifically, we explored whether pitches inconsistent with an established scale context elicit deviant components even though equally rare pitches that fit into the established context do not, and even when their timing is unpredictable. We used Markov chains to create temporally irregular pseudo-random sequences of notes chosen from one of two diatonic scales. The Markov pitch-transition probabilities resulted in sequences that favored notes within the scale, but that lacked clear melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic structure. At the random positions, the sequence contained probe tones that were either within the established scale or were out of key. Our subjects ignored the note sequences, watching a self-selected silent movie with subtitles. Compared to the in-key probes, the out-of-key probes elicited a significantly larger P2 ERR component. Results show that random note sequences establish expectations of the "first-order" statistical property of musical key, even in listeners not actively monitoring the sequences	[Choi, Inyong; Bharadwaj, Hari M.; Bressler, Scott; Shinn-Cunningham, Barbara G.] Boston Univ, Ctr Computat Neurosci & Neural Technol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bharadwaj, Hari M.; Shinn-Cunningham, Barbara G.] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Loui, Psyche] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Psychol, Middletown, CT USA; [Loui, Psyche] Wesleyan Univ, Neurosci & Behav Program, Middletown, CT USA; [Lee, Kyogu] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Convergence Sci & Technol, Suwon, South Korea		Shinn-Cunningham, BG (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Ctr Computat Neurosci & Neural Technol, 677 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.	shinn@cns.bu.edu		Bharadwaj, Hari/0000-0001-8685-9630; Loui, Psyche/0000-0001-7664-6092	CELEST, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (NSF) [SMA-0835976]; National Security Science and Engineering Fellowship; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2013R1A6A3A03062982]	CELEST, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); National Security Science and Engineering Fellowship; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education	This project was supported in part by CELEST, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (NSF SMA-0835976), by a National Security Science and Engineering Fellowship to BGSC, and by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2013R1A6A3A03062982).		55	11	11	2	15	FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

Experimental Brain Research,184,105-113). Presumably, mental rehearsal must induce brain changes that facilitate motor learning. We tested this hypothesis by recording scalp electroencephalographic activity (EEG) in two groups of subjects. In one group, subjects executed a reach to grasp task for 240 trials. In the second group, subjects learned the task through a combination of mental rehearsal for the initial 180 trials followed by the execution of 60 trials. Thus, one group physically executed the task for 240 trials, the other only for 60 trials. Amplitudes and latencies of event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared across groups at different stages during learning. We found that ERP activity increases dramatically with training and reaches the same amplitude over the premotor regions in the two groups, despite large differences in physically executed trials. These findings suggest that during. mental rehearsal, neuronal changes occur in the motor networks that make physical practice after mental rehearsal more effective in configuring functional networks for skilful behaviour.

In this study, we have tried to find the relations of signal between adjoin nerve system and diverse hemisphere of brain. In literature, relationship this type between two independent variable is called correlation. The purpose of this statistical method is to give us a statistic known as the correlation coefficient which represents the degree of linear association between two measured variables [13]. Three different tests had been conducted to find the correlation between EEGs from the 'sensorimotor area channel' during the motor imagery tasks and medial nerve's conduction test as well. The correlation is calculated with respect to Event-Related-Potential (ERP)[1]. The events we have studied are relaxing state, motor activity and motor imagery task. Those data were then digitized, simulated and calculated the correlation in linear mode as well as in cross mode. Our study result shows that there are significant correlation exists between adjoin nerve system and diverse hemisphere of central nervous system of human.

The current study aims to explore the neural signature of both facets of attention, as well as their possible interactions in the context of auditory scenes. Using a paradigm with dynamic auditory streams with occasional salient events, we recorded neurophysiological responses of human listeners using EEG while manipulating the subjects' attentional state as well as the presence or absence of a competing auditory stream. Our results showed that salient events caused an increase in the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) irrespective of attentional state or complexity of the scene. Such increase supplemented ASSR increases due to task-driven attention. Salient events also evoked a strong N1 peak in the ERP response when listeners were attending to the target sound stream, accompanied by an MMN-like component in some cases and changes in the P1 and P300 components under all listening conditions. Overall, bottom-up attention induced by a salient change in the auditory stream appears to mostly modulate the amplitude of the steady-state response and certain event-related potentials to salient sound events; though this modulation is affected by top-down attentional processes and the prominence of these events in the auditory scene as well.

J	Nguyen, VT; Cunnington, R				Nguyen, Vinh T.; Cunnington, Ross			The superior temporal sulcus and the N170 during face processing: Single trial analysis of concurrent EEG-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Concurrent EEG-fMRI; Multimodal neuroimaging; Face processing; Single-trial ERP analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; INVERTED FACES; FUSIFORM GYRUS; HUMAN BRAIN; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL NETWORK; EYE GAZE	Face-selective neural signals have been reliably identified using both EEG and fMRI studies. These consist of the N170 component, a neural response peaking approximately 170 ms after a face is presented, and face-selective activations in the fusiform face area (FFA), the occipital face area (OFA), and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). As most neuroimaging studies examine these face-selective processes separately, the relationship between the N170 neural response and activation in the fusiform gyrus is still debated. In this study, we concurrently measured EEG and fMRI responses to upright faces, inverted faces, and objects to examine this association. We introduce a method for single-trial estimation of N170 amplitudes and correlation of the trial-by-trial variation in N170 neural responses with fMRI BOLD responses. For upright faces, BOLD responses in the right STS were negatively correlated with N170 amplitudes, showing greater activation on trials in which N170 amplitudes were larger (more negative). For inverted faces, a medial region of the fusiform gyrus (mFG) was positively correlated with N170 amplitudes, showing greater activation on trials in which N170 amplitudes were smaller (less negative). This result points to the STS as a crucial region for generating the N170 associated with face perception, and suggests that the mFG is additionally recruited for processing inverted faces, particularly on trials in which N170 is small. Despite the different time resolution of fMRI and EEG signals, our single-trial estimation and EEG-fMRI correlation method can reveal associations between activation in face-selective brain regions and neural processes at 170 ms associated with face perception.

To examine this question, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during a cued task-switching version of the Wisconsin card-sorting test. Each target card was announced by a tone cueing either to switch or repeat the task. Novel sound distracters were interspersed among trials. Time-frequency EEG analyses revealed bursts of delta (2-4Hz) power associated with enhanced nP3 amplitudes to both task-switch cues and novel distractersbut no association with target P3b. These findings indicate that the P300-delta response indexes contextual novelty regardless of whether novelty emanates from endogenous (new task rules) or exogenous (novel distracters) sources of information.

Improving data retention in EEG research with children using child-centered eye tracking	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Children; Eye tracking	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; LOOKING; INFANTS; FACES; ERP	Background: Event Related Potentials (ERPs) elicited by visual stimuli have increased our understanding of developmental disorders and adult cognitive abilities for decades; however, these studies are very difficult with populations who cannot sustain visual attention such as infants and young children. Current methods for studying such populations include requiring a button response, which may be impossible for some participants, and experimenter monitoring, which is subject to error, highly variable, and spatially imprecise. New method: We developed a child-centered methodology to integrate EEG data acquisition and eye-tracking technologies that uses "attention-getters" in which stimulus display is contingent upon the child's gaze. The goal was to increase the number of trials retained. Additionally, we used the eye-tracker to categorize and analyze the EEG data based on gaze to specific areas of the visual display, compared to analyzing based on stimulus presentation. Results compared with existing methods: The number of trials retained was substantially improved using the child-centered methodology compared to a button-press response in 7-8 year olds. In contrast, analyzing the EEG based on eye gaze to specific points within the visual display as opposed to stimulus presentation provided too few trials for reliable interpretation. Conclusions: By using the linked EEG-eye-tracker we significantly increased data retention. With this method, studies can be completed with fewer participants and a wider range of populations. However, caution should be used when epoching based on participants' eye gaze because, in this case, this technique provided substantially fewer trials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neural Potentials Disorder during Differential Psychoacoustic Experiment evaluated by Discrete Wavelet Analysis	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			DURATION DISCRIMINATION; ENTROPY	The aim of the paper is the assessment of neural potentials disorder during a differential sensitivity psychoacoustic procedure. Ten volunteers were asked to compare the duration of two acoustic pulses: one reference with stable duration of 500ms and one trial which varied from 420ms to 620ms. During the discrimination task, Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Event Related Potential (ERP) signals were recorded. The mean Relative Wavelet Energy (mRWE) and the normalized Shannon Wavelet Entropy (nSWE) are computed based on the Discrete Wavelet analysis. The results are correlated to the data derived by the psychoacoustic analysis on the volunteers responses. In most of the electrodes, when the duration of the trial pulse is 460ms and 560ms, there is an increase and a decrease in nSWE value, respectively, which is determined mostly by the mRWE in delta rhythm. These extrema are correlated to the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in pulses duration, calculated by psychoacoustic analysis. The dominance of delta rhythm during the whole auditory experiment is noteworthy. The lowest values of nSWE are noted in temporal lobe.

The ERN is thought to reflect cognitive control processes aiming to improve performance. As previous studies showed a modulation of the ERN amplitude throughout the execution of a learning task, this study aims to follow the ERN amplitude changes from early to late learning blocks in relation with concomitant motor sequence learning using a serial reaction time (SRT) task. Twenty-two healthy participants completed a SRT task during which continuous EEG activity was recorded. The SRT task consists of series of stimulus-response pairs and involves motor learning of a repeating sequence. Learning was computed as the difference in mean response time between the last sequence block and the last random blocks that immediately follows it (sequence-specific learning). Event-related potentials were analysed to measure ERN amplitude elicited by error commission. Results: Mean ERN amplitude difference between the first four learning blocks and the last four learning blocks of the SRT task correlated significantly with motor sequence learning as well as with overall response time improvement, such that those participants whose ERN amplitude most increased through learning blocks were also those who exhibited most SRT task improvements. In contrast, neither sequence-specific learning nor overall response time improvement across learning blocks were found to be related to averaged ERN amplitude from all learning blocks. Conclusion: Findings from the present study suggest that the ERN amplitude changes from early to late learning blocks occurring over the course of the SRT task, as opposed to the averaged ERN amplitude from all learning blocks, is more closely associated with learning of a motor sequence. These findings propose an improved electrophysiological marker to index change in cognitive control efficiency during motor sequence learning.

The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a learning-based task that relies heavily on executive functioning, in particular, attention shift and working memory. Performance during early and late phases of a series within the task represents learning and implementation of a newly learned rule. Here, we aimed to examine two event-related potentials associated with learning, feedback-related negativity (FRN)-P300 complex, in individuals with dyslexia performing the WCST. Methods: Adolescents with dyslexia and age-matched typical readers performed the Madrid card sorting test (MCST), a computerized version of the WCST. Task performance, reading measures, and cognitive measures were collected. FRN and the P300 complex were acquired using the event-related potentials methodology and were compared in early vs late errors within a series. Results: While performing the MCST, both groups showed a significant reduction in average reaction times and a trend toward decreased error rates. Typical readers performed consistently better than individuals with dyslexia. FRN amplitudes in early phases were significantly smaller in dyslexic readers, but were essentially equivalent to typical readers in the late phase. P300 amplitudes were initially smaller among readers with dyslexia and tended to decrease further in late phases. Differences in FRN amplitudes for early vs late phases were positively correlated with those of P300 amplitudes in the entire sample. Conclusion: Individuals with dyslexia demonstrate a behavioral and electrophysiological change within single series of the MCST. However, learning patterns seem to differ between individuals with dyslexia and typical readers. We attribute these differences to the lower baseline performance of individuals with dyslexia. We suggest that these changes represent a fast compensatory mechanism, demonstrating the importance of learning strategies on reading among individuals with dyslexia.

Neglect-like characteristics of developmental disregard in children with cerebral palsy revealed by event related potentials	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Unilateral cerebral palsy; Developmental disregard; Cognitive control; EEG; Event-related potentials; Executive functions; Neglect; Visuo-spatial attention	INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; CLASSIFICATION; IMPAIRMENTS; VALIDITY; WAVE	Background: Children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy (CP) often show diminished awareness of the remaining capacity of their affected upper limb. This phenomenon is known as Developmental Disregard (DD). DD has been explained by operant conditioning. Alternatively, DD can be described as a developmental delay resulting from a lack of use of the affected hand during crucial developmental periods. We hypothesize that this delay is associated with a general delay in executive functions (EF) related to motor behavior, also known as motor EFs. Methods: Twenty-four children with unilateral CP participated in this cross-sectional study, twelve of them diagnosed with DD. To test motor EFs, a modified go/nogo task was presented in which cues followed by go-or nogo-stimuli appeared at either the left or right side of a screen. Children had to press a button with the hand corresponding to the side of stimulus presentation. Apart from response accuracy, Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) extracted from the ongoing EEG were used to register covert cognitive processes. ERP N1, P2, N2, and P3 components elicited by cue-, go-, and nogo-stimuli were further analyzed to differentiate between different covert cognitive processes. Results: Children with DD made more errors. With respect to the ERPs, the P3 component to go-stimuli was enhanced in children with DD. This enhancement was related to age, such that younger children with DD showed stronger enhancements. In addition, in DD the N1 component to cue-and go-stimuli was decreased. Conclusions: The behavioral results show that children with DD experience difficulties when performing the task. The finding of an enhanced P3 component to go-stimuli suggests that these difficulties are due to increased mental effort preceding movement. As age in DD mediated this enhancement, it seems that this increased mental effort is related to a developmental delay. The additional finding of a decreased N1 component in DD furthermore suggests a general diminished visuo-spatial attention. This effect reveals that DD might be a neuropsychological phenomenon similar to post-stroke neglect syndrome that does not resolve during development. These findings suggest that therapies aimed at reducing neglect could be a promising addition to existing therapies for DD.	[Zielinski, Ingar M.; Steenbergen, Bert; Baas, C.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Online Motor Correction Processing Revealed by High-density Electroencephalography	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; KINEMATIC PROPERTIES; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; EEG DYNAMICS; HAND; REACH; RECOVERY; STROKE	The ability to control online motor corrections is key to dealing with unexpected changes arising in the environment with which we interact. How the CNS controls online motor corrections is poorly understood, but evidence has accumulated in favor of a submovement-based model in which apparently continuous movement is segmented into distinct submovements. Although most studies have focused on submovements' kinematic features, direct links with the underlying neural dynamics have not been extensively explored. This study sought to identify an electroencephalographic signature of submovements. We elicited kinematic submovements using a double-step displacement paradigm. Participants moved their wrist toward a target whose direction could shift mid-movement with a 50% probability. Movement kinematics and cortical activity were concurrently recorded with a low-friction robotic device and high-density electroencephalography. Analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activation and its correlation with movement kinematics showed that the production of each kinematic submovement was accompanied by (1) stereotyped topographic scalp maps and (2) frontoparietal ERPs time-locked to submovements. Positive ERP peaks from frontocentral areas contralateral to the moving wrist preceded kinematic submovement peaks by 220-250 msec and were followed by positive ERP peaks from contralateral parietal areas (140-250 msec latency, 0-80 msec before submovement peaks). Moreover, individual subject variability in the latency of frontoparietal ERP components following the target shift significantly predicted variability in the latency of the corrective submovement. Our results are in concordance with evidence for the intermittent nature of continuous movement and elucidate the timing and role of frontoparietal activations in the generation and control of corrective submovements.

Among others, P300-based BCIs, which resort to EEG measurements, have been successfully operated by people with severe neuromuscular disabilities. Besides reducing the number of stimuli repetitions needed to detect the P300, a current challenge in P300-based BCI research is the simplification of system's setup and maintenance by lowering the number N of recording channels. By using offline data collected in 30 subjects (21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and 9 controls) through a clinical BCI with N = 5 channels, in the present paper we show that a preprocessing approach based on a Bayesian single-trial ERP estimation technique allows reducing N to 1 without affecting the system's accuracy. The potentially great benefit for the practical usability of BCI devices (including patient acceptance) that would be given by the reduction of the number N of channels encourages further development of the present study, for example, in an online setting.

However, little is known about the neuronal underpinnings and temporal dynamics of working memory mechanisms in healthy aging which are necessary to understand the age-related changes. To this end, 36 young and 36 old healthy individuals performed a 2-back task and a 0-back control task, while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Participants were instructed to press a response key whenever a target appeared and not to respond in case of nontargets. Expectedly, older participants showed considerably slower RTs and significantly higher rates of omitted targets and false alarms than young participants in the 2-back task, whereas no age-group difference in detection rate was found in the 0-back task. From the EEG event-related potentials as well as time-frequency plots were computed. The ERPs showed a general delay of the frontocentral N2, and an attenuation and delay of both the P3a and P3b in older versus younger adults. Importantly, the frontal P3a was reduced in older adults in the 2-back task. Time-frequency decomposition revealed consistently lower power in frontal theta (6 Hz) and parietal alpha (9-11 Hz) frequency range in older versus younger adults whereas no age-related differences were found in the delta frequency range. Task unspecific reduction of posterior alpha in elderly was paralleled by a reduction of the P3b. In contrast, the older adults had a strongly reduced frontal theta power in the 2-back task, which parallels the P3a reduction in the ERPs. The widespread reduction of alpha may indicate that older adults needed to recruit more attentional resources for successful task performance, whereas reduced frontal theta may indicate that older adults are less able to recruit frontal resources related to top-down control with increasing task demands. This suggests a less efficient fronto-parietal network synchronicity in older individuals that leads to deficits in identification and maintenance of task relevant stimuli.

Neuroimaging studies have identified brain structures involved in the processing of hierarchical stimuli but the precise temporal dynamics of brain activity associated with such processing remains largely unknown. Here, we used electroencephalography to examine the effect of social hierarchy on neural responses elicited by faces. In contrast to previous studies, the key manipulation was that a hierarchical context was constructed, not by varying facial expressions, but by presenting neutral-expression faces in a game setting. Once the performance-based hierarchy was established, participants were presented with high-rank, middle-rank and low-rank player faces and had to evaluate the rank of each face with respect to their own position. Both event-related potentials and task-related oscillatory activity were investigated. Three main findings emerge from the study. First, the experimental manipulation had no effect on the early N170 component, which may suggest that hierarchy did not modulate the structural encoding of neutral-expression faces. Second, hierarchy significantly modulated the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) within a 400-700 ms time-window, with more a prominent LPP occurring when the participants processed the face of the highest-rank player. Third, high-rank faces were associated with the highest reduction of alpha power. Taken together these findings provide novel electrophysiological evidence for enhanced allocation of attentional resource in the presence of high-rank faces. At a broader level, this study brings new insights into the neural processing underlying social categorization.

It has also been identified with the P3 (P600-as-P3 hypothesis), which is thought to reflect a systemic neuromodulator release facilitating behavioural shifts and is usually response time aligned. We investigated single-trial alignment of the P600 to response, a critical prediction of the P600-as-P3 hypothesis. Participants heard sentences containing morphosyntactic and semantic violations and responded via a button press. The elicited P600 was perfectly response aligned, while an N400 following semantic deviations was stimulus aligned. This is, to our knowledge, the first single-trial analysis of language processing data using within-sentence behavioural responses as temporal covariates. Results support the P600-as-P3 perspective and thus constitute a step towards a neurophysiological grounding of language-related ERPs. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The categorization will be realized by equivalent current dipole source localization (ECDL). To analyze this, we used EEG data and visually evoked related potentials (v-ERP) led by 32 electrodes. From the result of single-trial v-ERP, only 6 electrode v-ERPs have a remarkable reaction. Therefore, from the view point of business, it is found that the minimum number of electrodes have been seven.

Neuropsychological abnormalities in children with the Panayiotopoulos syndrome point to parietal lobe dysfunction	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Panayiotopoulos syndrome; EEG; Neuropsychology; Parietal lobe	EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ORIGIN; TESTS	Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) is a common epilepsy syndrome associated with rare clinical seizures and unknown localization of the epileptogenic area. Despite findings of normal development in patients with PS, recent neuropsychological studies point to subtle and diverse cognitive impairments. No well-outlined hypothesis about the localization of the brain dysfunction responsible for these impairments has been proposed. We further explored the cognitive dysfunctions in PS andmade inferences on the most likely anatomical localization of brain impairment. A group of 19 patients (aged 6-12) with PS was rated according to spike activity and lateralization. The patients were submitted to a neuropsychological evaluation to assess general intelligence, memory, language, visual-perceptual abilities, attention, and executive functions. Using 35-channel scalp EEG recordings, the N170 face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) was obtained to assess the functional integrity of the ventral pathway. All patients with PS showed normal IQ but subtle and consistent neurocognitive impairments. Namely, we found abnormalities in the copy task of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure and in the Narrative Memory Test. There was no correlation between neuropsychological impairments with spike activity and hemispheric spike lateralization. The N170 ERP was normal in all patients except for one. Our neuropsychological findings demonstrate impairments in visual-perceptual abilities and in semantic processing. These findings, paired with the absence of occipital lobe dysfunction in all neuropsychological studies of PS performed to this date, support the existence of parietal lobe dysfunction.

But, people cannot feel auditory change when auditory brain areas are damaged, in this paper a novel evaluation method is proposed based on induced event-related coherence (ERCoh), which quantified auditory brain areas response during auditory input change. To investigate the functional coupling of brain areas under auditory stimuli, sixty-four-channel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded for 14 subjects who were asked to listen different sounds. ERCoh of the EEG different bands (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and gamma) was calculated and compared statistically among different stimuli. The results suggest that alpha frequency band may reflect the cerebral processing of auditory changes by showing differential ERCoh phenomena among standard-, deviant-and novel-elicited responses. The bilateral hemisphere coherence of the standard stimulus is higher than the deviant and novel stimulus in alpha band. For each stimulus, the coherence difference was clearly larger in the right hemisphere, which is mainly involved in auditory perception. Furthermore, the right frontal and temporal ERCoh is brought about by an increase in auditory changes. Thus, induced ERCoh does not only appear to be generated by distinct neurophysiological mechanisms but also differ with regard to their functional significance to evaluation auditory brain areas impairment. In addition, EEG classification task is accomplished based on ERCoh for potential BCI applications, which provide potentially the only communication channel for severely disabled people who are otherwise unable to articulate their thoughts and needs, Therefore, ERCoh is a very promising approach in the future.

While psychometrics measures brain functions in terms of behavioral parameters, a recently emerged branch of neuroscience called neuro-metrics relies on measuring the electrophysiological parameters of brain functioning. There are two approaches in neurometrics. The first relies on the spectral characteristics of spontaneous electroencephalograms (EEG) and measures deviations from normality in EEG recorded in the resting state. The second approach relies on event-related potentials (ERPs) that measure the electrical responses of the brain to stimuli and actions in behavioral tasks. The present study reviews recent research on the application of ERPs for the discrimination of different types of brain dysfunction. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is used as an example. It is shown that the diagnostic power of ERPs is enhanced by the recent emergence of new methods of analysis, such as independent component analysis (ICA) and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA).

Event-related oscillations (ERO) may provide a useful tool for the identification of cognitive deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we investigate peak-to-peak amplitude of auditory eventrelated delta oscillations of MCI subjects. Method. The study included twenty-two consecutive patients with MCI recruited in neurology clinic and 21 age-and education-matched normal elderly controls. A classical auditory oddball paradigm was used in the experiments. EEG was recorded from F-3, F-z, F-4, C-3, C-z, C-4, P-3, P-z, P-4, O-1, O-z, and O-2 locations. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-2.2Hz) weremeasured. Results. The amplitudes between groups differed significantly at the frontal and mid-centroparietal locations. ANOVA on delta responses revealed a significant effect for groups (F-(1.41) = 4.84, P = 0.033), indicating a larger delta response for healthy controls thanMCI subjects. Post hoc comparisons revealed that peak-to-peak delta response was significantly larger for healthy controls than for MCI over electrode sites F-3, F-z, F-4, C-z, C-4, and Pz. Discussion. Event-related delta frequency band seems to be the most affected oscillatory response in cognitive impairment due to AD. Therefore, it deserves to be investigated as a candidate electrophysiological biomarker in further studies.

In recent years, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have become mature enough to immensely benefit from the expertise and tools established in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). One of the core objectives in HCI research is the design of systems that provide a pleasurable user experience (UX). While the majority of BCI studies exclusively evaluate common efficiency measures such as classification accuracy and speed, single research groups have begun to look at further usability aspects such as ease of use, workload and learnability. However, these evaluation metrics only cover pragmatic aspects of UX while still not considering the hedonic quality of UX. In order to gain a holistic perspective on UX, hedonic quality aspects such as motivation and frustration were also taken into account for our evaluation of three BCI-driven interfaces, which were proposed to be used as a two-stage neuroprosthetic control within the EU project MUNDUS. Approach. At the first stage, one of six possible actions was selected and either confirmed or cancelled at the second stage. For the experiment, a solely event-related-potential-based interface (ERP-ERP) and two hybrid solutions were tested that were controlled by ERP and motor imagery (MI)-resulting in the two possible combinations: ERP selection/MI confirmation (ERP-MI) or MI selection/ERP confirmation (MI-ERP). Behavioural, subjective and encephalographic (EEG) data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during an online experiment with the three graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Main results. Results showed a significantly greater pragmatic quality (in terms of accuracy, efficiency, workload, use quality and learnability) for the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs in contrast to the MI-ERP GUI. Consequently, the MI-ERP GUI is least suited for use as a neuroprosthetic control. With respect to the comparison of the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs, no significant differences in pragmatic and hedonic quality of UX were found. Since throughout better results were obtained for the conventional approach and it was most preferred by the subjects, the ERP-ERP GUI seems more suitable for its deployment in actual end-users. Nevertheless, for individuals with stable MI patterns, the hybrid interface can be provided as an additional option of choice within the MUNDUS framework. Significance. Although the paramount goal in BCI research still remains the improvement of classification accuracy and communication speed, it is of significance to note that it is equally important for end-users to keep up their motivation and prevent frustration. By including pragmatic as well as hedonic quality aspects, this study is the first effort to gain a holistic perspective of the UX while interacting with BCI-driven assistive technology aimed at actual end-users. The broad-scale methodology provided valuable insights into the underlying dynamics causing the users' experience to differ across the GUIs. The results will be used to refine a BCI-driven neuroprosthesis and test it with end-users.

However, difficulties have been associated with the study of motor inhibitory processing because of the absence of actual behavioral performance. Therefore, non-invasive neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods including electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and functional magnetic resonance imaging have been used to investigate neural processes in the central nervous system. We mainly reviewed research on somato-motor inhibitory processing based on data obtained by using these techniques, which can examine 'when', 'where, and 'how' motor inhibition occurs in the brain. Although to date a number of studies have used these techniques separately, few studies have utilized them in a comprehensive manner. In this review, we provide evidence that combining neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods should contribute to our understanding of how executive and inhibitory functions are implemented.

Somatotopic organization between adjacent dermatomes and differences in cortical coding of similarly perceived nociceptive stimulation are less well studied. Here, cortical processing following contact heat nociceptive stimulation of cervical (C4, C6, and C8) and trunk (T10) dermatomes were recorded in 20 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Stimulation of T10 compared with the C6 and C8 revealed significant higher response intensity in the left S1 (contralateral) and the right S2 (ipsilateral) even when the perceived pain was equal between stimulation sites. Accordingly, contact heat evoked potentials following stimulation of T10 showed significantly higher N2P2 amplitudes compared to C6 and C8. Adjacent dermatomes did not reveal a distinct somatotopical representation. Within the assessed cervical and trunk dermatomes, nociceptive cortical processing to heat differs significantly in magnitude even when controlling for pain perception.

Specially recorded data during a continuous performance task from 10 ADHD and 11 healthy control subjects were analyzed. Behavioral measures showed that the inconsistency in response speed were significantly greater in adults with ADHD compared to control subjects (p = 0.009). ERP data revealed ADHD group compared to healthy controls had a significant increase in N2 amplitudes while P3 amplitudes' decreased particularly for shorter inter-stimulus intervals. Furthermore, N2 amplitude correlated with the number of ADHD symptoms. These results confirm the utility of the iICA method in discrimination between adults with ADHD and healthy comparison controls and strongly suggest that this method can be used for further evaluation of cognitive functioning.

Yet, it is a disorder with its own course and morbidity that can persist if untreated. This chapter describes the physiological correlates of insomnia expressed during sleep and during the daytime. Together, the data from nighttime and daytime electrophysiology, event-related brain potential recording, neuroimaging studies, sympathetic nervous system, and HPA axis monitoring all suggest that insomnia is a 24 h disorder of hyperarousal.

On the effect of subliminal priming on subjective perception of images: a machine learning approach	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			PICTURES	The research presented in this article investigates the influence of subliminal prime words on peoples' judgment about images, through electroencephalograms (EEGs). In this cross domain priming paradigm, the participants are asked to rate how much they like the stimulus images, on a 7-point Likert scale, after being subliminally exposed to masked lexical prime words, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Statistical analysis tools are used to analyze the effect of priming on behavior, and machine learning techniques to infer the primes from EEGs. The experiment reveals strong effects of subliminal priming on the participants' explicit rating of images. The subjective judgment affected by the priming makes visible change in event-related potentials (ERPs); results show larger ERP amplitude for the negative primes compared with positive and neutral primes. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers are proposed to infer the prime types from the average ERPs, which yields a classification rate of 70%.

J	Sela, I				Sela, Itamar			Visual and auditory synchronization deficits among dyslexic readers as compared to non-impaired readers: a cross-correlation algorithm analysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dyslexia; asynchrony; crossmodal integration; EEG; ERP; cross-correlation analysis	MODAL BINDING; SPECIAL-ISSUE; SPEECH; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; RESPONSES; PRINT; DISCRIMINATION; OSCILLATIONS	Visual and auditory temporal processing and crossmodal integration are crucial factors in the word decoding process. The speed of processing (SOP) gap (Asynchrony) between these two modalities, which has been suggested as related to the dyslexia phenomenon, is the focus of the current study. Nineteen dyslexic and 17 non-impaired University adult readers were given stimuli in a reaction time (RT) procedure where participants were asked to identify whether the stimulus type was only visual, only auditory or crossmodally integrated. Accuracy, RT, and Event Related Potential (ERP) measures were obtained for each of the three conditions. An algorithm to measure the contribution of the temporal SOP of each modality to the crossmodal integration in each group of participants was developed. Results obtained using this model for the analysis of the current study data, indicated that in the crossmodal integration condition the presence of the auditory modality at the pre-response time frame (between 170 and 240 ms after stimulus presentation), increased processing speed in the visual modality among the non-impaired readers, but not in the dyslexic group. The differences between the temporal SOP of the modalities among the dyslexics and the non-impaired readers give additional support to the theory that an asynchrony between the visual and auditory modalities is a cause of dyslexia.

Towards obtaining spatiotemporally precise responses to continuous sensory stimuli in humans: A general linear modeling approach to EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						VEP; VESPA; EEG; Impulse response; Motion; Dorsal stream	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-MOTION; EARLY VEP; AREAS V6; REPRESENTATION; CORTEX; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION	Noninvasive investigation of human sensory processing with high temporal resolution typically involves repeatedly presenting discrete stimuli and extracting an average event-related response from scalp recorded neuroelectric or neuromagnetic signals. While this approach is and has been extremely useful, it suffers from two drawbacks: a lack of naturalness in terms of the stimulus and a lack of precision in terms of the cortical response generators. Here we show that a linear modeling approach that exploits functional specialization in sensory systems can be used to rapidly obtain spatiotemporally precise responses to complex sensory stimuli using electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate the method by example through the controlled modulation of the contrast and coherent motion of visual stimuli. Regressing the data against these modulation signals produces spatially focal, highly temporally resolved response measures that are suggestive of specific activation of visual areas V1 and V6, respectively, based on their onset latency, their topographic distribution and the estimated location of their sources. We discuss our approach by comparing it with fMRI/MRI informed source analysis methods and, in doing so, we provide novel information on the timing of coherent motion processing in human V6. Generalizing such an approach has the potential to facilitate the rapid, inexpensive spatiotemporal localization of higher perceptual functions in behaving humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Event-related potentials associated with BCI errors have the potential to be used as online labels for adaptation of BCI classifiers; however, detection of event-related potentials is imperfect, which makes this a partially supervised classification problem. In this study, two linear binary classifiers are adapted using uncertain labels on artificial data sets representing various scenarios of concept drift as well as on a real motor imagery BCI data set. Both perfectly and imperfectly simulated labels are incorporated into the classifiers which are adapted in the following two ways: (i) only after trials where BCI mistakes were detected and (ii) after every trial regardless of whether or not an error was detected. We find that all data sets benefit from adaptation using imperfect labels and that adapting after all trials results in better performance than adapting only after detected errors, especially when the labels are imperfect and the classes are inseparable.

In particular, using an electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, this study aimed to explore how users physiologically respond to the avatars wearing their own faces. 25 undergraduate students participated in an ERP-based experiment at a large university in Seoul, Korea. In the 2x4 within-subjects factorial design, each subject was exposed to the eight combinations of two types of face presentations (photo faces vs. avatar faces) and four categories of faces (self-faces, famous faces, ideal faces, unfamiliar faces). The findings demonstrated that users paid much more attention to their own faces than to other faces regardless of the face presentation type. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that the brain potential signals of EEG can be utilized for understanding the relationship between human face-recognition system and self-presence in the domain of virtual avatars.

Several methods have been implemented mainly based on adaptive filtering in order to solve this problem. This work presents an algorithm for removing peak and spike artifacts based on a threshold built on the analytic signal envelope. The algorithm was tested on simulated and real EEG signals that contain peak and spike artifacts with random amplitude and frequency occurrence. The performance of the filter was compared with commonly used adaptive filters. Three indexes were used for testing the performance of the filters: Correlation coefficient (p), mean of coherence function (C), and rate of absolute error (RAE). All these indexes were calculated between filtered signal and original signal without noise. It was found that the new proposed filter was able to reduce the amplitude of peak and spike artifacts with rho > 0.85, C > 0.8, and RAE < 0.5. These values were significantly better than the performance of LMS adaptive filter (rho < 0.85, C < 0.6, and RAE > 1). (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Whereas most neurophysiologically based research in ASD to date has focussed on case-control differences based on the DSM- or ICD-based categorical ASD diagnosis, more recent studies have aimed at studying genetically and/or neurophysiologically defined homogeneous ASD subgroups for specific neuronal biomarkers. This review addresses the neurophysiological investigation of ASD by evoked and event-related potentials, by EEG/MEG connectivity measures such as coherence, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. As an example of classical neurophysiological studies in ASD, we report event-related potential studies which have illustrated which brain areas and processing stages are affected in the visual perception of socially relevant stimuli. However, a paradigm shift has taken place in recent years focussing on how these findings can be tracked down to basic neuronal functions such as deficits in cortico-cortical connectivity and the interaction between brain areas. Disconnectivity, for example, can again be related to genetically induced shifts in the excitation/inhibition balance. Genetic causes of ASD may be grouped by their effects on the brain's system level to identify ASD subgroups which respond differentially to therapeutic interventions.	[Luckhardt, C.; Jarczok, T.

In quiet environments, bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users show high speech recognition performance, but localization of auditory speech is poor, especially when discriminating stimuli from the same hemifield. Whether this difficulty relates to the inability of the auditory system to translate binaural electrical cues into neural signals, or to a functional reorganization of auditory cortical pathways following long periods of binaural deprivation is unknown. In this electroencephalography study, we examined the processing of auditory syllables in postlingually deaf adults with bilateral CIs and in normal-hearing adults. Participants were instructed to either recognize (recognition task) or localize (localization task) the syllables. The analysis focused on event-related potentials and oscillatory brain responses. N1 amplitudes in CI users were larger in the localization compared with recognition task, suggesting an enhanced stimulus processing effort in the localization task. Linear beamforming of oscillatory activity in CI users revealed stronger suppression of beta-band activity after 200 ms in the postero-dorsal auditory pathway for the localization compared with the recognition task. In normal-hearing adults, effects for longer latency event-related potentials were found, but no effects were observed for N1 amplitudes or beta-band responses. Our study suggests that difficulties in speech localization in bilateral CI users are not reflected in a functional reorganization of cortical auditory pathways. New signal processing strategies of cochlear devices preserving unambiguous binaural cues may improve auditory localization performance in bilateral CI users. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3107-3121, 2014.

In addition, an extension of this methodology based on multiresolution quantities, called wavelet leaders, is presented. In particular, the temporal evolution of Shannon entropy and the statistical complexity evaluated with different sets of multiresolution wavelet coefficients are considered. Both methodologies are applied to the quantitative EEG time series analysis of a tonic-clonic epileptic seizure, and comparative results are presented. In particular, even when both methods describe the dynamical changes of the EEG time series, the one based on wavelet leaders presents a better time resolution.

The main goals of genetic psychophysiology are to elucidate the neural pathways and mechanisms mediating genetic influences on cognition and emotion, identify intermediate brain-based phenotypes for psychopathology, and provide a functional characterization of genes being discovered by large association studies of behavioral phenotypes. Since the initiation of this neurogenetic approach to human individual differences in the 1970s, numerous twin and family studies have provided strong evidence for heritability of diverse aspects of brain function including resting-state brain oscillations, functional connectivity, and event-related neural activity in a variety of cognitive and emotion processing tasks, as well as peripheral psychophysiological responses. These data indicate large differences in the presence and strength of genetic influences across measures and domains, permitting the selection of heritable characteristics for gene finding studies. More recently, candidate gene association studies began to implicate specific gerietic variants in different aspects of neurocognition. However, great caution is needed in pursuing this line of research due to its demonstrated proneness to generate false-positive findings. Recent developments in methods for physiological signal analysis, hemodynamic imaging, and genomic technologies offer new exciting opportunities for the investigation of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of individual differences in behavior, both normal and abnormal.

However, neural correlates underlying this deficit in interference control in the LD are still unknown. In this study, we recruited a group of children with LD (age: 10.78 +/- 0.52) along with an age-matched control group (age: 10.74 +/- 0.86) and asked them to perform a numerical Stroop task. During the task, we used electroencephalogram (EEG) to record their event-related potentials (ERPs). We further evaluated performance of these children on a battery of tests, including the Academic Adaptability Test (AAT), an adapted Chinese version of Pupil Rating Scale (PRS), and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM). Children's scores on recent math and Chinese exams were also obtained. Results showed that: 1) children with LD had worse performance in the incongruent condition of the numerical Stroop task suggesting that children with LD had interference control deficits but not basic numerical cognition; 2) children with LD had larger N450 effects on the frontal and posterior sites, but did not show any difference in early ERP components, suggesting that the behavioral difference was related with interference control rather than early visual perception processing; and 3) N450 effects were correlated with accuracy in the numerical Stroop task, performance in Raven's SPM, as well as school math performance. These results suggest that N450 can serve as a potential electrophysiology marker for identifying and potentially, providing targeted intervention for children with LD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two independent forms of IOR have been theorized: input-based IOR occurs when the oculomotor system is quiescent, while output-based IOR occurs when the oculomotor system is engaged. EEG studies forbidding eye movements have demonstrated that reductions of target-elicited P1 components are correlated with IOR magnitude, but when eye movements occur, P1 effects bear no relationship to behavior. We expand on this work by adapting the cueing paradigm and recording event-related potentials: IOR is caused by oculomotor responses to central arrows or peripheral onsets and measured by key presses to peripheral targets. Behavioral IOR is observed in both conditions, but P1 reductions are absent in the central arrow condition. By contrast, arrow and peripheral cues enhance Nd, especially over contralateral electrode sites.

To investigate if cortical processing of intrinsic information in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is different from healthy children and, if so, whether it resolves with treatment, we used heartbeat as a source of interoceptive event-related brain potentials. Objectives: To investigate heartbeat evoked potentials (HEP) during sleep in healthy children and in children with SDB before and after treatment and to explore if there are any associations between HEP and daytime behavioral deficits in children with SDB. Methods: Heartbeat-aligned EEG was assessed for presence of HEP within stage 2, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep in 40 children with primarily mild to moderate SDB before and after adenotonsillectomy and in 40 matched control subjects at similar time points. Measurements and Main Results: In both groups, nonrandom HEP were present in all sleep stages analyzed; however, amplitude of HEP were significantly lower in children with SDB during non-REM sleep (stage 2: P = 0.03; slow-wave sleep: P = 0.001). This between-group difference was not significant post adenotonsillectomy. Significant negative associations between HEP and daytime behavioral scores were observed at baseline. Conclusions: Children with SDB displayed reduced HEP amplitude during sleep, which might be indicative of changes in afferent sensory inputs to the brain and/or signify differences in sensory gating of cardiac-related information in the insular cortex. Adenotonsillectomy appears to reverse this effect.

Theoretically, the escaping odorous airflow is able to stimulate the contralateral chemosensory receptors and might activate the olfactory or the trigeminal brain processes. Testing 18 healthy subjects, we were able to show that it was possible to generate CSERP by strictly monorhinal stimulation with closed contralateral nostril. That means that the rectangular shapes of the brief chemosensory stimuli were not disturbed. The latencies of N1 and P2 and the amplitudes (N1P2) of CSERP (stimulants: H2S and CO2) were not different with either open or closed contralateral nostril. The induced CSERP were independent of stimulated nostril side. Additionally we found that with closed contralateral nostril more than 90% of passive monorhinal chemosensory stimuli were perceived. In further imaging studies the presented paradigm should be applied with strictly monorhinal stimulation to investigate the chemosensory processing pathways with high time resolution (EEG/MEG).

Participants read emotionally negative, neutral and positive nouns while performing a color detection task in which only perceptual-level analysis was required. Event-related potentials and time frequency representations were computed from the concurrently measured EEG. Negative words elicited a larger P2 and a larger late positivity than positive and neutral words, indicating deeper semantic/evaluative processing of negative words. In addition, sustained alpha power suppressions were found for the emotional compared to neutral words, in the time range from 500 to 1000 ms post-stimulus. These results suggest that sustained attention was allocated to the emotional words, whereas the attention allocated to the neutral words was released after an initial analysis. This seems to hold even when the emotional content of the words is task-irrelevant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Network dynamics predict improvement in working memory performance following donepezil administration in healthy young adults	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						BNA; Donepezil; Working memory; Cognitive enhancement; EEG	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CHOLINERGIC ENHANCEMENT; ALPHA SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTIONAL FUNCTIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE	Attentional selection in the context of goal-directed behavior involves top-down modulation to enhance the contrast between relevant and irrelevant stimuli via enhancement and suppression of sensory cortical activity. Acetylcholine (ACh) is believed to be involved mechanistically in such attention processes. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic levels of ACh, on the relationship between performance and network dynamics during a visual working memory (WM) task involving relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded in 14 healthy young adults while they performed a selective face/scene working memory task. Each participant received either placebo or donepezil (5 mg, orally) on two different visits in a double-blinded study. To investigate the effects of donepezil on brain network dynamics we utilized a novel EEG-based Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis method that isolates location-time-frequency interrelations among event-related potential (ERP) peaks and extracts condition-specific networks. The activation level of the network modulated by donepezil, reflected in terms of the degree of its dynamical organization, was positively correlated with WM performance. Further analyses revealed that the frontal-posterior theta-alpha sub-network comprised the critical regions whose activation level correlated with beneficial effects on cognitive performance. These results indicate that condition-specific EEG network analysis could potentially serve to predict beneficial effects of therapeutic treatment in working memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The conventional approach of using signal averaging to improve the SNR cannot be used for single trial EEG estimation. As such, this paper proposes a beamforming based technique that can be used to improve the signal quality from a signal trial EEG measurement. Results on experimental data show that the proposed technique can successfully isolate the signal of interest from background processes.

Some of the brain structures found in functional magnetic resonance imaging are not readily apparent in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG; MEG) measures. By means of a combined EEG/MEG source localization procedure to fully exploit the available information, we sought to reduce these discrepancies and gain a better understanding of spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying emotional-word processing. Eighteen participants read high-arousing positive and negative, and low-arousing neutral nouns, while EEG and MEG were recorded simultaneously. Combined current-density reconstructions (L2-minimum norm least squares) for two early emotion-sensitive time intervals, the P1 (80-120 ms) and the early posterior negativity (EPN, 200-300 ms), were computed using realistic individual head models with a cortical constraint. The P1 time window uncovered an emotion effect peaking in the left middle temporal gyrus. In the EPN time window, processing of emotional words was associated with enhanced activity encompassing parietal and occipital areas, and posterior limbic structures. We suggest that lexical access, being underway within 100 ms, is speeded and/or favored for emotional words, possibly on the basis of an "emotional tagging" of the word form during acquisition. This gives rise to their differential processing in the EPN time window. The EPN, as an index of natural selective attention, appears to reflect an elaborate interplay of distributed structures, related to cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and evaluation of emotional stimuli.

The current study used high-density ERPs to examine how moral evaluations are mediated by automatic and controlled processes as well as how quickly information and causal-intentional representations can be extracted when viewing morally laden behavior. The study also explored the extent to which individual dispositions in affective and cognitive empathy as well as justice sensitivity influence the encoding of moral valence when healthy participants make moral judgments about prosocial (interpersonal assistance) and antisocial (interpersonal harm) actions. Moral judgment differences were reflected in differential amplitudes for components associated with cognitive appraisal (LPP) as well as early components associated with emotional salience (N1 and N2). Moreover, source estimation was performed to indicate potential neural generators. A posterior-to-anterior shift was observed, with current density peaks first in right inferior parietal cortex (at the temporoparietal junction), then later in medial prefrontal cortex. Cognitive empathy scores predicted behavioral ratings of blame as well as differential amplitudes in LPP and component activity at posterior sites. Overall, this study offers important insights into the temporal unfolding of moral evaluations, including when in time individual differences in empathy influence neural encoding of moral valence.

N1 enhancement in synesthesia during visual and audio-visual perception in semantic cross-modal conflict situations: an ERP study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synesthesia; multimodal; EEG; N1; integration	GRAPHEME-COLOR SYNESTHESIA; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; EYE-MOVEMENT; SYNAESTHESIA; BRAIN; INTEGRATION; EEG	Synesthesia entails a special kind of sensory perception, where stimulation in one sensory modality leads to an internally generated perceptual experience of another, not stimulated sensory modality. This phenomenon can be viewed as an abnormal multisensory integration process as here the synesthetic percept is aberrantly fused with the stimulated modality. Indeed, recent synesthesia research has focused on multimodal processing even outside of the specific synesthesia-inducing context and has revealed changed multimodal integration, thus suggesting perceptual alterations at a global level. Here, we focused on audio-visual processing in synesthesia using a semantic classification task in combination with visually or auditory visually presented animated and in animated objects in an audio-visual congruent and incongruent manner. Fourteen subjects with auditory-visual and/or grapheme-color synesthesia and 14 control subjects participated in the experiment. During presentation of the stimuli, event-related potentials were recorded from 32 electrodes. The analysis of reaction times and error rates revealed no group differences with best performance for audio-visually congruent stimulation indicating the well-known multimodal facilitation effect. We found enhanced amplitude of the N1 component over occipital electrode sites for synesthetes compared to controls. The differences occurred irrespective of the experimental condition and therefore suggest a global influence on early sensory processing in synesthetes.

Though the main application of ICA is in the context of denoising, we prefer to focus our attention to the independent components of artifacts-free EEG data. The interpretation of these independent components is still controversial, and we outline the more accepted alternatives.

Specifically, participants studied emotional and neutral pictures organized in mixed lists (in which emotional and neutral pictures were intermixed) or in pure lists (only-neutral or only-emotional pictures) and performed a recall test. To estimate encoding efficiency, we used the Dm effect, measured with event-related potentials. Recall for neutral items was lower in mixed compared to pure lists and posterior Dm activity for neutral items was reduced in mixed lists, whereas it remained robust in pure lists. These findings might be caused by an asymmetrical competition for attentional and working memory resources between emotional and neutral information, which could be a major determinant of emotional memory effects.

Comparing temporal microstate features such as on- and offset or duration between groups and conditions therefore allows a precise assessment of the timing of cognitive processes. So far, this has been achieved by assigning the individual time-varying ERP maps to spatially defined microstate templates obtained from clustering the grand mean data into predetermined numbers of topographies (microstate prototypes). Features obtained from these individual assignments were then statistically compared. This has the problem that the individual noise dilutes the match between individual topographies and templates leading to lower statistical power. We therefore propose a randomization-based procedure that works without assigning grand-mean microstate prototypes to individual data. In addition, we propose a new criterion to select the optimal number of microstate prototypes based on cross-validation across subjects. After a formal introduction, the method is applied to a sample data set of an N400 experiment and to simulated data with varying signal-to-noise ratios, and the results are compared to existing methods. In a first comparison with previously employed statistical procedures, the new method showed an increased robustness to noise, and a higher sensitivity for more subtle effects of microstate timing. We conclude that the proposed method is well-suited for the assessment of timing differences in cognitive processes. The increased statistical power allows identifying more subtle effects, which is particularly important in small and scarce patient populations.

Most of these applications rely on synchronous tasks with different user's evaluations associated to correct and wrong events. Asynchronous detection during the continuous evaluation of the task, however, has to cope with background noise and an increased number of misdetections common in event-related potential detection. This paper studies a different characteristic that may carry additional information to be exploited by asynchronous ErrP detectors: brain connectivity coherence patterns appearing while the user monitors the continuous operation of a device. The results obtained with five subject revealed the presence of an error potential in an asynchronous reaching task an showed an increase in the coherency within the theta band.

The N2 ERP component as an index of impaired cognitive control in smokers	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Smoking; Nicotine; Cognitive control; Executive function; ERP	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; CONFLICT; NICOTINE; DYSFUNCTION; ADDICTION; DYNAMICS; SMOKING; TASK	Impaired cognitive control has been proposed as a hallmark of nicotine dependence and is thought to arise, in part, from synaptic alterations in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a primary component of the dopamine reward pathway. The N2 component of the event-related potential (ERP) appears to index a cognitive control process in paradigms such as the visual go/no-go task. Moreover, as dipole-modeling has suggested that the neural generator of the N2 component can be localized to the ACC, this component may prove useful for investigating impairments of cognitive control in smokers. Given conflicting reports of whether the N2 is reduced in smokers (as compared to non-smoker controls), the current study further examined the suitability of this component as an index for impaired cognitive control in smokers. Smokers and non-smokers performed a visual go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. As predicted, the no-go N2 of smokers was significantly smaller than that of non-smoker controls, while the no-go P3 did not differ between groups. Importantly, behavioral performance (reaction time and accuracy) did not differ between smokers and nonsmokers, which might reflect the low levels of nicotine dependence (assessed by the Fagerstrom test) in our sample. The observed N2 modulation in the absence of behavioral impairments provides evidence for the utility of the N2 component as a sensitive measure of impaired cognitive control in smokers, even in those with low levels of nicotine dependence.

Recently, we proposed a method (Common Waveform Estimation, CWE) that could extract such brain activities from magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. CWE estimates spatiotemporal MEG/EEG patterns occurring with unknown and variable delays, referred to here as unlocked waveforms, without hypotheses about their shapes. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of CWE for cognitive neuroscience. For this purpose, we show procedures to estimate unlocked waveforms using CWE and to examine their role. We applied CWE to the MEG epochs during Go trials of a visual Go/NoGo task. This revealed unlocked waveforms with interesting properties, specifically large alpha oscillations around the temporal areas. To examine the role of the unlocked waveform, we attempted to estimate the strength of the brain activity of the unlocked waveform in various conditions. We made a spatial filter to extract the component reflecting the brain activity of the unlocked waveform, applied this spatial filter to MEG data under different conditions (a passive viewing, a simple reaction time, and Go/NoGo tasks), and calculated the powers of the extracted components. Comparing the powers across these conditions suggests that the unlocked waveforms may reflect the inhibition of the task-irrelevant activities in the temporal regions while the subject attends to the visual stimulus. Our results demonstrate that CWE is a potential tool for revealing new findings of cognitive brain functions without any hypothesis in advance.

In earlier studies, we used green/blue (GB) luminance and chromatic changes in the P300-BCI system and reported that this luminance and chromatic flicker matrix was associated with better performance and greater subject comfort compared with the conventional white/gray (WG) luminance flicker matrix. To highlight areas involved in improved P300-BCI performance, we used simultaneous EEG fMRI recordings and showed enhanced activities in bilateral and right lateralized parieto-occipital areas. Here, to capture coherent activities of the areas during P300-BCI, we collected whole-head 306 channel magnetoencephalography data. When comparing functional connectivity between the right and left parieto-occipital channels, significantly greater functional connectivity in the alpha band was observed under the GB flicker matrix condition than under the WG flicker matrix condition. Current sources were estimated with a narrow-band adaptive spatial filter, and mean imaginary coherence was computed in the alpha band. Significantly greater coherence was observed in the right posterior parietal cortex under the GB than under the WG condition. Re-analysis of previous EEG-based P300-BCI data showed significant correlations between the power of the coherence of the bilateral parieto-occipital cortices and their performance accuracy. These results suggest that coherent activity in the bilateral parieto-occipital cortices plays a significant role in effectively driving the P300-BCI.

One key mechanism of suppression is through the deployment of anticipatory alpha-band (similar to 10 Hz) oscillatory activity, with greater alpha-band power observed in cortical regions that will ultimately process the distracting stream. Atypical attention has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including greater interference by distracting task-irrelevant inputs. Here we tested the integrity of these alpha-band mechanisms in ASD using an intersensory attention task. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants were cued on a trial-by-trial basis to selectively deploy attention to the visual or auditory modality in anticipation of a target within the cued modality. Whereas typically developing (TD) children showed the predicted alpha-band modulation, with increased alpha-band power over parieto-occipital scalp when attention was deployed to the auditory compared with the visual modality, this differential pattern was entirely absent at the group level in the ASD cohort. Further, only the ASD group showed impaired performance due to the presence of task-irrelevant sensory information. These data suggest that impaired modulation of alpha-band activity plays a role in increased distraction from extraneous sensory inputs in ASD.

Gamma band activity and the P3 reflect post-perceptual processes, not visual awareness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Consciousness; Gamma; P3; Task relevance; Visual awareness	AUDITORY SIGNAL-DETECTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SACCADES. NEURON 58; CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; HEMIANOPIC PATIENT; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ET-AL.; EEG; CORTEX	A primary goal in cognitive neuroscience is to identify neural correlates of conscious perception (NCC). By contrasting conditions in which subjects are aware versus unaware of identical visual stimuli, a number of candidate NCCs have emerged; among them are induced gamma band activity in the EEG and the P3 event-related potential. In most previous studies, however, the critical stimuli were always directly relevant to the subjects' task, such that aware versus unaware contrasts may well have included differences in post-perceptual processing in addition to differences in conscious perception per se. Here, in a series of EEG experiments, visual awareness and task relevance were manipulated independently. Induced gamma activity and the P3 were absent for task-irrelevant stimuli regardless of whether subjects were aware of such stimuli. For task-relevant stimuli, gamma and the P3 were robust and dissociable, indicating that each reflects distinct post-perceptual processes necessary for carrying-out the task but not for consciously perceiving the stimuli. Overall, this pattern of results challenges a number of previous proposals linking gamma band activity and the P3 to conscious perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We compared brain activity (electroencephalography) during a same-different task for High and Low AQ groups. The task was composed of identical comparison and categorical comparison (CC) conditions that presented simple or complex patterns. In the CC condition, the Low AQ showed large P3b amplitudes with simple patterns than with complex patterns, whereas the High AQ showed the same amplitude levels for these patterns. These indicate that, similar to simple patterns, complex patterns are efficiently encoded in the High AQ. Moreover, the High AQ had no impairment in the global pattern encoding compared with the Low AQ.

While most research focuses on event-related changes of brain activity in response to external events there is also increasing interest in internal brain states influencing information processing. Several studies suggest amplitude changes of EEG oscillatory activity selectively influencing cortical excitability, and more recently it was shown that phase of EEG activity (instantaneous phase) conveys additional meaning. Here we review this field with many conflicting findings and further investigate whether corticospinal excitability in the resting brain is dependent on a specific spontaneously occurring brain state reflected by amplitude and instantaneous phase of EEG oscillations. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left sensorimotor cortex, while simultaneously recording ongoing oscillatory activity with EEG. Results indicate that brain oscillations reflect rapid, spontaneous fluctuations of cortical excitability. Instantaneous phase but not amplitude of oscillations at various frequency bands at stimulation site at the time of TMS-pulse is indicative for brain states associated with different levels of excitability (defined by size of the elicited motor evoked potential). These results are further evidence that ongoing brain oscillations directly influence neural excitability which puts further emphasis on their role in orchestrating neuronal firing in the brain.

Efforts are being made to diagnose these neurodegenerative disorders in the early stages. Indeed, early diagnosis helps patients to obtain the maximum treatment benefit before significant mental decline occurs. The use of electroencephalogram as a tool for the detection of changes in brain activities and clinical diagnosis is becoming increasingly popular for its capabilities in quantifying changes in brain degeneration in dementia. This paper reviews the role of electroencephalogram as a biomarker based on signal processing to detect dementia in early stages and classify its severity. The review starts with a discussion of dementia types and cognitive spectrum followed by the presentation of the effective preprocessing denoising to eliminate possible artifacts. It continues with a description of feature extraction by using linear and nonlinear techniques, and it ends with a brief explanation of vast variety of separation techniques to classify EEG signals. This paper also provides an idea from the most popular studies that may help in diagnosing dementia in early stages and classifying through electroencephalogram signal processing and analysis.

However, the adoption of this approach to human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been more limited, despite the ability of this methodology to quantify canonical neuronal processes. Here, we provide evidence that theta band activities over the midfrontal cortex appear to reflect a common computation used for realizing the need for cognitive control. Moreover, by virtue of inherent properties of field oscillations, these theta band processes may be used to communicate this need and subsequently implement such control across disparate brain regions. Thus, frontal theta is a compelling candidate mechanism by which emergent processes, such as 'cognitive control', may be biophysically realized.

However, the performance of active electrodes has not been directly compared with that of passive electrodes in the context of collecting ERPs from a cognitive task. Here, the performance of active and passive amplification electrodes in the same digitizing amplifier system was examined. Method: In Experiment 1, interelectrode impedance in an electrically quiet setting was manipulated to determine whether, in such recording conditions, active electrodes can outperform passive ones. In Experiment 2, the performance of active electrodes at the limits of natural skin impedance was explored, as was the relationship between active amplification circuitry and voltage stability in averaged EOG. Results: Results reveal a complex pattern of interrelations between electrode type, impedance, and voltage stability, indicating that which type of electrode is "best" depends non-trivially on the circumstances in which data are being collected. Comparison with existing methods: Traditional, passive electrodes acquired the cleanest data observed in any of the acquisition conditions at very low impedance, but not at any impedance >2 k Omega Conclusion: Active electrodes perform better than passive ones at all impedances other than very low ones; however, this is qualified by the additional finding that during fast voltage fluctuations, such as those most desirable in most ERP studies, active electrodes are less able to accurately follow the EEG than passive ones.

Executive dysfunction and reward dysregulation: A high-density electrical mapping study in cocaine abusers	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Reward; Inhibition; Executive function; EEG; ERP; Substance abuse; Addiction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; STIMULANT USE; ANHEDONIA; DOPAMINE	Executive function deficits and reward dysregulation, which mainly manifests as anhedonia, are well documented in drug abusers. We investigated specific aspects of executive function (inhibitory control and cognitive control), as well as anhedonia, in a cohort of current cocaine abusers in order to ascertain to what extent these factors are associated with more severe drug dependence. Participants filled out questionnaires relating to anhedonia and their addiction history. Participants also performed a response inhibition task while high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Electrophysiological responses to successful inhibitions (N2/P3 components) and to commission errors (ERN/Pe components) were compared between 23 current users of cocaine and 27 non(-)using controls. A regression model was performed to determine the association of our measures of reward dysregulation and executive function with addiction severity. As expected, cocaine users performed more poorly than controls on the inhibitory control task and showed significant electrophysiological differences. They were also generally more anhedonic than controls. Higher levels of anhedonia were associated with more severe substance use, whereas the level of executive dysfunction was not associated with more severe substance use. However, N2 amplitude was associated with duration of drug use. Further, inhibitory control and anhedonia were correlated, but only in controls. These data suggest that while executive dysfunction characterizes drug abuse, it is anhedonia, independent of executive dysfunction, that is most strongly associated with more severe use.

Human voices have positive effects on infants, e.g., soothe infants and evoke an infant's smile. Increased left relative to right frontal alpha activity as assessed by the electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered to reflect approach-related emotions. In the present study, we recorded the EEG in thirty-eight 2-month-old infants during a baseline period while listening to sounds, i.e., human voices. Infants displayed increased relative left frontal alpha activity in response to sounds compared to the baseline condition. These results suggest that sounds can elicit relative left frontal activity in young infants, and that this approach-related emotion presents early in life. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Wavelet Decomposition-Based Analysis of Mismatch Negativity Elicited by a Multi-Feature Paradigm	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERPs); mismatch negativity (MMN); difference-wave (DW); band-pass digital filter (DF); wavelet decomposition (WLD) techniques	UNINTERRUPTED SOUND; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION; NEUROSCIENCE; FREQUENCY; EEG; MMN	In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) collected from normally hearing subjects and elicited by a multi-feature paradigm were investigated, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was detected. Standard stimuli and five types of deviant stimuli were presented in a specified sequence, while EEG data were recorded digitally at a 1024 sec(-1) sampling rate. Two wavelet analyses were compared with a traditional difference-wave (DW) method. The Reverse biorthogonal wavelet ot the order of 6.8 and the quadratic B-Spline wavelet were applied for seven-level decomposition. The sixth-level approximation coefficients were appropriate for extracting the MMN from the averaged trace. The results obtained showed that wavelet decomposition (WLD) methods extract MMN as well as a band-pass digital filter (DF). The differences of the MMN peak latency between deviant types elicited by B-Spline WLD were more significant than those extracted by the DW, DF, or Reverse biorthogonal WLD. Also, wavelet coefficients of the delta-theta range indicated good discrimination between some combinations of the deviant types.

Through the use of data-driven approaches such as jointICA, sources extracted from EEG can be linked to regions in fMRI. JointICA in its standard formulation however does not allow for the inclusion of multiple EEG electrodes, so it is a rather arbitrary choice which electrode is used in the analysis. In this study, we explore several ways to include the higher dimensionality of the EEG during a joint decomposition of EEG and fMRI. Our results show that incorporation of multiple channels in the jointICA can reveal new relations between fMRI activation maps and ERP features.

INTER-HEMISPHERIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY CHANGES WITH CORPUS CALLOSUM MORPHOLOGY IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS); corpus callosum; inter-hemispheric coherence; electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ ERPs); structural magnetic resonance imaging; sensorimotor control	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; WHITE-MATTER; SIZE; ASYMMETRIES; HANDEDNESS; FATIGUE; GENDER	Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, concurring to cause brain atrophy and neurodegeneration as well as gradual functional disconnections. To explore early signs of altered connectivity in MS from a structural and functional perspective, the morphology of corpus callosum (CC) was correlated with a dynamic inter-hemispheric connectivity index. Twenty mildly disabled patients affected by a relapsing-remitting (RR) form of MS (EDSS <= 3.5) and 15 healthy subjects underwent structural MRI to measure CC thickness over 100 sections and electroencephalography to assess a spectral coherence index between primary regions devoted to hand control, at rest and during an isometric handgrip. In patients, an overall CC atrophy was associated with increased lesion load. A less efficacious inter-hemispheric coherence (IHCoh) during movement was associated with CC atrophy in sections interconnecting homologous primary motor areas (anterior mid-body). In healthy controls, less efficacious IHCoh at rest was associated with a thinner CC splenium. Our data suggest that in mildly disabled RR-MS patients a covert impairment may be detected in the correlation between the structural (CC thickness) and functional (IHCoh) measures of homologous networks, whereas these two counterparts do not yet differ individually from controls.

Electrophysiological spatiotemporal dynamics during implicit visual threat processing	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Beta; Corticolimbic network; Electroencephalography; ERSP; Theta	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; AMYGDALA; EEG; EMOTION; FEAR; CORTEX; ERP; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Numerous studies have found evidence for corticolimbic theta band electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in the neural processing of visual stimuli perceived as threatening. However, varying temporal and topographical patterns have emerged, possibly due to varying arousal levels of the stimuli. In addition, recent studies suggest neural oscillations in delta, theta, alpha, and beta-band frequencies play a functional role in information processing in the brain. This study implemented a data-driven PCA based analysis investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of electroencephalographic delta, theta, alpha, and beta-band frequencies during an implicit visual threat processing task. While controlling for the arousal dimension (the intensity of emotional activation), we found several spatial and temporal differences for threatening compared to nonthreatening visual images. We detected an early posterior increase in theta power followed by a later frontal increase in theta power, greatest for the threatening condition. There was also a consistent left lateralized beta desynchronization for the threatening condition. Our results provide support for a dynamic corticolimbic network, with theta and beta band activity indexing processes pivotal in visual threat processing. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, we suggest here that response inhibition is achieved automatically, nonselectively, within very short delays in uncertain environments. We modified a classical go/nogo protocol to probe context-dependent inhibitory mechanisms. Because no single neuroimaging method can definitely disentangle neural excitation and inhibition, we combined fMRI and EEG recordings in healthy humans. Any stimulus (go or nogo) presented in an uncertain context requiring action restraint was found to evoke activity changes in the supplementary motor complex (SMC) with respect to a control condition in which no response inhibition was required. These changes included: (1) An increase in event-related BOLD activity, (2) an attenuation of the early (170 ms) event related potential generated by a single, consistent source isolated by advanced blind source separation, and (3) an increase in the evoked-EEG Alpha power of this source. Considered together, these results suggest that the BOLD signal evoked by any stimulus in the SMC when the situation is unpredictable can be driven by automatic, nonselective, context-dependent inhibitory activities. This finding reveals the paradoxical mechanisms by which voluntary control of action may be achieved. The ability to provide controlled responses in unpredictable environments would require setting-up the automatic self-inhibitory circuitry within the SMC. Conversely, enabling automatic behavior when the environment becomes predictable would require top-down control to deactivate anticipatorily and temporarily the inhibitory set.

We used a metacontrast backward masking paradigm in which subjects had to discriminate between two weak stimuli and obtained measures of accuracy and awareness while their EEG was recorded from 256 channels. Comparing targets that were correctly identified with and without awareness allowed us to contrast differences in awareness while keeping performance constant for identical physical stimuli. Two distinct pre-stimulus scalp potential fields (microstate maps) dissociated correct identification with and without awareness, and their estimated intracranial generators were stronger in primary visual cortex before correct identification without awareness. This difference in activity cannot be explained by differences in alpha power or phase which were less reliably linked with differential pre-stimulus activation of primary visual cortex. Our results shed a new light on the function of pre-stimulus activity in early visual cortex in visual awareness and emphasize the importance of trial-by-trials analysis of the spatial configuration of the scalp potential field identified with multichannel EEG.

Parieto-Frontal Circuits During Observation of Hidden and Visible Motor Acts in Children. A High-density EEG Source Imaging Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Brain circuits; Children; ERP; Mirror Mechanism; Source localization	MIRROR NEURON DYSFUNCTION; MU-RHYTHM; AUTISM; SYSTEM; EXECUTION; RECOGNITION; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; OTHERS; CORTEX	Several studies showed that in the human brain specific premotor and parietal areas are activated during the execution and observation of motor acts. The activation of this premotor-parietal network displaying the so-called Mirror Mechanism (MM) was proposed to underpin basic forms of action understanding. However, the functional properties of the MM in children are still largely unknown. In order to address this issue, we recorded high-density EEG from 12 children (6 female, 6 male; average age 10.5, SD +/- 2.15). Data were collected when children observed video clips showing hands grasping objects in two different experimental conditions: (1) Full Vision, in which the motor act was fully visible; (2) Hidden, in which the interaction between the hand and the object was not visible. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and topographic map analyses were used to investigate the temporal pattern of the ERPs and their brain source of localization, employing a children template of the Montreal Neurological Institute. Results showed that two different parieto-premotor circuits are activated by the observation of object-related hand reaching-to-grasping motor acts in children. The first circuit comprises the ventral premotor and the inferior parietal cortices. The second one comprises the dorsal premotor and superior parietal cortices. The activation of both circuits is differently lateralized and modulated in time, and influenced by the amount of visual information available about the hand grasping-related portion of the observed motor acts.

J	Zanto, TP; Chadick, JZ; Gazzaley, A				Zanto, Theodore P.; Chadick, James Z.; Gazzaley, Adam			Anticipatory alpha phase influences visual working memory performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Electroencephalography; Alpha band; Phase; Working memory; Motion	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; MOTION; TMS; CORTEX; BRAIN	Alpha band (8-12 Hz) phase dynamics in the visual cortex are thought to reflect fluctuations in cortical excitability that influences perceptual processing. As such, visual stimuli are better detected when their onset is concurrent with specific phases of the alpha cycle. However, it is unclear whether alpha phase differentially influences cognitive performance at specific times relative to stimulus onset (i.e., is the influence of phase maximal before, at, or after stimulus onset?). To address this, participants performed a delayed-recognition, working memory (WM) task for visual motion direction during two separate visits. The first visit utilized functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging to identify neural regions associated with task performance. Replicating previous studies, fMRI data showed engagement of visual cortical area V5, as well as a prefrontal cortical region, the inferior frontal junction (IFJ). During the second visit, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied separately to both the right IFJ and right V5 (with the vertex as a control region) while electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded. During each trial, a single pulse of TMS (spTMS) was applied at one of six time points (200, 100, -50, 0, 80, 160 ms) relative to the encoded stimulus onset Results demonstrated a relationship between the phase of the posterior alpha signal prior to stimulus encoding and subsequent response times to the memory probe two seconds later. Specifically, spTMS to V5, and not the IFJ or vertex, yielded faster response times, indicating improved WM performance, when delivered during the peak, compared to the trough, of the alpha cycle, but only when spTMS was applied 100 ms prior to stimulus onset These faster responses to the probe correlated with decreased early event related potential (ERP) amplitudes (i.e., P1) to the probe stimuli. Moreover, participants that were least affected by spTMS exhibited greater functional connectivity between V5 and fronto-parietal regions. These results suggest that posterior alpha phase indexes a critical time period for motion processing in the context of WM encoding goals, which occurs in anticipation of stimulus onset.

Anticipatory preparation for an upcoming task switch is a hallmark of top-down intentional control. Meanwhile, asymmetries in performance and voluntary choice when switching between tasks differing in relative strength reveal the effects of between-task competition, reflected in a surprising bias against switching to an easier task. Here, we assessed the impact of this bias on EEG markers of intentional control during preparation for an upcoming task switch. The results revealed strong and varied effects of between-task competition on EEG markers of global task preparationua frontal contingent negative variation (CNV), a posterior slow positive wave, and oscillatory activity in the alpha band (812 Hz) over posterior scalp sites. In contrast, we observed no between-task differences in motor-specific task preparation, as indexed by the lateralized readiness potential and by motor-related amplitude asymmetries in the mu (913 Hz) and beta (1826 Hz) frequency bands. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that between-task competition directly influences the formation of top-down intentions, not only their expression in overt behavior. Specifically, this influence occurs at the level of global task intention rather than the preparation of specific actions.

The online gaming addiction shares many negative impacts of substance addiction, such as failing at school, breaking family relationship and social relationship. In the present study we obtained EEG data during a modified Stroop task, a color matching task using online game-related words and neutral words, in 10 online game addicts and 12 healthy individuals. The significantly higher P300 and late positive potential (LPP) elicited by online game related words, as compared to neutral words, were recorded in online game addicts, while those did not be observed in health controls. The results indicated that the online game addicts were difficult to ignore the meaning of the colored words, and had to allocate their cognitive resources to the content of these words when facing the online game-related stimuli. The attentional bias to addiction-related cues may play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of online game addiction.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL CORRELATES OF TASTE PROCESSING IN THE HUMAN PRIMARY GUSTATORY CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						primary taste cortex; insula; source localization; EEG; MEG; gustometry	UMAMI TASTE; REPRESENTATION; LATERALITY; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; PATHWAY; MONKEY; FLAVOR; SALT	In humans the identification of the primary gustatory cortex (PGC) is still under debate. Neuroimaging studies indicate insula and overlying opercula as the best candidates but the exact position of the PGC within this region is not entirely clear. Moreover, inconsistencies appear when comparing results from studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and gustatory event-related potentials (gERP), or gustatory event-related magnetic fields (gERMF). fMRI indicates activations in the anterior part of the insula and frontal operculum, while gERP and/or gERMF indicate activations at the transition between the parietal operculum and insula in its posterior part. Here it is important to note that for gERP and gERMF temporal and spatial characteristics of the stimulus must be well controlled to evoke a useful brain response. In the present study gERMF and gERP were recorded simultaneously using a whole-head system with 249 magnetometers and 32 electrodes, respectively; taste stimuli were applied using a stimulator providing excellent temporal and spatial control of the stimulus. Separate ERP and ERMF averaged waveforms were derived time-locked to the onset of the taste stimuli. The source analysis for the early time range revealed activity in the left and right anterior and mid part of the insula, where in the later time range the sources were located more in the posterior part of the insula.

Suppression and congruency effects in audiovisual paradigms with letters and speech sounds have provided information about low-level mechanisms of grapheme-phoneme integration during reading. However, the central question about how such processes relate to reading entire words remains unexplored. Using ERPs, we investigated whether audiovisual integration occurs for words already in beginning readers, and if so, whether this integration is reflected by differences in map strength or topography (aim 1); and moreover, whether such integration is associated with reading fluency (aim 2). A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 69 monolingual (Swiss)-German speaking first-graders performed a detection task with rare targets. Stimuli were presented in blocks either auditorily (A), visually (V) or audiovisually (matching: AVM; nonmatching: AVN). Corresponding ERPs were computed, and unimodal ERPs summated (A + V = sumAV). We applied TANOVAs to identify time windows with significant integration effects: suppression (sumAV-AVM) and congruency (AVN-AVM). They were further characterized using GFP and 3D-centroid analyses, and significant effects were correlated with reading fluency. The results suggest that audiovisual suppression effects occur for familiar German and unfamiliar English words, whereas audiovisual congruency effects can be found only for familiar German words, probably due to lexical-semantic processes involved. Moreover, congruency effects were characterized by topographic differences, indicating that different sources are active during processing of congruent compared to incongruent audiovisual words. Furthermore, no clear associations between audiovisual integration and reading fluency were found. The degree to which such associations develop in beginning readers remains open to further investigation.

Twenty-six adult participants completed a modified one-back task, where letters where presented in easy-to-read typefaces ("fluent" letter stimuli) or difficult-to-read typefaces ("disfluent" letter stimuli). Task instructions necessitated that participant's focus on letter identity not visual letter form. Electroencephalography was collected and event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated relative to letter stimuli. It was found that typeface affected both early-mid (N1 amplitude and P2-N2 amplitude and latency) and late processing (450-600 ms), thereby including time points whereby it is theorised that abstract identity is extracted from visual letter form (that is, 300 ms post-stimulus). Visual features of the letter therefore affect its processing well beyond the currently theorised point at which abstract information is extracted; which could be explained by a feedback loop between abstract letter representations and lower-level visual form processing units, which is not included in current cognitive reading models.

Detection of the onset of upper-limb movements based on the combined analysis of changes in the sensorimotor rhythms and slow cortical potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; voluntary movement; stroke; bereitcshaftspotential; event-related desynchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; INTENTION; NEUROPROSTHESIS; SYSTEM	Objective. Characterizing the intention to move by means of electroencephalographic activity can be used in rehabilitation protocols with patients' cortical activity taking an active role during the intervention. In such applications, the reliability of the intention estimation is critical both in terms of specificity 'number of misclassifications' and temporal accuracy. Here, a detector of the onset of voluntary upper-limb reaching movements based on the cortical rhythms and the slow cortical potentials is proposed. The improvement in detections due to the combination of these two cortical patterns is also studied. Approach. Upper-limb movements and cortical activity were recorded in healthy subjects and stroke patients performing self-paced reaching movements. A logistic regression combined the output of two classifiers: (i) a naive Bayes classifier trained to detect the event-related desynchronization preceding the movement onset and (ii) a matched filter detecting the bereitschaftspotential. The proposed detector was compared with the detectors by using each one of these cortical patterns separately. In addition, differences between the patients and healthy subjects were analysed. Main results. On average, 74.5 +/- 13.8% and 82.2 +/- 10.4% of the movements were detected with 1.32 +/- 0.87 and 1.50 +/- 1.09 false detections generated per minute in the healthy subjects and the patients, respectively. A significantly better performance was achieved by the combined detector (as compared to the detectors of the two cortical patterns separately) in terms of true detections (p = 0.099) and false positives (p = 0.0083). Significance. A rationale is provided for combining information from cortical rhythms and slow cortical potentials to detect the onsets of voluntary upper-limb movements. It is demonstrated that the two cortical processes supply complementary information that can be summed up to boost the performance of the detector. Successful results have been also obtained with stroke patients, which supports the use of the proposed system in brain-computer interface applications with this group of patients.

An ERP study	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Event related potentials; Categorical perception; Top-down influences; Visual perception	RIGHT VISUAL-FIELD; TOP-DOWN; COLOR DISCRIMINATION; CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE; LANGUAGE; OBJECT; FACE; POTENTIALS; HYPOTHESIS; ATTENTION	Accumulating evidence suggests that visual perception and, in particular, visual discrimination, can be influenced by verbal category boundaries. One issue that still awaits systematic investigation is the specific influence of semantic contents of verbal categories on categorical perception (CP). We tackled this issue with a learning paradigm in which initially unfamiliar, yet realistic objects were associated with either bare labels lacking explicit semantic content or labels that were accompanied by enriched semantic information about the specific meaning of the label. Two to three days after learning, the EEG was recorded while participants performed a lateralized oddball task. Newly acquired verbal category boundaries modulated low-level aspects of visual perception as early as 100-150 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting a genuine influence of language on perception. Importantly, this effect was not further influenced by enriched semantic category information, suggesting that bare labels and the associated minimal and predominantly perceptual information are sufficient for CP. Distinct effects of semantic knowledge independent of category boundaries were found subsequently, starting at about 200 ms, possibly reflecting selective attention to semantically meaningful visual features.

Social cognition and neural substrates of face perception: Implications for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						FMRI; Face processing; Autism spectrum disorder; Social cognition; Quantitative traits	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SYSTEMATIZING QUOTIENT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MULTIPLE-INCIDENCE; CHILDRENS RITUALS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EMPATHY QUOTIENT	Background: Social cognition is an important aspect of social behavior in humans. Social cognitive deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study we examine the neural substrates of social cognition and face processing in a group of healthy young adults to examine the neural substrates of social cognition. Methods: Fifty-seven undergraduates completed a battery of social cognition tasks and were assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) during a face-perception task. A subset (N=22) were administered a face-perception task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Variance in the N170 EEG was predicted by social attribution performance and by a quantitative measure of empathy. Neurally, face processing was more bilateral in females than in males. Variance in fMRI voxel count in the face-sensitive fusiform gyrus was predicted by quantitative measures of social behavior, including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Empathizing Quotient. Conclusions: When measured as a quantitative trait, social behaviors in typical and pathological populations share common neural pathways. The results highlight the importance of viewing neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders as spectrum phenomena that may be informed by studies of the normal distribution of relevant traits in the general population.

Vection typically occurs in stationary observers being exposed to visual information that suggest self-motion (e.g. simulators, virtual reality). In the present study, we tested whether sensory integration of visual information triggers vection: participants (N=13) perceived patterns of moving altered black-and-white vertical stripes on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual field. In both fields the pattern was either moving or stationary, resulting in four combinations of central and peripheral motions: (1) central and peripheral stripes moved into the same direction, (2) central and peripheral stripes moved in opposite directions, or (3) either the central or (4) the peripheral stripes were stable while the other stripes were in motion. This stimulation induced vection: Results showed significantly higher vection ratings when the stationary center of the pattern was surrounded by a moving periphery. Event-related potentials mirrored this finding: The occipital N2 was largest with stationary central and moving peripheral stripes. Our findings suggest that sensory integration of peripheral and central visual information triggers the perception of vection. Furthermore, we found evidence that neural processes precede the subjective perception of vection strength prior to the actual onset of vection. We will discuss our findings with respect to the role of stimulus eccentricity, stimulus' depth, and neural correlates involved during the genesis of vection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Painful cutaneous laser stimuli induce event-related oscillatory EEG activities that are different from those induced by nonpainful electrical stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; cortex; event-related synchronization; EEG; human; pain	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; A-DELTA-FIBER; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; C-FIBER; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES	The non-phase-locked EEG response to painful stimuli has usually been characterized as decreased oscillatory activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the alpha band. Increased activity (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the gamma band has been reported more recently. We have now tested the hypothesis that the non-phase-locked responses to nonpainful electric cutaneous stimuli are different from those to painful cutaneous laser stimuli when the baseline salience of the two stimuli is the same and the salience during the protocol is modulated by count laser and count electric tasks. Both of these stimuli were presented in random order in a single train at intensities that produced the same baseline salience in the same somatic location. The response to the laser stimulus was characterized by five windows (designated windows I-V) in the time-frequency domain: early (200-400 ms) and late (600-1,400 ms) delta/theta ERS, 500-900 ms alpha ERD, 1,200-1,600 ms beta ERS (rebound), and 800-1,200 ms gamma ERS. Similar ERS/ERD windows of activity were found for the electric stimulus. Individual participants very commonly had activity in windows consistent with the overall analysis. Linear regression of ERS/ERD for parietal channels was most commonly found for sensory (pain or unpleasantness)- or attention (salience)-related measures. Overall, the main effect for modality was found in window I-delta/theta and window V-gamma, and the Modality with Task interaction was found in all five windows. All significant interaction terms included Modality as a factor. Therefore, Modality was the most common factor explaining our results, which is consistent with our hypothesis.	[Chien, J. H.; Liu, C.

The development of effective pharmacological compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia has proven challenging and costly, with many compounds failing during clinical trials. Many failures occur due to disease heterogeneity and lack of predictive preclinical models and biomarkers that readily translate to humans during early characterization of novel antipsychotic compounds. Traditional early-phase trials consist of single- or multiple-dose designs aimed at determining the safety and tolerability of an investigational compound in healthy volunteers. However, by incorporating a translational approach employing methodologies derived from preclinical studies, such as EEG measures and imaging, into the traditional Phase I program, critical information regarding a compound's dose-response effects on pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be acquired. Furthermore, combined with the use of patients with stable schizophrenia in early-phase clinical trials, significant de-risking' and more confident go/no-go' decisions are possible.

The effect of enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission by nicotine on EEG indices of inhibition in the human brain	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Acetylcholine; Nicotine; Inhibition; SSRT; N2; P3	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BASE-LINE-DEPENDENCY; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; HEALTHY NONSMOKERS; YOUNG-ADULTS; IMPULSIVITY; SYSTEM; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS	The role of the cholinergic system in inhibition remains to be elucidated. Nicotine is a potent tool to augment this system, but most studies investigated its effects solely on behavior. Reference to brain activity is important to specifically identify inhibition-related mechanisms. In the current study the objective was to elucidate the role of the cholinergic system in inhibition. 16 healthy non-smokers performed in a stop task while EEG was recorded. A pre- versus post-treatment, within subjects, placebo controlled, single-blind design was used. It was hypothesized that nicotine would decrease stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and increase the amplitude of inhibition-related event related potentials, the stop N2 and stop P3. Behavioral measures show nicotine shortened SSRT, but only when pretreatment values were not taken into account. On EEG measures, an enhanced stop P3 under nicotine was found, but only in a subsample sensitive to nicotine based on diastolic blood pressure. The results are indicative of enhanced inhibitory activity possibly reflecting enhanced activation in the superior frontal gyrus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Logemann, H. N.

Depending on task requirements, they may analyze the fraction components separately (componential processing strategy, CPS) or consider the fraction as a whole (holistic processing strategy, HPS). It is so far unknown what is the brain coordination dynamics underlying these types of fraction processing strategies. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed oscillatory brain activity during a fraction comparison task, presenting pairs of fractions either with or without common components. Results show that CPS induces a left frontal-parietal alpha phase desynchronization after the onset of fraction pairs, while HPS induces an increase of phase synchrony on theta and gamma bands, over frontal and central-parietal sites, respectively. Additionally, the HPS evokes more negative ERPs around 400 ms over the right frontal scalp than the CPS. This ERP activity correlates with the increase of Theta phase synchrony. Our results reveal the emergence of different functional neural networks depending on the kind of cognitive strategy used for processing fractions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Selective attention modulates high-frequency activity in the face-processing network	CORTEX			English	Article						Emotion; Face processing; Amygdala; Gamma band activity; Intracranial EEG	FACIAL-EXPRESSION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; INTRACRANIAL RECORDINGS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; EMOTION; POTENTIALS	Face processing depends on the orchestrated activity of a large-scale neuronal network. Its activity can be modulated by attention as a function of task demands. However, it remains largely unknown whether voluntary, endogenous attention and reflexive, exogenous attention to facial expressions equally affect all regions of the face-processing network, and whether such effects primarily modify the strength of the neuronal response, the latency, the duration, or the spectral characteristics. We exploited the good temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and recorded from depth electrodes to uncover the fast dynamics of emotional face processing. We investigated frequency-specific responses and event-related potentials (ERP) in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), ventral temporal cortex (VTC), anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala when facial expressions were task-relevant or task-irrelevant. All investigated regions of interest (ROI) were clearly modulated by task demands and exhibited stronger changes in stimulus-induced gamma band activity (50-150 Hz) when facial expressions were task-relevant. Observed latencies demonstrate that the activation is temporally coordinated across the network, rather than serially proceeding along a processing hierarchy. Early and sustained responses to task-relevant faces in VOTC and VTC corroborate their role for the core system of face processing, but they also occurred in the anterior insula. Strong attentional modulation in the OFC and amygdala (300 msec) suggests that the extended system of the face-processing network is only recruited if the task demands active face processing. Contrary to our expectation, we rarely observed differences between fearful and neutral faces. Our results demonstrate that activity in the face-processing network is susceptible to the deployment of selective attention. Moreover, we show that endogenous attention operates along the whole face-processing network, and that these effects are reflected in frequency-specific changes in the gamma band.

Event-Related Potentials for Post-Error and Post-Conflict Slowing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STOP-SIGNAL TASK; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONTROL MECHANISMS; ANTISACCADE TASK; ADJUSTMENTS; NEGATIVITY	In a reaction time task, people typically slow down following an error or conflict, each called post-error slowing (PES) and post-conflict slowing (PCS). Despite many studies of the cognitive mechanisms, the neural responses of PES and PCS continue to be debated. In this study, we combined high-density array EEG and a stop-signal task to examine event-related potentials of PES and PCS in sixteen young adult participants. The results showed that the amplitude of N2 is greater during PES but not PCS. In contrast, the peak latency of N2 is longer for PCS but not PES. Furthermore, error-positivity (Pe) but not error-related negativity (ERN) was greater in the stop error trials preceding PES than non-PES trials, suggesting that PES is related to participants' awareness of the error. Together, these findings extend earlier work of cognitive control by specifying the neural correlates of PES and PCS in the stop signal task.

The hypotheses of this study were that the neural correlate of projection may involve frontal, parietal, and temporal brain areas, and that alexithymia may be negatively associated with intensities in limbic and paralimbic areas during projection. EEG data were recorded continuously at 250 Hz using NetStation 4.5.1 with 256-channels HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net in 20 healthy subjects during the presentation of structured and not-structured visual stimuli. The tasks were paying attention to the stimuli and thinking about the possible meaning of each image. Event related potential (ERP) components and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLoreta) were analyzed. Participants were administered the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale before stimulus presentation. Source analyses (sLORETA) showed a greater activated source in the left primary somatosensory cortex (BA1) compared to all the others BA in both conditions through all the ERP components. An involvement of the frontal (right-BA4, left- and right-BA9, left-BA11) and parietal (left and right-BA2 and left-BA7) areas was found in projective response to not-structured visual stimuli. Alexithymia levels were negatively correlated with the anterior (right-BA32) and posterior (left-BA29) cingulate cortex. Findings show the relevance of fronto-parieto circuits during projection, where the internally generating somatosensory representations could drive an intermodal meaning attribution during the task. Moreover, high alexithymia levels were associated with a reduced activation of the cingulated cortex. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is an important aspect in signal processing as the result obtained will be used for signal classification. A good technique for feature extraction is necessary in order to achieve robust classification of signal. Considering several techniques have been implemented for extracting features in EEG signal, we only highlight the most commonly used for schizophrenia. The techniques are Hilbert-Huang transform, Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Local Discriminant Bases. Despite of their drawbacks, they can be applied which depends on the aim of a research, parameters and the data collected. Nevertheless, these techniques can be modified so that the new algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of original algorithm or algorithm beforehand. The modified Local Discriminant Bases algorithm is introduced in the present paper as another powerful adaptive feature extraction technique for EEG signal which is not reported elsewhere in investigating schizophrenia.

For this purpose, event related synchronization and desynchronization patterns which occur in the process of lifting different weights by the right hand by executing elbow flexion and extension movements, are classified by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our results show that the varying difficulty of the task can be classified based on the EEG signals. In addition, a correlation analysis between the intention levels detected from EEG and surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals is presented and the detected level of correlation between these two signals supports our previous inference. Determining the level of intention of the patients during the physical rehabilitation treatment, ensures the patients' active participation in their therapy task and increases the effectiveness of the robotic rehabilitation system. Accordingly, the type of intention level detection approach we propose here has the potential to be useful in such physical rehabilitation processes.

We examined the cortical source localization of the NoGo stimuli in a Go/NoGo task by employing a standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) using EEG. Fifteen psychopathic trait subjects and 15 control subjects performed the Go/NoGo task. The statistical analysis of P3 elicited by the NoGo stimuli indicated that the psychopathic trait group showed significantly reduced NoGo-P3 amplitudes than the control group at the frontocental area. In the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the psychopathic trait group showed significantly higher perseverative responses than the control group. Compared to the control group, cortical sources reduction elicited by NoGo-P3 in the psychopathic trait group was found at the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate, right precentral gyrus, and the right inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that individuals with psychopathic traits have difficulties in inhibiting a response with reduced frontal function. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We modified the time-varying generalized partial directed coherence (tv-gPDC) method, by orthogonalization of the strictly causal multivariate autoregressive model coefficients, to minimize the effect of mutual sources. The novel measure, generalized orthogonalized PDC (gOPDC), was tested first using two simulated models with feature dimensions relevant to EEG activities. We then used the method for assessing event-related directional information flow from flash-evoked responses in neonatal EEG. For testing statistical significance of the findings, we followed a thresholding procedure driven by baseline periods in the same EEG activity. The results suggest that the gOPDC method 1) is able to remove common components akin to volume conduction effect in the scalp EEG, 2) handles the potential challenge with different amplitude scaling within multichannel signals, and 3) can detect directed information flow within a subsecond time scale in nonstationary multichannel EEG datasets. This method holds promise for estimating directed interactions between scalp EEG channels that are commonly affected by the confounding impact of mutual cortical sources.

Here we extended this work by recording both ERP and oscillatory EEG activity (event-related spectral perturbations, ERSPs) to line-drawn faces depicting eye and mouth movements (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) and non-face motion controls. Neural activity was measured in 2 occipito-temporal clusters of 9 electrodes, one in each hemisphere. Mouth opening generated larger N170s than mouth closing, replicating earlier work. Eye motion elicited robust N170s that did not differ between gaze conditions. Control condition differences were seen, and generated the largest N170. ERSP difference plots across conditions in the occipito-temporal electrode clusters (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) showed statistically significant differences in beta and gamma bands for gaze direction changes and mouth opening at similar post-stimulus times and frequencies. In contrast, control stimuli showed activity in the gamma ban with a completely different time profile and hemispheric distribution to facial stimuli. ERSP plots were generated in two 9 electrode clusters centered on central sites, C3 and C4. In the left cluster for a stimulus conditions, broadband beta suppression persisted from about 250 ms post-motion onset. In the cluster, beta suppression was seen for control conditions only. Statistically significant differences between conditions were confined between 4 and 15 Hz, unlike the occipito-temporal sites where differences occurred at much higher frequencies (high beta/gamma). Our data indicate that N170 amplitude is sensitive to the amount of movement in the visual field, independent of stimulus type. In contrast, occipito-temporal beta and gamma activity differentiates between facial am non-facial motion. Context and stimulus configuration likely plays a role in shaping neural responses, based on comparisons of the current data to previously reported studies. Broadband suppression of central beta activity, and significant low frequency differences were likely stimulus driven and not contingent on behavioral responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Temporo-frontal phase synchronization supports hierarchical network for mismatch negativity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						MMN; Alpha; Theta; Gamma; Phase-locking; Independent component analysis; Predictive coding; Standard; Deviant; Auditory change detection	AUDITORY CHANGE DETECTION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN RESPONSES; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS; MMN	Objective: We performed an experiment designed to reveal the brain-regional network dynamics underlying both automatic and intentional auditory change detection as typically indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential (ERP). Methods: High-density EEG was recorded while participants heard a stream of standard pure tones, into which occasional (14%) frequency deviants were inserted. In a first run they listened passively while watching a closed-captioned movie, whereas in a second run they pressed a button each time they detected a deviant while watching the movie with neither sound nor captioning. Results: Independent component analysis revealed independent components that we localized to temporal and frontal regional brain sources relevant to the generation of the MMN. Relative power in various oscillatory frequency bands, computed from a wavelet analysis on the time series of these independent components, was modulated by task demands and stimulus type, as was dynamic phase-locking between pairs of the independent components in those same frequency bands. Conclusion: These results support a hierarchical model of MMN generation that emphasizes information processing and transfer between temporal and frontal brain regions. Significance: In addition to enhancing the use of the MMN to evaluate some aspects of central auditory functioning, these results could be important for the evaluation of alterations in other cognitive functions or in consciousness.

Very early processing of emotional words revealed in temporoparietal junctions of both hemispheres by EEG and TMS	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Lexical decision; Word detection; Emotion; Lateralisation; Right hemisphere; EEG; Source imaging; TMS	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; RESTING STATE; BRAIN-DAMAGE; RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; SPEECH	We investigate the contribution of both hemispheres in a lateralised lexical decision paradigm with emotional and neutral words in healthy volunteers. In a first experiment, high-density EEG analysis using source imaging methods revealed early specific participation of the temporoparietal junctions (TPJ) in both hemispheres for the detection of words. Then, in an event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation experiment with the same task, the disruption of left or right TPJ compared with a control stimulation over the vertex showed a slowing that is more pronounced when words are emotional and presented in the left visual field (LVF). This indicates that interference with both left and right TPJ results in impaired processing of words that were presented to the LVF. In addition, these results point to a specific cooperative contribution of the right hemisphere in the processing of words with emotional content compared with neutral words at very early stages. Results from the two experiments can be integrated in a brain-based spatiotemporal model of the early detection of written words.

Regardless of the advantages of combining these modalities, artifacts posed a greater challenge to attain good quality data. One such problematic artifact which contaminates EEG recordings is Ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact. A reference-free composite algorithm which combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and principal component analysis (PCA) named as EMD-PCA has been introduced in this study. The results show that the algorithm can efficiently reduce the BCG artifact by preserving original neuronal signals. The proposed algorithm showed improvement in reducing the BCG artifact as well as in the preservation of brain activities, when compared with two renowned existing methods that are average artifact subtraction (AAS) and optimal basis set (OBS).

The neurophysiological bases of EEG and EEG measurement: A review for the rest of us	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; ERP; Methods; Signal propagation	ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE; BRAIN; CONDUCTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; QUALITY; ALPHA; MODEL; MEG	A thorough understanding of the EEG signal and its measurement is necessary to produce high quality data and to draw accurate conclusions from those data. However, publications that discuss relevant topics are written for divergent audiences with specific levels of expertise: explanations are either at an abstract level that leaves readers with a fuzzy understanding of the electrophysiology involved, or are at a technical level that requires mastery of the relevant physics to understand. A clear, comprehensive review of the origin and measurement of EEG that bridges these high and low levels of explanation fills a critical gap in the literature and is necessary for promoting better research practices and peer review. The present paper addresses the neurophysiological source of EEG, propagation of the EEG signal, technical aspects of EEG measurement, and implications for interpretation of EEG data.

The aim of the study was to explore how the introduction of the cue influences the morphological features of the MRCP and ERD/ERS curves. Preliminary results of the tests in 9 healthy subjects showed statistically significant differences in MRCP components for the two conditions and no significant differences in ERD/ERS morphology.

We aimed to investigate event-related oscillations associated with the Stroop test. EEG data was collected from 23 healthy volunteers while they performed a computer version of Stroop test. Both evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) oscillatory responses in the EEG were analyzed by wavelet transform. Data from the congruent (color-word matching) and incongruent stimuli (color-word non-matching) conditions are compared. In the incongruent condition, N450 wave was more negative and amplitude of the late slow wave was more positive. In the time-frequency plane, the fronto-central total theta amplitude (300-700 ms) was larger in the incongruent condition. The evoked delta (250-600 ms) was larger in the congruent condition particularly over parieto-occipital regions. The larger frontal theta response in the incongruent condition was associated with the detection of interference and inhibition of the response to task-irrelevant features, while the larger evoked delta in the congruent condition was suggestive of the easier decision process owing to congruency between the physical attribute and the verbal meaning of the stimuli. Furthermore, in the incongruent condition, amplitude of the occipital total alpha in the very late phase (700-900 ms) was smaller. This prolonged desynchronization in the alpha band could be reflecting augmentation of attentional filters in visual modality for the next stimulus. These multiple findings on EEG time-frequency plane provide improved description of the overlapping processes in Stroop test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A network of cortical areas is responsible for the motor preparation process, including the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) and the SMA. However, the relationship between activity in these regions during movement preparation and the readiness potential is poorly understood. We examined this relationship by integrating simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI through computational modeling. We first observed that global field power of premovement neural activity showed a specific correlation with BOLD responses in the aMCC. We then used dynamic causal modeling to infer premovement interactions between these regions and their relationship to the premovement neural activity underlying the readiness potential. These analyses suggest that SMA and aMCC have strong reciprocal connections that act to sustain each other's activity, and that this interaction is mediated during movement preparation according to the readiness potential amplitude, as reflected in global cortical field power. Our study suggests that the reciprocal connections between SMA and aMCC are important to maintain the sustained activity of the readiness potential before movement and lead to a weak system instability at movement onset. We suggest that the effective connectivity of this network underlies its functional role in the preparation of self-generated actions.

Therefore, improvement in the assessment and management of patients with BSDs is critical. Should valid physiological measures for BSDs be identified and implemented, significant clinical improvements are likely to be realized. This chapter reviews the physiological correlates of BSDs and treatment, and in doing so, examines the neuroimaging, electroencephalogram, and event-related potential, and peripheral physiological correlates that both characterize and differentiate BSDs and their response to treatment. Key correlates of BSDs involve underlying disturbances in prefrontal and limbic network neural activity, early neural processing, and within the autonomic nervous system. These changes appear to be mood-related and can be normalized with treatment. We adopt an "embodied'' perspective and propose a novel, working framework that takes into account embodied psychophysiological mechanisms in which the physiological correlates of BSD are integrated. This approach may in time provide the objective physiological measures needed to improve assessment and decision making when treating patients with BSDs. Future research with integrative, multimodal measures is likely to yield potential applications for physiological measures of BSD that correlate closely with diagnosis and treatment.

Event-related oscillations (ERO) reflect cognitive responses of brain whereas sensory-evoked oscillations (SE) inform about sensory responses. For this study, we compared visual SEO and ERO responses in MCI to explore brain dynamics (Background). Forty-three patients with MCI (mean age=74.0 year) and 41 age- and education-matched healthy-elderly controls (HC) (mean age=71.1 year) participated in the study. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-3.0 Hz) were measured from two conditions (simple visual stimulation and classical visual oddball paradigm target stimulation) (Method). Overall, amplitudes of target ERO responses were higher than SEO amplitudes. The preferential location for maximum amplitude values was frontal lobe for ERO and occipital lobe for SEO. The ANOVA for delta responses showed significant results for the group Xparadigm. Post-hoc tests indicated that (1) the difference between groups were significant for target delta responses, but not for SEO, (2) ERO elicited higher responses for HC than MCI patients, and (3) females had higher target ERO than males and this difference was pronounced in the control group (Results). Overall, cognitive responses display almost double the amplitudes of sensory responses over frontal regions. The topography of oscillatory responses differs depending on stimuli: visualsensory responses are highest over occipitals and -cognitive responses over frontal regions. A group effect is observed in MCI indicating that visual sensory and cognitive circuits behave differently indicating preserved visual sensory responses, but decreased cognitive responses (Conclusion).

ERP abnormalities elicited by word repetition in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and amnestic MCI	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Fragile X permutation; Dementia; Memory; Language; EEG	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PREMUTATION CARRIERS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; MENTAL-RETARDATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FMR1 PREMUTATION; MOUSE MODEL	Background: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by FMR1 gene premutations, typically associated with frontal-subcortical type cognitive impairments. High prevalence (similar to 50%) of superimposed Alzheimer's pathology has been reported in FMR1 premutation carriers, and standardized neuropsychological tests have not yielded any robust discriminators between FXTAS and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The similarities/differences in memory processes between FXTAS and early AD remain underexplored. Methods: 32-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from a semantic judgment task in which semantically congruous (50%) and incongruous pairs repeat pseudorandomly. The N400 and late positive component (LPC) of 25 FXTAS patients (M-age=71.2, MMSE=26.6) were compared to a matched group of 25 patients with MCI or early AD (1 mild AD dementia, 24 amnestic MCI, of whom 18 later converted to AD; M-age=73.4, MMSE=26.4), and 25 healthy elderly. Results: Both patient groups showed similar reductions in the N400 repetition effect and N400 congruity effect amplitudes, compared to controls, reflecting abnormal semantic priming and repetition priming. The MCI/AD group, however, had significantly smaller LPC word repetition effects and poorer learning and memory on the CVLT than FXTAS. The LPC and N400 repetition effects both correlated with verbal memory across all subjects, but only N400 correlated with memory in FXTAS. Conclusion: FXTAS patients show relative sparing of the LPC repetition effect, and less disruption of explicit memory than prodromal/early AD. N400 abnormalities in FXTAS appear to account for much of their mild impairments in verbal learning and memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently no medication is really effective against it. Even, its diagnosis and management remain challenging research problem for scientists. This paper aims towards identifying early-stage AD based upon the characteristics of the non-oscillatory independent components (ICs) of the auditory event related potential (AERP) waveforms of an oddball task for healthy and newly diagnosed AD subjects. Using 27 sensors to record P300 Evoked Potentials (EPs) as features vectors to train the simplified fuzzy adaptive resonance theory map (SFAM) neural network as a classifier, normal and AD subjects were classified with higher than 95% of success. The use of the ARTMAP-familiarity discrimination (ARTMAP-FD) shows that the separation of the two populations was achieved with high success and without any mistake. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from a Frontocentral Negative Potential Modulated by Movement Execution Errors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arm-movements; EEG-ERP; error-processing; feedback-related negativity; force-field; kinematics	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BLIND SEPARATION; ADAPTATION; DOPAMINE; FEEDBACK; SYSTEM; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; COMPONENTS	In humans, electrophysiological correlates of error processing have been extensively investigated in relation to decision-making theories. In particular, error-related ERPs have been most often studied using response selection tasks. In these tasks, involving very simple motor responses (e. g., button press), errors concern inappropriate action-selection only. However, EEG activity in relation to inaccurate movement-execution in more complex motor tasks has been much less examined. In the present study, we recorded EEG while volunteers performed reaching movements in a force-field created by a robotic device. Hand-path deviations were induced by interspersing catch trials in which the force condition was unpredictably altered. Our goal was twofold. First, we wanted to determine whether a frontocentral ERP was elicited by sensory-prediction errors, whose amplitude reflected the size of kinematic errors. Then, we explored whether common neural processes could be involved in the generation of this ERP and the feedback-related negativity (FRN), often assumed to reflect reward-prediction errors. We identified a frontocentral negativity whose amplitude was modulated by the size of the hand-path deviations induced by the unpredictable mechanical perturbations. This kinematic error-related ERP presented great similarities in terms of time course, topography, and potential source-location with the FRN recorded in the same experiment. These findings suggest that the processing of sensory-prediction errors and the processing of reward-prediction errors could involve a shared neural network.

There is a sustained posterior negativity (SPN) related to the presence of symmetry. There is also functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity in extrastriate visual areas and in the lateral occipital complex. We summarise the evidence by answering six questions. (1) Is there an automatic and sustained response to symmetry in visual areas? Answer: Yes, and this suggests automatic processing of symmetry. (2) Which brain areas are involved in symmetry perception? Answer: There is an extended network from extrastriate areas to higher areas. (3) Is reflection special? Answer: Reflection is the optimal stimulus for a more general regularity-sensitive network. (4) Is the response to symmetry independent of view angle? Answer: When people classify patterns as symmetrical or random, the response to symmetry is view-invariant. When people attend to other dimensions, the network responds to residual regularity in the image. (5) How are brain rhythms in the two hemispheres altered during symmetry perception? Answer: Symmetry processing (rather than presence) produces more alpha desynchronization in the right posterior regions. Finally, (6) does symmetry processing produce positive affect? Answer: Not in the strongest sense, but behavioural measures reveal implicit positive evaluation of abstract symmetry.	[Bertamini, Marco; Makin, Alexis D.

At present, the search for functional correlates of brain oscillations is an important trend in neuroscience. Furthermore, analyses of oscillatory responses provide key knowledge on the physiology of brain dynamics. Studies analysing oscillatory dynamics in face perception and emotional pictures have increased in recent years; however, the literature lacks a review of the current state of the art. This study provides a comprehensive review of the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillatory responses on presentation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures (International Affective Picture System, IAPS). The reviewed literature revealed that the brain is more sensitive to emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli. A common and reliable finding from all reviewed studies was the increased brain responsiveness towards negative emotional pictures (face expression or IAPS). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Fifteen PD patients and 15 healthy controls were recruited for the study. PD patients were administrated a basic neuropsychological assessment oriented to exclude cognitive impairments. Both groups underwent the computerized IGT during electroencephalography (EEG) registration. To analyse ERPs, continuous EEG data were epoched within a time-window starting 1000 ms before and ending 1000 ms after feedback presentation and averaged separately for positive (i.e., win condition) and negative (i.e., loss condition) feedbacks. Behavioral data revealed a significant lower performance of PD patients (p < 0.05) compared with the controls. While controls demonstrated a correct feedback evaluation, PD patients did not show any learning, selecting more disadvantageous decks even in the last part of task. Furthermore, ERPs results revealed that controls showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in ERPs morphology recorded after the win and the loss conditions, suggesting that positive and negative feedbacks were differently evaluated and processed. PD patients showed a different pattern: their ERPs morphology was the same for positive and negative feedback. Interestingly, our ERPs results suggest that in PD patients an incorrect evaluation of context-relevant outcomes could be the reason of a poor performance in decision-making tasks, and could explain cognitive and behavioral problems related to impulse control disorder.

In this study, we recorded the electroencephlography (EEG) signals of thirteen subjects recruited for the natural auditory memory retrieval task. EEGs were recorded using an electrode cap with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) computed. For evaluating the interaction between distinct brain regions, phase-locking value (PLV) was calculated to determine the functional connectivity for distinct frequency bands. The results of ERSPs show that there is larger delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (5-8 Hz) synchronization in the left-and midline-frontal areas for subjects when they attend to the music segments with main theme. For the desynchronization of the alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz) in the midline-occipital and parietal region, the local suppression may indicate the engagement of specific cortical areas in sensory or cognitive functions. There is also strong beta synchronization when the subjects were attending to melody similar to the main theme which may indicate the active inhibition of motor cortices. The functional connectivity is shown by calculating the phase synchronization. Since the task is mainly related to the retrieval of working memory, the phase-locking value for the theta band is significantly larger when the subjects heard the melody similar to the main theme than the condition without main-theme recognition. However, the difference of phase synchronization between main-theme condition and other sound segments is not significant. The phase synchronization is significantly larger for the condition of similar melody in the frontal-parietal, frontal-temporal, and temporal-parietal regions which may indicate the processing of memory information.

This might be related to a decline of awareness, to episodes of low arousal and disturbed sleep patterns, and/or to distorting and attenuating effects of the skull and intermediate tissue on the recorded brain signals. Novel approaches are required to overcome these limitations. We introduced epidural electrocorticography (ECoG) for monitoring of cortical physiology in a late-stage amytrophic lateral sclerosis patient in completely locked-in state (CLIS) Despite long-term application for a period of six months, no implant related complications occurred. Recordings from the left frontal cortex were sufficient to identify three arousal states. Spectral analysis of the intrinsic oscillatory activity enabled us to extract state-dependent dominant frequencies at <4, similar to 7 and similar to 20 Hz, representing sleep-like periods, and phases of low and elevated arousal, respectively. In the absence of other biomarkers, ECoG proved to be a reliable tool for monitoring circadian rhythmicity, i.e., avoiding interference with the patient when he was sleeping and exploiting time windows of responsiveness. Moreover, the effects of interventions addressing the patient's arousal, e.g., amantadine medication, could be evaluated objectively on the basis of physiological markers, even in the absence of behavioral parameters. Epidural ECoG constitutes a feasible trade-off between surgical risk and quality of recorded brain signals to gain information on the patient's present level of arousal. This approach enables us to optimize the timing of interactions and medical interventions, all of which should take place when the patient is in a phase of high arousal. Furthermore, avoiding low responsiveness periods will facilitate measures to implement alternative communication pathways involving brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

These respiratory events lead to chronic sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia. Several studies have shown that OSA is associated with daytime sleepiness and cognitive dysfunctions, characterized by impairments of attention, episodic memory, working memory, and executive functions. This paper reviews the cognitive profile of adults with OSA and discusses the relative role of altered sleep and hypoxemia in the aetiology of these cognitive deficits. Markers of cognitive dysfunctions such as those measured with waking electroencephalography and neuroimaging are also presented. The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cognitive functioning and the possibility of permanent brain damage associated with OSA are also discussed. Finally, this paper reviews the evidence suggesting that OSA is a risk factor for developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia in the aging population and stresses the importance of its early diagnosis and treatment.

In the present EEG study, we investigated the influence of social pressure on visual perception in participants with high (HA) and low (LA) levels of autonomy. Ten HA and ten LA individuals were asked to accomplish a visual discrimination task in an adapted paradigm of Solomon Asch. Results indicate that LA participants adapted to the incorrect group opinion more often than HA participants (42% vs. 30% of the trials, respectively). LA participants showed a larger posterior P1 component contralateral to targets presented in the right visual field when conforming to the correct compared to conforming to the incorrect group decision. In conclusion, our ERP data suggest that the group context can have early effects on our perception rather than on conscious decision processes in LA, but not HA participants.

Improvements in concentration, working memory and sustained attention following consumption of a natural citicoline-caffeine beverage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION			English	Article						Attention; citicoline; EEG; functional beverage; nutrition	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; AUSTIN MAZE; PERFORMANCE; DEFICITS; DISEASE; UPDATE; AD/HD; ADHD; EEG; CPT	This study examined the neurocognitive and electrophysiological effects of a citicoline-caffeine-based beverage in 60 healthy adult participants enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Measures of electrical brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuropsychological measures examining attention, concentration and reaction time were administered. Compared to placebo, participants receiving the citicoline-caffeine beverage exhibited significantly faster maze learning times and reaction times on a continuous performance test, fewer errors in a go/no-go task and better accuracy on a measure of information processing speed. EEG results examining P450 event-related potentials revealed that participants receiving the citicoline-caffeine beverage exhibited higher P450 amplitudes than controls, suggesting an increase in sustained attention. Overall, these findings suggest that the beverage significantly improved sustained attention, cognitive effort and reaction times in healthy adults. Evidence of improved P450 amplitude indicates a general improvement in the ability to accommodate new and relevant information within working memory and overall enhanced brain activation.

Using electroencephalography (EEG) and a computerized line bisection task, here we investigated for the first time the neural correlates of changes in spatial attention bias induced by line-length (the so-called line-length effect). In accordance with previous studies, an overall systematic left bias (pseudoneglect) was present during long line but not during short line bisection performance. This effect of line-length on behavioral bias was associated with stronger right parietooccipital responses to long as compared to short lines in an early time window (100-200 ms) post-stimulus onset. This early differential activation to long as compared to short lines was task-independent (present even in a non-spatial control task not requiring line bisection), suggesting that it reflects a reflexive attentional response to long lines. This was corroborated by further analyses source-localizing the line-length effect to the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and revealing a positive correlation between the strength of this effect and the magnitude by which long lines (relative to short lines) drive a behavioral left bias across individuals. Therefore, stimulus-driven left bisection bias was associated with increased right hemispheric engagement of areas of the ventral attention network. This further substantiates that this network plays a key role in the genesis of spatial bias, and suggests that post-stimulus TPJ-activity at early information processing stages (around the latency of the N1 component) contributes to the left bias.

Being a first-order discriminator, LDA is usually preceded by the feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as multi-density EEG data are of second order. In this study, an analytic bilinear classification method which inherits and extends LDA is proposed. This method considers 2-dimentional EEG signals as the feature input and performs classification using the optimized complex-valued bilinear projections. Without being transformed into frequency domain, the complex-valued bilinear projections essentially spatially and temporally modulate the phases and magnitudes of slow event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by distinct brain states in the sense that they become more separable. The results show that the proposed method has demonstrated its discriminating capability in the development of a rapid image triage (RIT) system, which is a challenging variant of BCIs due to the fast presentation speed and consequently overlapping of ERPs.

Reflectional symmetry is more quickly detected when it is a property of a single object than when it is formed by a gap between two objects. Translational symmetry shows the reverse effect, being more quickly detected when it is a gap between objects. We investigated the neural correlates of this interaction. Electroencephalographic data was recorded from 40 participants who were presented with reflected and translated contours in one-or two-object displays. Half of the participants discriminated regularity, half distinguished number of objects. An event-related potential known as the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN) distinguished between reflection and translation. A similar ERP distinguished between one and two object presentations, but these waves summed with the SPN, rather than altering it. All stimuli produced desynchronization of 8-13 Hz alpha oscillations over the bilateral parietal cortex. In the Discriminate Regularity group, this effect was right lateralized. The SPN and alpha desynchronization index different stages of visual symmetry discrimination. However, neither component displayed the Regularity X Objecthood interaction that is observed in speeded discrimination tasks, suggesting that integration of visual regularity with objectness is not inevitable. Instead, both attributes may be processed in parallel and independently.	[Makin, Alexis D.

Suppression of Salient Objects Prevents Distraction in Visual Search	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; distraction; EEG; ERP; suppression; visual search	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; TOP-DOWN; CAPTURE; SINGLETONS; MECHANISMS; DETERMINES; RESOLUTION; PREDICTS; TARGET	To find objects of interest in a cluttered and continually changing visual environment, humans must often ignore salient stimuli that are not currently relevant to the task at hand. Recent neuroimaging results indicate that the ability to prevent salience-driven distraction depends on the current level of attentional control activity in frontal cortex, but the specific mechanism by which this control activity prevents salience-driven distraction is still poorly understood. Here, we asked whether salience-driven distraction is prevented by suppressing salient distractors or by preferentially up-weighting the relevant visual dimension. We found that salient distractors were suppressed even when they resided in the same feature dimension as the target (that is, when dimensional weighting was not a viable selection strategy). Our neurophysiological measure of suppression-the P-D component of the event-related potential-was associated with variations in the amount of time it took to perform the search task: distractors triggered the P-D on fast-response trials, but on slow-response trials they triggered activity associated with working memory representation instead. These results demonstrate that during search salience-driven distraction is mitigated by a suppressive mechanism that reduces the salience of potentially distracting visual objects.

Methods: A sample of 30 college students currently meeting a diagnosis of ADHD and 25 typically developing students, matched on age and gender, performed a delayed match-to-sample task with low and high memory load conditions. Dense-array electroencephalography was recorded. Specifically, the P3, an event related potential (ERP) associated with WM, was examined because of its relation with attentional allocation during WM. Task performance (accuracy, reaction time) as well as performance on other neuropsychological tasks of WM was analyzed. Results: Neural differences were found between the groups. Specifically, the P3 amplitude was smaller in the ADHD group compared to the comparison group for both load conditions at parietal-occipital sites. Lower scores on behavioural working memory tasks were suggestive of impaired behavioural WM performance in the ADHD group. Conclusions: Findings from this study provide the first evidence of neural differences in the encoding stage of WM in young adults with ADHD, suggesting ineffective allocation of attentional resources involved in encoding of information in WM. Significance: These findings, reflecting alternate neural functioning of WM, may explain some of the difficulties related to WM functioning that college students with ADHD report in their every day cognitive functioning.

To exploit such prior knowledge, our technique makes use of recent advances in complex-valued statistics to exploit the power difference or the correlation between the data channels, in contrast to current methods which cater only for the restrictive class of circular data. In particular, the principal component analysis-like technique was employed to detect the onset of P300, and tracked this event-related potential. In this way, the classification of EEG can be made possible to differentiate between a healthy subject and a schizophrenic patient. In particular, we illuminate how features such as P3a and P3b can be used to perform such classification.

J	van den Broeke, EN; Mouraux, A				van den Broeke, Emanuel N.; Mouraux, Andre			Enhanced brain responses to C-fiber input in the area of secondary hyperalgesia induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation of the skin	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						high-frequency stimulation; secondary hyperalgesia; event-related potentials; heat; C fibers	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA; CAPSAICIN INJECTION; HEAT HYPERALGESIA; EEG RESPONSES; PAIN; AFFERENTS; NOCICEPTORS; MONKEY	High-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the human skin induces an increase in both mechanical and heat pain sensitivity in the surrounding unconditioned skin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HFS on the intensity of perception and brain responses elicited by the selective activation of C fibers. HFS was applied to the ventral forearm of 15 healthy volunteers. Temperature-controlled CO2 laser stimulation was used to activate selectively low-threshold C-fiber afferents without concomitantly activating A delta-fiber afferents. These stimuli were detected with reaction times compatible with the conduction velocity of C fibers. The intensity of perception and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by thermal stimuli delivered to the surrounding unconditioned skin were recorded before (T0) and after HFS (T1: 20 min after HFS; T2: 45 min after HFS). The contralateral forearm served as a control. Mechanical hyperalgesia following HFS was confirmed by measuring the change in the intensity of perception elicited by mechanical punctate stimuli. HFS resulted in increased intensity of perception to mechanical punctate stimulation and selective C-fiber thermal stimulation at both time points. In contrast, the N2 wave of the ERP elicited by C-fiber stimulation (679 +/- 88 ms; means +/- SD) was enhanced at T1 but not at T2. The P2 wave (808 +/- 105 ms) was unaffected by HFS. Our results suggest that HFS enhances the sensitivity to thermal C-fiber input in the area of secondary hyperalgesia. However, there was no significant enhancement of the magnitude of the C-fiber ERPs at T2, suggesting that quickly adapting C fibers do not contribute to this enhancement.

Twelve VaD patients and twelve age-matched controls participated in the study. EEG signal was recorded when subjects were performing a visual oddball task. Information flow was analyzed between 9 electrodes in frontal, central, and parietal lobes using short-window Directed Transfer Function (sDTF). VaD patients presented a significant decline in the information flow from parietal to frontal and central lobes, compared with the healthy elderly. This decline mainly occurred in delta, theta, and lower alpha bands, from about 200 ms to 300 ms after target stimulus onset. The findings indicated an impaired parietal-to-frontal and parietal-to-central connectivity in VaD patients, which may be one reason for the cognitive deficits in VaD patients.

The objective was to assess development of EEG markers of these strategies and their role in both preparatory attention (contingent negative variation, CNV) and response monitoring (Error Related Negativity, ERN, and Correct Related Negativity, CRN). Methods: CNV, ERN and CRN were assessed in 38 adolescents (18 girls), age 11-18 years, using a variation of a letter discrimination task. Results: Accuracy increased with age and developmental stage. Younger adolescents used a posterior attention network involved in inhibiting irrelevant information. Activity in this juvenile network, as indexed by a posteriorly-biased CNV and CRN decreased with age and advancing pubertal development. Although enhanced frontal CNV, known to be predictive of accuracy in adults, was not detected even in the older adolescents, top-down medial frontal response monitoring processes (ERN) showed evidence of development within the age-range studied. Conclusions: The data revealed a dissociation of developmental progress, marked by relatively delayed onset of frontal preparatory attention relative to error monitoring. Significance: This dissociation may render adolescents vulnerable to excessive risk-taking and disinhibited behavior imposed by asynchronous development of component cognitive control processes.

The solution of these techniques depends directly on the accuracy of the forward model that is inverted. Recently, a parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) framework for distributed source reconstruction in EEG/MEG was introduced and implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The framework allows us to compare different forward modeling approaches, using real data, instead of using more traditional simulated data from an assumed true forward model. In the absence of a subject specific MR image, a 3-layered boundary element method (BEM) template head model is currently used including a scalp, skull and brain compartment. In this study, we introduced volumetric template head models based on the finite difference method (FDM). We constructed a FDM head model equivalent to the BEM model and an extended FDM model including CSF. These models were compared within the context of three different types of source priors related to the type of inversion used in the PEB framework: independent and identically distributed (IID) sources, equivalent to classical minimum norm approaches, coherence (COH) priors similar to methods such as LORETA, and multiple sparse priors (MSP). The resulting models were compared based on ERP data of 20 subjects using Bayesian model selection for group studies. The reconstructed activity was also compared with the findings of previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found very strong evidence in favor of the extended FDM head model with CSF and assuming MSP. These results suggest that the use of realistic volumetric forward models can improve PEB EEG source reconstruction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The comparative judgments were based on a newly learned rule binding the auditory and visual stimuli within the context of magnitude comparisons: the higher the pitch of the tone, the larger the number presented. The cortical responses were measured by simultaneous MEG\EEG recordings and a combined source analysis with individualized realistic head models was performed. Musical expertise effects were investigated by comparing musicians to non-musicians. Congruent audiovisual stimuli, corresponding to the newly learned rule, elicited activity in frontotemporal and occipital areas. In contrast, incongruent stimuli activated temporal and parietal regions. Musicians when compared with nonmusicians showed increased differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli in a prefrontal region, thereby indicating that music expertise may affect multisensory comparative judgments within a generalized representation of analog magnitude.

In the current study, an associative learning task was used in healthy participants assessed for obsessive-compulsive symptoms by the OCI-R questionnaire. The task included a condition with equivocal feedback that did not inform about the participants' performance. Following incorrect responses, an error-related negativity and an error positivity were observed. In the feedback phase, the largest feedback-related negativity was observed following equivocal feedback. Theta and beta oscillatory components were found following incorrect and correct responses, respectively, and an increase in theta power was associated with negative and equivocal feedback. Changes over time were also explored as an indicator for possible learning effects. Finally, event-related potentials and oscillatory components were found to be uncorrelated with OCI-R scores in the current non-clinical sample. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Disrupted Gamma-Band Neural Oscillations During Coherent Motion Perception in Heavy Cannabis Users	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA MT; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; GLUTAMATERGIC NEURONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; TRANSPARENT MOTION; CORTICAL AREAS; CB1 RECEPTOR	Previous work in animals and humans has shown that exogenous cannabinoids disrupt time-locked, evoked gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz). However, no studies to date have examined the effect of cannabis on non-time-locked, induced gamma oscillations during more complex Gestalt perception. The current study therefore utilized electroencephalography (EEG) to examine gamma oscillations during coherent motion perception in heavy cannabis users and controls. Chronic cannabis users (n = 24; 12 h abstinence before study; positive 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol urine levels) and cannabis-naive controls (n = 23) were evaluated. Stimuli consisted of random dot kinetograms (RD1<s) that subjects passively viewed during three different conditions: coherent motion, incoherent motion, and static. Time x frequency analysis on EEG data was performed using Fourier-based mean trial power (MTP). Transient event-related potentials (ERPs) to stimulus onset (visual N100 and P200 components) were also evaluated. The results showed that the coherent motion condition produced a robust increase in neural activity in the gamma range (induced power from 40 to 59 Hz) as compared with the incoherent motion and static conditions. As predicted, the cannabis group showed significant reductions in induced gamma power in the coherent condition relative to healthy controls. No differences were observed between the groups in the N100 or P200 components, indicating intact primary sensory processing. Finally, cannabis users showed a trend toward increased scores on the Chapman Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) that was positively correlated with total years of active cannabis use. These data suggest that cannabis use may interfere with the generation of induced gamma-band neural oscillations that could in part mediate the perceptual-altering effects of exogenous cannabinoids.

Recent findings demonstrate that neural activity that is time-locked to a particular amplitude-modulation (AM) is enhanced in the auditory cortex when the modulated stream of sounds is selectively attended to under sensory competition with other streams. However, the target sounds used in the previous studies differed not only in their AM, but also in other sound features, such as carrier frequency or location. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the observed enhancements reflect AM-selective attention. The present study aims at dissociating the effect of AM frequency on response enhancement in auditory cortex by using an ongoing auditory stimulus that contains two competing targets differing exclusively in their AM frequency. Electroencephalography results showed a sustained response enhancement for auditory attention compared to visual attention, but not for AM-selective attention (attended AM frequency vs. ignored AM frequency). In contrast, the response to the ignored AM frequency was enhanced, although a brief trend toward response enhancement occurred during the initial 15 s. Together with the previous findings, these observations indicate that selective enhancement of attended AMs in auditory cortex is adaptive under sustained AM-selective attention. This finding has implications for our understanding of cortical mechanisms for feature-based attentional gain control.

This work introduces a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combines MI and SSVEP strategies - such an approach allows us to improve performance and universality of the system, and also the number of EEG electrodes from 32 to 3 in central area can increase the efficiency of EEG preprocessing to design an effective and easy way to use hybrid BCI system. In this study the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm was introduced as a feature extraction method, which provides a high accuracy in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD)-based BCI. The four most common classifiers (KNNC, PARZENDC, LDC, SVC) were used for accuracy estimation. Results show that support vector classifier (SVC) and K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier provide better performance than others, and it is possible to reach the same good accuracy using 3-channel (C3, Cz, C4) hybrid BCI system, as with usual 32-channel system .

Cortical response of the ventral attention network to unattended angry facial expressions: an EEG source analysis study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ventral attentional network; temporo-parietal junction; EEG source analysis; threatening facial expressions; attention modulation	HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; FUSIFORM FACE AREA; EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; ERP; LATERALIZATION; AUTOMATICITY; METAANALYSIS	Introduction: We used an affective prime task composed of emotional (happy, angry, and neutral) prime faces and target words with either positive or negative valence. By asking subjects to attend to either the faces' emotional expression or to the glasses' shape, we assessed whether angry facial expressions were processed when they were unattended and task-irrelevant. Methods: We conducted a distributed source analysis on the corresponding event-related potentials focused on the early activity of face processing and attention networks' related areas. We also evaluated the magnitude of the affective priming effect. Results: We observed a reduction of occipitotemporal areas' (BA37) activation to unattended compared to attended faces and a modulation of primary visual areas' activity lateralization. The latter was more right lateralized for attended than for unattended faces, and emotional faces were more right lateralized than neutral ones only in the former condition. Affective priming disappeared when emotional expressions of prime faces were ignored. Moreover, an increased activation in the right temporo parietal junction (TPA but not in the intraparietal sulcus, was observed only for unattended angry facial expressions at 170 ms after face presentation. Conclusion: We suggest that attentional resources affect the early processing in visual and occipito-temporal areas, irrespective of the faces' threatening content. The disappearance of the affective priming effect suggests that when subjects were asked to focus on glasses' shape, attentional resources were not available to process the facial emotional expression, even though emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features of the face were presented in the same position. On the other hand, unattended angry faces evoked a pre-attentive TPJ activity, which most likely represents a bottom-up trigger that signals their high behavioral relevance, although it is unrelated to task demands.

To study the neural correlates of congenital prosopagnosia, we measured the face-sensitive N170 component of the event-related potential in three members of the same family (father (56 y), son (25 y) and daughter (22 y)) and in age-matched neurotypical participants (young controls: n = 14; 24.5 y +/- 2.1; old controls: n = 6; 57.3 y +/- 5.4). To compare the face sensitivity of N170 in congenital prosopagnosic and neurotypical participants we measured the event-related potentials for faces and phase-scrambled random noise stimuli. In neurotypicals we found significantly larger N170 amplitude for faces compared to noise stimuli, reflecting normal early face processing. The congenital prosopagnosic participants, by contrast, showed reduced face sensitivity of the N170, and this was due to a larger than normal noise-elicited N170, rather than to a smaller face-elicited N170. Interestingly, single-trial analysis revealed that the lack of face sensitivity in congenital prosopagnosia is related to a larger oscillatory power and phase-locking in the theta frequency-band (4-7 Hz, 130-190 ms) as well as to a lower intertrial jitter of the response latency for the noise stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that congenital prosopagnosia is due to the deficit of early, structural encoding steps of face perception in filtering between face and non-face stimuli.

Recent studies use time-varying multivariate autoregressive (TV-MAR) models to better describe the changing connectivity between cortical regions where the TV coefficients are estimated by Kalman filter (KF) within a state-space framework. We extend this approach by incorporating Kalman smoothing (KS) to improve the KF estimates, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the unknown model parameters from EEG. We also consider solving the volume conduction problem by modeling the induced instantaneous correlations using a full noise covariate. Simulation results show the superiority of KS in tracking the coefficient changes. We apply two derived frequency domain measures i.e. TV partial directed coherence (TV-PDC) and TV directed transfer function (TV-DTF), to investigate dynamic causal interactions between motor areas in discriminating motor imagery (MI) of left and right hand. Event-related changes of information flows around beta-band, in a unidirectional way between left and right hemispheres are observed during MI. A difference in interhemispheric connectivity patterns is found between left and right-hand movements, implying potential usage for BCI.	[Samdin, S.

J	Reuter, EM; Voelcker-Rehage, C; Vieluf, S; Godde, B				Reuter, Eva-Maria; Voelcker-Rehage, Claudia; Vieluf, Solveig; Godde, Ben			Effects of age and expertise on tactile learning in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; EEG/ERP; expertise; meta-plasticity; somatosensory	SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; VIBROTACTILE STIMULI; SENSORY STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; MEDIAN NERVE; OLDER-ADULTS; AGING BRAIN; P300; DISCRIMINATION	Repetitive tactile stimulation is a well-established tool for inducing somatosensory cortical plasticity and changes in tactile perception. Previous studies have suggested that baseline performance determines the amount of stimulation-induced learning differently in specific populations. Older adults with lower baseline performance than young adults, but also experts, with higher baseline performance than non-experts of the same age, have been found to profit most from such interventions. This begs the question of how age-related and expertise-related differences in tactile learning are reflected in neurophysiological correlates. In two experiments, we investigated how tactile learning depends on age (experiment 1) and expertise (experiment 2). We assessed tactile spatial and temporal discrimination accuracy and event-related potentials (ERPs) in 57 persons of different age and expertise groups before and after a 30-min tactile stimulation intervention. The intervention increased accuracy in temporal (found in experiment 1) and spatial (found in experiment 2) discrimination. Experts improved more than non-experts in spatial discrimination. Lower baseline performance was associated with higher learning gain in experts and non-experts. After the intervention, P300 latencies were reduced in young adults and amplitudes were increased in late middle-aged adults in the temporal discrimination task. Experts showed a steeper P300 parietal-to-frontal gradient after the stimulation. We demonstrated that tactile stimulation partially reverses the age-related decline in late middle-aged adults and increases processing speed in young adults. We further showed that learning gain depends on baseline performance in both non-experts and experts. In experts, however, the upper limit for learning seems to be shifted to a higher level.

Rejection positivity predicts trial-to-trial reaction times in an auditory selective attention task: a computational analysis of inhibitory control	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						rejection positivity; selective attention; computational model; inhibitory control; distractor salience	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPING OCULOMOTOR COMMANDS; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-SEARCH; STROOP DIMENSIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN	A series of computer simulations using variants of a formal model of attention (Melara and Algom, 2003) probed the role of rejection positivity (RP), a slow-wave electroencephalographic (EEG) component, in the inhibitory control of distraction. Behavioral and EEG data were recorded as participants performed auditory selective attention tasks. Simulations that modulated processes of distractor inhibition accounted well for reaction-time (RT) performance, whereas those that modulated target excitation did not. A model that incorporated RP from actual EEG recordings in estimating distractor inhibition was superior in predicting changes in RT as a function of distractor salience across conditions. A model that additionally incorporated momentary fluctuations in EEG as the source of trial-to-trial variation in performance precisely predicted individual RTs within each condition. The results lend support to the linking proposition that RP controls the speed of responding to targets through the inhibitory control of distractors.

Implicit Perceptual Memory Modulates Early Visual Processing of Ambiguous Images	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ambiguous figures; EEG; perceptual memory; perceptual rivalry; vision; visual cortex	STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; NECKER-CUBE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SENSORY MEMORY; LOW-LEVEL; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ADAPTATION; CORTEX	The way we perceive the present visual environment is influenced by past visual experiences. Here we investigated the neural basis of such experience dependency. We repeatedly presented human observers with an ambiguous visual stimulus (structure-from-motion) that can give rise to two distinct perceptual interpretations. Past visual experience is known to influence the perception of such stimuli. We recorded fast dynamics of neural activity shortly after stimulus onset using event-related electroencephalography. The number of previous occurrences of a certain percept modulated early posterior brain activity starting as early as 50 ms after stimulus onset. This modulation developed across hundreds of percept repetitions, reflecting several minutes of accumulating perceptual experience. Importantly, there was no such modulation when the mere number of previous stimulus presentations was considered regardless of how they were perceived. This indicates that the effect depended on previous perception rather than previous visual input. The short latency and posterior scalp location of the effect suggest that perceptual history modified bottom-up stimulus processing in early visual cortex. We propose that bottom-up neural responses to a given visual presentation are shaped, in part, by feedback modulation that occurred during previous presentations, thus allowing these responses to be biased in light of previous perceptual decisions.

Using neuroimaging to understand the cortical mechanisms of auditory selective attention	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Review							FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; COCKTAIL PARTY; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN-BRAIN; SPEECH; MODULATION; FMRI	Over the last four decades, a range of different neuroimaging tools have been used to study human auditory attention, spanning from classic event-related potential studies using electroencephalography to modern multimodal imaging approaches (e.g., combining anatomical information based on magnetic resonance imaging with magneto- and electroencephalography). This review begins by exploring the different strengths and limitations inherent to different neuroimaging methods, and then outlines some common behavioral paradigms that have been adopted to study auditory attention. We argue that in order to design a neuroimaging experiment that produces interpretable, unambiguous results, the experimenter must not only have a deep appreciation of the imaging technique employed, but also a sophisticated understanding of perception and behavior. Only with the proper caveats in mind can one begin to infer how the cortex supports a human in solving the "cocktail party" problem.

Localizing evoked cortical activity associated with balance reactions: does the anterior cingulate play a role?	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						balance; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; reactive control	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; NEURAL SYSTEM; COMPENSATORY REACTIONS; POSTURAL CORRECTIONS; STANCE PERTURBATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	The ability to correct balance disturbances is essential for the maintenance of upright stability. Although information about how the central nervous system controls balance reactions in humans remains limited, recent literature highlights a potentially important role for the cerebral cortex. The objective of this study was to determine the neural source of the well-reported balance-evoked N1 response. It was hypothesized that the N1 is associated with an "error-detection" event in response to the induced perturbation and therefore may be associated with activity within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The localized source of the N1 evoked by perturbations to standing balance was compared, within each participant, to the location of an error-related negativity (ERN) known to occur within the ACC while performing a flanker task. In contrast to the main hypotheses, the results revealed that the location of the N1 was not within the ACC. The mean Talairach coordinates for the ERN were (6.47, -4.41, 41.17) mm, corresponding to the cingulate gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 24], as expected. However, coordinates for the N1 dipole were (5.74, -11.81, 53.73) mm, corresponding to the medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), specifically the supplementary motor area. This may suggest the N1 is linked to the planning and execution of elements of the evoked balance reactions rather than being associated with error or event detection. Alternatively, it is possible that the N1 is associated with variation in the cortical representation due to task-specific differences in the activation of a distributed network of error-related processing. Subsequent work should focus on disentangling these two possible explanations as they relate to the cortical processing linked to reactive balance control.

Independent components (ICs) come from undesired sources that are mixed with the useful signal, and the assessment of such ICs allows them to be detected. But the unwanted ICs also can contain some useful information. To overcome this problem, wavelet-enhanced ICA (wICA) can be used, and this method applies a wavelet threshold for each wavelet coefficient to suppress abnormal deformation in each wavelet coefficient. Using the wICA algorithm to suppress artifacts provides an EEG signal with less distortion in the amplitude and in the phase of the cerebral part of the EEG, and the cerebral part of the EEG can be estimated and obtained very similar to control conditions. However, the EEG signals are affected by various artifact components, and those that have the greatest influence are electromyography (EMG) and electrooculography (EOG). These artifacts may appear simultaneously, randomly or interruptedly, so a fixed threshold level is not really appropriate. We proposed a system including wICA integrated with an adaptive filter model, and this combination system can provide the best prediction of the impacts of artifacts to set up a threshold value that is adaptive and suitable. Our experimental results showed that are approach provided better rejection of artifacts than the wICA system.

Modulation of the N30 generators of the somatosensory evoked potentials by the mirror neuron system	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MEDIAN NERVE; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; FRONTAL COMPONENT; PREMOTOR CORTEX; PHASE-LOCKING; TOOL USE; BRAIN	The N30 component of the somatosensory evoked potential is known to be modulated by sensory interference, motor action, movement ideation and observation. We introduce a new paradigm in which the observation task Of another person's hand movement triggers the somatosensory stimulus, inducing the N30 response in participants. In order to identify the possible contribution of the mirror neuron network (MNN) to this early sensorimotor processing, we analyzed the N30 topography, the event-related spectral perturbation and the inter-trial coherence on single electroencephalogram (EEG) trials, and we applied swLORETA to localize the N30 sources implicated in the time-frequency domain at rest and during observation, as well as the generators differentiating these two contextual brain states. We found that N30 amplitude increase correlated with increased contralateral precentral alpha, frontal beta, and contralateral frontal gamma power spectrum, and with central and precentral alpha and parietal beta phase-locking of ongoing EEG signals. We demonstrate specific activation of the contralateral post-central and parietal cortex where the angular gyrus (BA39), an important MNN node, is implicated in this enhancement during observation. We conclude that this part of the MNN, involved in proprioceptive processing and more complex body-action representations, is already active prior to somatosensory input and may enhance N30.

The wavelet coherence based on Monte Carlo method (MC-WTC) is effective in measuring the time-frequency coherence of neural signals, but it generates large intermediate data and could not be applied in real-time neural signal analysis. We develop a parallelised MC-WTC method with general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), namely G-MC-WTC, which speeds up the calculations using the CUDA toolkit. Simulation data showed that it can improve the runtime performance by almost 200 times. This method has been applied to a visual-auditory EEG data and to obtain the coherence information between different brain areas in real time. The result revealed a coherence difference in. band at left temporal lobe. This method may become a useful tool for studying the cooperation mechanisms of brain regions in cognitive processes.

We examined whether without salient cues of attention in the form of losses, predictability is reduced. Fifty-seven participants performed an experiential decision task in a gain-only, loss-only, and mixed (gains and losses) condition. Increased risk taking on the part of individuals with relatively high left frontal activation, as denoted by the Alpha band, was only observed in the task involving both gains and losses. Event-related potential analysis sheds light on the processes leading to this pattern. Left-frontal dominant individuals had increased fronto-central P300 activation following risky compared to safe outcomes, while right-frontal dominant individuals did not show a P300 difference following safe and risky outcomes. This interaction also only emerged when losses were contrasted with gains. The findings highlight the sensitivity of behavioral predictability to cues of valence.

Using distraction to regulate emotion: Insights from EEG theta dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion regulation; EEG theta; Distraction	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; FACE; BAND; METAANALYSIS; AROUSAL; MODEL	Distraction is a powerful and widely-used emotion regulation strategy. Although distraction regulates emotion sooner than other cognitive strategies (Thiruchselvam, Blechert, Sheppes, Rydstrom, & Gross, 2011), it is not yet clear whether it is capable of blocking the earliest stages of emotion generation. To address this issue, we capitalized on the excellent temporal resolution of EEG by focusing on occipital theta dynamics which were associated with distinct stages of visual processing of emotional stimuli Individually defined theta band dynamics were extracted from a previously published EEG dataset (Thiruchselvam et at, 2011) in which participants attended to unpleasant (and neutral) images or regulated emotion using distraction and reappraisal. Results revealed two peaks within early theta power increase, both of which were increased by emotional stimuli. Distraction did not affect theta power during an early peak (150-350 ms), but did successfully decrease activity in a second peak (350-550 ms). These results suggest that although distraction acts relatively early in the emotion-generative trajectory, it does not block fast detection of emotional significance. Given that theta dynamics were uncorrelated with Late Positive Potential activity, the present results also encourage researchers to add the occipital theta to the growing toolkit of EEG-based measures of emotion regulation.

Based on the new index MLDoA, the assessment of depth of anaesthesia (DoA) for a patient can be clearly monitored. Firstly, a modified Bayesian wavelet threshold is proposed to de-noise the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Secondly, the Hurst exponent is obtained to classify four states of anaesthesia: deep anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia, light anaesthesia and awake. Finally, the index MLDoA is derived based on the Hurst exponent and maximum-likelihood function. The MLDoA index is evaluated using clinically obtained EEG signals and the bispectral (BIS) data. The results show that the new index remains robust in the case of poor signal quality where BIS does not. Moreover, the new index MLDoA responds faster than the BIS index during the anaesthetic state transitions of patients. To validate the proposed method, the analysis of variance method is used to compare the new index MLDoA with the BIS index. The results indicate that the MLDoA distribution is better in distinguishing the five DoA states.

The present study explores whether a different pattern of response is observed when using non-infant affective pictures. We examined the event-related evoked potentials and induced delta, theta and alpha activity in 14 neglectful mothers and 14 control mothers elicited while categorizing positive, negative and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Self-reports of anhedonia and empathy were also recorded. Early posterior negativity, P200 and late positive potential components were modulated by the emotional content of pictures in both groups. However, the LPP waveform had a more delayed and more attenuated maximum in neglectful mothers than in control mothers. Oscillatory responses indicated lower power increases for neglectful mothers than for control mothers in delta (14 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and lower alpha (8-10 Hz) bands at frontal sites, and a more consistent increase for neglectful mothers in theta and lower alpha bands at occipital sites, especially for negative pictures. These findings help us to better understand the limits of emotional insensitivity in neglectful mothers.

Psychophysiological support of increasing attentional reserve during the development of a motor skill	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Motor learning; Attention; Novelty-P3; EEG; Event-related potential	TASK; TRANSFORMATIONS; PERFORMANCE; EXPERTISE; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; ODDBALL; NOVELTY; IMPACT; TRIALS	The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between motor skill and attentional reserve. Participants practiced a reaching task with the dominant upper extremity, to which a distortion of the visual feedback was applied, while a control group performed the same task without distortion. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs), elicited by auditory stimuli were recorded throughout practice. Performance, as measured by initial directional error, was initially worse relative to controls and improved over trials. Analyses of the ERPs revealed that exogenous components, N1 and P2, were undifferentiated between the groups and did not change with practice. Notably, amplitude of the novelty P3 component, an index of the involuntary orienting of attention, was initially attenuated relative to controls, but progressively increased in amplitude over trials in the learning group only. The results provide psychophysiological evidence that attentional reserve increases as a function of motor skill acquisition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Participants sat by a table with their right hand resting upon it. In IVR, they saw a virtual table that was registered with the real one, and they had a virtual body that substituted their real body seen from a first person perspective. The virtual right hand was collocated with their real right hand. Event-related brain potentials were recorded in two conditions, one where the participant's virtual hand was attacked with a knife and a control condition where the knife only struck the virtual table. Significantly greater P450 potentials were obtained in the attack condition confirming our expectations that participants had a strong illusion of the virtual hand being their own, which was also strongly supported by questionnaire responses. Higher levels of subjective virtual hand ownership correlated with larger P450 amplitudes. Mu-rhythm event-related desynchronization in the motor cortex and readiness potential (C3-C4) negativity were clearly observed when the virtual hand was threatened-as would be expected, if the real hand was threatened and the participant tried to avoid harm. Our results support the idea that event-related potentials may provide a promising non-subjective measure of virtual embodiment. They also support previous experiments on pain observation and are placed into context of similar experiments and studies of body perception and body ownership within cognitive neuroscience.

Study design OERPs to phenylethyl alcohol were measured in 13 infants, between 23 and 41 days of age. The odor was delivered with a computer-controlled olfactometer. Recording electrodes were applied using the 10-20 system. Data from electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, and C4 were analyzed by MatLab's Letswave toolbox (Andre Mouraux, Brussels, Belgium) using the canonical time-domain averaging as well as the time-frequency analyzing method. Results Ten of 13 infants finished the recording session. We observed OERPs in 7 of these 10 infants. Recordings were best in electrodes Fz and Cz. The N1 peak was visible at 328 ms followed by P2 at 505 ms. In addition, the time-frequency analysis had an increase in low frequencies (4-7 Hz) around 550 ms after odor presentation. Conclusions We were able to record OERPs in infants. The time-domain averaging as well as the time-frequency analysis was of value for data analysis.

The present research seeks deeper insights into these intrinsically motivating mechanisms by investigating neurophysiological correlates of cognitive absorption in the context of enactive learning, specifically simulation-based training on the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. An experiment was conducted in which 36 student trainees used ERP software to make decisions while running a simulated company. Consistent with flow theory, skill, difficulty, and their interaction significantly influenced cognitive absorption (R-2 = .16). Five neurophysiological measures were captured for each trainee: EEG alpha, EEG beta, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, and heart rate variability. Each of the five neurophysiological measures explained significant unique variance in cognitive absorption over and above skill, difficulty, and their interaction, and collectively more than doubled the explained variance to R-2 = .34. Overall, cognitive absorption was positively related to a more relaxed, less vigilant state. Cognitive absorption was significantly related to the training outcome. These findings provide new insights into the psychological states that are conducive to experiencing cognitive absorption during enactive training. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Humiliation as an intense emotional experience: Evidence from the electro-encephalogram	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Humiliation; EEG; LPP; Alpha Desynchronization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; ADJECTIVES; SELF; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXPECTANCY; ARTIFACTS	Humiliation, the emotion associated with being lowered in status in the eyes of others, seems to be very intense. As such, humiliation has been implied to play an important role in the escalation of inter-individual and inter-group conflict. Here, we provide the first clear empirical evidence that humiliation is indeed a very intense experience. Based on the electro-encephalogram recorded from people reading scenarios that evoked humiliation, anger, or happiness, electrophysiological measures of cognitive intensity were derived for each of the emotion types. The late positive potential (LPP), a measure of the level of perceived (negative), affect was markedly increased in humiliation scenarios compared to happiness and anger scenarios. In addition, event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-frequency range, a measure of the overall intensity of cortical activation, was significantly more pronounced for humiliation than for happiness and anger scenarios. Our findings support the idea that humiliation is a particularly intense experience that is likely to have far-reaching consequences.

Two color combinations of the dial scales were used, which were named G-dials and B-dials respectively under each dial shape. Fifteen participants took part in the experiments. The two groups of dials were used as target stimuli respectively with P300 recorded. The participants were required to press specific key when the target stimuli appeared. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were recorded simultaneously. The influence on amplitude and change of beta band power spectra was significant (rho< 0.05). Visual stimuli intensity of G-dials (white-red combination) is stronger than that of B-dials (green-yellow combination) and the degree to motivate the brain is higher than that of B-dials. Moreover the color combinations of B-dials have the trend of accelerating visual fatigue. P300 can be the better metric than reaction time and accuracy in ergonomic analyzing of instrument interface. The findings may be of value for the evaluation of instrument display design.	[Jiang, Y.; Hong, J.] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Li, X.

One approach consists in studying the effects of linguistic and pre-linguistic variables in picture naming tasks. So far, studies have analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) during word production by examining one or two variables with factorial designs. Here we extended this approach by investigating simultaneously the effects of multiple theoretical relevant predictors in a picture naming task. High density EEG was recorded on 31 participants during overt naming of 100 pictures. ERPs were extracted on a trial by trial basis from picture on set to 100 ms before the on set of articulation. Mixed-effects regression models were conducted to examine which variables affected production latencies and the duration of periods of stable electrophysiological patterns (topographic maps). Results revealed an effect of a prelinguistic variable, visual complexity, on a nearly period of stable electric field at scalp, from 140 to 180 ms after picture presentation, a result consistent with the proposal that this time period is associated with visual object recognition processes. Three other variables, word Age of Acquisition, Name Agreement, and Image Agreement influenced response latencies and modulated ERPs from similar to 380 ms to the end of the analyzed period. These results demonstrate that a topographic analysis fitted into the single trial ERPs and covering the entire processing period allows one to associate the cost generated by psycholinguistic variables to the duration of specific stable electrophysiological processes and top in point the precise time-course of multiple word production predictors at once.

Patients show increased amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-related negativity (CRN). Recently, two temporo-spatial factors were shown to contribute to both ERPs in healthy individuals. In the present study, it was investigated whether the factor structure underlying ERN and CRN is similar in OCD and which factors differ between groups. A principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to investigate the temporo-spatial factor structure of ERN and CRN. Twenty-six OCD patients and 26 healthy controls conducted a flanker task. EEG data were analyzed as conventional ERP components and as factor scores derived from temporo-spatial PCA. ERP results showed expected increases in ERN and CRN amplitudes in OCD patients. For both groups, the PCA confirmed the assumed factor structure of a central and a fronto-parietal factor contributing to ERN and CRN. Factor scores of both factors were differently affected by response correctness in OCD. Alterations in factor scores indicate increased activity in both an outcome-independent monitoring process and an error-sensitive process, contributing to overactive performance monitoring in OCD.

In order to get a refined picture of this attentional deficit, which is based on the analysis of averaged event-related potentials, we studied the distribution of single-trial cue-P3 amplitudes and the relation between the cue-P3 and the neural state (EEG spectral analysis) when expecting the stimulus. Brain electrical activity was recorded in children of different ADHD subtypes (combined type, predominantly inattentive) and typically developing children while conducting the attention network test. In children with ADHD of the combined type, smaller cue-P3 amplitudes in the averaged signal were due to a larger portion of single trials with reduced cue-P3 amplitudes whereas maximum amplitudes did not differ from typically developing children. In this ADHD subtype, larger activity in the upper theta/lower alpha range (5.5-10.5 Hz) was strongly associated with the range (difference between 0.9 quantile and 0.1 quantile) of the cue-P3 amplitude in single trials (correlation coefficient r = 0.77) indicating a suboptimal neural state before stimulus presentation. In children with ADHD of the predominantly inattentive subtype, single-trial P3 amplitudes were comparable at lower quantiles but maximum amplitudes were reduced. This result pattern indicates an intact triggering of the cue-P3 but a reduced capacity of resource allocation for the predominantly inattentive subtype. Though findings are limited by a relative small sample size, the cue-P3 may be considered as a neurophysiological marker of alerting deficits in ADHD reflecting different underlying mechanisms in ADHD subtypes.

However, its relation to functional connectivity has remained largely obscure. In the sensorimotor system, movement-related changes emerge in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) range (event-related desynchronization, ERD, before and during movement; event-related synchronization, ERS, after movement offset). Some studies suggest that beta-ERS may functionally inhibit new movements. According to the gating-by-inhibition framework ( Jensen and Mazaheri 2010), we expected that the ERD would go along with increased corticomuscular coupling, and vice versa. By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography, we were directly able to test this hypothesis. In a reaction time task, single TMS pulses were delivered randomly during ERD/ERS to the motor cortex. The motor-evoked potential (MEP) was then related to the beta and alpha frequencies and corticomuscular coherence. Results indicate that MEPs are smaller when preceded by high pre-TMS beta-band power and low pre-TMS alpha-band corticomuscular coherence (and vice versa) in a network of motor-relevant areas comprising frontal, parietal, and motor cortices. This confirms that an increase in rhythms that putatively reflect functionally inhibited states goes along with weaker coupling of the respective brain regions.

Using the readiness potential of button-press and verbal response within spoken language processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Turn-taking; Event-related potential; Button-press and verbal responses; Language processing	TURN-TAKING; ONSET	Background: Even though research in turn-taking in spoken dialogues is now abundant, a typical EEG-signature associated with the anticipation of turn-ends has not yet been identified until now. New method: The purpose of this study was to examine if readiness potentials (RP) can be used to study the anticipation of turn-ends by using it in a motoric finger movement and articulatory movement task. The goal was to determine the preconscious onset of turn-end anticipation in early, preconscious turn-end anticipation processes by the simultaneous registration of EEG measures (RP) and behavioural measures (anticipation timing accuracy, ATA). For our behavioural measures, we used both button-press and verbal response ("yes"). In the experiment, 30 subjects were asked to listen to auditorily presented utterances and press a button or utter a brief verbal response when they expected the end of the turn. During the task, a 32-channel-EEG signal was recorded. Results: The results showed that the RPs during verbal- and button-press-responses developed similarly and had an almost identical time course: the RP signals started to develop 1170 vs. 1190 ms before the behavioural responses. Comparison with existing methods: Until now, turn-end anticipation is usually studied using behavioural methods, for instance by measuring the anticipation timing accuracy, which is a measurement that reflects conscious behavioural processes and is insensitive to preconscious anticipation processes. Conclusion: The similar time course of the recorded RP signals for both verbal- and button-press responses provide evidence for the validity of using RPs as an online marker for response preparation in turn-taking and spoken dialogue research.

This model has not yet been extended to high approach-motivation sexual stimuli, which may represent an important model of reward system function. Sixty-five participants viewed a neutral and a sexually motivating film while their EEG was recorded, and reported their sexual feelings after each film. Greater alpha power in the left hemisphere during sexually motivated states was evident. A positive relationship between self-reported mental sexual arousal and alpha asymmetry was identified, where coherence between these indicators was higher in women. Notably, coherence was stronger when mental versus physical sexual arousal was rated. Alpha asymmetry appears to offer a new method for further examining this novel coherence pattern across men and women.

Many workplaces occupy themselves with the processing of electroencephalographic signals. They solve mainly the issues of the detection epileptic states, Brain Computer Interface, or the detection of evocated potentials initiated by various stimuli (the light, sound, movement, etc.). As the duration of the brain reaction to a given stimulus range within tens of milliseconds, it is necessary to record the event as precisely as possible. The main aim of this paper is to describe a universal device which is able to record external stimuli during the measurement of the electroencephalographic. The designed device contains of a set of sensors and can be used with different measurement systems. The main advantages of this system are the universality, the short reaction time and the ability of recording several stimuli simultaneously.

Material/ methods: Auditory event-related low frequency oscillations (delta delta -[2, 4] Hz; theta theta -[4.5, 7] Hz; alpha a -[7.5, 12] Hz) were examined during an auditory discrimination motor task (lowfrequency tone -right hand movement, high-frequency tone -left hand movement) between two groups with mean age 26.3 and 55 years. Results: The amplitudes of the phase-locked delta, theta and a activity were more pronounced with a progressive increase in age during the sensory processing, independent of tone type. The difference between the groups with respect to scalp distribution was tone-independent for delta/ theta oscillations, but not for the alpha activity. Age-related and tone-dependent changes in a band activity were focused at frontal and sensorimotor areas. Neither functional brain specificity was observed for the amplitudes of the lowfrequency (delta, theta, alpha) oscillations during the cognitive processing, which diminished with increasing age. Conclusion: The cognitive brain oscillatory specificity diminished with increasing age. (C)2014 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp.z o.o. All rights reserved.

In addition, the expression of these components seems to be sensitive to diverse experimental variations. The main purpose of the present investigation was to explore the role of inter-stimulus interval (IS!) on the N1 and P2 responses, considering two widely used experimental paradigms: a single tone task (1000 Hz sound repeated in a fixed rhythm) and an auditory oddball (80% of the stimuli were equal to the sound used in the single tone and the remaining were a 1500 Hz tone). Both tasks had four different conditions, and each one tested a fixed value of IS! (600, 1000, 3000, or 6000 ms). A sample of 22 participants performed these tasks, while an EEG was recorded, in order to examine the maximum amplitude of the N1 and P2 components. Analysis of the stimuli in the single tone task and the frequent tones in the oddball task revealed a similar outcome for both tasks and for both components: N1 and P2 amplitudes were enhanced in conditions with longer ISIs regardless of task. This response pattern emphasizes the dependence of both the N1 and P2 components on the ISI, especially in a scenario of repetitive and regular stimulation. The absence of task effects suggests that the ISI effect reported may depend on refractory mechanisms rather than being due to habituation effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Holler, Y; Trinka, E				Hoeller, Yvonne; Trinka, Eugen			What do temporal lobe epilepsy and progressive mild cognitive impairment have in common?	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						epilepsy; mild cognitive impairment; subjective cognitive complaints; memory decline; neuroimaging; neurophysiology	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; VERBAL MEMORY; DEMENTIA; DECLINE	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are both subject to intensive memory research. Memory problems are a core characteristic of both conditions and we wonder if there are analogies which would enrich the two distinct research communities. In this review we focus on memory decline in both conditions, that is, the most feared psychosocial effect. While it is clear that memory decline in MCI is highly likely and would lead to the more severe diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, it is a debate if TLE is a dementing disease or not. As such, like for MCI, one can differentiate progressive from stable TLE subtypes, mainly depending on the age of onset. Neuroimaging techniques such as volumetric analysis of the hippocampus, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex show evidence of pathological changes in TLE and are predictive for memory decline in MCI. Several studies emphasize that it is necessary to extend the region of interest-even whole-brain characteristics can be predictive for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. Electroencephalography is increasingly subject to computational neuroscience, revealing new approaches for analyzing frequency, spatial synchronization, and information content of the signals. These methods together with event-related designs that assess memory functions are highly promising for understanding the mechanisms of memory decline in both TLE and MCI populations. Finally, there is evidence that the potential of such markers for memory decline is far from being exhausted. Similar structural and neurophysiological characteristics are linked to memory decline in TLE and MCI. We raise the hope that interdisciplinary research and cross-talk between fields such as research on epilepsy and dementia, will shed further light on the dementing characteristics of the pathological basis of MCI and TLE and support the development of new memory enhancing treatment strategies.

Segmentation of a sound stream of music at event boundaries is necessary for identification and extraction of musical context and features. To investigate recognition of music termination structure, or cadence, we composed music sequences with two types of dominant-tonic termination structures and presented them to participants and analyzed their segment recognition and brain activities using EEG. The results revealed that a sense of termination was caused by listening to a tonic chord. Frontal area positivity at 380-480 ms was elicited by a dominant chord in cadence type I with a stronger sense of termination. These activities possibly reflected the expectation of the next tonic chord in the cadence.

Method: Fifteen H-SLI children, 15 TD children, and 15 adults judged whether a flashed explosion-shaped figure and a 2-kHz pure tone occurred simultaneously. The stimuli were presented at 0-, 100-, 200-, 300-, 400-, and 500-ms temporal offsets. This task was combined with EEG recordings. Results: H-SLI children were profoundly less sensitive to temporal separations between auditory and visual modalities compared with their TD peers. Those H-SLI children who performed better at simultaneity judgment also had higher language aptitude. TD children were less accurate than adults, revealing a remarkably prolonged developmental course of the audiovisual temporal discrimination. Analysis of early event-related potential components suggested that poor sensory encoding was not a key factor in H-SLI children's reduced sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony. Conclusions: Audiovisual temporal discrimination is impaired in H-SLI children and is still immature during mid-childhood in TD children. The present findings highlight the need for further evaluation of the role of atypical audiovisual processing in the development of SLI.

We sought to: 1) define a protocol for determining whether a person with ALS can use a visual P300-based BCI; 2) determine what proportion of this population can use the BCI; and 3) identify factors affecting BCI performance. Twenty-five individuals with ALS completed an evaluation protocol using a standard 6 x 6 matrix and parameters selected by stepwise linear discrimination. With an 8-channel EEG montage, the subjects fell into two groups in BCI accuracy (chance accuracy 3%). Seventeen averaged 92 (+/- 3)% (range 71-100%), which is adequate for communication (G70 group). Eight averaged 12 (+/- 6)% (range 0-36%), inadequate for communication (L40 subject group). Performance did not correlate with disability: 11/17 (65%) of G70 subjects were severely disabled (i.e. ALSFRS-R <5). All L40 subjects had visual impairments (e.g. nystagmus, diplopia, ptosis). P300 was larger and more anterior in G70 subjects. A 16-channel montage did not significantly improve accuracy. In conclusion, most people severely disabled by ALS could use a visual P300-based BCI for communication. In those who could not, visual impairment was the principal obstacle. For these individuals, auditory P300-based BCIs might be effective.	[McCane, Lynn M.; McFarland, Dennis J.; Carmack, C.

Here, we used behavioral, electrophysiological, and psychophysiological methods to examine the role of emotional arousal on subsequent memory in school-age children. Five- to 8-year-olds, divided into younger and older groups, viewed emotional scenes as EEG, heart rate, and respiration was recorded, and participated in a memory task 24 hours later where EEG and behavioral responses were recorded; participants provided subjective ratings of the scenes after the memory task. All measures indicated emotion responses in both groups, and in ERP measures the effects were stronger for older children. Emotion responses were more consistent across measures for negative than positive stimuli. Behavioral memory performance was strong but did not differ by emotion condition. Emotion influenced the ERP index of recognition memory in the older group only (enhanced recognition of negative scenes). The findings an increasing interaction of emotion and memory during the school years. Further, the findings impress the value of combining multiple methods to assess emotion and memory in development.

Previous reaction-time based studies have shown a congruency effect, where reflection symmetry facilitates processing of positive words, and random patterns facilitate negative words. But what is the neural basis of affective responses to symmetry? In Experiment 1 we recorded ERPs from posterior electrode clusters while participants viewed reflection or random patterns with either a positive or negative word superimposed. In the Discriminate Regularity task, participants categorized the patterns (reflection or random). In the Discriminate Word task, they categorized the words as positive or negative. In Experiment 2, participants classified words and patterns on each trial. We found a difference between ERP waves from congruent (reflection with positive word, random with negative word) and incongruent trials (reflection with negative, random with positive). This congruency effect began around 200 ms, and persisted up to 1000 ms post stimulus, and was only present in the Discriminate Word task. We suggest that when evaluating words, participants automatically evaluate the background pattern as well, and this alters early visual processing. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Involvement of Human Internal Globus Pallidus in the Early Modulation of Cortical Error-Related Activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						basal ganglia; error monitoring; error-related negativity; Granger causality; response errors	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASAL GANGLIA; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; MOVEMENT	The detection and assessment of errors are a prerequisite to adapt behavior and improve future performance. Error monitoring is afforded by the interplay between cortical and subcortical neural systems. Ample evidence has pointed to a specific cortical error-related evoked potential, the error-related negativity (ERN), during the detection and evaluation of response errors. Recent models of reinforcement learning implicate the basal ganglia (BG) in early error detection following the learning of stimulus-response associations and in the modulation of the cortical ERN. To investigate the influence of the human BG motor output activity on the cortical ERN during response errors, we recorded local field potentials from the sensorimotor area of the internal globus pallidus and scalp electroencephalogram representing activity from the posterior medial frontal cortex in patients with idiopathic dystonia (hands not affected) during a flanker task. In error trials, a specific pallidal error-related potential arose 60 ms prior to the cortical ERN. The error-related changes in pallidal activity-characterized by theta oscillations-were predictive of the cortical error-related activity as assessed by Granger causality analysis. Our findings show an early modulation of error-related activity in the human pallidum, suggesting that pallidal output influences the cortex at an early stage of error detection.

This information may lead to novel rehabilitation technologies with the patients' cortical activity taking an active role during the intervention. For such applications, the reliability of the estimations based on the electroencephalographic activity is critical both in terms of specificity and temporal accuracy. In this study, a detector of the onset of voluntary upper-limb reaching movements based on cortical rhythms and slow cortical potentials is proposed. To that end, upper-limb movements and cortical activity were recorded while participants performed self-paced movements. A logistic regression combined the output of two classifiers: a) a naive Bayes trained to detect the event-related desynchronization at the movement onset, and b) a matched filter detecting the bereitschaftspotential. On average, 74.5 +/- 10.8 % of the movements were detected and 1.32 +/- 0.87 false detections were generated per minute. The detections were performed with an average latency of -89.9 +/- 349.2 ms with respect to the actual movements. Therefore, the combination of two different sources of information (event-related desynchronization and bereitschaftspotential) is proposed as a way to boost the performance of this kind of systems.

Invisible visual stimuli elicit increases in alpha-band power	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-band; EEG; event-related synchronization; oscillations; subthreshold stimulation	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; FEEDFORWARD; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; RHYTHM; CONSCIOUSNESS; PSYCHOPHYSICS; SUPPRESSION	The cerebral cortex responds to stimuli of a wide range of intensities. Previous studies have demonstrated that undetectably weak somatosensory stimuli cause a functional deactivation or inhibition in somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we tested whether invisible visual stimuli lead to similar responses, indicated by an increase in EEG alpha-band power-an index of cortical excitability. We presented subliminal and supraliminal visual stimuli after estimating each participant's detection threshold. Stimuli consisted of peripherally presented small circular patches that differed in their contrast to a background consisting of a random white noise pattern. We demonstrate that subliminal and supraliminal stimuli each elicit specific neuronal response patterns. Supraliminal stimuli evoked an early, strongly phase-locked lower-frequency response representing the evoked potential and induced a decrease in alpha-band power from 400 ms on. By contrast, subliminal visual stimuli induced an increase of non-phase-locked power around 300 ms that was maximal within the alpha-band. This response might be due to an inhibitory mechanism, which reduces spurious visual activation that is unlikely to result from external stimuli.

However, neuronal mechanisms of ASD-like deficits in ADHD have rarely been studied. The processing of biological motion-recently discussed as a marker of social cognition-was found to be disrupted in ASD in several studies. Thus in the present study we tested if biological motion processing is disrupted in ADHD. We used 64-channel EEG and spatio-temporal source analysis to assess event-related potentials associated with human motion processing in 21 children and adolescents with ADHD and 21 matched typically developing controls. On the behavioural level, all subjects were able to differentiate between human and scrambled motion. But in response to both scrambled and biological motion, the N200 amplitude was decreased in subjects with ADHD. After a spatio-temporal dipole analysis, a human motion specific activation was observable in occipital-temporal regions with a reduced and more diffuse activation in ADHD subjects. These results point towards neuronal determined alterations in the processing of biological motion in ADHD.

Up to date, there are few studies that investigate the single trial performance of neural decoding in cognitive tasks. In this study we examine EEG data while a given subject is solving questions which are commonly used in intelligence quotient tests. Subjects are instructed to solve a number of visual template matching tasks. Our findings suggest that it is possible to decode the true answer from the subjects' ERP responses at the time of its presentation. These results indicate that neurophysiological markers could be useful for neurotechnology assisted learning paradigms.

The Kv1.1 null mouse, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Kcna1; Vagus; Parasympathetic	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIAC ASYSTOLE; PARTIAL SEIZURES; ICTAL ASYSTOLE; LOBE EPILEPSY; BRADYCARDIA; MICE; APNEA; ARRHYTHMIAS; DYSFUNCTION	ObjectiveKv1.1 potassium channel null mouse (NULL) exhibits spontaneous seizure-related bradycardia, dies following seizure, and has been proposed as a model for vagus-mediated SUDEP. We characterized the cardiac events surrounding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in NULL during terminal asystole for comparison to patients with epilepsy who exhibit bradycardia and terminal or nonterminal asystole during/following seizure and explored the contribution of vagal-mediated bradycardia to SUDEP. MethodsElectrocardiography (ECG) studies of 27 freely moving telemetered NULL mice was evaluated surrounding seizure-associated death. Chronic unilateral vagal section and, in a separate set of experiments, electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi in NULL and wild-type (WT) littermates assessed the role of the vagus nerve in seizure-related death. Seizure activity indicated by intense myogenic activity on the ECG recording correlated with visual and video recording. ResultsAll NULL died following seizures, which were preceded by normal rhythm. Bradycardia followed seizure and led to slow ventricular escape rhythm (70-150bpm) and asystole. The sequence from seizure to asystole was complete within approximately 3min and was similar to that reported in individuals exhibiting ictal and postictal bradycardia/asystole. To address the singular role of vagus nerves in seizure-related asystole, cervical vagus nerves were stimulated in the absence of seizure. Heart rate was reduced 3min to values similar to that following seizure but never produced asystole, suggesting activation of the vagi alone is insufficient for SUDEP. Nevertheless, unilateral chronic section of the vagus nerve increased survival time compared to nonsectioned NULL animals, supporting a role for the vagus nerve in seizure-associated death. SignificanceThe Kv1.1 null mouse is a potential model for SUDEP in patients who experience ictal and postictal bradycardia. It offers the opportunity for evaluation of the combination of factors, in addition to vagal activation, necessary to produce a terminal asystole following seizure. It is notable that long-term studies that evaluate electroencephalography (EEG) and cardiorespiratory events surrounding nonfatal seizures may provide indices predictive of terminal seizure.

Electrophysiological evidence for altered visual, but not auditory, selective attention in adolescent cochlear implant users	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						Cochlear implant; Auditory evoked potential; Visual evoked potential; Selective attention; Children; Electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; DEAF; STIMULI; MOTION; CHILDREN; LANGUAGE; DISCRIMINATION; DEPRIVATION	Objective: Selective attention fundamentally alters sensory perception, but little is known about the functioning of attention in individuals who use a cochlear implant. This study aimed to investigate visual and auditory attention in adolescent cochlear implant users. Methods: Event related potentials were used to investigate the influence of attention on visual and auditory evoked potentials in six cochlear implant users and age-matched normally-hearing children. Participants were presented with streams of alternating visual and auditory stimuli in an oddball paradigm: each modality contained frequently presented 'standard' and infrequent 'deviant' stimuli. Across different blocks attention was directed to either the visual or auditory modality. Results: For the visual stimuli attention boosted the early N1 potential, but this effect was larger for cochlear implant users. Attention was also associated with a later P3 component for the visual deviant stimulus, but there was no difference between groups in the later attention effects. For the auditory stimuli, attention was associated with a decrease in N1 latency as well as a robust P3 for the deviant tone. Importantly, there was no difference between groups in these auditory attention effects. Conclusion: The results suggest that basic mechanisms of auditory attention are largely normal in children who are proficient cochlear implant users, but that visual attention may be altered. Ultimately, a better understanding of how selective attention influences sensory perception in cochlear implant users will be important for optimising habilitation strategies.

To date, no drug has been approved for this indication by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. This article presents findings suggesting that a medication targeting the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7 nAChR) might meet this need. This single-center, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined 21 medically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with second generation antipsychotics. Patients were treated with a daily dose of either 0.3 mg (n = 8) or 1.0 mg (n = 9) of EVP-6124, an alpha 7 nAChR partial agonist, or placebo (n = 4). Treatment continued for 21 days while patients continued their usual antipsychotic medication: aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day), olanzapine (10-20 mg/day), paliperidone (3-12 mg/day), or risperidone (2-16 mg/day). Cognitive test performance, event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials, clinical symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical side effects were measured. EVP-6124 was well tolerated and showed positive, and in some cases, dose-dependent effects on several EEG responses, especially the Mismatch Negativity and P300 potentials. Positive effects were also found in performance on cognitive tests that measured non-verbal learning, memory, and executive function. This study is an example of the type of early proof of concept trial that is done to enable drug developers to evaluate whether to continue research on an agent. Based on the promising findings in this study, larger phase II studies were initiated to further test the pro-cognitive effects of EVP-6124 in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

Methods: Six prefrontal stroke patients were compared with eleven neurologically intact older adults during a vibrotactile discrimination task. All subjects attended to stimuli on one digit while ignoring distracter stimuli on a separate digit of the same hand. Subjects were required to report infrequent targets on the attended digit only. Throughout testing electroencephalography was used to measure event-related potentials for both task-relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Results: Prefrontal patients demonstrated significant changes in cortical somatosensory processing based on attention compared to age-matched controls. This was evident both in early unimodal somatosensory processing (i.e. P100) and in later cortical processing stages (i.e. long-latency positivity). Moreover, there was a tendency towards a tonic loss of inhibition over early somatosensory cortical processing (i.e. P50). Conclusions: The attention-based modulation noted for neurologically intact older adults was absent in prefrontal lesion patients. Significance: The present study highlights the important role of prefrontal regions in sustaining inhibition over early sensory cortical processing stages and in modifying somatosensory transmission based on task-relevance. Notably these deficits extend beyond those previously shown to occur as a function of age. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bolton, David A. E.; Staines, W.

It requires functioning mechanisms to establish feelings of agency and ownership. Agency is defined causally, where the subjects action is followed by an effect. Ownership is defined by the features of the effect, independent from the action. In our study, we manipulated these qualities separately. 13 right-handed healthy individuals performed the experiment while 76-channel EEG was recorded. Stimuli consisted of visually presented words, read aloud by the subject. The experiment consisted of six conditions: (a) subjects saw a word, read it aloud, heard it in their own voice; (b) like a, but the word was heard in an unfamiliar voice; (c) subject heard a word in his/her own voice without speaking; (d) like c, but the word was heard in an unfamiliar voice; (e) like a, but subjects heard the word with a delay; (f) subjects read without hearing. ERPs and difference maps were computed for all conditions. Effects were analysed topographically. The N100 (86-172 ms) displayed significant main effects of agency and ownership. The topographies of the two effects shared little common variance, suggesting independent effects. Later effects (174-400 ms) of agency and ownership were topographically similar, suggesting common mechanisms. Replicating earlier studies, significant N100 suppression was observed, with a topography resembling the agency effect. 'Sensing the self' appears to recruit from at least two very distinct processes: an agency assessment that represents causality and an ownership assessment that compares stimulus features with memory content.

This article discusses the influence of the Baroque music on learning state from the perspective of electroencephalogram analysis. First electroencephalogram (EEG) data of the n-back experiments are collected before and after listening to the Baroque music. Then its frequency, the energy, a wave distribution, scalp, event related potential and other components are compared. Specially, the brain's memory and attention are analyzed and estimated by extracting useful EEG information in time-domain, frequency-domain and spatial distribution. The experimental results show that Baroque music has a positive influence on improving learning efficiency. So that teachers can use Baroque music to assist teaching as reform means, which will provide an effective way to improve the learning efficiency and teaching quality.

Although neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions related to face gender perception, the temporal dynamics of this process remain under debate. Here, we identified the mechanism and temporal dynamics of face gender perception. We used stereoscopic depth manipulation to create two conditions: the front and behind condition. In the front condition, facial patches were presented stereoscopically infront of the occluder and participants perceived them as disjoint parts (featural cues). In the behind condition, facial patches were presented stereoscopically behind the occluder and were amodally completed and unified in a coherent face (holisticcues). We performed three behavioral experiments and one electro encephalography experiment, and compared the results of the front and behind conditions. We found faster reaction times (RTs) in the behind condition compared with the front, and observed priming effects and after effects only in the behind condition. Moreover, the EEG experiment revealed that face gender perception is processed in the relatively late phase of visual recognition( 200-285 ms). Our results indicate that holistic information is critical for face gender perception, and that this process occurs witha relatively late latency.

Contrary to previous approach, we did not manipulate speed and accuracy instructions: participants were required to be fast and accurate in a go/no-go task, and we selected post-hoc the groups based on the subjects' spontaneous behavioral tendency. Based on the reaction times, we selected the fast and slow groups (Speed-groups), and based on the percentage of false alarms, we selected the accurate and inaccurate groups (Accuracy groups) The two Speed groups were accuracy matched, and the two Accuracy-groups were speed-matched. High density electroencephalographic (EEG) and stimulus-locked analyses allowed us to observe group differences both before and after the stimulus onset. Long before the stimulus appearance, the two Speed-groups showed different amplitude of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), reflecting the activity of the supplementary motor area (SMA); by contrast, the two Accuracy groups showed different amplitude of the prefrontal negativity (pN), reflecting the activity of the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). In addition, the post-stimulus event-related potential (ERR) components showed differences between groups: the P1 component was larger in accurate than inaccurate group; the Ni and N2 components were larger in the fast than slow group; the P3 component started earlier and was larger in the fast than slow group. The go minus no-go subtractive wave enhancing go-related processing revealed a differential prefrontal positivity (dpP) that peaked at about 330 ms; the latency and the amplitude of this peak were associated with the speed of the decision process and the efficiency of the stimulus response mapping, respectively. Overall, data are consistent with the view that speed and accuracy are processed by two interacting but separate neurocognitive systems, with different features in both the anticipation and the response execution phases.

These null findings have been explained by insufficient motivational intensity of, and/or overshadowing interindividual variability within the responses to emotional pictures. These explanations were systematically tested using data from 70 students watching 5 types of affective pictures ranging from very pleasant to unpleasant. The stimulus categories reliably modulated self-reports as well as the amplitude of late positive potential, an ERR component reflecting orienting toward motivationally significant stimuli. The stimuli did not, however, induce expected asymmetry effects either for the sample or individual participants. Even while systematic stimulus-dependent individual differences emerged in self-reports as well as LPP amplitudes, the asymmetry variability was dominated by stimulus-independent interindividual variability. Taken together with previous findings, these results suggest that under some circumstances anterior asymmetry may not be an inevitable consequence of core affect. Instead, state asymmetry shifts may be overpowered by stable trait asymmetry differences and/or stimulus-independent yet situation-dependent interindividual variability, possibly caused by processes such as emotion regulation or anxious apprehension.

Individual differences in reward prediction error: contrasting relations between feedback-related negativity and trait measures of reward sensitivity,impulsivity and extraversion	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						extraversion; pleasure; feedback-related negativity; reward; event related potential; behavioral approach system	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELF-REPORT; DOPAMINE; ANHEDONIA; PERSONALITY; IMPULSIVITY; PUNISHMENT; RESPONSES	Media-frontal negativity occurring similar to 200-300 ms post-stimulus in response to motivationally salient stimuli,usually referred to as feedback-related negativity(FRN), appears to be atleast partly modulated by dopaminergic-based reward prediction error(RPE) signaling. Previous research(e. g., Smillie et al., 2011) has shown that higher scores on a putatively dopaminergic-based personality trait, extraversion, were associated with a more pronounced difference wave contrasting unpredicted non-reward and unpredicted reward trials on an associative learning task. In the current study, we sought to extend this research by comparing how trait measures of reward sensitivity, impulsivity and extraversion related to the FRN using the same associative learning task. A sample of healthy adults( N= 38) completed a battery of personality questionnaires, before completing the associative learning task while EEG was recorded. As expected, FRN was most negative following unpredicted non reward. A difference wave contrasting unpredicted non reward and unpredicted reward trials was calculated. Extraversion, but not measure so impulsivity,had a significant association with this difference wave. Further, the differnce wave was significantly related to a measure of anticipatory pleasure, but not consummatory pleasure. These findings provide support for the existing evidence suggesting that variation in dopaminergic functioning in brain "reward" pathways may partially underpin associations between the FRN and trait measures of extraversion and anticipatory pleasure.

We addressed this signature with two experiments in which participants helped a virtual police officer to locate a knife. Crucially, before this response, they announced whether they would lie or tell the truth about the knife's location. This design allowed us to study the signature of lie-telling in the absence of rare and personally significant oddball stimuli that are typically used for lie detection via electrophysiological markers, especially the P300 component. Our results indicate that active lying attenuated P300 amplitudes as well as N200 amplitudes for such non-oddball stimuli. These results support accounts that stress the high cognitive demand of lie-telling, including the need to suppress the truthful response and to generate a lie.

One of the most used paradigms to analyze inhibitory processes is the Go-Nogo task (GNG). This task has been widely used in psychophysical and cognitive EEG studies, and more recently in paradigms using fMRI. However, a technical limitation is that the time resolution of fMRI is poorer than that of the EEG technique. In order to compensate for these temporal constraints, it has become common practice in the fMRI field to use longer inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) than those used in EEG protocols. Despite the noticeable temporal differences between these two techniques, it is currently assumed that both approaches assess similar inhibitory processes. We performed an EEG study using a GNG task with both short ISI (fast-condition, FC, as in EEG protocols) and long ISI (slow-condition, SC, as in fMRI protocols). We found that in the FC there was a stronger Nogo-N2 effect than in the SC. Moreover, in the FC, but not in the SC, the number of preceding Go trials correlated positively with the Nogo-P3 amplitude and with the Go trial reaction time; and negatively with commission errors. In addition, we found significant topographical differences for the Go-P3 elicited in FC and SC, which is interpreted in terms of different neurotransmitter dynamics. Taken together, our results provide evidence that frequency of stimulus presentation in the GNG task strongly modulates the behavioral response and the evoked EEG activity. Therefore, it is likely that short-ISI EEG protocols and long-ISI fMRI protocols do not assess equivalent inhibitory processes.

However, little is known about how to use AO effectively in MI practice. The aim of our study is to compare the effectiveness of synchronous and asynchronous AO in facilitating MI for neurorehabilitation of stroke patients. The participants with hand motor dysfunction following stroke were asked to imagine a specific object insertion and removal task guided by synchronous or asynchronous AO during MI practice. The event-related power decrease (ERD) or event-related power increase (ERS) in sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) of electroencephalographic (EEG) was calculated to evaluate the cortex excitation during MI. The Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and Pinch Strength Test (PST) were used to score functional recovery of the paralyzed hand. The effectiveness of MI was evaluated according to the cortex excitation and the scores of hand functional recovery. The results of ERD in EEG SMR indicate that synchronous AO increases cortex excitation more effectively than asynchronous AO in MI. Meanwhile, higher NHPT and PST scores were achieved after MI training guided by synchronous AO. This reflects that the hand motor function is also improved more significantly by MI practice guided by synchronous AO. Therefore, compared to asynchronous AO, synchronous AO significantly facilitates MI practice and leads to more effective neurorehabilitation of stroke patients.

Participants completed an attentionally demanding flanker task under conditions that emphasized either speed or accuracy or under conditions that manipulated the monetary value of errors. Conditions in which errors had greater motivational value produced greater ERAS, that is, greater alpha suppression following errors compared to correct trials. A second study found that a manipulation of task difficulty did not affect ERAS. Together, the results confirm that ERAS is both a robust phenomenon and one that is sensitive to motivational factors.

This was defined as the ability to utilize predictive contextual information to facilitate detection of predictable versus random targets. Method: We recorded EEG in 15 MDD patients and 14 age-matched controls. Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by randomized sequences of standards and by sequences of standards that included a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a subsequent target event. Results: Both MDD patients and age-matched controls demonstrated a significant reaction time (RT) and P3b latency differences between predicted and random targets. However, patients demonstrated a specific prolongation of these measures during processing of predicted targets, as well as an attenuation of P3b amplitudes for the predictive sequence. In addition, patients target N1 amplitudes were attenuated compared with controls. Conclusion: MDD patients were able to utilize predictive context in order to facilitate processing of deterministic targets, however, this ability was limited compared to controls, as demonstrated by context-dependent P3b deficits. Significance: These findings suggest that patients with major depression have altered processing of local contextual processing. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Until now, however, researchers had little understanding of the details of relationship between different emotional states and various EEG features. To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our EEG data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

Methods: Power spectra of resting EEG, CSD and gIC (19 channels, linked ears reference, eyes open/closed) from 96 ADHD and 376 healthy adults were compared between eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and between groups of subjects. Results: Pattern of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between conditions was approximately similar, whereas it was more widely spatially distributed for EEG. Size effect (Cohen's d) of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between groups of subjects was considerably greater than in the case of EEG. Significant reduction of gIC and CSD spectral power depending on conditions was found in ADHD patients. Reducing power in a wide frequency range in the fronto-central areas is a common phenomenon regardless of whether the eyes were open or closed. Conclusions: Spectral power of local EEG activity isolated by gICA or CSD in the fronto-central areas may be a suitable marker for discrimination of ADHD and healthy adults. Significance: Spectral analysis of gIC and CSD provides better sensitivity to discriminate ADHD and healthy adults. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A neuronal signal emitted by the prefrontal cortex is considered to be an important contributor to filtering. Proof of the functional significance of this signal during normal cognitive functioning is, however, still missing. Furthermore, research has so far neglected that the prefrontal cortex must receive input from posterior brain areas that report the necessity to filter. From human electroencephalograms, we extracted several event-related components that reflect the different subprocesses of filtering. On the basis of their timing and a clear pattern of correlations, we reason that filtering might consist of a causal chain of events that involve prefrontal and posterior cortex regions: After distractors are detected in posterior regions, a prefrontal mechanism is activated, which in turn prevents subsequent unnecessary parietal storage of distractor information.

Functional and effective connectivity of stopping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stopping; Inhibition; Stop signal task; N200; P300; Delta; Theta; Connectivity	MOTOR INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; MECHANISMS; FAILURE; POWER; TASK; AGE	Behavioral inhibition often is studied by comparing the electroencephalographic responses to stop and to go signals. Most studies simply assess amplitude differences of the N200 and P300 event-related potentials, which seem to best correspond to increased activity in the theta and delta frequency bands, respectively. However, neither have reliable indicators for successful behavioral inhibition been identified nor have the causal dependencies of stop-related neurocognitive processes been addressed yet. By studying functional and effective connectivity underlying stopping behavior, this study opens new directions for the investigation of behavioral inhibition. Group independent component analysis was used to infer functionally coherent networks from electroencephalographic data, which were recorded from healthy human participants during processing of a stop signal task. Then, the temporal dynamics of causal dependencies between independent components were identified by means of Bayesian network estimations. The mean clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length measure indicated time windows between 130 and 180 ms and between 420 and 500 ms to express significantly different connectivity profiles between conditions. Three components showed significant correlations between 120 and 260 ms with stop signal reaction times and the number of failed stops. Two of these components acted as sources of causal flow, one capturing P300/delta characteristics while the other was characterized by alpha power depletion putatively representing the evaluation or processing of stimulus features. Although results suggest that the P300 and associated delta activity seem to be statistically dependent on earlier processes associated with behavioral inhibition, the time window critical for inhibition coincides with early changes in causal patterns and largely precedes peak amplitude differences between go and stop trials.

Auditory evoked potentials reveal early perceptual effects of distal prosody on speech segmentation	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prosody; speech segmentation; event-related potentials; temporal attention	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; WORD SEGMENTATION; SPEAKING RATE; SPOKEN WORDS; TIME-COURSE; CUES; COMPONENT; DURATION; STRESS; ONSETS	Prosodic context several syllables prior (i.e., distal) to an ambiguous word boundary influences speech segmentation. To assess whether distal prosody influences early perceptual processing or later lexical competition, EEG was recorded while subjects listened to eight-syllable sequences with ambiguous word boundaries for the last four syllables (e. g., tie murder bee vs. timer derby). Pitch and duration of the first five syllables were manipulated to induce sequence segmentation with either a monosyllabic or disyllabic final word. Behavioural results confirmed a successful manipulation. Moreover, penultimate syllables (e.g., der) elicited a larger anterior positivity 200-500 ms after the onset for prosodic contexts predicted to induce word-initial perception of these syllables. Final syllables (e.g. bee) elicited a similar anterior positivity in the context predicted to induce word-initial perception of these syllables. Additionally, these final syllables elicited a larger positive-to-negative deflection (P1-N1) 60-120 ms after onset, and a larger N400. The finding that prosodic characteristics of speech several syllables prior to ambiguous word boundaries modulate both early and late event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by subsequent syllable onsets provides evidence that distal prosody influences early perceptual processing and later lexical competition.

Hence, it is of interest in the assessment of the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processing in schizophrenia. However, to date, SE has been barely used in studies comparing resting EEG recordings between patients and controls. In this work, we compared SE between resting baseline [-250 0] ms and active task [150 550] ms windows of a P300 task in 31 patients with schizophrenia and 38 controls. Moreover, we also calculated the median frequency (MF) and relative power in each frequency band for these windows to assess the correlates of the possible SE differences. Controls showed a significant (p < 0.0029) SE decrease (i.e., meaning higher signal regularity) from baseline to the active task window at parietal and central electrode sites. This SE decrease from baseline to active conditions was significantly lower in patients. In controls, this SE decrease was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in MF (i.e., a significant slowing of the EEG activity), not observed in patients. In this latter group, the difference in SE between resting baseline and active task windows was inversely correlated to positive and total symptoms scores, as measured with the positive and negative symptoms scale. Our data support the relevance of SE in the study of cerebral processing in schizophrenia.

Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Filtering for Movement Related Potentials in EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); electroencephalogram (EEG); movement related potentials (MRPs)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; COMPONENTS; REGRESSION; SELECTION; ERP; ICA	Movement related potentials (MRPs) are used as features in many brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalogram (EEG). MRP feature extraction is challenging since EEG is noisy and varies between subjects. Previous studies used spatial and spatio-temporal filtering methods to deal with these problems. However, they did not optimize temporal information or may have been susceptible to overfitting when training data are limited and the feature space is of high dimension. Furthermore, most of these studies manually select data windows and low-pass frequencies. We propose an adaptive spatio-temporal (AST) filtering method to model MRPs more accurately in lower dimensional space. AST automatically optimizes all parameters by employing a Gaussian kernel to construct a low-pass time-frequency filter and a linear ridge regression (LRR) algorithm to compute a spatial filter. Optimal parameters are simultaneously sought by minimizing leave-one-out cross-validation error through gradient descent. Using four BCI datasets from 12 individuals, we compare the performances of AST filter to two popular methods: the discriminant spatial pattern filter and regularized spatio-temporal filter. The results demonstrate that our AST filter can make more accurate predictions and is computationally feasible.

Sequential processing in the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task: Children vs. adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Children; Adults; ERPs; Equiprobable Go/NoGo paradigm; Principal Components Analysis (PCA); Exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; TARGET STIMULI; ERP; RESOLUTION; MISMATCH; ANTERIORISATION; NEGATIVITY	Objective: To compare sequential processing in the unwarned auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task in children and adults, in the context of a recently developed adult schema. Methods: Adult and child samples completed an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task while EEG was recorded from 19 channels. Go and NoGo ERPs were decomposed using unrestricted Varimax-rotated PCAs for the groups separately, and in combination. The separate adult and child components were compared using the Congruence Coefficient. Brain sources of each assessed component were examined using eLORETA. Results: Corresponding adult/child components were tentatively identified: two N1 subcomponents (N1-1, PN) and P2, followed by N2, P3 (separate P3a/P3b in children), the classic Slow Wave (SW), and a diffuse Late Positivity (LP). While early and late components showed similarities, the intermediate P2 and N2 differed substantially in their stimulus effects. Conclusions: Aspects of "Go'' vs. "NoGo'' categorisation differ between adults and children, but subsequent processing reflected in the different Go/NoGo P3 components, and their sequellae, are similar. Significance: This is the first detailed examination of child responses in this paradigm. The tested schema appears relatively robust in adults, and the child results may aid our understanding of developmental aspects of cognitive processing in normal and atypical individuals.

Additionally the emergence of wireless electroencephalograph (EEG) neuroheadsets and smartphone brainscanners widens the possibilities for this to be used in mobile settings on a consumer level. However the neural signatures of emotional responses are characterized by small voltage changes that would be highly susceptible to noise if captured in a mobile context. Hypothesizing that retrieval of emotional responses in mobile usage scenarios could be enhanced through spatial filtering, we compare a standard EEG electrode-based analysis against an approach based on independent component analysis (ICA). By clustering scalp maps and time series responses we identify neural signatures that are differentially modulated when passively viewing neutral, pleasant and unpleasant images. While early responses can be detected from the raw EEG signal, we identify multiple early and late ICA components that are modulated by emotional content. We propose that similar approaches to spatial filtering might allow us to retrieve more robust signals in real-life mobile usage scenarios, and potentially facilitate design of cognitive interfaces that adapt the selection of media to our emotional responses.

Semantic and syntactic violations embedded in sentences evoke well-known ERPs, but little is known about the oscillatory responses to these violations. We investigated oscillatory responses to both kinds of violations, while monolingual and bilingual participants performed an acceptability judgment task. Both violations elicited power decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the 8-30 Hz frequency range, but with different scalp topographies. In addition, semantic anomalies elicited power increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the 1-5 Hz frequency band. The 1-5 Hz ERS was strongly phase-locked to stimulus onset and highly correlated with time domain averages, whereas the 8-30 Hz ERD response varied independently of these. In addition, the results showed that language expertise modulated 8-30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations as a function of the executive demands of the task. When the executive function demands were increased using a grammaticality judgment task, bilinguals but not monolinguals demonstrated reduced 8-30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations. These findings suggest a putative role of the 8-30 Hz ERD response as a marker of linguistic processing that likely represents a separate neural process from those underlying ERPs.

Age-related differences have been documented on executive functions; motor control becomes more reliant on cognitive control mechanisms, including the engagement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), possibly compensating for age-related sensorimotor declines. Since at functional level the PFC showed the largest age-related differences during discriminative response task, we wonder whether those effects are mainly due to the cognitive difficulty in stimulus discrimination or they could be also detected in a much easier task. In the present study, we measured the association of physical exercise with the PFC activation and response times (RTs) using a simple response task (SRI), in which the participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible by manual key-press to visual stimuli. Simultaneous behavioral (RTs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were performed on 84 healthy participants aged 19-86 years. The whole sample was divided into three cohorts (young, middle-aged, and older); each cohort was further divided into two equal sub-cohorts (exercise and not-exercise) based on a self-report questionnaire measuring physical exercise.The EEG signal was segmented in epochs starting 1100 prior to stimulus onset and lasting 2s. Behavioral results showed age effects, indicating a slowing of RTs with increasing age. The EEG results showed a significant interaction between age and exercise on the activities recorded on the PFC. The results indicates that: (a) the brain of older adults needs the PFC engagement also to perform elementary task, such as the SRI, while this activity is not necessary in younger adults, (b) physical exercise could reduce this age-related reliance on extra cognitive control also during the performance of a SRI, and (c) the activity of the PFC is a sensitive index of the benefits of physical exercise on sensorimotor decline.

Here we suggest that lexical access already occurs at around 100 ms. This interpretation is based on the finding that semantically rich and frequent words exhibit a significantly shorter topographical latency difference between the site with the shortest P1 latency (leading site) and that with the longest P1 latency (trailing site). This latency difference can be described in terms of an evoked traveling alpha wave as was already shown in earlier studies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Acheson, DJ; Hagoort, P				Acheson, Daniel J.; Hagoort, Peter			Twisting tongues to test for conflict-monitoring in speech production	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech production; error-related negativity (ERN); monitoring; flanker task; ERP/EEG; cognitive control; tongue twister; N2	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-DETECTION; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSE-CONFLICT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL SYSTEM; INTERFERENCE; OUTPUT	A number of recent studies have hypothesized that monitoring in speech production may occur via domain-general mechanisms responsible for the detection of response conflict. Outside of language, two ERR components have consistently been elicited in conflict-inducing tasks (e.g., the flanker task): the stimulus-locked N2 on correct trials, and the response-locked error-related negativity (ERN). The present investigation used these electrophysiological markers to test whether a common response conflict monitor is responsible for monitoring in speech and non-speech tasks. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants performed a tongue twister (TT) task and a manual version of the flanker task. In the TT task, people rapidly read sequences of four nonwords arranged in TT and non-TT patterns three times. In the flanker task, people responded with a left/right button press to a center-facing arrow, and conflict was manipulated by the congruency of the flanking arrows. Behavioral results showed typical effects of both tasks, with increased error rates and slower speech onset times forTT relative to non-TT trials and for incongruent relative to congruent flanker trials. In the flanker task, stimulus-locked EEG analyses replicated previous results, with a larger N2 for incongruent relative to congruent trials, and a response-locked ERN. In the TT task, stimulus-locked analyses revealed broad, frontally-distributed differences beginning around 50 ms and lasting until just before speech initiation, with TT trials more negative than non-TT trials; response-locked analyses revealed an ERN. Correlation across these measures showed some correlations within a task, but little evidence of systematic cross-task correlation. Although the present results do not speak against conflict signals from the production system serving as cues to self-monitoring, they are not consistent with signatures of response conflict being mediated by a single, domain-general conflict monitor.

J	Hong, LB; Walz, JM; Sajda, P				Hong, Linbi; Walz, Jennifer M.; Sajda, Paul			Your Eyes Give You Away: Prestimulus Changes in Pupil Diameter Correlate with Poststimulus Task-Related EEG Dynamics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TEMPORAL EVOLUTION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ALPHA-BAND; ERP; DISCRIMINATION; ORIGINS	Pupillary measures have been linked to arousal and attention as well as activity in the brainstem's locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Similarly, there is evidence that evoked EEG responses, such as the P3, might have LC-NE activity as their basis. Since it is not feasible to record electrophysiological data directly from the LC in humans due to its location in the brainstem, an open question has been whether pupillary measures and EEG variability can be linked in a meaningful way to shed light on the nature of the LC-NE role in attention and arousal. We used an auditory oddball task with a data-driven approach to learn task-relevant projections of the EEG, for windows of data spanning the entire trial. We investigated linear and quadratic relationships between the evoked EEG along these projections and both prestimulus (baseline) and poststimulus (evoked dilation) pupil diameter measurements. We found that baseline pupil diameter correlates with early (175-200 ms) and late (350-400 ms) EEG component variability, suggesting a linear relationship between baseline (tonic) LC-NE activity and evoked EEG. We found no relationships between evoked EEG and evoked pupil dilation, which is often associated with evoked (phasic) LC activity. After regressing out reaction time (RT), the correlation between EEG variability and baseline pupil diameter remained, suggesting that such correlation is not explainable by RT variability. We also investigated the relationship between these pupil measures and prestimulus EEG alpha activity, which has been reported as a marker of attentional state, and found a negative linear relationship with evoked pupil dilation. In summary, our results demonstrate significant relationships between prestimulus and poststimulus neural and pupillary measures, and they provide further evidence for tight coupling between attentional state and evoked neural activity and for the role of cortical and subcortical networks underlying the process of target detection.

This evoked negative response occurs in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) over the temporal and frontal cortices, 100-250 ms after onset of the deviant stimulus. The MMN is used to detect sensory information processing. The aim of our study was to investigate whether MMN can be recorded in the subthalamic nuclei (STN) as evidence of auditory information processing on an unconscious level within this structure. To our knowledge, MMN has never been recorded in the human STN. We recorded intracerebral EEG using a MMN paradigm in five patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were implanted with depth electrodes in the subthalamic nuclei (STN). We found far-field MMN when intracerebral contacts were connected to an extracranial reference electrode. In all five PD patients (and nine of ten intracerebral electrodes), we also found near-field MMN-like potentials when intracerebral contacts were referenced to one another, and in some electrodes, we observed phase reversals in these potentials. The mean time-to-peak latency of the intracerebral MMN-like potentials was 214 +/- A 38 ms (median 219 ms). We reveal MMN-like potentials in bilateral STN. This finding provides evidence that STN receives sensory (auditory) information from other structures. The question for further research is whether STN receives such signals through a previously described hyperdirect pathway between STN and frontal cortex (a known generator of the MMN potential) and if the STN contributes to sensorimotor integration.

Reasons for these discordant findings might include the presence of confounders, variability in chronic pain conditions, and the use of different cognitive tests. The present study was aimed to add evidence in this field, by exploring the cognitive profile of a specific type of chronic pain, i.e., chronic low back pain (cLBP). Twenty four cLBP patients and 24 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological battery and we focused on emotional DM abilities by means of Iowa gambling task (IGT). During IGT, behavioral responses and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in 12 patients and 12 controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged offline from EEG epochs locked to the feedback presentation (4000 ms duration, from 2000 ms before to 2000 ms after the feedback onset) separately for wins and losses and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 peak-to-peak amplitudes were calculated. Among cognitive measures, cLBP patients scored lower than controls in the modified card sorting test (MCST) and the score in this test was significantly influenced by pain duration and intensity. Behavioral IGT results documented worse performance and the absence of a learning process during the test in cLBP patients compared to controls, with no effect of pain characteristics. ERPs findings documented abnormal feedback processing in patients during IGT. cLBP patients showed poor performance in the MCST and the IGT. Abnormal feedback processing may be secondary to impingement of chronic pain in brain areas involved in DM or suggest the presence of a predisposing factor related to pain chronification. These abnormalities might contribute to the impairment in the work and family settings that often cLBP patients report.

Hypothetical payoffs are not incentive compatible and are, therefore, not considered to be reliable. Behavioral differences between the evaluation of hypothetical and real payoffs can be attributed to this incentive effect. Because real payoff mechanisms are not always applicable in the field, it is necessary to know in which way both types of payoffs affect evaluation processes. In order to delineate the cognitive processes related to hypothetical bias, we conducted a within-subject EEG experiment with hypothetical and real payoffs. A certainty equivalent elicitation method for measuring risk attitudes was performed in which subjects had to indicate whether they preferred playing a lottery or receiving a sure payoff instead. At the behavioral level, subjects were more risk averse for real payoff choices, confirming a hypothetical bias. EEG-derived event-related potentials provide evidence that the processes underlying these differences in evaluations differ. A higher N2 component for hypothetical payoffs revealed increased cognitive control for hypothetical decisions. These neuronal underpinnings indicate additional evaluation processes in hypothetical choice paradigms, which can explain the shift in risk attitude toward the expected value of a lottery.

Is pitch accent necessary for comprehension by native Japanese speakers? - An ERP investigation	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Pitch accent; Accentual opposition; Homophone; ERP; N400; Japanese	BRAIN POTENTIALS	Not unlike the tonal system in Chinese, Japanese habitually attaches pitch accents to the production of words. However, in contrast to Chinese, few homophonic word-pairs are really distinguished by pitch accents (Shibata & Shibata, 1990). This predicts that pitch accent plays a small role in lexical selection for Japanese language comprehension. The present study investigated whether native Japanese speakers necessarily use pitch accent in the processing of accent-contrasted homophonic pairs (e.g., ame [LH] for 'candy' and ame [HI] for 'rain') measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials. Electrophysiological evidence (i.e., N400) was obtained when a word was semantically incorrect for a given context but not for incorrectly accented homophones. This suggests that pitch accent indeed plays a minor role when understanding Japanese. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The EEG was recorded for 11 female and 11 male participants, during the presentation of 2 television ads. A local frequency analysis pointed key moments of the ad. Also, a sLORETA analysis showed that during the first second, one of the ads triggered greater neural activation than the other, for both genders, especially in areas related with visual and auditory integration, as well as specific decision-related structures.

J	Hanna, J; Pulvermuller, F				Hanna, Jeff; Pulvermueller, Friedemann			Neurophysiological evidence for whole form retrieval of complex derived words: a mismatch negativity study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						morphology; derivation; MMN; ERP; EEG; German	HUMAN BRAIN; MORPHOLOGICAL DECOMPOSITION; MEMORY TRACES; LANGUAGE; RECOGNITION; MEG; ATTENTION; GRAMMAR; SPEECH; REPRESENTATION	Complex words can be seen as combinations of elementary units, decomposable into stems and affixes according to morphological rules. Alternatively, complex forms may be stored as single lexical entries and accessed as whole forms. This study uses an event-related potential brain response capable of indexing both whole-form retrieval and combinatorial processing, the Mismatch Negativity (MMN), to investigate early brain activity elicited by morphologically complex derived words in German. We presented complex words consisting of stems "sicher" (secure), or "sauber" (clean) combined with abstract nominalizing derivational affixes -heit or -keit, to form either congruent derived words: "Sicherheit" (security) and "Sauberkeit" (cleanliness), or incongruent derived pseudowords: *''Sicherkeit' and *"Sauberheit" Using this orthogonal design, it was possible to record brain responses for -heit and -keit in both congruent and incongruent contexts, therefore balancing acoustic variance. Previous research has shown that incongruent combinations of symbols elicit a stronger MMN than congruent combinations, but that single words or constructions stored as whole forms elicit a stronger MMN than pseudowords or non-existent constructions. We found that congruent derived words elicited a stronger MMN than incongruent derived words, beginning about 150 ms after perception of the critical morpheme. This pattern of results is consistent with whole-form storage of morphologically complex derived words as lexical units, or mini constructions. Using distributed source localization methods, the MMN enhancement for well-formed derivationally complex words appeared to be most prominent in the left inferior anterior temporal, bilateral superior parietal and bilateral post-central, supra-marginal areas. In addition, neurophysiological results reflected the frequency of derived forms, thus providing further converging evidence for whole form storage and against a combinatorial mechanism.

A practical, intuitive brain-computer interface for communicating 'yes' or 'no' by listening	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		brain-computer interface; EEG; event-related potential; auditory attention; natural stimuli	SYSTEM	Objective. Previous work has shown that it is possible to build an EEG-based binary brain-computer interface system (BCI) driven purely by shifts of attention to auditory stimuli. However, previous studies used abrupt, abstract stimuli that are often perceived as harsh and unpleasant, and whose lack of inherent meaning may make the interface unintuitive and difficult for beginners. We aimed to establish whether we could transition to a system based on more natural, intuitive stimuli (spoken words 'yes' and 'no') without loss of performance, and whether the system could be used by people in the locked-in state. Approach. We performed a counterbalanced, interleaved within-subject comparison between an auditory streaming BCI that used beep stimuli, and one that used word stimuli. Fourteen healthy volunteers performed two sessions each, on separate days. We also collected preliminary data from two subjects with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who used the word-based system to answer a set of simple yes-no questions. Main results. The N1, N2 and P3 event-related potentials elicited by words varied more between subjects than those elicited by beeps. However, the difference between responses to attended and unattended stimuli was more consistent with words than beeps. Healthy subjects' performance with word stimuli (mean 77% +/- 3.3 s.e.) was slightly but not significantly better than their performance with beep stimuli (mean 73% +/- 2.8 s.e.). The two subjects with ALS used the word-based BCI to answer questions with a level of accuracy similar to that of the healthy subjects. Significance. Since performance using word stimuli was at least as good as performance using beeps, we recommend that auditory streaming BCI systems be built with word stimuli to make the system more pleasant and intuitive. Our preliminary data show that word-based streaming BCI is a promising tool for communication by people who are locked in.	[Hill, N.

Enhancement of brain event-related potentials to speech sounds is associated with compensated reading skills in dyslexic children with familial risk for dyslexia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dyslexia; Speech perception; ERP; EEG; Phonemic length discrimination; Compensation	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-SYSTEM ACTIVITY; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; LENGTH DISCRIMINATION; PHONETIC PERCEPTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; PROCESSING SKILLS; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; PHONEMIC LENGTH	Specific reading disability, dyslexia, is a prevalent and heritable disorder impairing reading acquisition characterized by a phonological deficit. However, the underlying mechanism of how the impaired phonological processing mediates resulting dyslexia or reading disabilities remains still unclear. Using ERPs we studied speech sound processing of 30 dyslexic children with familial risk for dyslexia, 51 typically reading children with familial risk for dyslexia, and 58 typically reading control children. We found enhanced brain responses to shortening of a phonemic length in pseudo-words (/at:a/ vs. /ata/) in dyslexic children with familial risk as compared to other groups. The enhanced brain responses were associated with better performance in behavioral phonemic length discrimination task, as well as with better reading and writing accuracy. Source analyses revealed that the brain responses of sub-group of dyslexic children with largest responses originated from a more posterior area of the right temporal cortex as compared to the responses of the other participants. This is the first electrophysiological evidence for a possible compensatory speech perception mechanism in dyslexia. The best readers within the dyslexic group have probably developed alternative strategies which employ compensatory mechanisms substituting their possible earlier deficit in phonological processing and might therefore be able to perform better in phonemic length discrimination and reading and writing accuracy tasks. However, we speculate that for reading fluency compensatory mechanisms are not that easily built and dyslexic children remain slow readers during their adult life. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We tested whether the N170 response as well as later EPN and P3/LPP responses to nude bodies reflect the effect of increased arousal elicited by these stimuli, or top-down allocation of object-based attention to the nude bodies. Participants saw pictures of clothed and nude bodies and faces. In each block, participants were asked to direct their attention towards stimuli from a specified target category while ignoring others. Object-based attention did not modulate the N170 amplitudes towards attended stimuli; instead N170 response was larger to nude bodies compared to stimuli from other categories. Top-down attention and affective arousal had additive effects on the EPN and P3/LPP responses reflecting later processing stages. We conclude that nude human bodies have a privileged status in the visual processing system due to the affective arousal they trigger. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although the prognosis for children with BECTS is excellent, some studies have revealed neuropsychological deficits in many domains, including language. Auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) reflect activation of different neuronal populations and are suggested to contribute to the evaluation of auditory discrimination (N1), attention allocation and phonological categorization (N2), and echoic memory (mismatch negativity - MMN). The scarce existing literature about this theme motivated the present study, which aims to investigate and document the existing AERP changes in a group of children with BECTS. AERPs were recorded, during the day, to pure and vocal tones and in a conventional auditory oddball paradigm in five children with BECTS (aged 8-12; mean = 10 years; male = 5) and in six gender and age-matched controls. Results revealed high amplitude of AERPs for the group of children with BECTS with a slight latency delay more pronounced in fronto-central electrodes. Children with BECTS may have abnormal central auditory processing, reflected by electrophysiological measures such as AERPs. In advance, AERPs seem a good tool to detect and reliably reveal cortical excitability in children with typical BECTS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better understand the neural basis of deafness-induced changes, the present study used electroencephalography to examine visual functions and cross-modal reorganization of the auditory cortex in deaf individuals. Congenitally deaf participants and hearing controls were presented with reversing chequerboard stimuli that were systematically modulated in luminance ratio. The two groups of participants showed similar modulation of visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes (N85, P110) and latencies (P110) as a function of luminance ratio. Analysis of VEPs revealed faster neural processing in deaf participants compared with hearing controls at early stages of cortical visual processing (N85). Deaf participants also showed higher amplitudes (P110) than hearing participants. In contrast to our expectations, the results from VEP source analysis revealed no clear evidence for cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex of deaf participants. However, deaf participants tended to show higher activation in posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Moreover, modulation of PPC responses as a function of luminance was also stronger in deaf than in hearing participants. Taken together, these findings are an indication of more efficient neural processing of visual information in the deaf, which may relate to functional changes, in particular in multisensory parietal cortex, as a consequence of early auditory deprivation.

We created three experimental situations for a standard osteopathic procedure in which patients and practitioner listened either to silence, to the same music in synchrony, or (unknowingly) to different desynchronized montages of the same material. Music had no effect on heart rate and arterial pressure pre- and posttreatment compared to silence, but EEG measures revealed a clear effect of synchronized versus desynchronized listening: listening to desynchronized music was associated with larger amounts of mu-rhythm event-related desynchronization (ERD), indicating decreased sensorimotor fluency compared to what was gained in the synchronized music listening condition. This result suggests that, if any effect can be attributed to music for osteopathy, it is related to its capacity to modulate empathy between patient and therapist and, further, that music does not systematically create better conditions for empathy than silence.

Influence of trait behavioral inhibition and behavioral approach motivation systems on the LPP and frontal asymmetry to anger pictures	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Behavioral inhibition system (BIS); behavioral approach system (BAS); anger; late positive potential; approach motivation; frontal alpha-suppression asymmetry	ACTION-BASED MODEL; EEG ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; APPETITIVE STIMULI; RESPONSES; EMOTION; SENSITIVITY; COVARIATION; PERSONALITY	Behavioral approach and avoidance are fundamental to the experience of emotion and motivation, but the motivational system associated with anger is not well established. Some theories posit that approach motivational processes underlie anger, whereas others posit that avoidance motivational processes underlie anger. The current experiment sought to address whether traits related to behavioral approach or avoidance influence responses to anger stimuli using multiple measures: ERP, electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha-asymmetry and self-report. After completing the behavioral inhibition system/behavioral approach system (BIS/BAS) scales, participants viewed anger pictures and neutral pictures. BAS predicted larger late positive potentials (LPPs) to anger pictures, but not to neutral pictures. In addition, BAS predicted greater left-frontal asymmetry to anger pictures. Moreover, larger LPPs to anger pictures related to greater left-frontal EEG asymmetry during anger pictures. These results suggest that trait approach motivation relates to neurophysiological responses of anger.

J	Luft, CD				Luft, Caroline Di Bernardi			Learning from feedback: The neural mechanisms of feedback processing facilitating better performance	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Feedback; Learning; FRN; ERP; Oscillations; Connectivity	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; ERROR-DETECTION; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; EXTERNAL INFORMATION; NEGATIVITY	Different levels of feedback, from sensory signals to verbal advice, are needed not only for learning new skills, but also for monitoring performance. A great deal of research has focused on the electrophysiological correlates of feedback processing and how they relate to good learning. In this paper, studies on the EEG correlates of learning from feedback are reviewed. The main objective is to discuss these findings whilst also considering some key theoretical aspects of learning. The learning processes, its operational definition and the feedback characteristics are discussed and used as reference for integrating the findings in the literature. The EEG correlates of feedback processing for learning using various analytical approaches are discussed, including ERPs, oscillations and inter-site synchronization. How these EEG responses to feedback are related to learning is discussed, highlighting the gaps in the literature and suggesting future directions for understanding the neural underpinnings of learning from feedback.

In the present implementation, multiple cortical patches are introduced as source priors based on a dipole source space restricted to a cortical surface mesh. In this note, we present a technique to construct volumetric cortical regions to introduce as source priors by restricting the dipole source space to a segmented gray matter layer and using a region growing approach. This extension allows to reconstruct brain structures besides the cortical surface and facilitates the use of more realistic volumetric head models including more layers, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), compared to the standard 3-layered scalp-skull-brain head models. We illustrated the technique with ERP data and anatomical MR images in 12 subjects. Based on the segmented gray matter for each of the subjects, cortical regions were created and introduced as source priors for MSP-inversion assuming two types of head models. The standard 3-layered scalp-skull-brain head models and extended 4-layered head models including CSF. We compared these models with the current implementation by assessing the free energy corresponding with each of the reconstructions using Bayesian model selection for group studies. Strong evidence was found in favor of the volumetric MSP approach compared to the MSP approach based on cortical patches for both types of head models. Overall, the strongest evidence was found in favor of the volumetric MSP reconstructions based on the extended head models including CSF. These results were verified by comparing the reconstructed activity. The use of volumetric cortical regions as source priors is a useful complement to the present implementation as it allows to introduce more complex head models and volumetric source priors in future studies.

Many ICs may be identified with a precise physiological or non-physiological origin. However, this process is hindered by partial instability in ICA results that can arise from noise in the data. Here we propose RELICA (RELiable ICA), a novel method to characterize IC reliability within subjects. RELICA first computes IC "dipolarity" a measure of physiological plausibility, plus a measure of IC consistency across multiple decompositions of bootstrap versions of the input data. RELICA then uses these two measures to visualize and cluster the separated ICs, providing a within-subject measure of IC reliability that does not involve checking for its occurrence across subjects. We demonstrate the use of RELICA on EEG data recorded from 14 subjects performing a working memory experiment and show that many brain and ocular artifact ICs are correctly classified as "stable" (highly repeatable across decompositions of bootstrapped versions of the input data). Many stable ICs appear to originate in the brain, while other stable ICs account for identifiable non-brain processes such as line noise. RELICA might be used with any linear blind source separation algorithm to reduce the risk of basing conclusions on unstable or physiologically un-interpretable component processes.

The acute effects of MDMA and ethanol administration on electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring in healthy volunteers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Error monitoring; EEG; ERPs; Error-related negativity (ERN); N2; MDMA; Ethanol; Drugs of abuse; Healthy volunteers	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO/NO-GO TASK; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; RESPONSE CONFLICT; ECSTASY MDMA; ALCOHOL; BRAIN; P300	Knowing how commonly used drugs affect performance monitoring is of great importance, because drug use is often associated with compromised behavioral control. Two of the most commonly used recreational drugs in the western world, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or "ecstasy") and ethanol (alcohol), are also often used in combination. The error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN), and N2 are electrophysiological indices of performance monitoring. The present study aimed to investigate how ethanol, MDMA, and their co-administration affect performance monitoring as indexed by the electrophysiological correlates. Behavioral and EEG data were obtained from 14 healthy volunteers during execution of a speeded choice-reaction-time task after administration of ethanol, MDMA, and combined ethanol and MDMA, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. Ethanol significantly reduced ERN amplitudes, while administration of MDMA did not affect the ERN. Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not further impair nor ameliorate the effect of ethanol alone. No drug effects on CRN nor N2 were observed. A decreased ERN following ethanol administration is in line with previous work and offers further support for the impairing effects of alcohol intoxication on performance monitoring. This impairment may underlie maladaptive behavior in people who are under influence. Moreover, these data demonstrate for the first time that MDMA does not affect performance monitoring nor does it interact with ethanol in this process. These findings corroborate the notion that MDMA leaves central executive functions relatively unaffected.	[Spronk, D. B.; Verkes, R.

Preferential encoding of behaviorally relevant predictions revealed by EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prediction; expectation; task-relevance; EEG; event-related potential	VISUAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION; MEMORY; IMPLICIT; ADAPTATION; VARIETIES	Statistical regularities in the environment guide perceptual processing; however, some predictions are bound to be more important than others. In this electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we test how task relevance influences the way predictions are learned from the statistics of visual input, and exploited for behavior. We developed a novel task in which participants are simply instructed to respond to a designated target stimulus embedded in a serial stream of non-target stimuli. Presentation probabilities were manipulated such that a designated target cue stimulus predicted the target onset with 70% validity. We also included a corresponding control contingency: a pre-designated control cue predicted a specific non-target stimulus with 70% validity. Participants were not informed about these contingencies. This design allowed us to examine the neural response to task-relevant predictive (cue) and predicted stimuli (target), relative to task-irrelevant predictive (control cue) and predicted stimuli (control non-target). The behavioral results confirmed that participants learned and exploited task-relevant predictions even when not explicitly defined. The EEG results further showed that target-relevant predictions are coded more strongly than statistically equivalent regularities between non-target stimuli. There was a robust modulation of the response for predicted targets associated with learning, enhancing the response to cued stimuli just after 200 ms post-stimulus in central and posterior electrodes, but no corresponding effects for predicted non-target stimuli. These effects of target prediction were preceded by a sustained frontal negativity following presentation of the predictive cue stim ulus. These results show that task relevance critically influences how the brain extracts predictive structure from the environment, and exploits these regularities for optimized behavior.

Multi-subject EEG source imaging studies that apply Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to data concatenated across subjects have overlooked the fact that projections to the scalp sensors from functionally equivalent cortical sources vary from subject to subject. This study demonstrates an approach to spatiotemporal independent component decomposition and alignment that spatially co-registers the MR-derived cortical topographies of individual subjects to a well-defined, shared spherical topology (Fischl et al., 1999). Its efficacy for identifying functionally equivalent EEG sources in multi-subject analysis is demonstrated by analyzing EEG and behavioral data from a stop-signal paradigm using two source-imaging approaches, both based on individual subject independent source decompositions. The first, two-stage approach uses temporal infomax ICA to separate each subject's data into temporally independent components (ICs), then estimates the source density distribution of each IC process from its scalp map and clusters similar sources across subjects (Makeig et al., 2002). The second approach, Electromagnetic Spatiotemporal Independent Component Analysis (EMSICA), combines ICA decomposition and source current density estimation of the artifact-rejected data into a single spatiotemporal ICA decomposition for each subject (Tsai et al., 2006), concurrently identifying both the spatial source distribution of each cortical source and its event-related dynamics. Applied to the stop-signal task data, both approaches gave IC clusters that separately accounted for EEG processes expected in stop-signal tasks, including pre/ postcentral mu rhythms, anterior-cingulate theta rhythm, and right-inferior frontal responses, the EMSICA clusters exhibiting more tightly correlated source areas and time-frequency features.

A BCI is a tool that converts signals recorded from the user's brain into control signals for different applications. Most BCI systems are based on one of the following methods: P300; steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP); and event-related desynchronization (ERD). Electroencephalog-ram (EEG) activity is recorded non-invasively using active or passive electrodes mounted on the human scalp. In recent years, a variety of different BCI applications for communication and control were developed. A promising new idea is to utilize BCI systems as tools for brain rehabilitation. The BCI can detect the user's movement intention and provide online feedback for rehabilitation sessions. In many cases, stroke patients can re-train their brains to restore effective movement. Previous work has continued to show that higher density electrode systems can reveal subtleties of brain dynamics that are not obvious with only few electrodes. This paper tries to optimize current BCI strategies for stroke rehabilitation by comparing conventional bar feedback (bFD) to immersive 3-D virtual reality feedback (VRFB).

The manipulation correlates with an up-regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In humans, different pathologies have been associated with T. gondii infections but most latently infected humans do not seem to display overt impairments. Since a dopamine plus does not necessarily bear exclusively negative consequences in humans, we investigated potential positive consequences of latent toxoplasmosis (and the presumed boosting of dopaminergic neurotransmission) on human cognition and behavior. For this purpose, we focused on action cascading which has been shown to be modulated by dopamine. Based on behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) data obtained by means of a stop-change paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that healthy young humans can actually benefit from latent T. gondii infection as regards their performance in this task (as indicated by faster response times and a smaller P3 component). The data shows that a latent infection which is assumed to affect the dopaminergic system can lead to paradoxical improvements of cognitive control processes in humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In-vitro studies suggest that the neurochemical basis of gamma-band oscillatory activity is based on interactions between excitatory (i.e. glutamate) and inhibitory (i.e. GABA) neurotransmitter concentrations. However, the nature of the relationship between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and changes in gamma band activity in humans remains undetermined. Here, we examine the links between dynamic glutamate concentration and the formation of functional gamma-band oscillatory networks. Using concurrently acquired event-related magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electroencephalography, during a repetition-priming paradigm, we demonstrate an interaction between stimulus type (object vs. abstract pictures) and repetition in evoked gamma-band oscillatory activity, and find that glutamate levels within the lateral occipital cortex, differ in response to these distinct stimulus categories. Importantly, we show that dynamic glutamate levels are related to the amplitude of stimulus evoked gamma-band (but not to beta, alpha or theta or ERP) activity. These results highlight the specific connection between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and amplitude of oscillatory response, providing a novel insight into the relationship between the neurochemical and neurophysiological processes underlying cognition.

However, the specific contribution of each sensory system during attentional processing remains unclear. We used EEG to investigate the effects of visual priming and attentional relevance in modulating somatosensory cortical responses. Methods: Healthy adults performed a sensory integration task that required scaled motor responses dependent on the amplitudes of tactile and visual stimuli. Participants completed an attentional paradigm comprised of 5 conditions that presented sequential or concurrent pairs of discrete stimuli with random amplitude variations: 1) tactile-tactile (TT), 2) visual-visual (VV), 3) visual-tactile simultaneous (SIM), 4) tactile-visual delay (TVd), and 5) visual-tactile delay (VTd), each with a 100 ms temporal delay between stimulus onsets. Attention was directed to crossmodal conditions and graded motor responses representing the summation of the 2 stimulus amplitudes were made. Results: Results of somatosensory ERPs showed that the modality-specific components (P50, P100) were sensitive to i) the temporal dynamics of crossmodal interactions, and ii) the relevance of these sensory signals for behaviour. Conclusion: Notably, the P50 amplitude was greatest in the VTd condition, suggesting that presentation of relevant visual information for upcoming movement modulates somatosensory processing in modality-specific cortical regions, as early as the primary somatosensory cortex (SI).

Acute Stress Modulates Feedback Processing in Men and Women: Differential Effects on the Feedback-Related Negativity and Theta and Beta Power	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ANTICIPATORY STRESS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; GAMBLING TASK; REWARD; DEPRESSION	Sex-specific prevalence rates in mental and physical disorders may be partly explained by sex differences in physiological stress responses. Neural networks that might be involved are those underlying feedback processing. Aim of the present EEG study was to investigate whether acute stress alters feedback processing, and whether stress effects differ between men and women. Male and female participants performed a gambling task, in a control and a stress condition. Stress was induced by exposing participants to a noise stressor. Brain activity was analyzed using both event-related potential and time-frequency analyses, measuring the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback-related changes in theta and beta oscillatory power, respectively. While the FRN and feedback-related theta power were similarly affected by stress induction in both sexes, feedback-related beta power depended on the combination of stress induction condition and sex. FRN amplitude and theta power increases were smaller in the stress relative to the control condition in both sexes, demonstrating that acute noise stress impairs performance monitoring irrespective of sex. However, in the stress but not in the control condition, early lower beta-band power increases were larger for men than women, indicating that stress effects on feedback processing are partly sex-dependent. Our findings suggest that sex-specific effects on feedback processing may comprise a factor underlying sex-specific stress responses.

We recorded N2pc and CDA, two lateralized components of the EEG signal associated respectively with individuation and visual working memory, while participants enumerated a variable number (1-9) of uniquely colored targets among distractors. Behavioral results showed a clear subitizing effect, with lower error rates for smaller (1-3 targets) than larger sets. ERP results showed that both N2pc and CDA amplitudes increased as a function of target numerosity up to approximately three targets. However, individual differences in the enumeration efficiency were correlated only with the individual variation in the N2pc modulations. The results suggest that the constraints of the attentional individuation system play a significant role in the occurrence of the subitizing phenomenon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Social cognition, face processing, and oxytocin receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms in typically developing children	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Social cognition; Oxytocin; Autism spectrum disorder; Typically developing children; Event-related potential-N170	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; GENE OXTR; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MIND; ASSOCIATION; ATTRIBUTION; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Recent research has provided evidence of a link between behavioral measures of social cognition (SC) and neural and genetic correlates. Differences in face processing and variations in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene have been associated with SC deficits and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits. Much work has examined the qualitative differences between those with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals, but very little has been done to quantify the natural variation in ASD-like traits in the typical population. The present study examines this variation in TD children using a multidimensional perspective involving behavior assessment, neural electroencephalogram (EEG) testing, and OXTR genotyping. Children completed a series of neurocognitive assessments, provided saliva samples for sequencing, and completed a face processing task while connected to an EEG. No clear pattern emerged for EEG covariates or genotypes for individual OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, SNPs rs2254298 and rs53576 consistently interacted such that the AG/GG allele combination of these SNPs was associated with poorer performance on neurocognitive measures. These results suggest that neither SNP in isolation is risk-conferring, but rather that the combination of rs2254298(A/G) and rs53576(G/G) confers a deleterious effect on SC across several neurocognitive measures.

The studies demonstrating the existence of novelty neurons showing SSA at different levels along the auditory pathway's hierarchy, together with the recent results showing human auditory-evoked potential correlates of deviance detection at very short latencies, that is, at 20-40ms from change onset, support the view that novelty detection is a key principle that governs the functional organization of the auditory system. Furthermore, the generation of the MMN recorded from the human scalp seems to involve a cascade of neuronal processing that occurs at different successive levels of the auditory system's hierarchy.

But in almost all researches, this process is associated with a secondary task, (like numeration). Some believe that the link between these two cognitive activities (i.e. attention and numeration) in human brain is very close and intricate. However, the goal of this research is to evaluate the side effects of counting on visual attention in order to clarify the definition of Attention through brain signals. In previous related researches, only the qualitative impacts of counting have been dealt with and endeavor in this field is a new effort. We used a novel psychophysics task to explore the impact of this extra task on visual top-down attention. EEG was recorded during the task from 48 subjects in occipital, Parietal and frontal lobes. Target-locked ERPs for attention with and without numerating were constructed. Time features corresponding to P300 component were extracted for all eight channels separately. Common feature selection method and classifiers were employed to separate two classes (attention with numeration and pure attention). The results indicate that our task was capable of separation and some of the predefined ERP, time features are meaningful while attention is with numeration. As a result, we have introduced ERP features which belong to this separation and also determined the most relevant brain areas. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this quantitative separation is performed.

Still, it is unclear whether the act of rating response correctness changes ERP correlates of performance monitoring. In order to investigate the influence of response accuracy ratings, a flanker task was conducted with or without concomitant accuracy rating and ERPs were compared between the two conditions. Error- and correct-related negativities were increased in the rating condition, possibly indicating an increase in performance monitoring. The error positivity differed more strongly between errors and correct responses in the rating condition. Additionally, correct reaction times were slower and post-error slowing was diminished in the rating condition, pointing toward a more cautious response strategy. These possible confounds should be taken into account by future studies using response accuracy ratings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, different results have been obtained in studies using color stimuli. This could be due to important differences in the experimental paradigms used in previous studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined whether the same relationship between capacity and resolution holds for color information. Participants performed a color change detection task while their electroencephalography was recorded. We manipulated representation resolution by asking participants to detect either a salient change (low-resolution) or a subtle change (high-resolution) in color. We used an ERP component known as contralateral delay activity (CDA) to index the amount of information maintained in VWM. The result demonstrated the same pattern for both low- and high-resolution conditions, with no difference between conditions. Conclusions/Significance: This result suggests that VWM always represents a fixed number of approximately 3-4 colors regardless of the resolution of representation.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate reduced cortical sensitivity to auditory oddball regularities	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Perceptual organization; Context processing; Acoustic regularities; Bayesian prediction error; Auditory oddball; Schizophrenia	PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; DYSFUNCTION	Background: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in context processing. These deficits can be characterized by examining the influence of auditory context on ERP responses to rare target tones. Previous studies demonstrate that target ERP deficits in schizophrenia depend on the number of non-targets that precede the target ERP. Our goal was to extend these findings by examining whether patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to subtle differences in the auditory context preceding rare target stimuli, as quantified by Itti and Baldi's Bayesian prediction error model. Methods: Cortical responses to auditory oddball tones were measured within 59 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and 59 controls (HC). Individual trial amplitudes were estimated by conducting group ICA on the EEG time series and analyzing the reconstructed individual temporal sources. We quantified the auditory context of target tones using the Bayesian prediction errormodel and determinedwhether ERPamplitudes to toneswere sensitive to this measure of context, or the number of preceding non-targets directly, within HC and SZ. Results: Individuals with schizophrenia show a significant reduction in ERP response amplitudes to targets approximately 244-412ms following target onsets. Individual amplitudeswithin thiswindowshowed significantly greater sensitivity to the modeled prediction error within the controls than in individuals with schizophrenia. These differences approached significancewhen examining differences in amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding non-targets. Conclusions: These findings further clarify differences inHC and SZwith regard to their attentional and perceptual sensitivity to subtle environmental regularities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Speed pressure in conflict situations impedes inhibitory action control in Parkinson's disease	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Inhibitory control; Parkinson's disease; Speed accuracy trade off; Dual Processing Activation-Suppression model; Event related motor potentials; Laplacian	STIMULUS-RESPONSE COMPATIBILITY; BASAL GANGLIA; ACCURACY TRADEOFF; COGNITIVE CONTROL; REACTION-TIME; NEUROCOGNITIVE MECHANISMS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INTERFERENCE CONTROL; SCALP EEG; MOTOR	The current study investigated the effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the ability to resolve conflicts when performance emphasized speed vs. response accuracy. PD patients and healthy controls (HC) completed a Simon task, and a subset of participants provided movement-related potential (MRP) data to investigate motor cortex activation and inhibition associated with conflict resolution. Both groups adjusted performance strategically with speed or accuracy instructions. The groups experienced similar susceptibility to making fast errors in conflict trials, but PD patients were less proficient compared to HC at suppressing incorrect responses, especially under speed pressure. Analysis of MRPs showed attenuated inhibition of the motor cortex controlling the conflicting response in PD patients compared to HC. These results confirm the detrimental effects of PD on inhibitory control mechanisms with speed pressure and also suggest that a downstream effect of inhibitory dysfunction in PD might be due to diminished inhibition of the motor cortex.

J	Chand, GB; Dhamala, M				Chand, Ganesh B.; Dhamala, Mukesh			Spectral factorization-based current source density analysis of ongoing neural oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Spontaneous neural oscillations; Neural current sources; Local field potentials; Evoked brain activity; Induced brain activity; Electrophysiological recordings	MULTIVARIATE STOCHASTIC PROCESSES; ANURAN CEREBELLUM; PREDICTION THEORY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Background: Current source density (CSD) analysis is widely used in neurophysiological investigations intended to reveal the patterns of localized neuronal activity in terms of current sources and sinks. CSD is based on the second spatial derivatives of multi-electrode electrophysiological recordings, and can be applied to brain activity related to repeated external stimulations (evoked brain activity) or ongoing (spontaneous) brain activity. In evoked brain activity, event-related time-series averages of ensembles are used to compute CSD patterns. However, for ongoing neural activity, the lack of external events requires a different approach other than ensemble averaging. New method: Here, we propose a new spectral factorization-based current source density (SF-CSD) analysis method for ongoing neural oscillations. Results: We validated this new SF-CSD analysis method using simulated data and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying to experimental intra-cortical local field potentials recorded on multi-contact depth electrodes from monkeys performing selective visual attention tasks. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method gives space-unbiased estimates since it does not rely on a reference for CSD calculation in the frequency-domain. Conclusion: The proposed SF-CSD method is expected to be a useful tool for systematic analysis of neural sources and oscillations from multi-site electrophysiological recordings.

The stimuli were Gabor arrays with some Gabor elements positioned on the contour of an embedded shape, in three conditions: with local and global structure (perfect contour alignment), with global structure only (orthogonal orientations interrupting the alignment), or without contour. By applying JointICA to the EEG and fMRI responses of the subjects, new insights could be obtained that cannot be derived from unimodal recordings. In particular, only in the global structure condition, an ERP peak around 300 ms was identified that involved a loop from LOC to the early visual areas. This component can be interpreted as being related to the verification of the consistency of the different local elements with the globally defined shape, which is necessary when perfect local-to-global alignment is absent. By modifying JointICA, a quantitative comparison of brain regions and the time-course of their interplay were obtained between different conditions. More generally, we provide additional support for the presence of feedback loops from higher areas to lower level sensory regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Traditionally, this paradigm has been applied using either high temporal resolution (EEG) or high spatial resolution (fMRI, PET). However, used separately, these techniques cannot provide information on both the location and time course of particular neural processes. The goal of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of auditory processes with a fine spatio-temporal resolution. A simultaneous auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique (AEP-fMRI), together with an oddball paradigm, were used. Material/Methods: Six healthy volunteers, aged 20-35 years, participated in an odd-ball simultaneous AEP-fMRI experiment. AEP in response to acoustic stimuli were used to model bioelectric intracerebral generators, and electrophysiological results were integrated with fMRI data. Results: fMRI activation evoked by standard stimuli was found to occur mainly in the primary auditory cortex. Activity in these regions overlapped with intracerebral bioelectric sources (dipoles) of the N1 component. Dipoles of the N1/P2 complex in response to standard stimuli were also found in the auditory pathway between the thalamus and the auditory cortex. Deviant stimuli induced fMRI activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and parietal lobes. Conclusions: The present study showed that neural processes evoked by standard stimuli occur predominantly in subcortical and cortical structures of the auditory pathway. Deviants activate areas non-specific for auditory information processing.

Using a contour integration task and EEG source level analyses, we tested the hypothesis that perceptual grouping requires a top-down selection, rather than a passive pooling, of neural information that codes local elements in the visual image. The participants were presented visual displays with or without a hidden contour. Two tasks were performed: a central luminance-change detection task and a peripheral contour detection task. Only in the contour-detection task could we find differential brain activity between contour and non-contour conditions, within a distributed brain network including parietal, lateral occipital and primary visual areas. Contour processing was associated with an inflow of information from lateral occipital into primary visual regions, as revealed from the slope of phase differences between source level oscillations within these areas. The findings suggest that contour integration results from a selection of neural information from lower visual areas, and that this selection is driven by the lateral occipital cortex.

This depletion is counteracted through dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). Dopamine has been suggested to affect novelty processing and memory, which suggests that these processes are also implicated in PD and that DRT could affect them. Objective: To investigate word learning and novelty processing in patients with PD as indexed by the P2 and P3 event-related potential components, and the role of DRT in these processes. Methods: 21 patients with PD and 21 matched healthy controls were included. Patients with PD were tested on and off DRT in two sessions in a counterbalanced design, and healthy controls were tested twice without intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured while participants performed a word learning Von Restorff task. Results: Healthy controls showed the typical Von Restorff effect, with better memory for words that were presented in novel fonts, than for words presented in standard font. Surprisingly, this effect was reversed in the patients with PD. In line with the behavioral findings, the P3 was larger for novel than for standard font words in healthy controls, but not in patients with PD. For both groups the P2 and P3 event-related components were larger for recalled versus forgotten words. DRT did not affect these processes. Conclusions: Learning of novel information is compromised in patients with PD. Likewise, the P2 and P3 components that predict successful memory encoding are reduced in PD patients. This was true both on and off DRT, suggesting that these findings reflect abnormalities in learning and memory in PD that are not resolved by dopaminergic medication. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Decoding auditory attention to instruments in polyphonic music using single-trial EEG classification	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; auditory; music; attention; oddball paradigm; P300	P300 SPELLING SYSTEM; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; IMAGERY	Objective. Polyphonic music (music consisting of several instruments playing in parallel) is an intuitive way of embedding multiple information streams. The different instruments in a musical piece form concurrent information streams that seamlessly integrate into a coherent and hedonistically appealing entity. Here, we explore polyphonic music as a novel stimulation approach for use in a brain-computer interface. Approach. In a multi-streamed oddball experiment, we had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips. Each instrument formed an oddball stream with its own specific standard stimuli (a repetitive musical pattern) and oddballs (deviating musical pattern). Main results. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject-and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument can be classified offline with a mean accuracy of 91% across 11 participants. Significance. This is a proof of concept that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for both brain-computer interface and music research.

Despite its efficiency, a potential problem is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition accuracy due to their lack of features from the real electro-encephalo-gram (EEG) data. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with EEG data from 10 healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs.

Psychophysiological correlates of coping and quality of life in patients with ALS	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ALS; N400; EEG; Coping; Quality of life	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MOOD; EMOTION	Objective: Self-regulation models of coping suggest that patients with chronic diseases reporting low quality of life (QoL), an indicator of failed coping efforts, should show facilitated access to disease related words. Here we investigated whether a reduced N400 amplitude within an incongruent, i.e. unpredictable disease-related context would be a correlate of this facilitated access. Methods: ERPs were recorded in N = 18 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and N = 20 age-matched healthy controls during reading of sentences, ending either with congruent or incongruent words. Incongruent and congruent words were disease related or disease unrelated. Mean N400 amplitudes were analyzed with mixed models. Results: Generally, incongruent words elicited a more negative N400 amplitude than congruent words in all groups and conditions, i.e. an N400 effect. In patients with high QoL this N400 effect did not differ between disease related and unrelated words. In patients with low QoL, however, the N400 effect was significantly smaller for disease related than for disease unrelated words. In healthy controls N400 amplitudes showed no such interaction between congruence, disease relatedness and QoL. Results remained stable when controlling for disease severity, duration and depression. Conclusion: The N400 indicates increased accessibility to disease related information in ALS patients with low QoL. The increased access may imply a constantly activated disease related context which is linked to low QoL. Significance: N400 modulation by disease related information may serve as a psychophysiological correlate of coping and the patient's QoL.

Using the same stimuli, participants indicated the orientation of a line contained in a shape singleton (identification task) or the presence of singletons (detection task). Shape singletons in the identification task elicited a contralateral negativity (N2pc) whereas shape singletons in the detection task elicited a contralateral positivity (Pd). We suggest that the reduction of attentional priority of a salient stimulus, reflected by the Pd, occurred more rapidly with the less demanding detection task. Further, fewer distractible participants showed a larger N2pc to lateral color distractors than highly distractible participants. We suggest that highly distractible participants developed compensatory mechanisms to suppress distracting stimuli.

Feasibility of an Asynchronous Event Related Desynchronization based Brain Switch for control of Functional Electrical Stimulation	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article								We present a feasibility study of inducing plasticity of the corticospinal tract to the flexor carpi radialis muscle by using EEG based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. The mental task that drives the proposed asynchronous BCI is hand motor imagery, which when detected activates a functional electrical stimulation induced matching movement. Tests on four healthy subjects show that the BCI can be asynchronously driven with a precision in the range of 0.66-0.92 and a sensitivity 0.81-0.94. Alterations in cortical excitability prior, immediately after and 30 minutes following the BCI intervention was quantified by the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Preliminary results show that the BCI intervention did not induce consistent alterations of MEP size in the target muscle. However the greater variability of MEPs following the intervention indicates that the motor cortex is undergoing changes.

The first canonical variate included figural and verbal flexibility and originality as dependent measures and (a) higher scores on the brain integration scale, (b) faster speed of processing in an event-related potential task, (c) faster conflict-resolution during the Stroop task, (d) higher moral reasoning, and (e) higher manageability and lower comprehensibility as independent measures. Flexibility and originality reflect the ability to see old situations in new ways leading to unique responses. Greater mental adaptability was associated with greater brain integration and speed of processing along with higher moral reasoning and feeling of being in control. Future research could investigate effects of interventions that optimize brain integration on creative output across professions.

J	Kashihara, K				Kashihara, Koji			A brain-computer interface for potential non-verbal facial communication based on EEG signals related to specific emotions	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neutral faces; source localization; aversive conditioning; face recognition; electroencephalogram; brain computer interfaces	HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; FACE; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; RESPONSES; FAMILIAR; FUSIFORM; IMAGERY; GAZE	Unlike assistive technology for verbal communication, the brain-machine or brain-computer interface (BMI/BCI) has not been established as a non-verbal communication tool for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Face-to-face communication enables access to rich emotional information, but individuals suffering from neurological disorders, such as ALS and autism, may not express their emotions or communicate their negative feelings. Although emotions may be inferred by looking at facial expressions, emotional prediction for neutral faces necessitates advanced judgment. The process that underlies brain neuronal responses to neutral faces and causes emotional changes remains unknown. To address this problem, therefore, this study attempted to decode conditioned emotional reactions to neutral face stimuli. This direction was motivated by the assumption that if electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to detect patients' emotional responses to specific inexpressive faces, the results could be incorporated into the design and development of BMI/BCI-based non-verbal communication tools. To these ends, this study investigated how a neutral face associated with a negative emotion modulates rapid central responses in face processing and then identified cortical activities. The conditioned neutral face-triggered event-related potentials that originated from the posterior temporal lobe statistically significantly changed during late face processing (600-700 ms) after stimulus, rather than in early face processing activities, such as P1 and N170 responses. Source localization revealed that the conditioned neutral faces increased activity in the right fusiform gyrus (FG). This study also developed an efficient method for detecting implicit negative emotional responses to specific faces by using EEG signals. A classification method based on a support vector machine enables the easy classification of neutral faces that trigger specific individual emotions. In accordance with this classification, a face on a computer morphs into a sad or displeased countenance. The proposed method could be incorporated as a part of non-verbal communication tools to enable emotional expression.

However, the neuronal mechanisms mediating a successful NF training have not yet been sufficiently uncovered for both theta/beta (T/B), and slow cortical potential (SCP) training, two protocols established in NF in ADHD. In the present, randomized, controlled investigation in adults without a clinical diagnosis (n = 59), the specificity of the effects of these two NF protocols on attentional processes and motor system excitability were to be examined, focusing on the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Neurofeedback training consisted of 10 double sessions, and self-regulation skills were analyzed. Pre- and post-training assessments encompassed performance and event-related potential measures during an attention task, and motor system excitability assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Some NF protocol-specific effects have been obtained. However, due to the limited sample size medium effects did not reach the level of significance. Self-regulation abilities during negativity trials of the SCP training were associated with increased contingent negative variation amplitudes, indicating improved resource allocation during cognitive preparation. Theta/beta training was associated with increased response speed and decreased target-P3 amplitudes after successful theta/beta regulation suggested reduced attentional resources necessary for stimulus evaluation. Motor system excitability effects after theta/beta training paralleled the effects of methylphenidate. Overall, our results are limited by the non-sufficiently acquired self-regulation skills, but some specific effects between good and poor learners could be described. Future studies with larger sample sizes and sufficient acquisition of self-regulation skills are needed to further evaluate the protocol-specific effects on attention and motor system excitability reported.

J	Spencer, KM; Ghorashi, S				Spencer, Kevin M.; Ghorashi, Shahab			Oscillatory dynamics of Gestalt perception in schizophrenia revisited	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; visual perception; Gestalt; gamma oscillation; event-related potential	NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; EEG; ORGANIZATION; STIMULATION; ABNORMALITIES; DYSFUNCTION; COGNITION	Background: Abnormalities in gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) have been proposed to reflect neural circuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia. Oscillations in the gamma band are thought to play an important role in visual perception, mediating the binding of visual features into coherent objects. However, there is relatively little evidence to date of deficits in gamma-mediated processes associated with Gestalt perception in schizophrenia. Methods: Fourteen healthy control subjects (HC) and 17 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) discriminated between illusory Kanisza Squares and No-Square control stimuli, indicating their judgment with a manual button press. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG was computed with the Morlet wavelet transform. Time-frequency maps of phase locking factor (PLF) values were calculated for stimulus- and response-locked oscillations. Results: HC and SZ did not differ in reaction time, error rate, an early ERR effect associated with Gestalt processing, nor an early visual-evoked gamma oscillation. Two response-locked high gamma effects had greater PLF for Square than No-Square stimuli in HC, and the reverse pattern in SZ. One of these effects was correlated with thought disorder symptom ratings in SZ. Conclusions: SZ demonstrated abnormalities in gamma oscillations associated with the perception of Gestalt objects, while their early visual-evoked gamma activity was mostly normal, contrary to previous results. This study supports the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillations are sensitive to aspects of psychosis.

Human Brain Responses to Concomitant Stimulation of A delta and C Nociceptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						A delta-fibers; C-fibers; evoked potentials; first pain; nociception; second pain	LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ULTRALATE CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; STIMULUS SALIENCY; PAIN PERCEPTION; INFRARED-LASER; FIBER	Intense radiant heat pulses concomitantly activate A delta-and C-fiber skin nociceptors, and elicit a typical double sensation: an initial A delta-related pricking pain is followed by a C-related prolonged burning sensation. It has been repeatedly reported that C-fiber laser-evoked potentials (C-LEPs) become detectable only when the concomitant activation of A delta-fibers is avoided or reduced. Given that the saliency of the eliciting stimulus is a major determinant of LEPs, one explanation for these observations is that the saliency of the C-input is smaller than that of the preceding A delta-input. However, even if the saliency of the C-input is reduced because of the preceding A delta-input, a C-LEP should still be visible even when preceded by an A delta-LEP response. Here we tested this hypothesis by applying advanced signal processing techniques (peak alignment and time-frequency decomposition) to electroencephalographic data collected in two experiments conducted in 34 and 96 healthy participants. We show that, when using optimal stimulus parameters (delivering >80 stimuli within a small skin territory), C-LEPs can be reliably detected in most participants. Importantly, C-LEPs are observed even when preceded by A delta-LEPs, both in average waveforms and single trials. By providing quantitative information about several response properties of C-LEPs (latency jitter, stimulus-response and perception-response functions, dependency on stimulus repetitions and stimulated area), these results define optimal parameters to record C-LEPs simply and reliably. These findings have important clinical implications for assessing small-fiber function in neuropathies and neuropathic pain.	[Hu, L.; Cai, M.

Diagnostic specificity and familiality of early versus late evoked potentials to auditory paired stimuli across the schizophrenia-bipolar psychosis spectrum	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Psychopathological; EEG/ERP; Sensation/Perception; Genetics	FAMILY-HISTORY; DISORDER; P50; SCALE; ENDOPHENOTYPES; RELIABILITY; SUPPRESSION; RELATIVES; N100; HETEROGENEITY	Disrupted sensory processing is a core feature of psychotic disorders. Auditory paired stimuli (PS) evoke a complex neural response, but it is uncertain which aspects reflect shared and/or distinct liability for the most common severe psychoses, schizophrenia (SZ) and psychotic bipolar disorder (BDP). Evoked time-voltage/time-frequency domain responses quantified with EEG during a typical PS paradigm (S1-S2) were compared among proband groups (SZ [n = 232], BDP [181]), their relatives (SZrel [259], BDPrel [220]), and healthy participants (H [228]). Early S1-evoked responses were reduced in SZ and BDP, while later/S2 abnormalities showed SZ/SZrel and BDP/BDPrel specificity. Relatives' effects were absent/small despite significant familiality of the entire auditorineural response. This pattern suggests general and divergent biological pathways associated with psychosis, yet may reflect complications with conditioning solely on clinical phenomenology.

J	Sallard, E; Barral, J; Chavan, CF; Spierer, L				Sallard, Etienne; Barral, Jerome; Chavan, Camille F.; Spierer, Lucas			Early attentional processes distinguish selective from global motor inhibitory control: An electrical neuroimaging study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Inhibitory control; Selective inhibition; Electrical neuroimaging; EEG topography; Electrical sources	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; GO/NO-GO; NO-GO; BRAIN; STOP; TASK; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	The rapid stopping of specific parts of movements is frequently required in daily life. Yet, whether selective inhibitory control of movements is mediated by a specific neural pathway or by the combination between a global stopping of all ongoing motor activity followed by the re-initiation of task-relevant movements remains unclear. To address this question, we applied time-wise statistical analyses of the topography, global field power and electrical sources of the event-related potentials to the global vs selective inhibition stimuli presented during a Go/NoGo task. Participants (n = 18) had to respond as fast as possible with their two hands to Go stimuli and to withhold the response from the two hands (global inhibition condition, GNG) or from only one hand (selective inhibition condition, SNG) when specific NoGo stimuli were presented. Behaviorally, we replicated previous evidence for slower response times in the SNG than in the Go condition. Electrophysiologically, there were two distinct phases of event-related potentials modulations between the GNG and the SNG conditions. At 110-150 ms post-stimulus onset, there was a difference in the strength of the electric field without concomitant topographic modulation, indicating the differential engagement of statistically indistinguishable configurations of neural generators for selective and global inhibitory control. At 150-200 ms, there was topographic modulation, indicating the engagement of distinct brain networks. Source estimations localized these effects within bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital and within parieto-central networks, respectively. Our results suggest that while both types of motor inhibitory control depend on global stopping mechanisms, selective and global inhibition still differ quantitatively at early attention-related processing phases.

A second main question was related to the effect of personality traits, in terms of the Behavior Activation System (BAS), in emotional word recognition. We tested the role of the left DLPFC (LDLPFC) by performing a memory task in which old (previously encoded targets) and new (previously not encoded distractors) positive or negative emotional words had to be recognized. High-BAS and low-BAS subjects were compared when a repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied on the LDLPFC. We found significant differences between high-BAS vs. low-BAS subjects, with better performance for high-BAS in response to positive words. In parallel, an increased left cortical activity (alpha desynchronization) was observed for high-BAS in the case of positive words. Thus, we can conclude that the left approach-related hemisphere, underlying BAS, may support faster recognition of positive words. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel classification model based on independent component analysis (ICA) and Extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to detect lying. Firstly, ICA and its topography information were used to automatically identify the P300 ICs. Then, time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the reconstructed P3 waveforms. Finally, two classes of feature samples were used to train ELM, Back-propagation network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for comparison. The optimal number of P3 ICs and the values of classifier parameter were optimized by the cross-validation procedures. Experimental results show that the presented method (ICA_ELM) achieves the highest training accuracy of 95.40% with extremely less training and testing time on detecting P3 components for the guilty and the innocent subjects. The results indicate that the proposed method can be applied in lie detection.

Using high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG), brain activity was measured during an intentional inference task, which assesses rapid moral decision-making regarding intentional or unintentional harm to people and objects. We compared the responses to this task in a socially deprived group (DG) with that of a control group (CG). The event-related potentials (ERPs) results showed atypical early and late frontal cortical markers associated with attribution of intentionality during moral decision-making in DG (especially regarding intentional harm to people). The source space of the hdEEG showed reduced activity for DG compared with CG in the right prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and right insula. Moreover, the reduced response in vmPFC for DG was predicted by higher rates of externalizing problems. These findings demonstrate the importance of the social environment in early moral development, supporting a prefrontal maturation model of social deprivation.

J	Dalla Volta, R; Fabbri-Destro, M; Gentilucci, M; Avanzini, P				Dalla Volta, Riccardo; Fabbri-Destro, Maddalena; Gentilucci, Maurizio; Avanzini, Pietro			Spatiotemporal dynamics during processing of abstract and concrete verbs: An ERP study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Abstract verbs; Concrete verbs; High density EEG; ERPs; Embodied theory	MOTOR SYSTEM; ACTION WORDS; CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATIONS; DISTRIBUTED ACCOUNT; SEMANTIC SYSTEM; PARIETAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; PREMOTOR	Different accounts have been proposed to explain the nature of concept representations. Embodied accounts claim a key involvement of sensory-motor systems during semantic processing while more traditional accounts posit that concepts are abstract mental entities independent of perceptual and motor brain systems. While the involvement of sensory-motor areas in concrete language processing is supported by a large number of studies, this involvement is far from being established when considering abstract language. The present study addressed abstract and concrete verb processing, by investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of evoked responses by means of high density EEG while participants performed a semantic decision task. In addition, RTs to the same set of stimuli were collected. In both early and late time intervals, ERP scalp topography significantly differed according to word categories. Concrete verbs showed involvement of parieto-frontal networks for action, according to the implied body effector. In contrast, abstract verbs recruited mostly frontal regions outside the motor system, suggesting a non-motor semantic processing for this category. In addition, differently from what has been reported during action observation, the parietal recruitment related to concrete verbs presentation followed the frontal one. The present findings suggest that action word semantic is grounded in sensory-motor systems, provided a bodily effector is specified, while abstract concepts' representation cannot be easily explained by a motor embodiment.

Towards this aim, ten healthy human subjects performed delayed responses to visual targets presented at different spatial locations. Two tasks were attained, one in which the spatial location of the target was the goal for a pointing movement and one in which the spatial location of the target was used for a perceptual (yes or no) change detection. Each task involved two conditions: a memory condition in which the target remained visible only for the first 250 ms of the delay period and a delay condition in which the target location remained visible throughout the delay period. The amplitude spectrum analysis of the EEG revealed that the alpha (8-12 Hz) band signal was smaller, while the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz) band signals were larger in the memory compared to the non-memory condition. The alpha band signal difference was confined to the frontal midline area; the beta band signal difference extended over the right hemisphere and midline central area, and the gamma band signal difference was confined to the right occipitoparietal area. Importantly, both in beta and gamma bands, we observed a significant increase in the movement-related compared to the perceptual-related memory-specific amplitude spectrum signal in the central midline area. This result provides clear evidence for the dissociation of motor and perceptual spatial working memory.

Speech comprehension thus entails detecting and replacing missing information based on predictive and restorative neural mechanisms. The present study targets predictive mechanisms by investigating the influence of a speech segment's predictability on early, modality-specific electrophysiological responses to this segment's omission. Predictability was manipulated in simple physical terms in a single-word framework (Experiment 1) or in more complex semantic terms in a sentence framework (Experiment 2). In both experiments, final consonants of the German words Lachs ([laks], salmon) or Latz ([lats], bib) were occasionally omitted, resulting in the syllable La ([lab no semantic meaning), while brain responses were measured with multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG). In both experiments, the occasional presentation of the fragment La elicited a larger omission response when the final speech segment had been predictable. The omission response occurred similar to 125-165 msec after the expected onset of the final segment and showed characteristics of the omission mismatch negativity (MMN), with generators in auditory cortical areas. Suggestive of a general auditory predictive mechanism at work, this main observation was robust against varying source of predictive information or attentional allocation, differing between the two experiments. Source localization further suggested the omission response enhancement by predictability to emerge from left superior temporal gyrus and left angular gyrus in both experiments, with additional experiment-specific contributions. These results are consistent with the existence of predictive coding mechanisms in the central auditory system, and suggestive of the general predictive properties of the auditory system to support spoken word recognition.

We tested whether this negative finding holds when the chosen outcome has an objective value of zero and therefore a comparison with the unchosen outcome is needed to identify overall choice valence. Participants completed a gambling task in which chosen and unchosen options could result in monetary wins, losses, or breaking even. Results show that the FRN does not reflect local favorableness but rather a dichotomy of gain versus no-gain for both chosen and unchosen outcomes. In contrast, P300 amplitude appears to reflect motivational salience derived from counterfactual comparisons of chosen and unchosen outcomes. Based on our and prior findings, we propose a threefold taxonomy of contextual factors and their relation to the FRN.

J	Van Roon, P; Zakizadeh, J; Chartier, S				Van Roon, Patricia; Zakizadeh, Jila; Chartier, Sylvain			Partial Least Squares tutorial for analyzing neuroimaging data	QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						partial least squares; PLS; regression; correlation; Mathematica; NIPALS		Partial least squares (PLS) has become a respected and meaningful soft modeling analysis technique that can be applied to very large datasets where the number of factors or variables is greater than the number of observations. Current biometric studies (e.g., eye movements, EKG, body movements, EEG) are often of this nature. PLS eliminates the multiple linear regression issues of over-fitting data by finding a few underlying or latent variables (factors) that account for most of the variation in the data. In real-world applications, where linear models do not always apply, PLS can model the non-linear relationship well. This tutorial introduces two PLS methods, PLS Correlation (PLSC) and PLS Regression (PLSR) and their applications in data analysis which are illustrated with neuroimaging examples. Both methods provide straightforward and comprehensible techniques for determining and modeling relationships between two multivariate data blocks by finding latent variables that best describe the relationships. In the examples, the PLSC will analyze the relationship between neuroimaging data such as Event-Related Potential (ERP) amplitude averages from different locations on the scalp with their corresponding behavioural data. Using the same data, the PLSR will be used to model the relationship between neuroimaging and behavioural data. This model will be able to predict future behaviour solely from available neuroimaging data. To find latent variables, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for PLSC and Non-linear Iterative PArtial Least Squares (NIPALS) for PLSR are implemented in this tutorial. SVD decomposes the large data block into three manageable matrices containing a diagonal set of singular values, as well as left and right singular vectors. For PLSR, NIPALS algorithms are used because they provide a more precise estimation of the latent variables. Mathematica notebooks are provided for each PLS method with clearly labeled sections and subsections. The notebook examples show the entire process and the results are reported in the Section 3 Examples.

J	Nguyen, VT; Breakspear, M; Cunnington, R				Nguyen, Vinh T.; Breakspear, Michael; Cunnington, Ross			Fusing concurrent EEG-fMRI with dynamic causal modeling: Application to effective connectivity during face perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Concurrent EEG-fMRI; Multimodal neuroimaging; Face processing; Effective connectivity; Dynamic causal modeling	HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INVERTED FACES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX ACTIVATION; FUSIFORM CORTEX; TEMPORAL CORTEX; INVERSION; N170	Despite the wealth of research on face perception, the interactions between core regions in the face-sensitive network of the visual cortex are not well understood. In particular, the link between neural activity in face-sensitive brain regions measured by fMRI and EEG markers of face-selective processing in the N170 component is not well established. In this study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) as a data fusion approach to integrate concurrently acquired EEG and fMRI data during the perception of upright compared with inverted faces. Data features derived from single-trial EEG variability were used as contextual modulators on fMRI-derived estimates of effective connectivity between key regions of the face perception network. The overall construction of our model space was highly constrained by the effects of task and ERP parameters on our fMRI data. Bayesian model selection suggested that the occipital face area (OFA) acted as a central gatekeeper directing visual information to the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the fusiform face area (FFA), and to a medial region of the fusiform gyrus (mFG). The connection from the OFA to the STS was strengthened on trials in which N170 amplitudes to upright faces were large. In contrast, the connection from the OFA to the mFG, an area known to be involved in object processing, was enhanced for inverted faces particularly on trials in which N170 amplitudes were small. Our results suggest that trial-by-trial variation in neural activity at around 170 ms, reflected in the N170 component, reflects the relative engagement of the OFA to STS/FFA network over the OFA to mFG object processing network for face perception. Importantly, the DCMs predicted the observed data significantly better by including the modulators derived from the N170, highlighting the value of incorporating EEG-derived information to explain interactions between regions as a multi-modal data fusion method for combined EEG-fMRI.

In addition, top-down modulation of visual processing has previously been demonstrated during cognitive operations including selective attention and working memory tasks. In the absence of a stable gravitational reference, the updating of salient stimuli becomes crucial for successful visuo-spatial behavior by humans in weightlessness. Here we found that visually-evoked potentials triggered by the image of a tunnel just prior to an impending 3D movement in a virtual navigation task were altered in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station, while those evoked by a classical 2D-checkerboard were not. Specifically, the analysis of event-related spectral perturbations and inter-trial phase coherency of these EEG signals recorded in the frontal and occipital areas showed that phase-locking of theta-alpha oscillations was suppressed in weightlessness, but only for the 3D tunnel image. Moreover, analysis of the phase of the coherency demonstrated the existence on Earth of a directional flux in the EEG signals from the frontal to the occipital areas mediating a top-down modulation during the presentation of the image of the 3D tunnel. In weightlessness, this fronto-occipital, top-down control was transformed into a diverging flux from the central areas toward the frontal and occipital areas. These results demonstrate that gravity-related sensory inputs modulate primary visual areas depending on the affordances of the visual scene.

We propose a new hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system that integrates two different EEG tasks: tactile selective attention (TSA) using a vibro-tactile stimulator on the left/right finger and motor imagery (MI) of left/right hand movement. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) from the MI task and steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) from the TSA task are retrieved and combined into two hybrid senses. Approach. One hybrid approach is to measure two tasks simultaneously; the features of each task are combined for testing. Another hybrid approach is to measure two tasks consecutively (TSA first and MI next) using only MI features. For comparison with the hybrid approaches, the TSA and MI tasks are measured independently. Main results. Using a total of 16 subject datasets, we analyzed the BCI classification performance for MI, TSA and two hybrid approaches in a comparative manner; we found that the consecutive hybrid approach outperformed the others, yielding about a 10% improvement in classification accuracy relative to MI alone. It is understood that TSA may play a crucial role as a prestimulus in that it helps to generate earlier ERD prior to MI and thus sustains ERD longer and to a stronger degree; this ERD may give more discriminative information than ERD in MI alone. Significance. Overall, our proposed consecutive hybrid approach is very promising for the development of advanced BCI systems.

Methods: Electroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties. Results: Perception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices. For local analysis, efficiency was more discernible than clustering coefficient. Nevertheless, there was no significant discrimination between Chinese traditional and western classical music perception. Conclusions: Perception of different styles of music introduces different network properties, both globally and locally. Research into both global and local network properties has been carried out in other areas; however, this is a preliminary investigation aimed at suggesting a possible new approach to brain network properties in music perception.

J	Matsumoto, A; Kakigi, R				Matsumoto, Atsushi; Kakigi, Ryusuke			Subliminal Semantic Priming Changes the Dynamic Causal Influence between the Left Frontal and Temporal Cortex	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; PROCESSING EVIDENCE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; REPETITION; EEG; REPRESENTATION	Recent neuroimaging experiments have revealed that subliminal priming of a target stimulus leads to the reduction of neural activity in specific regions concerned with processing the target. Such findings lead to questions about the degree to which the subliminal priming effect is based only on decreased activity in specific local brain regions, as opposed to the influence of neural mechanisms that regulate communication between brain regions. To address this question, this study recorded EEG during performance of a subliminal semantic priming task. We adopted an information-based approach that used independent component analysis and multivariate autoregressive modeling. Results indicated that subliminal semantic priming caused significant modulation of alpha band activity in the left inferior frontal cortex and modulation of gamma band activity in the left inferior temporal regions. The multivariate autoregressive approach confirmed significant increases in information flow from the inferior frontal cortex to inferior temporal regions in the early time window that was induced by subliminal priming. In the later time window, significant enhancement of bidirectional causal flow between these two regions underlying subliminal priming was observed. Results suggest that unconscious processing of words influences not only local activity of individual brain regions but also the dynamics of neural communication between those regions.

In the present follow-up study we investigated whether a single-trial P300 response can be reliably measured with this system, while subjects freely walk outdoors. Twenty healthy participants performed a three-class auditory oddball task, which included rare target and non-target distractor stimuli presented with equal probabilities of 16%. Data were recorded in a seated (control condition) and in a walking condition, both of which were realized outdoors. A significantly larger P300 event-related potential amplitude was evident for targets compared to distractors (p < .001), but no significant interaction with recording condition emerged. P300 single-trial analysis was performed with regularized stepwise linear discriminant analysis and revealed above chance-level classification accuracies for most participants (19 out of 20 for the seated, 16 out of 20 for the walking condition), with mean classification accuracies of 71% (seated) and 64% (walking). Moreover, the resulting information transfer rates for the seated and walking conditions were comparable to a recently published laboratory auditory brain-computer interface (BC!) study. This leads us to conclude that a truly mobile auditory BCI system is feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current study aimed to investigate auditory change detection in children with ASD in order to determine event-related potentials to meaningless and meaningful speech stimuli. 11 high functioning boys with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (mean age = 13.0; SD = 1.08) and 11 typically developing boys (mean age = 13.7; SD = 1.5) participated in a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm. Results revealed that compared to TD controls, the children with ASD showed significantly reduced MMN responses to both words and pseudowords in the frontal regions of the brain and also a significant reduction in their activation for words in the Central Parietal regions. In order to test the relationship between sensory processing and auditory processing, children completed the Adult and Adolescent Sensory Profile. As predicted, the children with ASD showed more extreme sensory behaviours and were significantly higher than their typically developing controls across three of the sensory quadrants (sensory sensitivity, low registration and sensory avoidance). Importantly, only auditory sensory sensitivity was able to account for the differences displayed for words in the frontal and central parietal regions when controlling for the effect of group, revealing an inverse relationship of the higher sensory sensitivity scores the less activation in response for words. We discuss how the expression of sensory behaviours in ASD may result in deficient neurophysiological mechanisms underlying automatic language processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

If these activities are well organized and supported by a suitable infrastructure, work efficiency of researchers increases significantly. This article deals with the main concepts, design, and development of software and hardware infrastructure for research in electrophysiology. The described infrastructure has been primarily developed for the needs of neuroinformatics laboratory at the University of West Bohemia, the Czech Republic. However, from the beginning it has been also designed and developed to be open and applicable in laboratories that do similar research. After introducing the laboratory and the whole architectural concept the individual parts of the infrastructure are described. The central element of the software infrastructure is a web-based portal that enables community researchers to store, share, download and search data and metadata from electrophysiological experiments. The data model, domain ontology and usage of semantic web languages and technologies are described. Current data publication policy used in the portal is briefly introduced. The registration of the portal within Neuroscience Information Framework is described. Then the methods used for processing of electrophysiological signals are presented. The specific modifications of these methods introduced by laboratory researches are summarized; the methods are organized into a laboratory workflow. Other parts of the software infrastructure include mobile and offline solutions for data/metadata storing and a hardware stimulator communicating with an EEG amplifier and recording software.

Early modality-specific sornatosensory cortical regions are modulated by attended visual stimuli: interaction of vision, touch, and behavioral intent	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERPs); attention; crossmodal; visual; tactile; somatosensory cortex; sensori-motor integration	SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUSTAINED SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INTERSENSORY FACILITATION; CROSSMODAL INFLUENCES; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; TASK-RELEVANCE; REACTION-TIME	Bimodal interactions between relevant visual and tactile inputs can facilitate attentional modulation at early stages in somatosensory cortices to achieve goal-oriented behaviors. However, the specific contribution of each sensory system during attentional processing and, importantly, how these interact with the required behavioral motor goals remains unclear. Here we used electroencephalography and event-related potentials (ERPs) to test the hypothesis that activity from modality-specific somatosensory cortical regions would be enhanced with task-relevant bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli and that the degree of modulation would depend on the difficulty of the associated sensory-motor task demands. Tactile stimuli were discrete vibrations to the index finger and visual stimuli were horizontal bars on a computer screen, both with random amplitudes. Streams of unimodal (tactile) and crossmodal (visual and tactile) stimuli were randomly presented and participants were instructed to attend to one type of stimulus (unimodal or crossmodal) and responses involved either an indication of the presence of an attended stimulus (detect), or the integration and summation of two stimulus amplitudes using a pressure-sensitive ball (grade). Force-amplitude associations were learned in a training session, and no feedback was provided during the task. ERPs were time-locked to tactile stimuli and extracted for early modality-specific components (P50, P100, N140). The P50 was enhanced with bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli that were attended to. This was maximal when the motor requirements involved integration of the two stimuli in the grade task and when the visual stimulus occurred before (100 ms) the tactile stimulus. These results suggest that visual information relevant for movement modulates somatosensory processing as early as the primary somatosensory cortex (51) and that the motor behavioral context influences this likely through interaction of top-down attentional and motor preparatory systems with more bottom-up crossmodal influences.

The children performed a task repeatedly (single-trial blocks) or switched between two different tasks (mixed-trial blocks). Intellectually gifted children performed quicker than the average group for both mixed and single-trial blocks. The electroencephalography P300 amplitude was larger in the mixed compared to the single-trial condition, but this effect was observed only in the gifted children. The results support the notion that gifted children are characterized by a faster maturation that leads to an 'adultlike' brain activity.

Combat veterans with PTSD after mild TBI exhibit greater ERPs from posterior-medial cortical areas while appraising facial features	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						PTSD; Mild TBI; N300; Posterior cingulate cortex; Precuneus; Biomarker	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CONCUSSED INDIVIDUALS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; TIME-COURSE; DEPRESSION; EMOTION	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) worsens prognosis following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Combat personnel with histories of mTBI exhibit abnormal activation of distributed brain networks including emotion processing and default mode networks. How developing PTSD further affects these abnormalities has not been directly examined. We recorded electroencephalography in combat veterans with histories of mTBI, but without active PTSD (mTBI only, n=16) and combat veterans who developed PTSD after mTBI (mTBI + PTSD, n = 16) during the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a validated test of empathy requiring emotional appraisal of facial features. Task-related event related potentials (ERPs) were identified, decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA) and localized anatomically using dipole modeling. We observed larger emotional face processing ERPs in veterans with mTBI + PTSD, including greater N300 negativity. Furthermore, greater N300 negativity correlated with greater PTSD severity, especially avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal symptom clusters. This correlation was dependent on contributions from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Our results support a model where, in combat veterans with histories of mTBI, larger ERPs from overactive posterior-medial cortical areas may be specific to PTSD, and is likely related to negative selfreferential activits.

This pre/post within-groups study utilized the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) to measure residual effects in the brain after 20 minutes of drawing. EEG recordings were conducted before and after participants (N = 10; 6 artists and 4 non-artists) created a drawing in oil pastels. Results showed a statistical difference (p < .05) pre- and post-drawing among artists in the left posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital regions within the alpha frequency band. For the non-artists, differences in alpha were recorded in the right parietal and right prefrontal areas. There were no significant findings between the groups. Results suggest that alpha rhythm may play an important role in drawing. Because alpha rhythm is associated with self-regulation, relaxation, memory, visual processing, intelligence, and creativity, this finding has useful implications for art therapy. The application of qEEG methodology with art therapy may help assess and further refine clinical treatment.

Neural processing of facial expressions of emotion in first onset psychosis	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						ERPs; Neural activation; Schizophrenia; EEG; BRAINnet	AFFECT RECOGNITION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTION; FEAR; METAANALYSIS; INTEGRATION; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS; DISORDERS; ATTENTION	Schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in face and facial emotion processing. This is the first study using event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the corresponding neural activation in first onset psychosis. ERPs for 108 first onset psychosis participants and 108 matched healthy controls were recorded while they viewed facial expressions. Group differences on general (neutral) face processing and emotional valence were examined under both unmasked (conscious) and backward-masked (nonconscious implicit) conditions over frontal and temporo-occipital regions. Clinical significance was assessed by comparing diagnoses and correlating ERPs with symptoms. During general face processing, patients showed reduced activation within 70 ms and exaggerated later processing from 160 ms over the frontal region, with a negative shift in voltage over left temporal and occipital regions across the time course. In addition, from 70 ms onwards, patients showed a positive shift in voltage for disgust whereas controls showed a negative shift in voltage for fear and anger (both compared to happy) over temporo-occipital regions. Effects were related to disorganization and depression symptoms and (preliminarily) were apparent across psychotic diagnoses. These results suggest that first onset psychosis is characterized by general as well as emotion-specific face processing impairments from the earliest, automatic processing period.

Materials and Methods: We studied 81 consecutive patients admitted to intensive care unit with diagnosis of severe head injury. All patients underwent neurophysiological assessment with SEPs and electroencephalography within the first 6 days after trauma. The marginal effect of each variable on Glasgow Outcome Scale score was evaluated by using univariate measures of association. We fit a cumulative logit model by maximum likelihood, and the partial effect of each variable was assessed by likelihood ratio test. We performed variable selection by forward stepwise, according to the Akaike information criterion. Results: Our final cumulative logit model including SEPs primary complex (pN20/fP20/cP22), SEPs middle latency (N30/P45/N60), and CT scan hypodensity values showed a significantly increased predictive power of Glasgow Outcome Scale, compared with pN20 alone (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant (P < 0.0001) improvement in outcome prediction when the model includes a pool of amplitudes and latencies referred to different early-evoked components pN20, pP25, fP20, cP22, N30, P45, and N60, associated to CT scan hypodensity values, compared with the use of the cortical parietal N20/P25 alone.

In the dual rapid serial visual presentation task, two targets (T1 and T2) occur among two different visual streams, rapidly presented left and right. We replaced the standard letter distractors in one stream by "easy symbols" (ESy; easily distinguished from targets), to facilitate T1 identification. If interhemispheric inhibition is deployed and released, this facilitation of one hemisphere's task should reduce its inhibitory effect on the other hemisphere, leading to improved T2 identification by the other hemisphere. This prediction was confirmed in three experiments. Furthermore, event-related EEG potentials did not only show a constant bias of allocated attention between ESy and standard streams, with letters evoking visual potentials earlier than ESy, but also short-term enlargement of this effect in the pair of distractors that followed TI. Taken together, these results support the notion of interhemispheric inhibition in visuospatial attention. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basic visual dysfunction allows classification of patients with schizophrenia with exceptional accuracy	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Biomarker; VEP; Spectral resolution; EEG; LORETA	SENSORY PROCESSING DEFICITS; FREQUENCY BAND RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MOTION PERCEPTION; EVOKED POTENTIALS; PERFORMANCE; BIOMARKERS; RECOGNITION; GENERATION	Basic visual dysfunctions are commonly reported in schizophrenia; however their value as diagnostic tools remains uncertain. This study reports a novel electrophysiological approach using checkerboard visual evoked potentials (VEP). Sources of spectral resolution VEP-components C1, P1 and N1 were estimated by LORETA, and the band-effects (BSE) on these estimated sources were explored in each subject. BSEs were Z-transformed for each component and relationships with clinical variables were assessed. Clinical effects were evaluated by ROC-curves and predictive values. Forty-eight patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 55 healthy controls participated in the study. For each of the 48 patients, the three VEP components were localized to both dorsal and ventral brain areas and also deviated from a normal distribution. P1 and N1 deviations were independent of treatment, illness chronicity or gender. Results from LORETA also suggest that deficits in thalamus, posterior cingulum, precuneus, superior parietal and medial occipitotemporal areas were associated with symptom severity. While positive symptoms were more strongly related to sensory processing deficits (P1), negative symptoms were more strongly related to perceptual processing dysfunction (N1). Clinical validation revealed positive and negative predictive values for correctly classifying SZ of 100% and 77%, respectively. Classification in an additional independent sample of 30 SZ corroborated these results. In summary, this novel approach revealed basic visual dysfunctions in all patients with schizophrenia, suggesting these visual dysfunctions represent a promising candidate as a biomarker for schizophrenia.

In this study, we used a probabilistic learning task and explored whether positive mood could alter the way positive versus negative feedback was used to guide learning. This process was characterized both at the behavioral and electro-encephalographic levels. Thirty two participants were randomly allocated either to a positive or a neutral (control) mood condition. Behavioral results showed that while learning performance was balanced between the two groups, participants in the positive mood group had a higher learning rate than participants in the neutral mood group. At the electrophysiological level, we found that positive mood increased the error-related negativity when the stimulus-response associations were deterministic, selectively (as opposed to random or probabilistic). However, it did not influence the feedback-related negativity. These new findings are discussed in terms of an enhanced internal reward prediction error signal after the induction of positive mood when the probability of getting a reward is high.

While some studies have emphasized the spatial differentiation of processing into discrete areas, others have emphasized the overlap of processing and the importance of distributed patterns of activity. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from subdural electrodes provides excellent temporal and spatial resolution of local neural activity, and thus provides an alternative method to fMRI for studying differences and commonalities in face and body processing. In this study we recorded iEEG from 12 patients while they viewed images of novel faces, isolated eyes, headless bodies, and flowers. Event-related potential analysis identified 69 occipitotemporal sites at which there was a face-, eye-, or body-selective response when contrasted to flowers. However, when comparing faces, eyes, and bodies to each other at these sites, we identified only 3 face-specific, 13 eye-specific, and 1 body-specific electrodes. Thus, at the majority of sites, faces, eyes, and bodies evoked similar responses. However, we identified ten locations at which the amplitude of the responses spatially varied across adjacent electrodes, indicating that the configuration of current sources and sinks were different for faces, eyes, and bodies. Our results also demonstrate that eye-sensitive regions are more abundant and more purely selective than face- or body-sensitive regions, particularly in lateral occipitotemporal cortex.

We combined data from four separate cognitive tasks and 64 subjects in which EEG and EMG (muscle activity from the thumb used to respond) were recorded. In typical neuroscience experiments, behavioral responses are classified as "error" or "correct"; however, closer inspection of our data revealed that correct responses were often accompanied by "partial errors" a muscle twitch of the incorrect hand ("mixed correct trials,"similar to 13% of the trials). We found that these muscle twitches dissociated conflicts from errors in time-frequency domain analyses of EEG data. In particular, both mixed-correct trials and full error trials were associated with enhanced theta-band power (4-9 Hz) compared to correct trials. However, full errors were additionally associated with power and frontal-parietal synchrony in the delta band. Single-trial robust multiple regression analyses revealed a significant modulation of theta power as a function of partial error correction time, thus linking trial-to-trial fluctuations in power to conflict. Furthermore, single-trial correlation analyses revealed a qualitative dissociation between conflict and error processing, such that mixed correct trials were associated with positive theta-RT correlations whereas full error trials were associated with negative delta-RT correlations. These findings shed new light on the local and global network mechanisms of conflict monitoring and error detection, and their relationship to online action adjustment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS			English	Article						auditory steady-state response; ASSR; menstrual cycle; estrogen; time-frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; EEG; BRAIN; WOMEN; MODULATION; ESTRADIOL; STEROIDS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STIMULATION	Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are widely applied to test brain's ability to follow external stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders. It is known that ASSRs are related to GABAergic transmission. Female sex steroid homones - both estrogens and progesterone affect functioning of GABAergic system. However, it is not known how these hormones affect brain's ability to entrain. This study was designed to test the ability to synchronize to 40 Hz stimulation during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-eight healthy females participated in the research during one of the menstrual cycle phases: (1) early follicular; (2) late follicular; (3) and mid-luteal. Auditory 40 Hz trains of 500 ms were delivered binaurally and EEG was recorded. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. Additionally, alpha power of the baseline period was calculated. Parameters of ASSR were increasing in a linear manner with increasing levels of 17 beta-estradiol and largest estimates of ASSR parameters were obtained in the late follicular phase, smallest in the mid-luteal phase. Alpha power values were highest in the late follicular phase and lowest in the mid-luteal phase, pointing to lower arousal level in the late follicular phase. We speculate that increased 40 Hz ASSRs during mid-cycle might be related to the level of general arousal and specific GABA-mediated changes during the menstrual cycle. The results suggest that the ability to entrain to 40 Hz stimulation depends on the phase of menstrual cycle. This should be taken into account, particularly when ASSRs are used in clinical practice, comparing patients and healthy subjects.

In humans, deviance detection based on acoustic regularity encoding has been associated with a brain response derived from the human EEG, the mismatch negativity (MMN) auditory evoked potential, peaking at about 100-200 ms from deviance onset. By its long latency and cerebral generators, the cortical nature of both the processes of regularity encoding and deviance detection has been assumed. Yet, intracellular, extracellular, single-unit and local-field potential recordings in rats and cats have shown much earlier (circa 20-30 ms) and hierarchically lower (primary auditory cortex, medial geniculate body, inferior colliculus) deviance-related responses. Here, we review the recent evidence obtained with the complex auditory brainstem response (cABR), the middle latency response (MLR) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) demonstrating that human auditory deviance detection based on regularity encoding-rather than on refractoriness-occurs at latencies and in neural networks comparable to those revealed in animals. Specifically, encoding of simple acoustic-feature regularities and detection of corresponding deviance, such as an infrequent change in frequency or location, occur in the latency range of the MLR, in separate auditory cortical regions from those generating the MMN, and even at the level of human auditory brainstem. In contrast, violations of more complex regularities, such as those defined by the alternation of two different tones or by feature conjunctions (i.e., frequency and location) fail to elicit MLR correlates but elicit sizable MMNs. Altogether, these findings support the emerging view that deviance detection is a basic principle of the functional organization of the auditory system, and that regularity encoding and deviance detection is organized in ascending levels of complexity along the auditory pathway expanding from the brainstem up to higher-order areas of the cerebral cortex.

The effect of the augmentation of cholinergic neurotransmission by nicotine on EEG indices of visuospatial attention	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Acetylcholine; Attention; Orienting; Bias; Disengagement; EEG	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HEALTHY NONSMOKERS; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; MODULATION	The cholinergic system has been implicated in visuospatial attention but the exact role remains unclear. In visuospatial attention, bias refers to neuronal signals that modulate the sensitivity of sensory cortex, while disengagement refers to the decoupling of attention making reorienting possible. In the current study we investigated the effect of facilitating cholinergic neurotransmission by nicotine (Nicorette Freshmint 2 mg, polacrilex chewing gum) on behavioral and electrophysiological indices of bias and disengagement. Sixteen non-smoking participants performed in a Visual Spatial Cueing (VSC) task while EEG was recorded. A randomized, single-blind, crossover design was implemented. Based on the scarce literature, it was expected that nicotine would specifically augment disengagement related processing, especially manifest as an increase of the modulation of the Late Positive Deflection (LPD) by validity of cueing. No effect was expected on bias related components (cue-locked: EDAN, LDAP; target-locked: P1 and N1 modulations). Results show weak indications for a reduction of the reaction time validity effect by nicotine, but only for half of the sample in which the validity effect on the pretest was largest. Nicotine reduced the result of bias as indexed by a reduced P1 modulation by validity, especially in subjects with strong peripheral responses to nicotine. Nicotine did not affect ERP manifestations of the directing of bias (EDAN, LDAP) or disengagement (LPD). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Logemann, H. N. A.; Kenemans, J.

The central idea behind DCM is to treat the brain as a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system that is subject to inputs, and produces outputs. DCM for EEG uses neural mass model to explain source activity and to build a forward model that predicts scalp-recorded response, based on a particular underlying network structure. Further analysis is done by selecting, using the Bayesian inference, among the competing hypotheses (models) the one that is best to explain the data. We used DCM approach to find a plausible model for ERPs recorded for standard and deviant stimuli in visual oddball task, and to evaluate the reproducibility of this model over a set of individual recordings. The model that best explained the data and gave reproducible results was the one that allowed the changes in strength of forward connections. These results are compatible with the DCM for auditory oddball experiment by other authors.	[Sharaev, M. G.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Sharaev, M.

Corticomuscular coherence can be used to examine the functional coupling or communication between human brain and muscles. To investigate the effects of grip force level on corticomuscular coherence in an accessory muscle, this study proposed an expanded support vector regression (ESVR) algorithm to quantify the coherence between electroencephalogram (EEG) from sensorimotor cortex and surface electromyogram (EMG) from brachioradialis in upper limb. A measure called coherence proportion was introduced to compare the corticomuscular coherence in the alpha (7-15Hz), beta (15-30Hz) and gamma (30-45Hz) band at 25 % maximum grip force (MGF) and 75 % MGF. Results show that ESVR could reduce the influence of deflected signals and summarize the overall behavior of multiple coherence curves. Coherence proportion is more sensitive to grip force level than coherence area. The significantly higher corticomuscular coherence occurred in the alpha (p < 0.01) and beta band (p < 0.01) during 75 % MGF, but in the gamma band (p < 0.01) during 25 % MGF. The results suggest that sensorimotor cortex might control the activity of an accessory muscle for hand grip with increased grip intensity by changing functional corticomuscular coupling at certain frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma bands).

These functions are important in daily life and are mediated by various cognitive subprocesses. However, it is unknown if stress affects the whole processing cascade, or exerts specific effects on a restricted subset of processes involved in the chaining of actions. We examine the effects of stress on action selection processes in a stop-change paradigm and apply event-related potentials (ERPs) combined with source localization analysis to examine potentially restricted effects of stress on subprocesses mediating action cascading. The results show that attentional selection processes, as well as processes related to allocation of processing resources were not affected by stress. Stress only seems to affect response selection functions during action cascading and leads to slowing of responses when two actions are executed in succession. These changes are related to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Changes in response selection were predictable on the basis of individual salivary cortisol levels. The results show that stress does not affect the whole processing cascade involved in the cascading of different actions, but seems to exert circumscribed effects on response selection processes which have previously been shown to depend on dopaminergic neural transmission.

Participants attended to one or both hands to perform a target detection task while concurrent mechanical vibrations were presented for 4500 ms to both hands in two recording sessions. Results revealed that the amplitude and the attentional modulation of SSSEPs had high test-retest reliability, while the test-retest reliability for the N140 component was low. SSSEPs for stimuli with focused and divided attention had about the same amplitude. For the N140 component only the stimuli with focused attention were significantly enhanced. We found greater habituation effects for the N140 compared to SSSEP amplitudes but attentional modulation was unaffected in both signals.

Mental workload was experimentally manipulated with dichotic listening tasks. Medium and high workload conditions alternated. Behavioral measures confirmed that the manipulation of mental workload was successful. Reduced P300 amplitude was found for the high workload condition. Along with lower performance and an increase in the subjective level of fatigue, an increase of power in the alpha band was found for the last as compared to the first run of both conditions. The study confirms that a combination of signals derived from the time and frequency domain of the electroencephalogram is promising for the online detection of workload and fatigue. It also demonstrates that satisfactory accuracies can be achieved by healthy participants with the P300 speller, despite constant distraction and when pursuing the task for a long time.

Biological Motion Coding in the Brain: Analysis of Visually Driven EEG Functional Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; RECOGNIZING GENDER; PERCEPTION; PREMOTOR; AREAS; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; MODULATION; EFFICIENCY	Herein, we address the time evolution of brain functional networks computed from electroencephalographic activity driven by visual stimuli. We describe how these functional network signatures change in fast scale when confronted with point-light display stimuli depicting biological motion (BM) as opposed to scrambled motion (SM). Whereas global network measures (average path length, average clustering coefficient, and average betweenness) computed as a function of time did not discriminate between BM and SM, local node properties did. Comparing the network local measures of the BM condition with those of the SM condition, we found higher degree and betweenness values in the left frontal (F7) electrode, as well as a higher clustering coefficient in the right occipital (O2) electrode, for the SM condition. Conversely, for the BM condition, we found higher degree values in central parietal (Pz) electrode and a higher clustering coefficient in the left parietal (P3) electrode. These results are discussed in the context of the brain networks involved in encoding BM versus SM.

As a result, electroencephalographic recordings are often significantly distorted and their interpretation becomes problematic. The electrooculograph is a signal captured around the eye region viz. vertical electrooculograph and horizontal electrooculograph. Since the electrooculogaph is captured close to the eye than the electroencephalograph, it can be presumed that the eye blink effects are stronger in electrooculogaph than in electroencephalograph. In this paper we propose a new technique for artifact correction. Correlation between the electrooculograph signal and electroencephalograph signal is exploited. In this method empirical mode decomposition is used to generate the intrinsic mode functions. The correlation between the electrooculograph signal and the intrinsic mode functions is obtained. The intrinsic mode functions with high correlation and the intrinsic mode functions generated thereafter are eliminated. Rests of the intrinsic mode functions are recombined to form electroencephalograph signal with mitigated effects of ocular artifacts.	[Keshava, Murthy G.

However, those BCI systems cannot implement the wheelchair navigation flexibly and effectively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid BCI scheme based on two-class MI and four-class SSVEP tasks. It cannot only provide multi- degree control for its user, but also allow the user implement the different types of commands in parallel. In order for the subject to learn the hybrid mental strategies effectively, we design a visual and auditory cues and feedback-based training paradigm. Furthermore, an algorithm based on entropy of classification probabilities is proposed to detect intentional control (IC) state for hybrid tasks, and ensure that multi-degree control commands are accurately and quickly generated. The experiment results attest to the efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid BCI for wheelchair control in the real- world.

Fifteen severely impaired subjects participated in the study. The developed tool allows users to interact with their usual environment fulfilling their main needs. It allows for navigation through ten menus and to manage up to 113 control commands from eight electronic devices. Ten out of the fifteen subjects were able to operate the proposed tool with accuracy above 77 %. Eight out of them reached accuracies higher than 95 %. Moreover, bitrates up to 20.1 bit/min were achieved. The novelty of this study lies in the use of an environment control application in a real scenario: real devices managed by potential BCI end-users. Although impaired users might not be able to set up this system without aid of others, this study takes a significant step to evaluate the degree to which such populations could eventually operate a stand-alone system. Our results suggest that neither the type nor the degree of disability is a relevant issue to suitably operate a P300-based BCI. Hence, it could be useful to assist disabled people at home improving their personal autonomy.

Despite the relevance of inhibition in everyday situations, current models of inhibition are rather simplistic and provide little generalizability especially in the face of clinical disorders. Thus, given the importance of inhibition for proper cognitive functioning, the need for a paradigm, which incorporates factors that will subsequently improve the current model for understanding inhibition, is of high demand. A popular paradigm used to assess motor inhibition, the stop signal paradigm, can be modified to further advance the current conceptual model of inhibitory control and thus provide a basis for better understanding different facets of inhibition. Namely, in this study, we have developed a novel version of the stop-signal task to assess how preparation (that is, whether reactive or proactive) and selectivity of the stopping behavior effect well-known time-frequency characteristics associated with successful inhibition and concomitant behavioral measures. With this innovative paradigm, we demonstrate that the selective nature of the stopping task modulates theta and motoric beta activity and we further provide the first account of delta activity as an electrophysiological feature sensitive to both manipulations of selectivity and preparatory control.

Neuroimaging of Mobility in Aging: A Targeted Review	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Cognition; Neuroimaging; Gait; Balance; Brain aging	WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; FUNCTIONING OLDER-ADULTS; STRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC DENERVATION; NORMAL-PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM ATROPHY; SMALL VESSEL DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAIT SPEED; WALKING SPEED	Background. The relationship between mobility and cognition in aging is well established, but the relationship between mobility and the structure and function of the aging brain is relatively unknown. This, in part, is attributed to the technological limitations of most neuroimaging procedures, which require the individual to be immobile or in a supine position. Herein, we provide a targeted review of neuroimaging studies of mobility in aging to promote (i) a better understanding of this relationship, (ii) future research in this area, and (iii) development of applications for improving mobility. Methods. A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was performed using PubMed. Search terms included (i) aging, older adults, or elderly; (ii) gait, walking, balance, or mobility; and (iii) magnetic resonance imaging, voxel-based morphometry, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, event-related potential, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results. Poor mobility outcomes were reliably associated with reduced gray and white matter volume. Fewer studies examined the relationship between changes in task-related brain activation and mobility performance. Extant findings, however, showed that activation patterns in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, parietal and frontal cortices were related to mobility. Increased involvement of the prefrontal cortex was evident in both imagined walking conditions and conditions where the cognitive demands of locomotion were increased. Conclusions. Cortical control of gait in aging is bilateral, widespread, and dependent on the integrity of both gray and white matter.

One instance of this is referred to as "positional priming of pop-out" (pPoP; Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1996). In positional PoP paradigms, the processing of the current target is examined depending on whether it occurs at the previous target or a previous distractor location, relative to a previously empty location ("neutral" baseline), permitting target facilitation and distractor inhibition to be dissociated. The present study combined RT measures with specific sensory- and motor-driven event-related lateralizations to track the time course of four distinct processing levels as a function of the target's position across consecutive trials. The results showed that, relative to targets at previous target and "neutral" locations, the appearance of a target at a previous distractor location was associated with a delayed build-up of the posterior contralateral negativity wave, indicating that distractor positions are suppressed at early stages of visual processing. By contrast, presentation of a target at a previous target, relative to "neutral" and distractor locations, modulated the elicitation of the subsequent stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential wave, indicating that post-selective response selection is facilitated if the target occurred at the same position as on the previous trial. Overall, the results of present study provide electrophysiological evidence for the idea that target location priming (RT benefits) does not originate from an enhanced coding of target saliency at repeated (target) locations; instead, they arise (near-) exclusively from processing levels subsequent to focal-attentional target selection.

The primary somatosensory cortex contributes to the latest part of the cortical response elicited by nociceptive somatosensory stimuli in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); Nociceptive system; Functional microstate analysis; Primary somatosensory cortex (S1)	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; A DIRECT; AFFERENTS; ERPS; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS	Nociceptive laser pulses elicit temporally-distinct cortical responses (the N1, N2 and P2 waves of laser-evoked potentials, LEPs) mainly reflecting the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contralateral to the stimulated side, and of the bilateral operculoinsular and cingulate cortices. Here, by performing two different EEG experiments and applying a range of analysis approaches (microstate analysis, scalp topography, single-trial estimation), we describe a distinct component in the last part of the human LEP response (P4 wave). We obtained three main results. First, the LEP is reliably decomposed in four main and distinct functional microstates, corresponding to the N1, N2, P2, and P4 waves, regardless of stimulus territory. Second, the scalp and source configurations of the P4 wave follow a clear somatotopical organization, indicating that this response is likely to be partly generated in contralateral Sl. Third, single-trial latencies and amplitudes of the P4 are tightly coupled with those of the N1, and are similarly sensitive to experimental manipulations (e.g., to crossing the hands over the body midline), suggesting that the P4 and N1 may have common neural sources. These results indicate that the P4 wave is a clear and distinct LEP component, which should be considered in LEP studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the brain response to nociceptive stimulation.

In this article, an overview of recent methodological developments and research findings related to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is provided. Different TMS parameters that reflect the function of interneurons in the motor cortex may represent neurophysiological markers of inhibition in ADHD, particularly the so-called intracortical inhibition. In children with a high level of hyperactivity and impulsivity, intracortical inhibition was comparably low at rest as shortly before the execution of a movement. TMS-evoked potentials can also be measured in the EEG so that investigating processes of excitability is not restricted to motor areas in future studies. The effects of methylphenidate on motor system excitability may be interpreted in the sense of a 'fine-tuning' with these mainly dopaminergic effects also depending on genetic parameters (DAT1 transporter). A differentiated view on the organization of motor control can be achieved by a combined analysis of TMS parameters and event-related potentials. Applying this bimodal approach, strong evidence for a deviant implementation of motor control in children with ADHD and probably compensatory mechanisms (with involvement of the prefrontal cortex) was obtained. These findings, which contribute to a better understanding of hyperactivity/impulsivity, inhibitory processes and motor control in ACED as well as the mechanisms of medication, underline the relevance of TMS as a neurophysiological method in ADHD research.

In particular, in nonhuman primates this area constructs expectations about upcoming rewards, given an environmental state or a choice planned by the animal. At the same time, in both humans and nonhuman primates, the MFC computes the difference between such predictions and actual environmental outcomes (reward prediction errors). However, there is a paucity of evidence about the time course of MFC-related activity during reward prediction and prediction error in humans. Here we experimentally investigated this by recording the EEG during a reinforcement learning task. Our results support the hypothesis that human MFC codes for reward prediction during the cue period and for prediction error during the outcome period. Further, reward expectation (cue period) was positively correlated with prediction error (outcome period) in error trials but negatively in correct trials, consistent with updating of reward expectation by prediction error. This demonstrates in humans, like in nonhuman primates, a role of the MFC in the rapid updating of reward expectations through prediction errors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Sumatriptan or saline was delivered subcutaneously by osmotic minipump for six days to Sprague-Dawley rats. Two weeks after pump removal, animals were anesthetized and recording/stimulating electrodes implanted. The animals were pretreated with vehicle or topiramate followed by graded electrical stimulation within the visual cortex. CSD events were identified by decreased EEG amplitude and DC potential shift. Additional unanesthetized sumatriptan or saline-pretreated rats were exposed to bright light environmental stress and periorbital and hindpaw withdrawal thresholds were measured. Following CSD stimulation or environmental stress, immunohistochemical staining for Fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) was performed. Results: Sumatriptan pre-exposure significantly decreased electrical stimulation threshold to generate a CSD event. Topiramate normalized the decreased CSD threshold as well as stress-induced behavioral withdrawal thresholds in sumatriptan-treated rats compared to saline-treated animals. Moreover, CSD and environmental stress increased Fos expression in the TNC of sumatriptan-treated rats, and these effects were blocked by topiramate. Environmental stress did not elicit cutaneous allodynia or elevate TNC Fos expression in saline-treated rats. Conclusions: A previous period of sumatriptan exposure produced long-lasting increased susceptibility to evoked CSD and environmental stress-induced activation of the TNC that was prevented by topiramate. Lowered CSD threshold, and enhanced consequences of CSD events (increased activation of TNC), may represent an underlying biological mechanism of MOH related to triptans.	[Green, A.

A plausible candidate mechanism for global workspace access is coupling of slow and fast brain activity. We studied coupling in EEG data using cross-frequency phase-amplitude modulation measurement between delta/theta phases and beta/gamma amplitudes from two experimental sessions, held on different days, of a typical attentional blink (AB) task, implying conscious access to targets. As the AB effect improved with practice between sessions, theta-gamma and theta-beta coupling increased generically. Most importantly, practice effects observed in delta-gamma and delta-beta couplings were specific to performance on the AB task. In particular, delta-gamma coupling showed the largest increase in cases of correct target detection in the most challenging AB conditions. All these practice effects were observed in the right temporal region. Given that the delta band is the main frequency of the P3 ERP, which is a marker of global workspace activity for conscious access, and because the gamma band is involved in visual object processing, the current results substantiate the role of phase-amplitude modulation in conscious access to visual target representations.

As such, individuals with high ENE may show biased information processing when faced with social evaluation. The aim of the current study was to examine the neural underpinnings of anticipating and processing social-evaluative feedback, and its correlates with ENE. We used a social judgment paradigm in which female participants (N = 31) were asked to indicate whether they believed to be socially accepted or rejected by their peers. Anticipatory attention was indexed by the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN), while the feedback-related negativity and P3 were used to index the processing of social-evaluative feedback. Results provided evidence of an optimism bias in social peer evaluation, as participants more often predicted to be socially accepted than rejected. Participants with high levels of ENE needed more time to provide their judgments about the social-evaluative outcome. While anticipating social-evaluative feedback, SPN amplitudes were larger for anticipated social acceptance than for social rejection feedback. Interestingly, the SPN during anticipated social acceptance was larger in participants with high levels of ENE. None of the feedback-related brain potentials correlated with the FNE. Together, the results provided evidence of biased information processing in individuals with high levels of ENE when anticipating (rather than processing) social-evaluative feedback. The delayed response times in high ENE individuals were interpreted to reflect augmented vigilance imposed by the upcoming social-evaluative threat. Possibly, the SPN constitutes a neural marker of this vigilance in females with higher ENE levels, particularly when anticipating social acceptance feedback.	[Van der Molen, Melle J.

For example, a reliable method could be used to improve scientific study of voluntary action by allowing external probe stimuli to be delivered at different moments during development of intention and action. Several Brain Computer Interface applications have used motor imagery of repetitive actions to achieve this goal. These systems are relatively successful, but only if the intention is sustained over a period of several seconds; much longer than the timescales identified in psychophysiological studies for normal preparation for voluntary action. We have used a combination of sensorimotor rhythms and motor imagery training to decode intentions in a single-trial cued-response paradigm similar to those used in human and non-human primate motor control research. Decoding accuracy of over 0.83 was achieved with twelve participants. With this approach, we could decode intentions to move the left or right hand at sub-second timescales, both for instructed choices instructed by an external stimulus and for free choices generated intentionally by the participant. The implications for volition are considered.

J	Ghaderi, F; Kim, SK; Kirchner, EA				Ghaderi, Foad; Kim, Su Kyoung; Kirchner, Elsa Andrea			Effects of eye artifact removal methods on single trial P300 detection, a comparative study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Eye artifact removal; Regression; Infomax; SOBI; ADJUST	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EOG ARTIFACTS; EEG; TIME; ICA; TOOL	Electroencephalographic signals are commonly contaminated by eye artifacts, even if recorded under controlled conditions. The objective of this work was to quantitatively compare standard artifact removal methods (regression, filtered regression, Infomax, and second order blind identification (SOBI)) and two artifact identification approaches for independent component analysis (ICA) methods, i.e. ADJUST and correlation. To this end, eye artifacts were removed and the cleaned datasets were used for single trial classification of P300 (a type of event related potentials elicited using the oddball paradigm). Statistical analysis of the results confirms that the combination of Infomax and ADJUST provides a relatively better performance (0.6% improvement on average of all subject) while the combination of SOBI and correlation performs the worst. Low-pass filtering the data at lower cutoffs (here 4 Hz) can also improve the classification accuracy. Without requiring any artifact reference channel, the combination of Infomax and ADJUST improves the classification performance more than the other methods for both examined filtering cutoffs, i.e., 4 Hz and 25 Hz.

The high comorbidity of ADHD and OCD with each other, especially of ADHD in paediatric OCD, is well described. OCD and ADHD often follow a chronic course with persistent rates of at least 40-50 %. Family studies showed high heritability in ADHD and OCD, and some genetic findings showed similar variants for both disorders of the same pathogenetic mechanisms, whereas other genetic findings may differentiate between ADHD and OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggest that partly similar executive functions are affected in both disorders. The deficits in the corresponding brain networks may be responsible for the perseverative, compulsive symptoms in OCD but also for the disinhibited and impulsive symptoms characterizing ADHD. This article reviews the current literature of neuroimaging, neurochemical circuitry, neuropsychological and genetic findings considering similarities as well as differences between OCD and ADHD.

However, functional subdivisions within this broad range of frequencies are disputed, with most studies hypothesizing only about single frequency bands. The present study utilizes an established paradigm of spoken word recognition (lexical decision) to test the hypothesis that within the slow neural oscillatory frequency range, distinct functional signatures and cortical networks can be identified at least for theta- (similar to 3-7 Hz) and alpha-frequencies (similar to 8-12 Hz). Listeners performed an auditory lexical decision task on a set of items that formed a word-pseudoword continuum: ranging from (1) real words over (2) ambiguous pseudowords (deviating from real words only in one vowel; comparable to natural mispronunciations in speech) to (3) pseudowords (clearly deviating from real words by randomized syllables). By means of time-frequency analysis and spatial filtering, we observed a dissociation into distinct but simultaneous patterns of alpha power suppression and theta power enhancement. Alpha exhibited a parametric suppression as items increasingly matched real words, in line with lowered functional inhibition in a left-dominant lexical processing network for more word-like input Simultaneously, theta power in a bilateral fronto-temporal network was selectively enhanced for ambiguous pseudowords only. Thus, enhanced alpha power can neurally 'gate' lexical integration, while enhanced theta power might index functionally more specific ambiguity-resolution processes. To this end, a joint analysis of both frequency bands provides neural evidence for parallel processes in achieving spoken word recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While task goals determine which information must be suppressed, the demand for inhibitory control depends on the strength of the interference induced by incoming, task-irrelevant information. Whether the same or distinct inhibitory processes are engaged to suppress various degrees of interference from task-irrelevant information remains largely unresolved. We investigated this question by manipulating the strength of the conflict induced by automatic word reading in a classical color Stroop task. High conflict was induced by presenting words in participant's native language and low conflict by presenting words in a less familiar language. Behavioral performance and electrical neuroimaging analyses of event-related potentials to the words were analyzed following a two-by-two within-subject design with factors conflict strength (high; low) and color word/word ink congruency (congruent; incongruent). Behaviorally, we observed a significant conflict strength x congruency driven by a smaller Stroop effect in the low- than high conflict condition. Electrophysiologically, we observed a significant conflict strength x congruency interaction at the topographic level during the period of the N450 components, indicative of the engagement of distinct configurations of brain networks. No such interaction was found at the level of response strength. Electrical sources analyses localized the topographic effect within the anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia, left middle frontal and occipital areas. We interpret our results in terms of qualitatively distinct executive mechanisms for reactive inhibitory control in conditions of high versus low stimulus-driven conflict.

The results showed that prior exposure to a stimulus biased toward one percept led to subsequent suppression of that percept. In contrast, in the absence of stimulus bias, prior perceptual experience can have a facilitative influence. The suppressive effects caused by the prior stimulus were found to transfer to an ambiguous plaid test stimulus rotated 180A(0) relative to the adaptation stimulus, but were abolished if (1) the ambiguous test stimulus was only rotated 90A(0) relative to the adaptation stimulus or (2) the adaptation stimulus was heavily biased toward the component grating percept. Event-related potential recordings were consistent with the involvement of visual cortical areas and suggested that the influence of recent stimulus exposure may involve recruitment of additional brain processes beyond those responsible for initial stimulus encoding. In contrast, the effects of prior and current perceptual experience appeared to depend on similar brain processes. Although the data presented here focus on vision, the work is discussed within the context of data from a parallel series of experiments in audition.

Dissociable Genetic Contributions to Error Processing: A Multimodal Neuroimaging Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE; DOPAMINE-D4 RECEPTOR GENE; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COMMON MUTATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; POLYMORPHISM; BRAIN; ASSOCIATION; NEURONS	Background: Neuroimaging studies reliably identify two markers of error commission: the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential, and functional MRI activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). While theorized to reflect the same neural process, recent evidence suggests that the ERN arises from the posterior cingulate cortex not the dACC. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these two error markers also have different genetic mediation. Methods: We measured both error markers in a sample of 92 comprised of healthy individuals and those with diagnoses of schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism spectrum disorder. Participants performed the same task during functional MRI and simultaneously acquired magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. We examined the mediation of the error markers by two single nucleotide polymorphisms: dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) C-521T (rs1800955), which has been associated with the ERN and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (rs1801133), which has been associated with error-related dACC activation. We then compared the effects of each polymorphism on the two error markers modeled as a bivariate response. Results: We replicated our previous report of a posterior cingulate source of the ERN in healthy participants in the schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder groups. The effect of genotype on error markers did not differ significantly by diagnostic group. DRD4 C-521T allele load had a significant linear effect on ERN amplitude, but not on dACC activation, and this difference was significant. MTHFR C677T allele load had a significant linear effect on dACC activation but not ERN amplitude, but the difference in effects on the two error markers was not significant. Conclusions: DRD4 C-521T, but not MTHFR C677T, had a significant differential effect on two canonical error markers. Together with the anatomical dissociation between the ERN and error-related dACC activation, these findings suggest that these error markers have different neural and genetic mediation.

The time window between 100 and 200 ms witnesses the transition between low-level and high-level vision, an N170 component correlating with conscious interpretation of a visual stimulus as a face. This face representation is rapidly refined as information accumulates during this time window, allowing the individualization of faces. To improve the sensitivity and objectivity of face perception measures, it is increasingly important to go beyond transient visual stimulation by recording electrophysiological responses at periodic frequency rates. This approach has recently provided face perception thresholds and the first objective signature of integration of facial parts in the human brain.

For example, in brain-computer interface applications, training data is often the result of lengthy experimental sessions, where the attention levels of participants can change over the course of the experiment. In such application cases, structured label noise will cause problems because most machine learning methods assume independent and identically distributed label noise. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for learning and evaluation in presence of systematic label noise. The core of which is a novel extension of support vector data description / one-class SVM that can incorporate latent variables. Controlled simulations on synthetic data and a real-world EEG experiment with 20 subjects from the domain of brain-computer-interfacing show that our method achieves accuracies that go beyond the state of the art.

J	Li, XQ; Zhao, HY; Lu, Y				Li, Xiaoqing; Zhao, Haiyan; Lu, Yong			The Relation between Thematic Role Computing and Semantic Relatedness Processing during On-Line Sentence Comprehension	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORLD KNOWLEDGE; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE; RETRIEVAL; ANIMACY; ENGLISH; SYSTEM; VERBS; POWER	Sentence comprehension involves timely computing different types of relations between its verbs and noun arguments, such as morphosyntactic, semantic, and thematic relations. Here, we used EEG technique to investigate the potential differences in thematic role computing and lexical-sematic relatedness processing during on-line sentence comprehension , and the intraction between these two types of processes. Mandarin Chinese sentences were used as materials. The basic structure of those sentences is "Noun+Verb+'le'+a two-character word", with the Noun being the initial argument. The verb disambiguates the initial argument as an agent or a patient, Meanwhile, the initial argument and the verb are highly or lowly semantically related. The ERPs at the verbs revealed that: relative to the agent condition, the patient condition evoked a larger N400 only when the argument and verb were lowly semantically related; however, relative to the high-relatedness condition, the low-relatedness condition elicited a larger N400 regardless of the thematic relation; although both thematic role variation and sematic relatedness variation elicited N400 effects, the N400 effect elicited by the former was broadly distributed and reached maximun over the frontal electrodes, and the N400 effect elicited by the latter had a posterior distribution. In addition, the brain oscillations results showed that, although thematic role variation (patient vs. agent) induced power decreases around the beta frequency band (15-30 Hz), semantic relatedness variation (low-relatedness vs. high-relatedness) induced power increases in the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz). These results suggested that, in the sentence context, thematic role computing is modulated by the sematic relatedness between the verb and its argument; semantic relatedness processing, however, is in some degree independent from the thematic relations. Moreover, our results indicated that, during on-line sentence comprehension, thematic role computing and sematic relatedness processing are mediated by distinct neural systems.

Additionally, we analyzed the feasibility of a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in NF research based on regulation performance during treatment sessions and self assessment of the participants. Twenty healthy adults participated in 16 sessions of SCPs training: 9 participants received regular SCP training, 11 participants received sham feedback. At three time points (pre, intermediate, post) fMRI and EEG/ERP-measurements were conducted during a continuous performance test (CPT). Performance-data during the sessions (regulation performance) in the treatment group and the placebo group were analyzed. Analysis of EEG-activity revealed in the SCP group a strong enhancement of the CNV (electrode Cz) at the intermediate assessment, followed by a decrease back to baseline at the post-treatment assessment. In contrast, in the placebo group a continuous but smaller increase of the CNV could be obtained from pre to post assessment. The increase of the CNV in the SCP group at intermediate testing was superior to the enhancement in the placebo group. The changes of the CNV were accompanied by a continuous improvement in the test performance of the CPT from pre to intermediate to post assessment comparable in both groups. The change of the CNV in the SCP group is interpreted as an indicator of neural plasticity and efficiency while an increase of the CNV in the placebo group might reflect learning and improved timing due to the frequent task repetition. In the fMRI analysis evidence was obtained for neuronal plasticity. After regular SCP neurofeedback activation in the posterior parietal cortex decreased from the pre-to the intermediate measurement and increased again in the post measurement, inversely following the U-shaped increase and decrease of the tCNV EEG amplitude in the SCP-trained group. Furthermore, we found a localized increase of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses of the estimation of treatment assignment by the participants indicate feasibility of blinding. Participants could not assess treatment assignment confidently. Participants of the SCP-group improved regulation capability during treatment sessions (in contrast to the participants of the placebo-group), although regulation capability appeared to be instable, presumably due to diminished confidence in the training (SCP- or sham-training). Our results indicate that SCP training in healthy adults might lead to functional changes in neuronal circuits serving cognitive preparation even after a limited number of sessions.

Inducing Task-Relevant Responses to Speech in the Sleeping Brain	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPATIAL ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; INTENTION; CORTEX; ONSET; EEG	Falling asleep leads to a loss of sensory awareness and to the inability to interact with the environment [1]. While this was traditionally thought as a consequence of the brain shutting down to external inputs, it is now acknowledged that incoming stimuli can still be processed, at least to some extent, during sleep [2]. For instance, sleeping participants can create novel sensory associations between tones and odors [3] or reactivate existing semantic associations, as evidenced by event-related potentials [4-7]. Yet, the extent to which the brain continues to process external stimuli remains largely unknown. In particular, it remains unclear whether sensory information can be processed in a flexible and task-dependent manner by the sleeping brain, all the way up to the preparation of relevant actions. Here, using semantic categorization and lexical decision tasks, we studied task-relevant responses triggered by spoken stimuli in the sleeping brain. Awake participants classified words as either animals or objects (experiment 1) or as either words or pseudowords (experiment 2) by pressing a button with their right or left hand, while transitioning toward sleep. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an electrophysiological index of response preparation, revealed that task-specific preparatory responses are preserved during sleep. These findings demonstrate that despite the absence of awareness and behavioral responsiveness, sleepers can still extract task-relevant information from external stimuli and covertly prepare for appropriate motor responses.

With age, there is an increased allocation of sensorimotor processing resources, accompanied by a reduced differentiation between the two networks of action selection. The present study examines the age effects on the motor-related oscillatory patterns related to the preparation of externally and internally guided movements. Thirty-two older and 30 younger adults underwent three delayed motor tasks with S1 as preparatory and S2 as imperative cue: Full, laterality instructed by S1 (external guidance); Free, laterality freely selected (internal guidance); None, laterality instructed by S2 (no preparation). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using 64 surface electrodes. Motor-Related Amplitude Asymmetries (MRAA), indexing the lateralization of oscillatory activities, were analyzed within the S1-S2 interval in the mu (9-12 Hz) and low beta (15-20 Hz) motor-related frequency bands. Reaction times to S2 were slower in older than younger subjects, and slower in the Free than in the Full condition in older subjects only. In the Full condition, there were significant mu MRAA in both age groups, and significant low beta MRAA only in older adults. The Free condition was associated with large mu MRAA in younger adults and limited low beta MRAA in older adults. In younger subjects, the lateralization of mu activity in both Full and Free conditions indicated effective external and internal motor preparation. In older subjects, external motor preparation was associated with lateralization of low beta in addition with mu activity, compatible with an increase of motor-related resources. In contrast, absence of mu and limited low beta lateralization in internal motor preparation was concomitant with reaction time slowing and suggested less efficient cerebral processes subtending free movement selection in older adults, indicating reduced capacity for internally driven action with age.

Whereas the former has been proposed to reflect a prediction error, the latter is often associated with working memory updating. Interestingly, these two proposals predict fundamentally different dynamics: prediction errors are thought to propagate serially through several distinct brain areas, while working memory supposes that activity is sustained over time within a stable set of brain areas. Here we test this temporal dissociation by showing how the generalization of brain activity patterns across time can characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural processes. This method is applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired from healthy participants who were presented with two types of auditory novelty. Following our predictions, the results show that the mismatch evoked by a local novelty leads to the sequential recruitment of distinct and short-lived patterns of brain activity. In sharp contrast, the global novelty evoked by an unexpected sequence of five sounds elicits a sustained state of brain activity that lasts for several hundreds of milliseconds. The present results highlight how MEG combined with multivariate pattern analyses can characterize the dynamics of human cortical processes.

Here we report the fortuitous observation in a patient who, while being recorded with intra-cerebral electrodes, was able, during paradoxical sleep, to reproduce a motor behaviour previously performed at wake to consciously indicate her perception of nociceptive stimulation. Noxious stimuli induced behavioural responses only if they reached the cortex during periods when mid-frontal networks (pre-SMA, pre-motor cortex) were pre-activated. Sensory responses in the opercular cortex, and insula were identical whether the noxious stimulus was to evoke or not a motor behaviour; conversely, the responses in mid-anterior cingulate were specifically enhanced for stimuli yielding motor responses. Neuronal networks implicated in the voluntary preparation of movements may be reactivated during paradoxical sleep, but only if behavioural-relevant stimuli reach the cortex during specific periods of "motor awareness". These local activation appeared without any global sleep stage change. This observation opens the way to further studies on the currently unknown capacity of the sleeping brain to interact meaningfully with its environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In general learning situations, it is an established concept that a trainer assists a trainee to improve his/her aptitude in certain skills. In this work, we want to evaluate whether we can apply this concept in the context of event-related desynchronization (ERD) based, adaptive, hybrid BCIs. Hence, in a first session we merged the features of a high aptitude BCI user, a trainer, and a novice user, the trainee, in a closed-loop BCI feedback task and automatically adapted the classifier over time. In a second session the trainees operated the system unassisted. Twelve healthy participants ran through this protocol. Along with the trainer, the trainees achieved a very high overall peak accuracy of 95.3 %. In the second session, where users operated the BCI unassisted, they still achieved a high overall peak accuracy of 83.6 %. Ten of twelve first time BCI users successfully achieved significantly better than chance accuracy. Concluding, we can say that this trainer-trainee approach is very promising. Future research should investigate, whether this approach is superior to conventional training approaches. This trainer-trainee concept could have potential for future application of BCIs to end users.

One classical example is the McGurk effect in which incongruent auditory and visual speech signals may lead to a fused percept different from either visual or auditory inputs. In a previous set of experiments, we showed that if a McGurk stimulus is preceded by an incongruent AV context (composed of incongruent auditory and visual speech materials) the amount of McGurk fusion is largely decreased. We interpreted this result in the framework of a two-stage "binding and fusion" model of AV speech perception, with an early AV binding stage controlling the fusion/decision process and likely to produce "unbinding" with less fusion if the context is incoherent. In order to provide further electrophysiological evidence for this binding/unbinding stage, early auditory evoked N1/P2 responses were here compared during auditory, congruent and incongruent AV speech perception, according to either prior coherent or incoherent AV contexts. Following the coherent context, in line with previous electroencephalographic/magnetoencephalographic studies, visual information in the congruent AV condition was found to modify auditory evoked potentials, with a latency decrease of P2 responses compared to the auditory condition. Importantly, both P2 amplitude and latency in the congruent AV condition increased from the coherent to the incoherent context. Although potential contamination by visual responses from the visual cortex cannot be discarded, our results might provide a possible neurophysiological correlate of early binding/unbinding process applied on AV interactions.

We used time-frequency single-trial EEG analyses (i.e., inter-trial coherence; ITC), to examine cortical phase synchrony in children with normal hearing (NH), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and ANSD. Methods: Single trial time-frequency analyses were performed on cortical auditory evoked responses from 41 NH children, 91 children with ANSD and 50 children with SNHL. The latter two groups included children who received intervention via hearing aids and cochlear implants. ITC measures were compared between groups as a function of hearing loss, intervention type, and cortical maturational status. Results: In children with SNHL, ITC decreased as severity of hearing loss increased. Children with ANSD revealed lower levels of ITC relative to children with NH or SNHL, regardless of intervention. Children with ANSD who received cochlear implants showed significant improvements in ITC with increasing experience with their implants. Conclusions: Cortical phase coherence is significantly reduced as a result of both severe-to-profound SNHL and ANSD. Significance: ITC provides a window into the brain oscillations underlying the averaged cortical auditory evoked response. Our results provide a first description of deficits in cortical phase synchrony in children with SNHL and ANSD. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Electrophysiological Explorations of the Bilingual Advantage: Evidence from a Stroop Task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT DETECTION; 2 LANGUAGES; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; TIME-COURSE; CONTROL MECHANISMS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; NEURAL MECHANISMS; NATIVE LANGUAGE	Bilinguals have been shown to exhibit a performance advantage on executive control tasks, outperforming their monolingual counterparts. Although a wealth of research has investigated this 'bilingual advantage' behaviourally, electrophysiological correlates are lacking. Using EEG with a Stroop task that manipulated the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of word and colour presentation, the current study addressed two facets of the bilingual advantage. The possibility that bilinguals experience superior conflict processing relative to monolinguals (a 'conflict-specific advantage') was investigated by comparing behavioural interference effects as well as the amplitude of the N-inc, a conflict-related ERP component occurring from approximately 300-500 ms after the onset of conflict. In contrast, the hypothesis that bilinguals experience domain-general, conflict-independent enhancements in executive processing (a 'non-conflict-specific advantage') was evaluated by comparing the control condition (symbol strings) between groups. There was some significant, but inconsistent, evidence for a conflict-specific bilingual advantage. In contrast, strong evidence emerged for a non-conflict-specific advantage, with bilinguals demonstrating faster RTs and reduced ERP amplitudes on control trials compared to monolinguals. Importantly, when the control stimulus was presented before the colour, ERPs to control trials revealed group differences before the onset of conflict, suggesting differences in the ability to ignore or suppress distracting irrelevant information. This indicates that bilinguals experience superior executive processing even in the absence of conflict and semantic salience, and suggests that the advantage extends to more efficient proactive management of the environment.

Converging evidence from time-frequency decompositions of the response-related ERP revealed that evoked theta activity at fronto-central electrode positions differentiates correct from erroneous responses in simple tasks, but also in more complex tasks. However, up to now it is unclear how different electrophysiological parameters of error processing, especially at the level of neural oscillations are related, or predictive for BOLD signal changes reflecting error processing at a functional-neuroanatomical level. The present study aims to provide crosslinks between time domain information, time-frequency information, MRI BOLD signal and behavioral parameters in a task examining error monitoring due to mistakes in a mental rotation task. The results show that BOLD signal changes reflecting error processing on a functional-neuroanatomical level are best predicted by evoked oscillations in the theta frequency band. Although the fMRI results in this study account for an involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and the Insula in error processing, the correlation of evoked oscillations and BOLD signal was restricted to a coupling of evoked theta and anterior cingulate cortex BOLD activity. The current results indicate that although there is a distributed functional-neuroanatomical network mediating error processing, only distinct parts of this network seem to modulate electrophysiological properties of error monitoring.

These inconsistencies contrast with the reliable finding of reduced P3 in relation to externalizing tendencies, which overlap with impulsive-antisocial features of psychopathy, as distinguished from the affective-interpersonal features. Employing a sample of incarcerated male offenders (N = 154) who completed the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised along with a three-stimulus visual oddball task, we tested the hypothesis that impulsive-antisocial features of psychopathy would selectively exhibit an inverse relationship with P3 amplitude. Clear support for this hypothesis was obtained. Our findings clarify the discrepant findings regarding psychopathy and P3, and establish P3 as a neurophysiological point of contact between psychopathy and externalizing proneness from the broader psychopathology literature.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; EEG/ERP; Salience	RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MEMORY; CONTEXT; REPRESENTATION; MMN	The role in which two tones are first encountered in an unattended oddball sequence affects how deviance detection, reflected by mismatch negativity, treats them later when the roles reverse: a "primacy bias." We tested whether this effect is modulated by previous behavioral relevance assigned to the two tones. To this end, sequences in which the roles of the two tones alternated were preceded by a go/no-go task in which tones were presented with equal probability. Half of the participants were asked to respond to the short sounds, the other half to long sounds. Primacy bias was initially abolished but returned dependent upon the go-stimulus that the participant was assigned. Results demonstrate a long-term impact of prior learning on deviance detection, and that even when prior importance/equivalence is learned, the bias ultimately returns. Results are discussed in terms of persistent go-stimulus specific changes in responsiveness to sound.

Numerous studies have identified electrophysiological correlates of error recognition in the human brain (error-related potentials, ErrPs). Consequently, it has been proposed to use these signals to improve human-computer interaction (HCI) or brain-machine interfacing (BMI). Here, we present a review of over a decade of developments toward this goal. This body of work provides consistent evidence that ErrPs can be successfully detected on a single-trial basis, and that they can be effectively used in both HCI and BMI applications. We first describe the ErrP phenomenon and follow up with an analysis of different strategies to increase the robustness of a system by incorporating single-trial ErrP recognition, either by correcting the machine's actions or by providing means for its error-based adaptation. These approaches can be applied both when the user employs traditional HCI input devices or in combination with another BMI channel. Finally, we discuss the current challenges that have to be overcome in order to fully integrate ErrPs into practical applications. This includes, in particular, the characterization of such signals during real(istic) applications, as well as the possibility of extracting richer information from them, going beyond the time-locked decoding that dominates current approaches.

Participants were instructed to perform a lexical decision task while dense-array EEG was continuously recorded. Both ERP components (namely N400 and P300) and swLORETA suggested that proper name processing engaged a more widespread neural network and required more cognitive resources than common noun processing. Overall, our results come down in favor of the hypothesis that specific effects of proper vs. common noun processing exist, and they suggest a possible neuro-functional segregation of proper vs. common noun processing. The difference in proper and common noun processing seems to emerge at the level of storage or representation of lexical knowledge, and it may crucially depend on their semantic characteristics.

Perioperative management in order to minimise postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction: Results from a Swedish web-based survey	ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY			English	Article						Surgery; General anaesthesia; Postoperative cognitive side effects; Emergence agitation; Postoperative delirium; Postoperative cognitive dysfunction; Depth of anaesthesia monitors; Bi-spectral index; Auditory evoked potential	CLINICAL-PRACTICE; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; DAY SURGERY; PREVENTION; AWARENESS; METAANALYSIS; ROUTINES; CHILDREN; DEPTH	Cognitive side-effects such as emergence agitation (EA), postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are not infrequently complicating the postoperative care especially in elderly and fragile patients. The aim of the present survey was to gain insight regarding concern and interest in prevention and treatment strategies for postoperative delirium and dysfunction, and the use of EEG-based depth-ofanaesthesia monitoring possibly reducing the risk for cognitive side effects among anaesthesia personnel. Methods: A web-based validated questionnaire was sent to all Swedish anaesthesiologists and nurse anaesthetists during summer 2013. The questionnaire consisted of 3 sections, subjective preferences, routines and practices related to the perioperative handling of EA, POD, POCD. Results: The response rate was 52%. Cardiovascular/pulmonary risks where assessed as importance by 98, 97% of responders while 69% considered the risk of neurocognitive side-effects important. When asked explicitly around cognitive side-effects 89%, 37% and 44% assessed awareness, POC and POD respectively of importance. EEG-based depth-of-anaesthesia monitors were used in 50% of hospitals. The responders were not convinced about the benefits of such monitors even in at-risk patients. Structured protocols for the management of postoperative cognitive side-effects were available only in few hospitals. Conclusion: Swedish anaesthesia personnel are concerned about the risk of postoperative cognitive sideeffects but are more concerned about cardiovascular/pulmonary risks, pain, PONV and the rare event of awareness. Most respondents were not convinced about the use of depth-of-anaesthesia monitors. There is a need to improve knowledge around risk factors, prevention and management of postoperative cognitive side effects. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We recorded EEG from Dutch-English bilinguals who listened to spoken sentences in their L2 (English) or L1 (Dutch). In Experiments 1 and 3 the sentences contained an interlingual homophone. The sentence context was either biased towards the target language meaning of the homophone (target biased), the non-target language meaning (non-target biased), or neither meaning of the homophone (fully incongruent). These conditions were each compared to a semantically congruent control condition. In L2 sentences we observed an N400 in the non-target biased condition that had an earlier offset than the N400 to fully incongruent homophones. In the target biased condition, a negativity emerged that was later than the N400 to fully incongruent homophones. In L1 contexts, neither target biased nor non-target biased homophones yielded significant N400 effects (compared to the control condition). In Experiments 2 and 4 the sentences contained a language switch to a non-target language word that could be semantically congruent or incongruent. Semantically incongruent words (switched, and non-switched) elicited an N400 effect. The N400 to semantically congruent language-switched words had an earlier offset than the N400 to incongruent words. Both congruent and incongruent language switches elicited a Late Positive Component (LPC). These findings show that bilinguals activate both meanings of interlingual homophones irrespective of their contextual fit. In L2 contexts, the target-language meaning of the homophone has a head start over the non-target language meaning. The target-language head start is also evident for language switches from both L2-to-L1 and L1-to-L2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The network can be characterized by inter-regional functional connectivity, i.e., blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlations between any two regions. However, functional connectivity is not constant over time, thus computing correlation at a given time and then at some later time could give different results (non-stationarity). We hypothesized (1) that non-stationarities can be induced by epilepsy (e.g., interictal epileptic activity) increasing local signal variance and that (2) these transient events contribute to fluctuations in connectivity leading to pathological functioning, i.e., TLE semiology. We analyzed fMRI data from 27 patients with TLE and 22 healthy controls focusing on EEG-confirmed wake epochs only to protect against sleep-induced connectivity changes. Testing hypothesis (1), we identified brain regions where the BOLD signal variance was significantly greater in TLE than in controls: the temporal pole including the hippocampus. Taking the latter as the seed region and testing hypothesis (2), we calculated the time-varying inter-regional correlation values (dynamic functional connectivity) to other brain regions and found greater connectivity variance in the TLE than the control group mainly in the precuneus, the supplementary and sensorimotor, and the frontal cortices. We conclude that the highest BOLD signal variance in the hippocampi is highly suggestive of a specific epilepsy-related effect. The altered connectivity dynamics in TLE patients might help to explain the hallmark semiological features of dyscognitive seizures including impaired consciousness (precuneus, frontal cortex), sensory disturbance, and motor automatisms (sensorimotor cortices, supplementary motor cortex). Accounting for the non-stationarity and state-dependence of functional connectivity are a prerequisite in the search for potential connectivity-derived biomarkers in TLE.

J	Matsumoto, M; Hori, J				Matsumoto, Mariko; Hori, Junichi			Classification of silent speech using support vector machine and relevance vector machine	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Silent speech; Brain computer interface (BCI); Support vector machine (SVM); Relevance vector machine (RVM); Adaptive collection	SYSTEM	To provide speech prostheses for individuals with severe communication impairments, we investigated a classification method for brain computer interfaces (BCIs) using silent speech. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using scalp electrodes when five subjects imagined the vocalization of Japanese vowels, /a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/ in order and in random order, while the subjects remained silent and immobilized. For actualization, we tried to apply relevance vector machine (RVM) and RVM with Gaussian kernel (RVM-G) instead of support vector machine with Gaussian kernel (SVM-G) to reduce the calculation cost in the use of 19 channels, common special patterns (CSPs) filtering, and adaptive collection (AC). Results show that using RVM-G instead of SVM-G reduced the ratio of the number of efficient vectors to the number of training data from 97% to 55%. At this time, the averaged classification accuracies (CAs) using SVM-G and RVM-G were, respectively, 77% and 79%, showing no degradation. However, the calculation cost was more than that using SVM-G because RVM-G necessitates high calculation costs for optimization. Furthermore, results show that CAs using RVM-G were weaker than SVM-G when the training data were few. Additionally, results showed that nonlinear classification was necessary for silent speech classification. This paper serves as a beginning of feasibility study for speech prostheses using an imagined voice. Although classification for silent speech presents great potential, many feasibility problems remain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modulation of early cortical processing during divided attention to non-contiguous locations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha-band oscillations; EEG; event-related potential; spatial attention; spotlight; visual evoked potential (VEP)	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ZOOM LENS; SUPPRESSION; SHIFTS; MECHANISMS; INCREASES; SERIAL; SPACE; FIELD; COMPONENTS	We often face the challenge of simultaneously attending to multiple non-contiguous regions of space. There is ongoing debate as to how spatial attention is divided under these situations. Whereas, for several years, the predominant view was that humans could divide the attentional spotlight, several recent studies argue in favor of a unitary spotlight that rhythmically samples relevant locations. Here, this issue was addressed by the use of high-density electrophysiology in concert with the multifocal m-sequence technique to examine visual evoked responses to multiple simultaneous streams of stimulation. Concurrently, we assayed the topographic distribution of alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms, a measure of attentional suppression. Participants performed a difficult detection task that required simultaneous attention to two stimuli in contiguous (undivided) or non-contiguous parts of space. In the undivided condition, the classic pattern of attentional modulation was observed, with increased amplitude of the early visual evoked response and increased alpha amplitude ipsilateral to the attended hemifield. For the divided condition, early visual responses to attended stimuli were also enhanced, and the observed multifocal topographic distribution of alpha suppression was in line with the divided attention hypothesis. These results support the existence of divided attentional spotlights, providing evidence that the corresponding modulation occurs during initial sensory processing time-frames in hierarchically early visual regions, and that suppressive mechanisms of visual attention selectively target distracter locations during divided spatial attention.

In the IBRE, participants learn that one pair of symptoms (AB) predicts a frequently occurring disease, whilst an overlapping pair of symptoms (AC) predicts a rarely occurring disease. Participants subsequently infer that BC predicts the rare disease, a non-rational decision made in opposition to the underlying base rates of the two diseases. Error-driven attention theories of learning state that the IBRE occurs because C attracts more attention than B. On the basis of this account we predicted and observed the occurrence of brain potentials associated with visual attention: a posterior Selection Negativity, and a concurrent anterior Selection Positivity, for C vs. B in a post-training test phase. Error-driven attention theories further predict no Selection Negativity, Selection Positivity or IBRE, for control symptoms matched on frequency to B and C, but for which there was no shared symptom (A) during training. These predictions were also confirmed, and this confirmation discounts alternative explanations of the IBRE based on the relative novelty of B and C. Further, we observed higher response accuracy for B alone than for C alone; this dissociation of response accuracy (B> C) from attentional allocation (C> B) discounts the possibility that the observed attentional difference was caused by the difference in response accuracy.

The results of a research diagnostic PTSD in breast cancer (BC) patients and determination of the relationship between intensity of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD), EEG reactivity and immunity suppression is presented. The diagnosis of PTSD was made with the help of the psychometric methods (CAPS, MS, IOES-R, BDI, WAS, LEQ, SCL-90-R, ERP recording). The immunological status of patients was evaluated on the basis of 20 parameters. In this research have shown that BC happens to be a traumatic stressor that can cause PTSD: the condition that fits the clinical picture PTSD has been found in 24% of patients. Results of ERP recording reflect a presence of two factors that correlate with intensity of PTSD signs. PTSD group has significant profound immune alterations. The percentage of PTSD (24 %) in breast cancer patients does not much differ from those in traumatic events survivors (combat veterans, natural and technological disasters and accidental victims). This results received by the described approach reflect psychological problem situations existing among BC patients. These data can be helpful for psychological assistance and social rehabilitation of such patients. The issue of direct impact of stress on the origin and development of cancer need further investigation but so far there is evidence that intense post-traumatic reaction, which are observed in some BC-patients, can aggravate the course of the oncological disorder and influense negatively the patients'status, thus enhancing the risk of relapse.											38	4	4	0	0	MOSCOW STATE UNIV PSYCHOLOGY & EDUCATION	MOSCOW	UL SRETENKA, 29, MOSCOW, 127051, RUSSIA	2075-3470	2311-9446		Konsult Psikhol Psik	Konsult.

This study aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the development of attention functions during childhood. A total of 46 healthy 4-13-year-old children and 15 adults performed an adapted version of the Attention Network Task (ANT) while brain activation was registered with a high-density EEG system. Performance of the ANT revealed changes in the efficiency of attention networks across ages. While no differences were observed on the alerting score, both orienting and executive attention scores showed a more protracted developmental curve. Further, age-related differences in brain activity were mostly observed in early ERP components. Young children had poorer early processing of warning cues compared to 10-13-year-olds and adults, as shown by an immature auditory-evoked potential complex elicited by warning tones. Also, 4-6-year-olds exhibited a poorer processing of orienting cues as indexed by lack of modulation of the NI. Finally, flanker congruency produced earlier modulation of ERPs amplitude with age. Flanker congruency effects were delayed and more anteriorly distributed for young children, compared to adults who showed a clear modulation of the N2 in fronto-parietal channels. Additionally, interactions among attention networks were examined. Both alerting and orienting conditions modulated the effectiveness of conflict processing by the executive attention network. The Orienting x Executive networks interactions was only observed after about age 7. Results are informative of the neural correlates of the development of attention networks in childhood.

The origins of consonance have been debated since the ancient Greeks. To elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these musical fundamentals, we recorded neuroelectric brain activity while participants listened passively to various chromatic musical intervals (simultaneously sounding pitches) varying in their perceptual pleasantness (i.e., consonance/ dissonance). Dichotic presentation eliminated acoustic and peripheral contributions that often confound explanations of consonance. We found that neural representations for pitch in early human auditory cortex code perceptual features of musical consonance and follow a hierarchical organization according to music-theoretic principles. These neural correlates emerge pre-attentively within similar to 150 ms after the onset of pitch, are segregated topographically in superior temporal gyrus with a rightward hemispheric bias, and closely mirror listeners' behavioral valence preferences for the chromatic tone combinations inherent to music. A perceptual-based organization implies that parallel to the phonetic code for speech, elements of music are mapped within early cerebral structures according to higher-order, perceptual principles and the rules of Western harmony rather than simple acoustic attributes.

The Dynamics of Proactive and Reactive Cognitive Control Processes in the Human Brain	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CONFLICT DETECTION; TIME-COURSE; STROOP INTERFERENCE; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; LOCATION; CORTEX; TASK; ERP; ADJUSTMENTS	In this study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the flexible regulation of cognitive control that unfolds over different timescales. We measured behavioral and neural effects of color-word incongruency, as different groups of participants performed three different versions of color-word Stroop tasks in which the relative timing of the color and word features varied from trial to trial. For this purpose, we used a standard Stroop color identification task with equal congruent-to-incongruent proportions (50%/50%), along with two versions of the "Reverse Stroop" word identification tasks, for which we manipulated the incongruency proportion (50%/50% and 80%/20%). Two canonical ERP markers of neural processing of stimulus incongruency, the frontocentral negative polarity incongruency wave (N-INC) and the late positive component (LPC), were evoked across the various conditions. Results indicated that color-word incongruency interacted with the relative feature timing, producing greater neural and behavioral effects when the task-irrelevant stimulus preceded the target, but still significant effects when it followed. Additionally, both behavioral and neural incongruency effects were reduced by nearly half in the word identification task (Reverse Stroop 50/50) relative to the color identification task (Stroop 50/50), with these effects essentially fully recovering when incongruent trials appeared only infrequently (Reverse Stroop 80/20). Across the conditions, N-INC amplitudes closely paralleled RTs, indicating this component is sensitive to the overall level of stimulus conflict. In contrast, LPC amplitudes were largest with infrequent incongruent trials, suggesting a possible readjustment role when proactive control is reduced. These findings thus unveil distinct control mechanisms that unfold over time in response to conflicting stimulus input under different contexts.	[Appelbaum, L. Gregory; Boehler, C.

Effective connectivity associated with auditory error detection in musicians with absolute pitch	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						absolute pitch; vocalization; auditory feedback; DCM; ERP; pitch shift	EVOKED-RESPONSES; VOCAL PITCH; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; MODEL; SINGERS; EEG	It is advantageous to study a wide range of vocal abilities in order to fully understand how vocal control measures vary across the full spectrum. Individuals with absolute pitch (AP) are able to assign a verbal label to musical notes and have enhanced abilities in pitch identification without reliance on an external referent. In this study we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to model effective connectivity of ERP responses to pitch perturbation in voice auditory feedback in musicians with relative pitch (RP), AP and non-musician controls. We identified a network compromising left and right hemisphere superior temporal gyrus (STG), primary motor cortex (M1), and premotor cortex (PM). We specified nine models and compared two main factors examining various combinations of STG involvement in feedback pitch error detection/correction process. Our results suggest that modulation of left to right STG connections are important in the identification of self-voice error and sensory motor integration in AP musicians. We also identify reduced connectivity of left hemisphere PM to STG connections in AP and RP groups during the error detection and corrections process relative to non-musicians. We suggest that this suppression may allow for enhanced connectivity relating to pitch identification in the right hemisphere in those with more precise pitch matching abilities. Musicians with enhanced pitch identification abilities likely have an improved auditory error detection and correction system involving connectivity of STG regions. Our findings here also suggest that individuals with AP are more adept at using feedback related to pitch from the right hemisphere.

Mismatch Negativity in essential tremor: Role of age at onset in pre-attentive auditory discrimination	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Essential tremor; MMN; Auditory discrimination; Age at onset; Elderly-onset ET	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; UNIQUE WINDOW; DYSFUNCTION; DEMENTIA; DISORDER; DISEASE; COGNITION; DEFICITS; MATTER	Objective: To investigate whether pre-attentive auditory discrimination is impaired in patients with essential tremor (ET) and to evaluate the role of age at onset in this function. Methods: Seventeen non-demented patients with ET and seventeen age-and sex-matched healthy controls underwent an EEG recording during a classical auditory MMN paradigm. Results: MMN latency was significantly prolonged in patients with elderly-onset ET (> 65 years) (p = 0.046), while no differences emerged in either latency or amplitude between young-onset ET patients and controls. Conclusions: This study represents a tentative indication of a dysfunction of auditory automatic change detection in elderly-onset ET patients, pointing to a selective attentive deficit in this subgroup of ET patients. Significance: The delay in pre-attentive auditory discrimination, which affects elderly-onset ET patients alone, further supports the hypothesis that ET represents a heterogeneous family of diseases united by tremor; these diseases are characterized by cognitive differences that may range from a disturbance in a selective cognitive function, such as the automatic part of the orienting response, to more widespread and complex cognitive dysfunctions.

Participants were instructed to respond to a luminance change in either of two lateralized stimuli that could randomly occur alone or together with an irrelevant orientation change of the same or contralateral stimulus. Task performance based on response times and accuracy was decreased compared to the remaining stimulus conditions when relevant and irrelevant feature changes were presented contralateral to each other (contralateral distractor condition). The sensory response to the feature changes was reflected in a posterior contralateral positivity at around 100 ms after change presentation and a posterior contralateral negativity in the N1 time window (N1pc). N2pc reflected a subsequent attentional bias in favor of the relevant luminance change. The continuation of the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) following N2pc covaried with response times within feature change conditions and revealed a posterior topography comparable to the earlier components associated with sensory and attentional mechanisms. Therefore, this component might reflect the re-processing of information based on sustained short-term memory representations in the visual system until a stable target percept is created that can serve as the perceptual basis for response selection and the initiation of goal-directed behavior.

INITIATORS AND TRIGGERING CONDITIONS FOR ADAPTIVE IN AUTOMATION ADVANCED SMALL MODULAR REACTORS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME SMALL MODULAR REACTORS SYMPOSIUM, 2014			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Small Modular Reactors Symposium 2014	APR 15-17, 2014	Washington, DC	ASME, Nucl Engn Div		Adaptive Automation; Advanced Small Modular Reactors; Automation	SITUATION AWARENESS; SYSTEM; HUMANS	It is anticipated that Advanced Small Modular Reactors (AdvSMRs) will employ high degrees of automation. High levels of automation can enhance system performance, but often at the cost of reduced human performance. Automation can lead to human out-of the loop issues, unbalanced workload, complacency, and other problems if it is not designed properly. Researchers have proposed adaptive automation (defined as dynamic or flexible allocation of functions) as a way to get the benefits of higher levels of automation without the human performance costs. Adaptive automation has the potential to balance operator workload and enhance operator situation awareness by allocating functions to the operators in a way that is sensitive to overall workload and capabilities at the time of operation. However, there still a number of questions regarding how to effectively design adaptive automation to achieve that potential. One of those questions is related to how to initiate (or trigger) a shift in automation in order to provide maximal sensitivity to operator needs without introducing undesirable consequences (such as unpredictable mode changes). Several triggering mechanisms for shifts in adaptive automation have been proposed including: operator initiated, critical events, performance-based, physiological measurement, model-based, and hybrid methods. As part of a larger project to develop design guidance for human-automation collaboration in AdvSMRs, researchers at Idaho National Laboratory have investigated the effectiveness and applicability of each of these triggering mechanisms in the context of AdvSMR. Researchers reviewed the empirical literature on adaptive automation and assessed each triggering mechanism based on the human-system performance consequences of employing that mechanism. Researchers also assessed the practicality and feasibility of using the mechanism in the context of an AdvSMR control room. Results indicate that there are tradeoffs associated with each mechanism, but that some are more applicable to the AdvSMR domain than others. The two mechanisms that consistently improve performance in laboratory studies are operator initiated adaptive automation based on hierarchical task delegation and the Electroencephalogram (EEG) -based measure of engagement. Current EEG methods are intrusive and require intensive analysis; therefore it is not recommended for an AdvSMR control rooms at this time. Researchers also discuss limitations in the existing empirical literature and make recommendations for further research.

The experiment involved two participants planning and performing joint actions (i.e., synchronously lifting and clinking glasses), unimanual individual actions (i.e., lifting and moving a glass as if clinking with another person), and bimanual individual actions. EEG was recorded from one of the participants. We employed a choice reaction paradigm where a visual cue indicated the type of action to be planned, followed 1.5 sec later by a visual go stimulus, prompting the participants to act. We studied attention allocation processes by examining two lateralized EEG components, namely the anterior directing attention negativity and the late directing attention positivity. Action planning processes were examined using the late contingent negative variation and the movement-related potential. The results show that early stages of joint action planning involve dividing attention between locations in space relevant for one's own part of the joint action and locations relevant for one's partner's part of the joint action. At later stages of joint action planning, participants represented in advance their partner's upcoming action in addition to their own action, although not at an effector-specific level. Our study provides electrophysiological evidence supporting the operation of attention sharing processes and predictive self/other action representation during the planning phase of a synchronous joint task.

The review begins with a discussion of how psychopathy and antisocial personality are defined, and how these conditions relate to one another and to violent behavior. A case is made that the relationships psychopathy and ASPD show with violent and aggressive behavior, and similarities and differences in associations of each with physiological measures of various types can be understood in terms of symptomatic features these conditions have in common versus features that distinguish them. Following this, an overview is provided of major lines of evidence emerging from psychophysiological and neuroimaging studies conducted to date on these conditions. The final section of the chapter summarizes what has been learned from these existing studies and discusses implications and directions for future research.

This survey is one of six ZInEP projects (Zurcher Impulsprogramm zur nachhaltigen Entwicklung der Psychiatrie, i.e. the Zurich Program for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services). It parallels the longitudinal Zurich Study with a sample comparable in age and gender, and with similar methodology, including identical instruments. Thus, it is aimed at assessing the change of prevalence rates of common mental disorders and the use of professional help and psychiatric sevices. Moreover, the current survey widens the spectrum of topics by including sociopsychiatric questionnaires on stigma, stress related biological measures such as load and cortisol levels, electroencephalographic (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) examinations with various paradigms, and sociophysiological tests. The structure of the ZInEP Epidemiology Survey entails four subprojects: a short telephone screening using the SCL-27 (n of nearly 10,000), a comprehensive face-to-face interview based on the SPIKE (Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of the Social Consequences for Epidemiology: the main instrument of the Zurich Study) with a stratified sample (n=1500), tests in the Center for Neurophysiology and Sociophysiology (n=227), and a prospective study with up to three follow-up interviews and further measures (n=157). In sum, the four subprojects of the ZInEP Epidemiology Survey deliver a large interdisciplinary database. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Discrete emotions; Affective dimensions; Sequential affective processing; EEG; Lexical decision	CORE AFFECT; PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION; BASIC EMOTIONS; ERP; BAWL	Manipulations of either discrete emotions (e.g. happiness) or affective dimensions (e.g. positivity) have a long tradition in emotion research, but interactive effects have never been studied, based on the assumption that the two underlying theories are incompatible. Recent theorizing suggests, however, that the human brain relies on two affective processing systems, one working on the basis of discrete emotion categories, and the other working along affective dimensions. Presenting participants with an orthogonal manipulation of happiness and positivity in a lexical decision task, the present study meant to test the appropriateness of this assumption in emotion word recognition. Behavioral and electroencephalographic data revealed independent effects for both variables, with happiness affecting the early visual N1 component, while positivity affected an N400-like component and the late positive complex. These results are interpreted as evidence for a sequential processing of affective information, with discrete emotions being the basis for later dimensional appraisal processes.

One phenomenon in this context is the congruency sequence-(Gratton effect), for which different theoretical explanations have been put forward. A critical aspect that differs between these explanations is the expectancy of what will happen in forthcoming trials. In the current study we examine the relevance of expectancy for sequence congruency effects and related neurophysiological processes using a flanker task in which we manipulate the probability that the n + 1 trial presents the same stimulus-response mapping than the n trial. We ask what cognitive subprocesses involved in response selection may be modulated by expectancy effects. To distinguish different subprocesses probably modulated by expectancy effects we use event-related potentials (ERPs) in combination with source localization techniques. The data show that cognitive subprocesses modulated by expectancy depend on the nature of expected transitions between succeeding trials. Expectancy effects only affected trial transitions within the same category (i.e., 'compatible-compatible' and 'incompatible-incompatible'), but not between compatibility categories (i.e., 'compatible-incompatible' and 'incompatible-compatible'). On compatible trial transitions attentional selection processes operating via the precuneus mediated expectancy effects, while on incompatible trial transitions inhibitory processes were modulated that were mediated via the medial and middle frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insular and the parahippocampal gyrus. Conflict monitoring processes per se were not modulated by expectancy effects. The data shows that there are different subprocesses underlying the influence of expectancy on sequence effects during response selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We presented a novel algorithm to enhance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of P300 and applied it in lie detection to increase the classification accuracy. Thirty-four subjects were divided randomly into guilty and innocent groups, and the EEG signals on 14 electrodes were recorded. A novel spatial denoising algorithm (SDA) was proposed to reconstruct the P300 with a high SNR based on independent component analysis. The differences between the proposed method and our/other early published methods mainly lie in the extraction and feature selection method of P300. Three groups of features were extracted from the denoised waves; then, the optimal features were selected by the F-score method. Selected feature samples were finally fed into three classical classifiers to make a performance comparison. The optimal parameter values in the SDA and the classifiers were tuned using a grid-searching training procedure with cross-validation. The support vector machine (SVM) approach was adopted to combine with an F-score because this approach had the best performance. The presented model F-score_SVM reaches a significantly higher classification accuracy for P300 (specificity of 96.05%) and non-P300 (sensitivity of 96.11%) compared with the results obtained without using SDA and compared with the results obtained by other classification models. Moreover, a higher individual diagnosis rate can be obtained compared with previous methods, and the presented method requires only a small number of stimuli in the real testing application.

What's intact and what's not within the mismatch negativity system in schizophrenia	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP; Psychopathological; Cognition; Mismatch negativity	AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; CONDITIONAL INFERENCE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; MMN; PSYCHOSIS; DURATION; DYSFUNCTION; GENERATION	Repetitive patterning facilitates inferences about likely properties of sound to follow. Mismatch negativity (MMN) occurs when sound fails to match an inference. Smaller MMN in schizophrenia indexes deficient gain control (difference in utilizing a limited dynamic range). Although it is clear that this group has a lower limit to MMN size, this study addressed whether smaller MMN indicates impaired perceptual inference. MMN was elicited to four deviants in two sequences: one in which occurrence was random and one in which it was paired. Despite smaller MMN, persons with schizophrenia are equally able to reduce MMN size evoked by a deviant when its occurrence is cued. Results also expose alterations in the evoked response to repeated sounds that appear to be exacerbations of age-related amplitude decline. Since these anomalies impact the computed MMN, they highlight the need to identify all contributions to limits in gain control in schizophrenia.

Reading and writing deficits are well documented, but other cognitive deficits in dyslexia are not as well known. To investigate spatial deficits in children with developmental dyslexia we used a mental rotation test with three types of stimuli (letters, animals, and objects that look like letters) while simultaneously recording electroencephalographs. Behaviorally, it was found that dyslexic children took more time than nondyslexic children to solve the letter' and object' stimuli and that the dyslexic children had a slower mental rotation speed when solving letter' stimuli. The electroencephalographic data demonstrated more negative amplitude modulations for the dyslexic group in the left hemisphere at the time epochs: 200-300, 600-700, 700-800, 800-900, and 900-1000 ms and in the right hemisphere for the time epoch 600-700 and 900-100 ms. In addition, hemispheric group differences were found on the basis of stimuli for the time epoch 600-700 ms in which the processing of letters was lateralized to the left hemisphere for both groups, but the object stimuli was lateralized to the left for nondyslexic and to the right for dyslexic children. These differences support the idea that the behavioral differences found between dyslexic and nondyslexic children may be because of both differences in the early processing of the stimuli and perhaps in the mental rotation itself.

In rare neurological conditions, such a dissociation can be achieved more easily. In the present work, we studied a patient (AC) with a posterior lesion of the corpus callosum (CC), using a combination of behavioural, structural MRI and high-density scalp EEG measures. Given the complete disruption of the posterior half of the CC, we speculated that inter-hemispheric transfer of visual information was only possible through top-down mobilization across the preserved anterior segment of the CC. We designed a matching-to-sample visual task during which this patient was randomly presented with two successive numerical targets (T1 and T2) flashed with either a short or a long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA), each presented within one visual hemifield (HF). Intra-hemispheric processing of visual stimuli was essentially preserved. In sharp contrast, patient's performance was massively impaired during inter-HFs trials with a short-SOA, confirming the lack of fast inter-hemispheric transfer. Crucially, patient AC spontaneously improved his performance in inter-HFs trials with a long-SOA. This behavioral improvement was correlated with a mid-frontal ERP effect occurring during the T1-T2 interval, concomitant with an increase of functional connectivity of this region with distant areas including occipital regions. These results put to light a slow, non-automatic, and frontally mediated route of inter-hemispheric transfer dependent on top-down control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Those control functions are thought to bias the processing of information toward the intended goals. Acute stress is thought to impair these frontal functions through the release of cortisol. In the present study, subjects had to detect a luminance change of a stimulus and ignore more salient but task irrelevant orientation changes. Before the execution of this task, subjects underwent a socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT) or a non-stressful control situation. The SECPT revealed reliable stress response with a significant increase of cortisol and alpha-amylase. Stressed subjects showed higher error rates than controls, particularly in conditions which require top-down control processing to bias the less salient target feature against the more salient and spatially separated distracter. By means of the EEG, subjects who got stressed showed a reduced allocation to the relevant luminance change apparent in a modulation of the N1pc. The following N2pc, which reflects a re-allocation of attentional resources, supports the error pattern. There was only an N2pc in conditions, which required to bias the less salient luminance change. Moreover, this N2pc was decreased as a consequence of the induced stress. These results allow the conclusion that acute stress impairs the intention-based attentional allocation and enhances the stimulus-driven selection, leading to a strong distractibility during attentional information selection.

Prestimulus Oscillations in the Alpha Band of the EEG Are Modulated by the Difficulty of Feature Discrimination and Predict Activation of a Sensory Discrimination Process	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PATTERN-SPECIFIC COMPONENTS; VISUAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOURCE LOCATIONS; EXTRASTRIATE; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; STRIATE; CORTEX	Recent work has demonstrated that the occipital-temporal N1 component of the ERP is sensitive to the difficulty of visual discrimination, in a manner that cannot be explained by simple differences in low-level visual features, arousal, or time on task. These observations provide evidence that the occipital-temporal N1 component is modulated by the application of top-down control. However, the timing of this control process remains unclear. Previous work has demonstrated proactive, top-down modulation of cortical excitability for cued spatial attention or feature selection tasks. Here, the possibility that a similar top-down process facilitates performance of a difficult stimulus discrimination task is explored. Participants performed an oddball task at two levels of discrimination difficulty, with difficulty manipulated by modulating the similarity between target and nontarget stimuli. Discrimination processes and cortical excitability were assessed via the amplitude of the occipital-temporal N1 component and prestimulus alpha oscillation of the EEG, respectively. For correct discriminations, prestimulus alpha power was reduced, and the occipital-temporal N1 was enhanced in the hard relative to the easy condition. Furthermore, within the hard condition, prestimulus alpha power was reduced, and the occipital-temporal N1 was enhanced for correct relative to incorrect discriminations. The generation of ERPs contingent on relative prestimulus alpha power additionally suggests that diminished alpha power preceding stimulus onset is related to enhancement of the occipital-temporal N1. As in spatial attention, proactive control appears to enhance cortical excitability and facilitate discrimination performance in tasks requiring nonspatial, feature-based attention, even in the absence of competing stimulus features.

The number of items of a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) should be adjustable in accordance with the requirements of the specific tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel task-oriented optimal approach aimed at increasing the performance of general P300 BCIs with different numbers of items. Approach. First, we proposed a stimulus presentation with variable dimensions (VD) paradigm as a generalization of the conventional single-character (SC) and row-column (RC) stimulus paradigms. Furthermore, an embedding design approach was employed for any given number of items. Finally, based on the score-P model of each subject, the VD flash pattern was selected by a linear interpolation approach for a certain task. Main results. The results indicate that the optimal BCI design consistently outperforms the conventional approaches, i.e., the SC and RC paradigms. Specifically, there is significant improvement in the practical information transfer rate for a large number of items. Significance. The results suggest that the proposed optimal approach would provide useful guidance in the practical design of general P300-based BCIs.

Here we used scalp EEG to determine the minimal time needed to classify a face as personally familiar or unfamiliar. Go (familiar) and no-go (unfamiliar) responses elicited clear differential waveforms from 210 msec onward, this difference being first observed at right occipito-temporal electrode sites. Similar but delayed (by about 40 msec) responses were observed when go response were required to the unfamiliar rather than familiar faces, in a second group of participants. In both groups, a small increase of amplitude was also observed on the right hemisphere N170 face-sensitive component for familiar faces. However, unlike the post-200 msec differential go/no-go effect, this effect was unrelated to behavior and disappeared with repetition of unfamiliar faces. These observations indicate that accumulation of evidence within the first 200 msec poststimulus onset is sufficient for the human brain to decide whether a person is familiar based on his or her face, a time frame that puts strong constraints on the time course of face processing.

Stimuli consisted of non-verbal affect bursts from the Montreal Affective Voices morphed to parametrically vary acoustical structure and perceived emotional properties. Scalp magnetic fields were recorded in three participants while they performed a 3-alternative forced choice emotion categorization task (Anger, Fear, Pleasure). Each participant performed more than 6000 trials to allow single-subject level statistical analyses using a new toolbox which implements the general linear model (GLM) on stimulus-specific responses (LIMO-EEG). For each participant we estimated "simple" models [including just one affective regressor (Arousal or Valence)] as well as "combined" models (including acoustical regressors). Results from the "simple" models revealed in every participant the significant early effects (as early as similar to 100 ms after onset) of Valence and Arousal already reported at the group-level in previous work. However, the "combined" models showed that few effects of Arousal remained after removing the acoustically-explained variance, whereas significant effects of Valence remained especially at late stages. This study demonstrates (i) that single-subject analyses replicate the results observed at early stages by group-level studies and (ii) the feasibility of GLM-based analysis of MEG data. It also suggests that early modulation of MEG amplitude by affective stimuli partly reflects their acoustical properties.

To date, it is not clear how age affects the respective sensory auditory processing at the pre-attentive level. Here we tested the hypothesis that pre-attentive processing of behaviorally perceptible spatial changes is preserved in older adults. An EEG-study was performed in older adults (65-82 years of age) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm employed. Sequences of frequent standard stimuli of defined azimuthal positions were presented together with rarely occurring deviants shifted by 10 degrees or 20 degrees to the left or to the right of the standard. Standard positions were at +5 degrees (central condition) from the midsagittal plane and at 65 degrees in both lateral hemifields (+/- 65 degrees; lateral condition). The results suggest an effect of laterality on the pre-attentive change processing of spatial deviations in older adults: While for the central conditions deviants close to MAA threshold (i.e., 10 degrees) yielded discernable MMNs, for lateral positions the respective MMN responses were only elicited by spatial deviations of 20 degrees toward the midline (i.e., +/- 45 degrees). Furthermore, MMN amplitudes were found to be insensitive to the magnitude of deviation (10 degrees, 20 degrees), which is contrary to recent studies with young adults (Bennemann et al., 2013) and hints to a deteriorated pre-attentive encoding of sound sources in older adults. The discrepancy between behavioral MAA data and present results are discussed with respect to the possibility that under the condition of active stimulus processing older adults might benefit from recruiting additional attentional top-down processes to detect small magnitudes of spatial deviations even within the lateral acoustic field.

Common Mechanisms of Spatial Attention in Memory and Perception: A Tactile Dual-Task Study	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; attention-based rehearsal; electroencephalography; short-term memory; somatosensation	WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; SOMATOSENSORY RESPONSES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; LOCATIONS; TOUCH; MODULATIONS	Orienting attention to locations in mnemonic representations engages processes that functionally and anatomically overlap the neural circuitry guiding prospective shifts of spatial attention. The attention-based rehearsal account predicts that the requirement to withdraw attention from a memorized location impairs memory accuracy. In a dual-task study, we simultaneously presented retro-cues and pre-cues to guide spatial attention in short-term memory (STM) and perception, respectively. The spatial direction of each cue was independent of the other. The locations indicated by the combined cues could be compatible (same hand) or incompatible (opposite hands). Incompatible directional cues decreased lateralized activity in brain potentials evoked by visual cues, indicating interference in the generation of prospective attention shifts. The detection of external stimuli at the prospectively cued location was impaired when the memorized location was part of the perceptually ignored hand. The disruption of attention-based rehearsal by means of incompatible pre-cues reduced memory accuracy and affected encoding of tactile test stimuli at the retrospectively cued hand. These findings highlight the functional significance of spatial attention for spatial STM. The bidirectional interactions between both tasks demonstrate that spatial attention is a shared neural resource of a capacity-limited system that regulates information processing in internal and external stimulus representations.

A great deal of debate exists regarding ambiguous figures that induce spontaneous switching between rival percepts. To investigate the time course of neural processes underlying such perceptual rivalry, we recorded electroencephalograms associated with participants' perceptions of a Necker cube under ambiguous and unambiguous conditions, using a modified discontinuous-presentation method. Each condition consisted of two stimuli presented consecutively, starting with an unambiguous stimulus in both conditions. The second stimulus was either ambiguous (ambiguous condition) or unambiguous (control condition). We compared endogenous reversal activity of ambiguous stimuli with exogenous reversals. As a result, we found that the right-occipital beta-band activity (16-26 Hz) increased 100-150 ms and 350-450 ms after the onset of the ambiguous stimulus only when the perception of the ambiguous stimulus differed from that of the first stimulus. These results indicate that activity in the right-occipital total beta band reflects endogenous switching between rivaling percepts. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Often the areas to adapt and to monitor progress are selected a priori. Less explored, however, has been the notion of automatically emerging activation in a particular area or subregions within that area recruited above and beyond the rest of the brain. Likewise, the notion of evoking such a signal as an amodal, abstract one remaining robust across different sensory modalities could afford some exploration. Here we develop a simple binary control task in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) and use a Bayesian sparse probit classification algorithm to automatically uncover brain regional activity that maximizes task performance. We trained and tested 19 participants using the visual modality for instructions and feedback. Across training blocks we quantified coupling of the frontoparietal nodes and selective involvement of visual and auditory regions as a function of the real-time sensory feedback. The testing phase under both forms of sensory feedback revealed automatic recruitment of the prefrontal cortex with a parcellation of higher strength levels in Brodmann's areas 9, 10, and 11 significantly above those in other brain areas. We propose that the prefrontal signal may be a neural correlate of externally driven intended direction and discuss our results in the context of various aspects involved in the cognitive control of our thoughts.

In the present study, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory brain responses induced by these factors, using a task in which participants named pictures after reading sentences. Sentence contexts were either constraining or nonconstraining towards the final word, which was presented as a picture. Picture names varied in their frequency of occurrence in the language. Naming latencies and electrophysiological responses were examined as a function of context and lexical frequency. Lexical frequency is an index of our cumulative learning experience with words, so lexical-frequency effects most likely reflect access to memory representations for words. Pictures were named faster with constraining than nonconstraining contexts. Associated with this effect, starting around 400 ms pre-picture presentation, oscillatory power between 8 and 30 Hz was lower for constraining relative to nonconstraining contexts. Furthermore, pictures were named faster with high-frequency than low-frequency names, but only for nonconstraining contexts, suggesting differential ease of memory access as a function of sentential context. Associated with the lexical-frequency effect, starting around 500 ms pre-picture presentation, oscillatory power between 4 and 10 Hz was higher for high-frequency than for low-frequency names, but only for constraining contexts. Our results characterise electrophysiological responses associated with lexical frequency and sentential constraint in spoken word production, and point to new avenues for studying these fundamental factors in language production.

Suppression of irrelevant information, unlike enhancement of relevant information, has been shown to be deficient in aging. Although these attentional mechanisms have been well characterized within the visual modality, little is known about these mechanisms when attention is selectively allocated across sensory modalities. The present EEG study addressed this issue by testing younger and older participants in three different tasks: Participants attended to the visual modality and ignored the auditory modality, attended to the auditory modality and ignored the visual modality, or passively perceived information presented through either modality. We found overall modulation of visual and auditory processing during cross-modal selective attention in both age groups. Top-down modulation of visual processing was observed as a trend toward enhancement of visual information in the setting of auditory distraction, but no significant suppression of visual distraction when auditory information was relevant. Top-down modulation of auditory processing, on the other hand, was observed as suppression of auditory distraction when visual stimuli were relevant, but no significant enhancement of auditory information in the setting of visual distraction. In addition, greater visual enhancement was associated with better recognition of relevant visual information, and greater auditory distractor suppression was associated with a better ability to ignore auditory distraction. There were no age differences in these effects, suggesting that when relevant and irrelevant information are presented through different sensory modalities, selective attention remains intact in older age.

Method: Eighteen children were recruited and examined at the stage of CI initial power-up (M0), as well as several follow-up periods, that is, 1 month (M1), 3 months (M3), and 6 months (M6) after CI power-up. The MMN responses were measured using a 128-Channel Dense Array EEG System. The group average and individual MMN analysis were used to investigate the longitudinal changes of the MMN characteristics. The relationship between MMN characteristics and scores of categories of auditory performance (CAP) was also investigated. Results: Although the MMN incidence was much lower at the periods of M0 and M1, significantly higher MMN incidence was found in M3 and M6. The MMN latencies decreased significantly from M3 to M6, but no significant difference in the amplitudes was found between these periods. There was a negative correlation between the increment of CAP scores and decrement of MMN latency from M3 to M6. Conclusion: MMN incidence increment and latency decrement are likely to be the objective and noninvasive indicators for evaluating auditory central development at an early stage in children after cochlear implantation. Moreover, the latency decrement from M3 to M6 correlated significantly with the increment of the CAP scores, indicating a fast maturation period, which might be a key period for auditory rehabilitation.

J	Kronschnabel, J; Brem, S; Maurer, U; Brandeis, D				Kronschnabel, Jens; Brem, Silvia; Maurer, Urs; Brandeis, Daniel			The level of audiovisual print-speech integration deficits in dyslexia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Multisensory integration; Reading; Phonological deficit; Adolescence; Superior temporal; Planum temporale	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; AUDITORY-CORTEX; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL RESPONSE; MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN MECHANISMS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CHILDREN LEARN; READING SKILL	The classical phonological deficit account of dyslexia is increasingly linked to impairments in graphophonological conversion, and to dysfunctions in superior temporal regions associated with audiovisual integration. The present study investigates mechanisms of audiovisual integration in typical and impaired readers at the critical developmental stage of adolescence. Congruent and incongruent audiovisual as well as unimodal (visual only and auditory only) material was presented. Audiovisual presentations were single letters and three-letter (consonant-vowel-consonant) stimuli accompanied by matching or mismatching speech sounds. Three-letter stimuli exhibited fast phonetic transitions as in real-life language processing and reading. Congruency effects, i.e. different brain responses to congruent and incongruent stimuli were taken as an indicator of audiovisual integration at a phonetic level (grapho-phonological conversion). Comparisons of unimodal and audiovisual stimuli revealed basic, more sensory aspects of audiovisual integration. By means of these two criteria of audiovisual integration, the generalizability of audiovisual deficits in dyslexia was tested. Moreover, it was expected that the more naturalistic three-letter stimuli are superior to single letters in revealing group differences. Electrophysiological and hemodynamic (EEG and fMRI) data were acquired simultaneously in a simple target detection task. Applying the same statistical models to event-related EEG potentials and fMRI responses allowed comparing the effects detected by the two techniques at a descriptive level. Group differences in congruency effects (congruent against incongruent) were observed in regions involved in grapho-phonological processing, including the left inferior frontal and angular gyri and the inferotemporal cortex. Importantly, such differences also emerged in superior temporal key regions. Three-letter stimuli revealed stronger group differences than single letters. No significant differences in basic measures of audiovisual integration emerged. Convergence of hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals appeared to be limited and mainly occurred for highly significant and large effects in visual cortices. The findings suggest efficient superior temporal tuning to audiovisual congruency in controls. In impaired readers, however, grapho-phonological conversion is effortful and inefficient, although basic audiovisual mechanisms seem intact. This unprecedented demonstration of audiovisual deficits in adolescent dyslexics provides critical evidence that the phonological deficit might be explained by impaired audiovisual integration at a phonetic level, especially for naturalistic and word-like stimulation.

The critical electrode contact was located in the most posterior face-selective brain area of the human brain (right "occipital face area", rOFA) as shown both by low- (ERP) and high-frequency (gamma) electrophysiological responses as well as a face localizer in fMRI. At this electrode contact, periodic visual presentation of 6 different faces by second evoked a larger electrophysiological periodic response at 6 Hz than when the same face identity was repeated at the same rate. This intracerebral EEG repetition suppression effect was markedly reduced when face stimuli were presented upside-down, a manipulation that impairs individual face discrimination. These findings provide original evidence for a causal relationship between the face-selective right inferior occipital cortex and individual face discrimination, independently of long-term memory representations. More generally, they support the functional value of electrophysiological repetition suppression effects, indicating that these effects can be used as an index of a necessary neural representation of the changing stimulus property.

Previous findings suggest impairment of inhibitory control, specifically a regulatory deficit in the lateral prefrontal circuitry that is associated with a compulsion for food. As demonstrated by three previous studies, bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (anode right/cathode left) reduces food craving and caloric intake. We designed the present study to evaluate the neural mechanisms that underlie these effects. We replicated the design of one of these previous studies but included electroencephalographic assessments to register evoked potentials in a Go/No-go task that contained pictures of food and furniture (a control visual stimulus). We collected data from nine women (mean age = 23.4 +/- 2 years) in a crossover experiment. We observed that active DLPFC tDCS (anode right/cathode left), compared with sham stimulation, reduced the frontal N2 component and enhanced the P3a component of responses to No-go stimuli, regardless of the stimulus condition (food or furniture). Active tDCS was also associated with a reduction in caloric intake. We discuss our findings in the context of cortico-subcortical processing of craving and tDCS effects on inhibitory control neural circuitry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, precise attentional mechanisms gating encoding and maintenance in VSTM and across development remain less well understood. We recorded EEG while adults and 10-year-olds used cues to guide attention before encoding or while maintaining items in VSTM. Known neural markers of spatial orienting to incoming percepts, that is, Early Directing Attention Negativity, Anterior Directing Attention Negativity, and Late Directing Attention Positivity, were examined in the context of orienting within VSTM. Adults elicited a set of neural markers that were broadly similar in preparation for encoding and during maintenance. In contrast, in children these processes dissociated. Furthermore, in children, individual differences in the amplitude of neural markers of prospective orienting related to individual differences in VSTM capacity, suggesting that children with high capacity are more efficient at selecting information for encoding into VSTM. Finally, retrospective, but not prospective, orienting in both age groups elicited the well-known marker of visual search (N2pc), indicating the recruitment of additional neural circuits when orienting during maintenance. Developmental and individual differences differentiate seemingly similar processes of orienting to perceptually available representations and to representations held in VSTM.

Typically, users must perform each mental task for two or more seconds before their brain activity is distinct enough for accurate classification. In P300 BCIs, this usually entails silently counting specific flashes three or more times. Although numerous articles have explored the prospect of a P300 BCI that relies on only one flash, results consistently show that the resulting accuracy would be too low for effective communication. The goal of this article was to introduce a new way to reduce the time to identify a message or command. Instead of relying on brain activity from one subject, our system utilized brain activity from eight subjects performing a single trial. Hence, the system could rely on an average based on eight trials, which is more than sufficient for adequate classification, even though each subject contributed only one trial. Results confirmed that all eight subjects could not have attained effective control with a single trial, but could attain 100% accuracy when the other seven subjects' data were also used. This is the first time that people worked together to accomplish a goal with a BCI, and could encourage future research into collaborative brain-based communication and control.

Deconvolution of overlapping cortical auditory evoked potentials recorded using short stimulus onset-asynchrony ranges	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Least-squares deconvolution; Cortical auditory evoked potential; Stimulus onset-asynchrony; Alternating stimulus frequency	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY; CORTEX; SOUND; SPECIFICITY; HABITUATION; RESPONSES; WAVE; ERP	Objective: The first aim of this study is to validate the theoretical framework of least-squares (LS) deconvolution on experimental data. The second is to investigate the waveform morphology of the cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) for five stimulus onset-asynchronies (SOAs) and effects of alternating stimulus frequency in normally hearing adults. Methods: Eleven adults (19-55 years) with normal hearing were investigated using tone-burst stimuli of 500 and 2000 Hz with SOAs jittered around 150, 250, 450, and 850 ms in a paired-interval paradigm with fixed or alternating stimulus frequency. Results: The LS deconvolution technique disentangled the overlapping responses, which then provided the following insights. The CAEP amplitude reached a minimum value for SOAs jittered around 450 ms, in contrast with significantly larger amplitudes for SOAs jittered around 150 and 850 ms. Despite this, longer latencies of N1 and P2 consistently occurred for decreasing SOAs. Alternating stimulus frequency significantly increased the amplitude of the CAEP response and decreased latencies for SOAs jittered around 150 ms. Effects of SOAs and alternating stimuli on CAEP amplitude can be modelled using a quantitative model of latent inhibition. Conclusions: LS deconvolution allows correction for cortical response overlap. The amplitude of the CAEP is sensitive to SOA and stimulus frequency alternation. Significance: CAEPs are emerging as an important tool in the objective evaluation of hearing aid and cochlear implant fittings. Responses to closely spaced stimuli provide objective information about integration and inhibition mechanisms in the auditory cortex. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The Decoupled Mind: Mind-wandering Disrupts Cortical Phase-locking to Perceptual Events	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; SYNCHRONY; ATTENTION; THOUGHT; BRAIN; TASK; PERFORMANCE	The mind flows in a stream of consciousness, which often neglects immediate sensory input in favor of focusing on intrinsic, self-generated thoughts or images. Although considerable research has documented the disruptive influences of task-unrelated thought for perceptual processing and task performance, the brain dynamics associated with these phenomena are not well understood. Here we investigate the possibility, suggested by several convergent lines of research, that task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the trial-to-trial phase consistency of the oscillatory neural signal in response to perceptual input. Using an experience sampling paradigm coupled with continuous high-density electroencephalography, we observed that task-unrelated thought was associated with a reduction of the P1 ERP, replicating prior observations that mind-wandering is accompanied by a reduction of the brain-evoked response to sensory input. Time-frequency analysis of the oscillatory neural response revealed a decrease in theta-band cortical phase-locking, which peaked over parietal scalp regions. Furthermore, we observed that task-unrelated thought impacted the oscillatory mode of the brain during the initiation of a task-relevant action, such that more cortical processing was required to meet task demands. Together, these findings document that the attenuation of perceptual processing that occurs during task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the temporal fidelity with which the brain responds to a stimulus and suggest that increased neural processing may be required to recouple attention to a task. More generally, these data provide novel confirmatory evidence for the mechanisms through which attentional states facilitate the neural processing of sensory input.

Motor imagery-induced EEG patterns in individuals with spinal cord injury and their impact on brain-computer interface accuracy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		brain-computer interface; spinal cord injury; motor imagery; electroencephalogram	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; HAND; NEUROPROSTHESIS; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PATIENT; PEOPLE; STATES; GRASP; MODE	Objective. Assimilating the diagnosis complete spinal cord injury (SCI) takes time and is not easy, as patients know that there is no 'cure' at the present time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can facilitate daily living. However, inter-subject variability demands measurements with potential user groups and an understanding of how they differ to healthy users BCIs are more commonly tested with. Thus, a three-class motor imagery (MI) screening (left hand, right hand, feet) was performed with a group of 10 able-bodied and 16 complete spinal-cord-injured people (paraplegics, tetraplegics) with the objective of determining what differences were present between the user groups and how they would impact upon the ability of these user groups to interact with a BCI. Approach. Electrophysiological differences between patient groups and healthy users are measured in terms of sensorimotor rhythm deflections from baseline during MI, electroencephalogram microstate scalp maps and strengths of inter-channel phase synchronization. Additionally, using a common spatial pattern algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis classifier, the classification accuracy was calculated and compared between groups. Main results. It is seen that both patient groups (tetraplegic and paraplegic) have some significant differences in event-related desynchronization strengths, exhibit significant increases in synchronization and reach significantly lower accuracies (mean (M) = 66.1%) than the group of healthy subjects (M = 85.1%). Significance. The results demonstrate significant differences in electrophysiological correlates of motor control between healthy individuals and those individuals who stand to benefit most from BCI technology (individuals with SCI). They highlight the difficulty in directly translating results from healthy subjects to participants with SCI and the challenges that, therefore, arise in providing BCIs to such individuals.

Methods: The subjects were 16 adult women with migraine and 16 normal controls. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained during PAS with standard (SS) and deviant stimuli (DS) were used. Alpha ERS fading, the phase locking index (PLI) and de-locking index (DLI) were evaluated from the 10 Hz complex Morlet wavelet components at 100 ms (t100) and 300 ms (t300) after PAS. Results: At t100, significant ERS was found with SS and DS in the migraineurs and controls (P = 0.000). At t300 in the controls, ERS faded to zero for DS while in the migraineurs there was no fading for DS. In both groups the PLI for SS and DS was significantly reduced, i.e. de-locked, at t300 compared to t100 (P = 0.000). In the migraineurs, the DLI for DS was significantly lower than in the controls (P = 0.003). Conclusion: The alpha ERS fading and phase de-locking are defective in migraineurs during passive auditory cognitive processing. Significance: The defects in timely alpha ERS fading and in de-locking may play a role in the different attention processing in migraine patients.

It increases when previous predictions are not accurate and in contexts with high environmental uncertainty. Previous fMRI studies have shown an important role of medial pFC in coding both reward prediction errors and the impact of this information to guide future decisions. However, it is unclear whether these two processes are dissociated in time or occur simultaneously, suggesting that a common mechanism is engaged. In the present work, we studied the modulation of two electro-physiological responses associated to outcome processing-the feedback-related negativity ERP and frontocentral theta oscillatory activity-with the reward prediction error and the learning rate. Twenty-six participants performed two learning tasks differing in the degree of predictability of the outcomes: a reversal learning task and a probabilistic learning task with multiple blocks of novel cue-outcome associations. We implemented a reinforcement learning model to obtain the single-trial reward prediction error and the learning rate for each participant and task. Our results indicated that midfrontal theta activity and feedback-related negativity increased linearly with the unsigned prediction error. In addition, variations of frontal theta oscillatory activity predicted the learning rate across tasks and participants. These results support the existence of a common brain mechanism for the computation of unsigned prediction error and learning rate.

Feedback is especially important for learning in early childhood, as toddlers strongly rely on external signals to determine the consequences of their actions. In adults, many electrophysiological studies have elucidated feedback processes using a neural marker called the feedback-related negativity (FRN). The neural generator of the FRN is assumed to be the ACC, located in medial frontal cortex. As frontal brain regions are the latest to mature during brain development, it is unclear when in early childhood a functional feedback system develops. Is feedback differentiated on a neural level in toddlers and in how far is neural feedback processing related to children's behavioral adjustment? In an EEG experiment, we addressed these questions by measuring the brain activity and behavioral performance of 2.5-year-old toddlers while they played a feedback-guided game on a touchscreen. Electrophysiological results show differential brain activity for feedback with a more negative deflection for incorrect than correct outcomes, resembling the adult FRN. This provides the first neural evidence for feedback processing in toddlers. Notably, FRN amplitudes were predictive of adaptive behavior: the stronger the differential brain activity for feedback, the better the toddlers' adaptive performance during the game. Thus, already in early childhood toddlers' feedback-guided performance directly relates to the functionality of their neural feedback processing. Implications for early feedback-based learning as well as structural and functional brain development are discussed.	[Meyer, Marlene; Bekkering, Harold; Janssen, Denise J.

Diagnostic delays in children with early onset epilepsy: Impact, reasons, and opportunities to improve care	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Health services; Barriers to care; Pediatrics; Development	ADAPTIVE-BEHAVIOR; EEG; SEIZURE; SURGERY; TIME; ACCESS; AGE	PurposeDelayed diagnosis of early onset epilepsy is a potentially important and avoidable complication in epilepsy care. We examined the frequency of diagnostic delays in young children with newly presenting epilepsy, their developmental impact, and reasons for delays. MethodsChildren who developed epilepsy before their third birthday were identified in a prospective community-based cohort. An interval 1month from second seizure to diagnosis was considered a delay. Testing of development at baseline and for up to 3years after and of intelligence quotient (IQ) 8-9years later was performed. Detailed parental baseline interview accounts and medical records were reviewed to identify potential reasons for delays. Factors associated with delays included the parent, child, pediatrician, neurologist, and scheduling. ResultsDiagnostic delays occurred in 70 (41%) of 172 children. Delays occurred less often if children had received medical attention for the first seizure (p<0.0001), previously had neonatal or febrile seizures (p=0.02), had only convulsions before diagnosis (p=0.005), or had a college-educated parent (p=0.01). A 1month diagnostic delay was associated with an average 7.4 point drop (p=0.02) in the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior motor score. The effect was present at diagnosis, persisted for at least 3years, and was also apparent in IQ scores 8-9years later, which were lower in association with a diagnostic delay by 8.4 points (p=0.06) for processing speed up to 14.5 points (p=0.004) for full scale IQ, after adjustment for parental education and other epilepsy-related clinical factors. Factors associated with delayed diagnosis included parents not recognizing events as seizures (N=47), pediatricians missing or deferring diagnosis (N=15), neurologists deferring diagnosis (N=7), and scheduling problems (N=11). SignificanceDiagnostic delays occur in many young children with epilepsy. They are associated with substantial decrements in development and IQ later in childhood. Several factors influence diagnostic delays and may represent opportunities for intervention and improved care.

THE COGNITIVE AND NEURAL TIME COURSE OF EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY: AN ELECTRICAL NEUROIMAGING STUDY ON SELF-OTHER INTERACTION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						empathy; sympathy; simulation; mentalizing; visuo-spatial mechanisms; cortical dynamics	SHARED MANIFOLD HYPOTHESIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIRROR NEURON; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; HUMAN BRAIN; MECHANISMS; PREMOTOR; FMRI	Although extensively investigated in sociocognitive neuroscience, empathy is difficult to study. The first difficulty originates in its multifaceted nature. According to the multidimensional model, empathy combines emotional, automatic (simulation), cognitive (mentalizing) and regulatory (executive functions) processes. Substantial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data demonstrated that co-activations in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and mentalizing network (MENT) sustain this co-recruitment of so-called first-and second-person-like processes. Because of the poor temporal resolution of fMRI techniques, we currently lack evidence about the precise timing of the MNS-MENT combination. An important challenge is, thus, to disentangle how MNS and MENT dynamically work together along time in empathy. Moreover, the role of the executive functions in the MNS-MENT combination time course is still unknown. Second, empathy - feeling into - is closely related to sympathy - feeling with - and both phenomena are often conflated in experimental studies on intersubjectivity. In this electrical neuroimaging (EEG) pilot-study, we tested whether the egocentered vs. heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms respectively associated with sympathy and empathy differentially modulate the dynamic combination of the MNS-MENT activations in their respective neural time course. For that, we employed our newly developed behavioral paradigm assessing the visuospatial - but not emotional - features of empathy and sympathy. Using a data-driven approach, we report that empathy and sympathy are underlied by sequential activations in the MNS from the insula to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) between 63 ms and 424 ms. However, at 333-424 ms, empathy triggered greater co-activations in the right IFG and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (executive functions). Linking together our present and prior (Thirioux et al., 2010) findings from the same dataset, we suggest that this greater recruitment of the right dlPFC monitors the shift from egocentered and first-person-like mechanisms in the MNS to heterocentered and second-person-like mechanisms in the left temporo-parietal junction within the MENT, i.e., reflecting the onset of perspective-change processes in the neural time course of empathy. Contrasting with sympathy, this recruitment of the executive functions could modulate the output end of the mirroring processing in the premotor and sensorimotor cortices. (C) 2014 IBRO.

According to current theories, a series of successive stages consisting of the registration, identification, and categorization of the sound has to be completed before participants are able to report the sound as a target by button press after similar to 300-500 ms. Here we use miniature eye movements as a tool to study the categorization of a sound as a target or nontarget, indicating that an initial categorization is present already after 80-100 ms. During visual fixation, the rate of microsaccades, the fastest components of miniature eye movements, is transiently modulated after auditory stimulation. In two experiments, we measured microsaccade rates in human participants in an auditory three-tone oddball paradigm (including rare nontarget sounds) and observed a difference in the microsaccade rates between targets and nontargets as early as 142 ms after sound onset. This finding was replicated in a third experiment with directed saccades measured in a paradigm in which tones had to be matched to score-like visual symbols. Considering the delays introduced by (motor) signal transmission and data analysis constraints, the brain must have differentiated target from nontarget sounds as fast as 80-100 ms after sound onset in both paradigms. We suggest that predictive information processing for expected input makes higher cognitive attributes, such as a sound's identity and category, available already during early sensory processing. The measurement of eye movements is thus a promising approach to investigate hearing.

J	Engell, AD; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; McCarthy, Gregory			Repetition Suppression of Face-Selective Evoked and Induced EEG Recorded From Human Cortex	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						ECoG; ERP; face; alpha; gamma; vision; repetition suppression	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; BOLD SIGNAL; ADAPTATION; FMRI; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATIONS; STIMULATION; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY	In functional MRI studies, repetition suppression refers to the reduction of hemodynamic activation to repeated stimulus presentation. For example, the repeated presentation of a face reduces the hemodynamic response evoked by faces in the fusiform gyrus. The neural events that underlie repetition suppression are not well understood. Indeed, in contrast to the hemodynamic response, the face-specific N200 recorded from subdural electrodes on the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, primarily along the fusiform gyrus, has been reported to be insensitive to face-identity repetition. We have previously described a face-specific broadband gamma (30-100 Hz) response at ventral face-specific N200 sites that is functionally dissociable from the N200. In this study, we investigate whether gamma and other components of the electroencephalogram spectrum are affected by face-identity repetition independently of the N200. Participants viewed sequentially presented identical faces. At sites on and around the fusiform gyrus, we found that face repetition modulated alpha (8-12 Hz), low-gamma (30-60 Hz), and high-gamma (60-100 Hz) synchrony, but not the N200. These findings provide evidence of a spatially co-localized progression of face processing. Whereas the N200 reflects an initial obligatory response that is less sensitive to face-identity repetition, the subsequent spectral fluctuations reflect more elaborative face processing and are thus sensitive to face novelty. It is notable that the observed modulations were different for different frequency bands. We observed repetition suppression of broadband gamma, but repetition enhancement of alpha synchrony. This difference is discussed with regard to an existing model of repetition suppression and behavioral repetition priming. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The N400, a neural measure of semantic processing, is found to be reduced in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if individuals with other psychoses (e.g., mood disorders or substance abuse with psychotic features) also show this impairment, and whether N400 reduction relates to real-world functioning and recovery. Methods: Eighty-nine individuals from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a longitudinal study of first-admission psychosis, and 35 healthy adults were assessed using matched, related, and unrelated picture-word pairs to elicit the N400. Patients' real-world functioning, symptomatology, and recovery were tracked since first hospitalization; EEG assessment was completed during year 15 of the study. Results: Participants with schizophrenia had slower reaction times and reduced N400 to semantically incongruent stimuli relative to healthy participants. Schizophrenia and other psychoses did not differ on N400, suggesting that N400 abnormalities characterize psychosis broadly. When grouped by recovery status, patients who remained ill had a significantly blunted N400, while those who recovered did not differ from healthy adults. Few patients with schizophrenia achieved recovery; therefore recovery results are limited to the other psychosis group. Furthermore, reduced N400 and increased reaction times correlated with greater psychotic symptoms, worse global assessment of functioning scores, unemployment, and impaired social functioning. Conclusions: Abnormalities in the N400 are not specific to schizophrenia; in addition, the N400 may be a useful neural correlate of recovery and real-world functioning across psychotic disorders.

Still, the bulk of existing neuroscientific investigations of the amygdala relies on conventional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, which are very useful but subject to limitations. These limitations are particular to their temporal resolution, but also to their spatial precision at a very fine-grained level. Here, we review studies investigating the functional profile of the human amygdala using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), an invasive technique with high temporal and spatial precision. We conducted a systematic literature review of 47 iEEG studies investigating the human amygdala, and we focus on two content-related domains and one process-related domain: (1) memory formation and retrieval; (2) affective processing; and (3) latency components. This review reveals the human amygdala to engage in invariant semantic encoding and recognition of specific objects and individuals, independent of context or visuospatial attributes, and to discriminate between familiar and novel stimuli. The review highlights the amygdala's role in emotion processing witnessed in differential treatment of social-affective facial cues, differential neuronal firing to relevant novel stimuli, and habituation to familiar affective stimuli. Overall, the review suggests the amygdala plays a key role in the processing of affective relevance. Finally, this review delineates effects on amygdala neuronal activity into three time latency windows (post-stimulus onset). The early window (similar to 50-290 msec) subsumes effects respective to exogenous stimulus-driven affective processing of faces and emotion. The intermediate window (similar to 270-470 msec) comprises effects related to explicit attention to novel task-relevant stimuli, irrespective of sensory modality. The late window (similar to 600-1400 msec) subsumes effects from tasks soliciting semantic associations and working memory during affective processing. We juxtapose these iEEG data with current clinical topics relevant to amygdala activation and propose avenues for future investigation of the amygdala using iEEG methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason most of BCIs are designed in a subject-dependent approach using data of healthy subjects. The developing of subject-independent systems is an option to decrease the required training sessions to design a BCI with patient functionality. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study to evaluate subject-independent system based on hand motor imagery taking gender into account. Methods: Subject-Independent BCIs are proposed using Common Spatial Patterns and log variance features of two groups of healthy subjects; one of the groups was composed by people of male gender and the other one by people of female gender. The performance of the developed gender-specific BCI designs was evaluated with respect to a subject-independent BCI designed without taking gender into account, and afterwards its performance was evaluated with data of two healthy subjects that were not included in the initial sample. As an additional test to probe the potential use for subcortical stroke patients we applied the methodology to two patients with right hand weakness. T-test was employed to determine the significance of the difference between traditional approach and the proposed gender-specific approach. Results: For most of the tested conditions, the gender-specific BCIs have a statistically significant better performance than those that did not take gender into account. It was also observed that with a BCI designed with log-variance features in the alpha and beta band of healthy subjects' data, it was possible to classify hand motor imagery of subcortical stroke patients above the practical level of chance. Conclusions: A larger subjects' sample test may be necessary to improve the performances of the gender-specific BCIs and to further test this methodology on different patients. The reduction of complexity in the implementation of BCI systems could bring these systems closer to applications such as controlling devices for the motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, and therefore, contribute to a more effective neurological rehabilitation.

An electrophysiological exploration of comic situation processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERPs; Humour; Facial expression; Emotion; Misfortune	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN RESPONSE; HUMOR; FACE; COMPREHENSION; PICTURES; APPRECIATION	The goal of the present study was to shed some light on a particular kind of humour, called slapstick, by measuring brain bioelectrical activity during the perception of funny vs. non-funny pictures involving misfortunate circumstances. According to our hypothesis, the element mostly providing a comic feature in a misfortunate situation is the facial expression of the victims: the observer's reaction will usually be laughing only if the victims will show a funny bewilderment face and not a painful or anger expression. Several coloured photographs depicting people involved in misfortunate situations were presented to 30 Italian healthy volunteers, while their EEG was recorded. Three different situations were considered: people showing a painful or an angry expression (Affective); people showing a bewilderment expression and, so, a comic look (Comic); people engaged in similar misfortunate situations but with no face visible (No Face). Results showed that the mean amplitude of both the posterior N170 and anterior N220 components was much larger in amplitude to comic pictures, than the other stimuli. This early response could be considered the first identification of a comic element and evidence of the compelling and automatic response that usually characterizes people amused reaction during a misfortune. In addition, we observed a larger P300 amplitude in response to comic than affective pictures, probably reflecting a more conscious processing of the comic element. Finally, no face pictures elicited an anteriorly distributed N400, which might reflect the effort to comprehend the nature of the situation displayed without any affective facial information, and a late positivity, possibly indexing a re-analysis processing of the unintelligible misfortunate situation (comic or unhappy) depicted in the No Face stimuli. These data support the hypothesis that the facial expression of the victims acts as a specific trigger for the amused feeling that observers usually experience when someone falls down. Overall, the data indicate the existence of a neural circuit that is capable of recognize and appreciate the comic element of a misfortunate situation in a group of young adults.
