Since the neuroIS field's genesis, several neuroIS papers have been published. Investigating empirical papers published in scientific journals and conference proceedings reveals that electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool. Thus, considering its relevance in contemporary research and the fact that it will also play a major role in future neuroIS research, we describe EEG from a layman's perspective. Because previous EEG descriptions in the neuroIS literature have only scantily outlined theoretical and methodological aspects related to this tool, we urgently need a more thorough one. As such, we inform IS scholars about the fundamentals of EEG in a compact way and discuss EEG's potential for IS research. Based on the knowledge base provided in this paper, IS researchers can make an informed decision about whether EEG could, or should, become part of their toolbox.

ERP components, such as the P300 wave, which are involved in the process of decision-making, help scientists diagnose specific cognitive disabilities. New method: In this study, we utilize the angles between multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) subspaces in different frequency bands, as a similarity factor for studying the spatial coherency between ERP frequency responses. A matched filter is used to enhance the ERP from background EEG. Results: While previous researches have focused on frequencies below 10 Hz, as the major frequency band of ERP, it is shown that by using the proposed method, significant ERP-related information can also be found in the 25-40 Hz band. These frequency bands are selected by calculating the correlation coefficient between P300 response segments and synthetic EEG, and ERP segments without P300 waves, and by rejecting the bands having the most association with background EEG and non-P300 components. Comparison with existing methods: The significance of the results is assessed by real EEG acquired in brain computer interface experiments versus synthetic EEG produced by existing methods in the literature, to assure that the results are not systematic side effects of the proposed framework. Conclusions: The overall results show that the equivalent dipoles corresponding to narrow-band events in the brain are spatially coherent within different (not necessarily adjacent) frequency bands. The results of this study can lead into novel perspectives in ERP studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet no widely used method exists for comparing variability in ordered collections of single-trial data epochs across conditions and subjects. New method: We have developed a method based on an ERP-image visualization tool in which potential, spectral power, or some other measure at each time point in a set of event-related single-trial data epochs are represented as color coded horizontal lines that are then stacked to form a 2-D colored image. Moving-window smoothing across trial epochs can make otherwise hidden event-related features in the data more perceptible. Stacking trials in different orders, for example ordered by subject reaction time, by context-related information such as inter-stimulus interval, or some other characteristic of the data (e.g., latency-window mean power or phase of some EEG source) can reveal aspects of the multifold complexities of trial-to-trial EEG data variability. Results: This study demonstrates new methods for computing and visualizing 'grand' ERP-image plots across subjects and for performing robust statistical testing on the resulting images. These methods have been implemented and made freely available in the EEGLAB signal-processing environment that we maintain and distribute. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The higher computation burden of EMD processing is the main obstacle in online implementation of brain-computer interfacing (BCI). To resolve such limitation, multivariate wavelet transform with higher computation speed is introduced in this paper to decompose multichannel EEG signals into a finite set of subbands. The energy based subband filtering is implemented to separate the higher frequency noise components to clean the noisy event-related potential (ERP) signals. An auditory oddball BCI experiment is conducted to test cleaning performance followed by the BCI classification of single trial ERP using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results illustrate that the classification performance is increased noticeably with the cleaned single-trial ERP data using proposed algorithm. It requires lower computational cost compared to EMD based cleaning approach.	[Molla, Md.

Simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI might be helpful in reconciling surface ERPs with hemodynamic activations in medial temporal lobe structures related to recognition memory. EEG and imaging studies provide evidence for two independent processes underlying recognition memory, namely recollection and familiarity. Recollection reflects the conscious retrieval of contextual information about a specific episode, while familiarity refers to an acontextual feeling of knowing. Both processes were related to two spatiotemporally different ERP effects, namely the early mid-frontal old/new effect (familiarity) and the late parietal old new effect (recollection). We conducted an exploratory simultaneous EEG-fMRI study using a recognition memory paradigm to investigate which brain activations are modulated in relation to the ERP old/new effects. To this end we examined 17 participants in a yes/no recognition task with word stimuli. Single-trial amplitudes of ERP old/new effects were related to the hemodynamic signal in an EEG-informed fMRI analysis for a subset of 12 subjects. FMRI activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right intraparietal sulcus was associated with the amplitude of the early frontal old/new effect (350-550 ms), and activation in the right posterior hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex and retrosplenial cortex was associated with the amplitude of the late parietal old new effect (580-750 ms). These results provide the first direct link between electrophysiological and hemodynamic correlates of familiarity and recollection. Moreover, these findings in healthy subjects complement data from intracranial ERP recordings in epilepsy patients and lesion studies in hypoxia patients. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep or resting-state conditions and event-related potentials (ERPs) have not only been used to discriminate patients from healthy subjects, but also for the prediction of treatment outcome in various psychiatric diseases, yielding information about tailored therapy approaches for an individual. This review focuses on baseline EEG markers for two psychiatric conditions, namely major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It covers potential biomarkers from EEG sleep research and vigilance regulation, paroxysmal EEG patterns and epileptiform discharges, quantitative EEG features within the EEG main frequency bands, connectivity markers and ERP components that might help to identify favourable treatment outcome. Further, the various markers are discussed in the context of their potential clinical value and as research domain criteria, before giving an outline for future studies that are needed to pave the way to an electrophysiological biomarker-based personalized medicine.

Previous work has demonstrated that a commercial gaming electroencephalography (EEG) system, Emotiv EPOC, can be adjusted to provide valid auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults that are comparable to ERPs recorded by a research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan. The aim of the current study was to determine if the same was true for children. Method. An adapted Emotiv EPOC system and Neuroscan system were used to make simultaneous EEG recordings in nineteen 6-to 12-year-old children under "passive" and "active" listening conditions. In the passive condition, children were instructed to watch a silent DVD and ignore 566 standard (1,000 Hz) and 100 deviant (1,200 Hz) tones. In the active condition, they listened to the same stimuli, and were asked to count the number of `high' (i.e., deviant) tones. Results. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) indicated that the ERP morphology recorded with the two systems was very similar for the P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERP peaks (r =.82 to.95) in both passive and active conditions, and less so, though still strong, for mismatch negativity ERP component (MMN; r =.67 to.74). There were few differences between peak amplitude and latency estimates for the two systems. Conclusions. An adapted EPOC EEG system can be used to index children's late auditory ERP peaks (i.e., P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) and theirMMNERP component.

Resting EEG and ERPs findings in methadone-substituted opiate users: a review	ACTA NEUROLOGICA BELGICA			English	Review						Methadone; Opiates; EEG; ERP; Review	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIV RISK BEHAVIOR; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DEPENDENT SUBJECTS; DECISION-MAKING; MAINTENANCE; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; ADDICTS; DETOXIFICATION	Methadone has been used to treat opiate dependence since the mid-1960s. Despite its clinical effectiveness there is evidence from neuropsychological studies demonstrating that its long-term use might have negative effects on cognition. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the observed cognitive impairments in patients undertaking methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) are solely attributable to the pharmacological effects of methadone, as suggested by some researchers. Determining the effects of MMT on neuropsychological function using electroencephalography (EEG) combined with event-related potentials (ERP) has been used infrequently. However EEG and ERP provide a means of closely examining information processing to determine whether MMT induces any deficits. The purpose of this review was to investigate whether psychophysiological evidence supports cognitive impairment in association with MMT by focusing on research using EEG and ERPs. The findings of EEG studies to date appear not support the notion that cognitive impairments are attributable to the specific pharmacological effects of methadone suggested by some neuropsychological studies. However, due to the methodological deficits and limited number of the studies, any conclusion based on the findings of the existing EEG studies should be avoided.

Objective measures that are extracted from neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) could be a potential solution to this problem. This approach is achieved by the successful prediction of antidepressant treatment efficacy early in the patient's care. EEG-based relevant research studies have shown promising results. These studies are based on derived measures from EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs), which are called neurophysiological predictive biomarkers for MDD. This paper seeks to provide a detailed review on such research studies along with their possible limitations. In addition, this paper provides a comparison of these methods based on EEG/ERP common datasets from MDD and healthy controls. This paper also proposes recommendations to improve these methods, e.g., EEG integration with other modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG), to achieve better evidence of the efficacy than EEG alone, to eventually improve the treatment selection process.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS): Two Overlapping Disorders Reviewed through Electroencephalography-What Can be Interpreted from the Available Information?	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						autism spectrum disorders; Fragile X Syndrome; electroencephalography; Event Related Potentials; resting state EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; MENTAL-RETARDATION; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG COHERENCE; RESTING-STATE; MOUSE MODEL	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are neurodevelopmental disorders with different but potentially related neurobiological underpinnings, which exhibit significant overlap in their behavioural symptoms. FXS is a neurogenetic disorder of known cause whereas ASD is a complex genetic disorder, with both rare and common genetic risk factors and likely genetic and environmental interaction effects. A comparison of the phenotypic presentation of the two disorders may highlight those symptoms that are more likely to be under direct genetic control, for example in FXS as opposed to shared symptoms that are likely to be under the control of multiple mechanisms. This review is focused on the application and analysis of electroencephalography data (EEG) in ASD and FXS. Specifically, Event Related Potentials (ERP) and resting state studies (rEEG) studies investigating ASD and FXS cohorts are compared. This review explores the electrophysiological similarities and differences between the two disorders in addition to the potentially associated neurobiological mechanisms at play. A series of pertinent research questions which are suggested in the literature are also posed within the review.

The change detection task was used, as it requires storage of information without updating or manipulation and predicts VWM capacity. Ground reaction forces ( GRFs) ( horizontal and vertical), EMG, and EEG elements, time locked to support surface perturbations, were used to infer the active neural processes underlying the automatic control of balance in 14 young adults. A significant reduction was seen between single task ( ST) and DT conditions in VWM capacity (F(1,13) = 6.175, p < 0.05, r = 06) and event-related potential ( ERP) N1 component amplitude over the L motor ( p < 0.001) and R sensory ( p < 0.05) cortical areas. In addition, a significant increase in the COP trajectory peak ( pkcopx) was seen in the DT versus ST condition. Modulation of VWM capacity as well as ERP amplitude and pkcopx in DT conditions provided evidence of an interference pattern, suggesting that the two modalities shared a similar set of attentional resources. The results provide direct evidence of the competition for central processing attentional resources between the two modalities, through the reduction in amplitude of the ERP evoked by the postural perturbation.

The voltage deflections in an ERP waveform reflect the processing of sensory information as well as higher-level processing that involves selective attention, memory, semantic comprehension, and other types of cognitive activity. ERPs provide a non-invasive method of studying, with exceptional temporal resolution, cognitive processes in the human brain. ERPs are extracted from scalp-recorded electroencephalography by a series of signal processing steps. The present tutorial will highlight several of the analysis techniques required to obtain event-related potentials. Some methodological issues that may be encountered will also be discussed.

While p-EEG in humans and animals has been shown to be closely related in terms of underlying neuronal substrates, both translational and back-translational approaches are being used to address extrapolation issues and optimize the translational validity of preclinical animal p-EEG paradigms and data. Present applications build further on animal p-EEG and pharmaco-sleep EEG findings, but also on stimulation protocols, more specifically pharmaco-event-related potentials. Pharmaceutical research into novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases has employed an increasing number of pharmacological as well as transgenic models to assess the potential therapeutic involvement of different neurochemical systems and novel drug targets as well as underlying neuronal connectivity and synaptic function. Consequently, p-EEG studies, now also readily applied in modeled animals, continue to have an important role in drug discovery and development, with progressively more emphasis on its potential as a central readout for target engagement and as a (translational) functional marker of neuronal circuit processes underlying normal and pathological brain functioning.

This interface is designed with a future objective of providing a testing platform as an interactive and intelligent Image Search and Retrieval tool that allows users, disabled or otherwise, to browse and search for images using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals. As a proof of concept, a prototype system was designed and implemented to test real time data collection and navigation through the interface by detection and classification of event-related potentials (ERPs). A comparison of different feature extraction methods and classifiers for the detection of ERPs is performed on a standard data set to determine the best fit for the real time implementation of the BCI. The preliminary results of the real time implementation of the prototype BCI system are quantified by the success rate of the user/subject in navigating through the interface and spelling a search keyword using the mental-typewriter Hex-O-Speller.

An open question exists as to what exactly the IAT measures, and here EEG (Electroencephalography) has been used to investigate the time course of ERPs (Event-related Potential) indices and implicated brain regions in the IAT. IAT-EEG research identifies a number of early (250-450 ms) negative ERPs indexing early-(pre-response) processing stages of the IAT. ERP activity in this time range is known to index processes related to cognitive control and semantic processing. A central focus of these efforts has been to use IAT-ERPs to delineate the implicit and explicit factors contributing to measured IAT effects. Increasing evidence indicates that cognitive control (and related top-down modulation of attention/perceptual processing) may be components in the effective measurement of IAT effects, as factors such as physical setting or task instruction can change an IAT measurement. In this study we further implicate the role of proactive cognitive control and top-down modulation of attention/perceptual processing in the IAT-EEG. We find statistically significant relationships between D-score (a reaction-time based measure of the IAT-effect) and early ERP-time windows, indicating where more rapid word categorizations driving the IAT effect are present, they are at least partly explainable by neural activity not significantly correlated with the IAT measurement itself. Using LORETA, we identify a number of brain regions driving these ERP-IAT relationships notably involving left temporal, insular, cingulate, medial frontal and parietal cortex in time regions corresponding to the N2- and P3-related activity. The identified brain regions involved with reduced reaction times on congruent blocks coincide with those of previous studies.

Human brain has a powerful ability to recognize faces across various conditions, which makes it possible to introduce brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to face recognition. However, the performance of single-participant based BCI suffers from the low signal-to-noise ratio of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, especially detecting the event-related potential (ERP) in single trial. Here, we propose a rapid face recognition approach based on single-trial ERP detection, but the EEG signals are integrated from multiple participants. After the first-layer classifier to detect the ERP of each individual, the support vector machine scores of all individuals are concatenated and inputted to a second-layer classifier by the voting method to obtain the final classification results. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the single-participant based BCI, and the voting method is superior to the ERP averaging method. In addition, when the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is required to be greater than 0.9, our approach can recognize target faces about 300 ms ahead of button-press responses when integrating EEG signals from 9 participants. These results indicate that our approach can integrate decisions from multiple individuals to achieve rapid and accurate face recognition.

These studies used constrain experimental paradigms during which participants did not move their eyes. However, during more ecological paradigms where participants can move their eyes, the P300 potential might be more difficult to identify due to the overlapped potentials elicited by consecutive ocular fixations. In this study, we use the xDawn algorithm for denoising the overlapped Eye-Fixation Related Potentials (EFRP), and we observe the P300 potential elicited on the first, but also on the consecutive subsequent fixations landed on the target stimuli.

Here, we build on this foundation, showing how rERP analysis can also handle the estimation of nonlinear effects (a generalization of both the well-known approach of dichotomizing continuous covariates, and also of the ERP image technique), and can disentangle overlapping ERPs to temporally adjacent stimuli. We then consider how the use of rERPs impacts on other parts of the EEG analysis pipeline, including baselining, filtering, significance testing, and artifact rejection, and provide practical recommendations.

Here we investigated the brain's capacity to detect contingencies between consecutive sounds by means of electroencephalography (EEG) during passive listening. Contingencies were embedded either within tonal or verbal stimuli. Contingency extraction was measured indirectly via the elicitation of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential (ERP) by contingency violations. MMN results indicate that structurally identical forms of predictability can be extracted from both tonal and verbal stimuli. We also found similar generators to underlie the processing of contingency violations across stimulus types, as well as similar performance in an active-listening follow-up test. However, the process of passive contingency extraction was considerably slower (twice as many rule exemplars were needed) for verbal than for tonal stimuli These results suggest caution in transferring findings on complex predictive regularity processing obtained with tonal stimuli directly to the speech domain.

This hybrid interface works in two modes: an EOG mode recognizes eye movements such as blinks, and an EEG mode detects event related potentials (ERPs) like P300. While both eye movements and ERPs have been separately used for implementing assistive interfaces, which help patients with motor disabilities in performing daily tasks, the proposed hybrid interface integrates them together. In this way, both the eye movements and ERPs complement each other. Therefore, it can provide a better efficiency and a wider scope of application. In this study, we design a threshold algorithm that can recognize four kinds of eye movements including blink, wink, gaze, and frown. In addition, an oddball paradigm with stimuli of inverted faces is used to evoke multiple ERP components including P300, N170, and VPP. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, two different online experiments are carried out. One is to control a multifunctional humanoid robot, and the other is to control four mobile robots. In both experiments, the subjects can complete tasks effectively by using the proposed interface, whereas the best completion time is relatively short and very close to the one operated by hand.

Characterization of spatio-temporal epidural event-related potentials for mouse models of psychiatric disorders	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ANIMAL-MODELS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; KETAMINE; EEG; ENDOPHENOTYPES; BIOMARKERS; DEFICITS; STRAINS; VARY	Distinctive features in sensory event-related potentials (ERPs) are endophenotypic biomarkers of psychiatric disorders, widely studied using electroencephalographic (EEG) methods in humans and model animals. Despite the popularity and unique significance of the mouse as a model species in basic research, existing EEG methods applicable to mice are far less powerful than those available for humans and large animals. We developed a new method for multi-channel epidural ERP characterization in behaving mice with high precision, reliability and convenience and report an application to time-domain ERP feature characterization of the Sp4 hypomorphic mouse model for schizophrenia. Compared to previous methods, our spatio-temporal ERP measurement robustly improved the resolving power of key signatures characteristic of the disease model. The high performance and low cost of this technique makes it suitable for high-throughput behavioral and pharmacological studies.	[Wang, Xin; Pinto-Duarte, Antonio; Behrens, M.

In this study, we first developed and validated a novel paradigm suitable for use with event-related potentials (ERPs) in scenario-based laboratory experiments of decision making in the context of information security. We then used this paradigm to examine the association between individual differences in self-control and ERPs elicited while individuals deliberated over violations of information security policies. Our results show that the left and right hemispheres of the brain were involved in decision making, and that the participants with low self-control had lower levels of neural recruitment in both hemispheres relative to those with high self-control. This was especially the case for regions in or near the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior frontal cortex (IFC). These results extend the findings in neuroscience literature related to the role of self-control in decision making in general, and validate a new paradigm for use with the electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) technique to examine theoretical questions in information security and criminology research.

Issues and considerations for using the scalp surface Laplacian in EEG/ERP research: A tutorial review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Current source density (CSD); EEG recording reference; EEG spectra; Event-related potentials (ERPs); ERP component; Surface Laplacian (SL); Spherical spline interpolation; Volume conduction	CURRENT SOURCE-DENSITY; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; NEURONAL GENERATOR PATTERNS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; WORD RECOGNITION MEMORY; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SPLINE-LAPLACIAN	Despite the recognition that the surface Laplacian may counteract adverse effects of volume conduction and recording reference for surface potential data, electrophysiology as a discipline has been reluctant to embrace this approach for data analysis. The reasons for such hesitation are manifold but often involve unfamiliarity with the nature of the underlying transformation, as well as intimidation by a perceived mathematical complexity, and concerns of signal loss, dense electrode array requirements, or susceptibility to noise. We revisit the pitfalls arising from volume conduction and the mandated arbitrary choice of EEG reference, describe the basic principle of the surface Laplacian transform in an intuitive fashion, and exemplify the differences between common reference schemes (nose, linked mastoids, average) and the surface Laplacian for frequently-measured EEG spectra (theta, alpha) and standard event-related potential (ERP) components, such as N1 or P3. We specifically review common reservations against the universal use of the surface Laplacian, which can be effectively addressed by employing spherical spline interpolations with an appropriate selection of the spline flexibility parameter and regularization constant. We argue from a pragmatic perspective that not only are these reservations unfounded but that the continued predominant use of surface potentials poses a considerable impediment on the progress of EEG and ERP research.

However, little is known about the psychometrics of commonly used functional connectivity indices. We examined the internal consistency of two different connectivity metrics: magnitude squared coherence and phase synchrony. EEG was recorded during visual entrainment to elicit a strong oscillatory component of known frequency. We found acceptable to good split-half reliability for the connectivity metrics when computing all possible pairwise interactions and after selecting an a priori seed reference. We also compared reliability estimates when using average referenced sensor versus reference independent current source density EEG data. Additional considerations were given to determining how reliability was influenced by factors including trial number, signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency content.

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of results, we inferred EEG signal uncertainty from postcorrection artifact residuals and computed the uncertainty-weighted mean of ERPs. Using an uncertainty-weighted mean significantly and consistently reduced both inter- and intrasubject SEM in the analysis of auditory evoked responses (AER, indicated by the N1-P2 complex) and in the effects of an auditory oddball paradigm (N1-P3 complex, standard-deviant difference). SNR increased by 3% on average for the AER amplitude (intrasubject) and 17% on average for the auditory oddball ERP (intersubject). This demonstrates that weighting by uncertainty complements existing artifact correction algorithms to increase SNR in ERPs. More specifically, it is an efficient method to utilize seemingly corrupt (difficult-to-correct) EEG data that might otherwise be discarded.

The present study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological features of BN rats, particularly EEG/event-related potential (ERP). EEG activity was recorded at rest and during the auditory sensory gating paradigm under an awake, freely moving condition. Frequency and ERP analysis were performed along with time-frequency analysis of evoked power and intertrial coherence. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats, a well-documented control line, EN rats showed increased EEG power at rest, particularly in the theta and gamma ranges. In ERP analysis, BN rats showed reduced N40-P20 amplitude but normal sensory gating. The rats also showed reduced evoked power and intertrial coherence against auditory stimuli. These results suggest that EN rats show features of EEG/ERP measures clinically relevant to schizophrenia and may provide additional opportunities for translational research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Raw EEG signal were segmented and averaged into the ERP signal according to the event stimulus occur. Discrete Wavelet Transform technique is preferred to decompose the ERP signal into different frequency band. ERP signal at alpha frequency is used because of alpha is the most prominent component of brain waves activity. The necessary features were extracted as an input for the Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Consequence indicated that the accuracy and mean performance results were significant in predicting either a child had working memory impairment or not. 7 years old have lower accuracy compared to other groups with 60% for LR and 86% for SVM. In conclusion, the study proposed that age-related changes and increasing level of visual stimuli affect working memory impaired. Thus, this study has provided empirical evidence in support for the assumption that younger children have working memory impaired through visual stimuli assessment.

Comprehensive analysis suggests simple processes underlying EEG/ERP - Demonstration with the go/no-go paradigm in ADHD	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Analysis; Oscillations; ADHD; Go/no-go	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS; CHILDREN; TASK; METHYLPHENIDATE; INHIBITION; ADULTS; BRAIN; EEG	Background: Current basic or more advanced methods for analysis of averaged EEG/ERP are based on assumptions on the underlying processes, which are not necessarily precise. New method: In this work we present the findings of a method which obviates such assumptions and aims at a comprehensive analysis of the averaged EEG/ERP signal. Results: For the sake of demonstration we chose the established go/no-go paradigm in the context of ADHD. Our analysis method characterized two spatiotemporally distinct neurophysiologic processes which underlie the sampled signal: one which may be related to attention and the other which may be more related to perception. Comparison with existing method(s): We show how these processes accord with and provide insight on the waveforms reported in the literature. Conclusions: Finally we suggest that application of our method on averaged EEG/ERP data sampled from other paradigms may point at a similarly parsimonious set of underlying neurophysiologic processes which underlie the signal.

Improving object segmentation by using EEG signals and rapid serial visual presentation	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; Electroencephalography; Rapid serial visual presentation; Object segmentation; Interactive segmentation; GrabCut algorithm	EYE	This paper extends our previous work on the potential of EEG-based brain computer interfaces to segment salient objects in images. The proposed system analyzes the Event Related Potentials (ERP) generated by the rapid serial visual presentation of windows on the image. The detection of the P300 signal allows estimating a saliency map of the image, which is used to seed a semi-supervised object segmentation algorithm. Thanks to the new contributions presented in this work, the average Jaccard index was improved from 0.47 to 0.66 when processed in our publicly available dataset of images, object masks and captured EEG signals. This work also studies alternative architectures to the original one, the impact of object occupation in each image window, and a more robust evaluation based on statistical analysis and a weighted F-score.

An ERP eeg segment data usually involves three subsegments: pre-stimulus, stimulus and post-stimulus. Obviously, the mathematic models for pre-stimulus (or post-stimulus) and stimulus should be different. However, the general approach for ERP analysis in the literature always views the whole segment data as one model. In this paper we use Granger causality (GC) and recently proposed New causality (NC) methods to demonstrate that NC is more sensitive than GC to reveal true causality influence based on ERP data.

To cope with this phenomenon, stimuli are applied repeatedly and the ERP signals arising from the individual trials are averaged at the subject level. This results in loss of information about potentially important changes in the magnitude and form of ERP signals over the course of the experiment. In this article, we develop a meta-preprocessing step utilizing a moving average of ERP across sliding trial windows, to capture such longitudinal trends. We embed this procedure in a weighted linear mixed effects model to describe longitudinal trends in features such as ERP peak amplitude and latency across trials while adjusting for the inherent heteroskedasticity created at the meta-preprocessing step. The proposed unified framework, including the meta-processing and the weighted linear mixed effects modeling steps, is referred to as MAP-ERP (moving-averaged-processed ERP). We perform simulation studies to assess the performance of MAP-ERP in reconstructing existing longitudinal trends and apply MAP-ERP to data from young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their typically developing counterparts to examine differences in patterns of implicit learning, providing novel insights about the mechanisms underlying social and/or cognitive deficits in this disorder.

Somatosensory Event-related Potentials from Orofacial Skin Stretch Stimulation	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 106; Cutaneous mechanoreceptors; speech perception; speech production; sensorimotor control; electroencephalography	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN EEG; SYSTEM; REFLEX; SOUNDS; CORTEX; NERVE	Cortical processing associated with orofacial somatosensory function in speech has received limited experimental attention due to the difficulty of providing precise and controlled stimulation. This article introduces a technique for recording somatosensory event-related potentials (ERP) that uses a novel mechanical stimulation method involving skin deformation using a robotic device. Controlled deformation of the facial skin is used to modulate kinesthetic inputs through excitation of cutaneous mechanoreceptors. By combining somatosensory stimulation with electroencephalographic recording, somatosensory evoked responses can be successfully measured at the level of the cortex. Somatosensory stimulation can be combined with the stimulation of other sensory modalities to assess multisensory interactions. For speech, orofacial stimulation is combined with speech sound stimulation to assess the contribution of multi-sensory processing including the effects of timing differences. The ability to precisely control orofacial somatosensory stimulation during speech perception and speech production with ERP recording is an important tool that provides new insight into the neural organization and neural representations for speech.

EEG signals were segmented and averaged into the event of stimulus to obtain the ERPs pattern. In neurophysiology research, ERP component at P300 will forms the visual responsiveness to detect the cognitive processes. P300 component is decomposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Daubechies (db4) at 7th level decomposition. In conclusion, visual stimuli assessment brings up a dissimilar in P300 pattern between two-phases. The mean performance shows that, the younger children tend to working memory impaired rather than older children.	[Tumari, S. Z.

A major problem faced during the extraction of evoked potentials is the identification and elimination of bad segments of EEG data contaminated by such sources of noise. We present a new method which automatically identifies and eliminates bad epoch trials not only contaminated by artifacts but also dominated by spontaneous brain activities. This method gives a significantly better estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of the averaged event-related response using only the good epoch trials selected based on template cross correlation as compared with the conventional technique of averaging all epoch trials to obtain the ERP. We illustrate the method by applying it to the extraction of visual evoked potential in the EEG measurements.	[Patel, Rajesh; Janawadkar, M. P.; Sengottuvel, S.; Gireesan, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.

This study addresses the last point by exploring the extent to which the recently introduced EarEEG technology, which provides an unobtrusive, discreet and user-friendly way of recording EEG, can be used in BCI applications. This was approached by comparing conventional on-scalp EEG and EarEEG recordings in a well-established visual P300 BCI setup. The two recording methods were compared qualitatively by comparing Event-Related Potential (ERP) waveforms, and quantitatively in terms of P300 signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and ITRs of the BCI paradigm. The study showed similar ERP waveforms and on par P300 SNRs from both on-scalp and ear electrodes, and only a 6.5% decrease in single channel ITR for ear electrodes compared to on-scalp electrodes. This demonstrates that the EarEEG platform is a feasible technology for P300-based BCIs.

These potentials can be measured at the scalp, and constitute the electroencephalogram (EEG). When the EEG is time-locked to stimulation - such as the presentation of a word - and averaged over many such presentations, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) is obtained. The functional characteristics of components of the ERP are well understood, and some components represent processing that may differ uniquely from individual to individual such as the N400 component, which represents access to the semantic network. We applied several pattern classifiers to ERPs representing the response of individuals to a stream of text designed to be idiosyncratically familiar to different individuals. Results indicate that there are robustly identifiable features of the ERP that enable labeling of ERPs as belonging to individuals with accuracy reliably above chance (in the range of 82-97%). Further, these features are stable over time, as indicated by continued accurate identification of individuals from ERPs after a lag of up to six months. Even better, the high degree of labeling accuracy achieved in all cases was achieved with the use of only 3 electrodes on the scalp the minimal possible number that can acquire clean data.

Nonhuman animals are sensitive to certain AGs; therefore, evaluating which EEG Event Related Potentials (ERPs) are associated with AG learning in nonhuman animals could identify evolutionarily conserved processes. We recorded EEG potentials during an auditory AG learning experiment in two Rhesus macaques. The animals were first exposed to sequences of nonsense words generated by the AG. Then surface-based ERPs were recorded in response to sequences that were 'consistent' with the AG and 'violation' sequences containing illegal transitions. The AG violations strongly modulated an early component, potentially homologous to the Mismatch Negativity (mMMN), a P200 and a late frontal positivity (P500). The macaque P500 is similar in polarity and time of occurrence to a late EEG positivity reported in human AG learning studies but might differ in functional role. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A comparative study of electrical potential sensors and Ag/AgCl electrodes for characterising spontaneous and event related electroencephalagram signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Electrical potential sensor; Capacitive electrode; ERP; ud-EEG	EEG; SPECTRA; DRY	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is still a widely used imaging tool that combines high temporal resolution with a relatively low cost. Ag/AgCl metal electrodes have been the gold standard for non-invasively monitoring electrical brain activity. Although reliable, these electrodes have multiple drawbacks: they suffer from noise, such as offset potential drift, and usability issues, for example, difficult skin preparation and cross-coupling of adjacent electrodes. New method: In order to tackle these issues a prototype Electric Potential Sensor (EPS) device based on an auto-zero operational amplifier was developed and evaluated. The EPS is a novel active ultrahigh impedance capacitively coupled sensor. The absence of 1/f noise makes the EPS ideal for use with signal frequencies of similar to 10 Hz or less. A comprehensive study was undertaken to compare neural signals recorded by the EPS with a standard commercial EEG system. Results: Quantitatively, highly similar signals were observed between the EPS and EEG sensors for both free running and evoked brain activity with cross correlations of higher than 0.9 between the EPS and a standard benchmark EEG system. Comparison with existing method(s): These studies comprised measurements of both free running EEG and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from a commercial EEG system and EPS. Conclusions: The EPS provides a promising alternative with many added benefits compared to standard EEG sensors, including reduced setup time and elimination of sensor cross-coupling. In the future the scalability of the EPS will allow the implementation of a whole head ultra-dense EPS array. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Fatoorechi, M.; Prance, R.

This dimensional approach is especially important to aid early PTSD detection and to guide better treatment options. In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to investigate PTSD; however, reviews regarding EEG data related to PTSD are lacking, especially considering the dimensional approach. This systematic review examined the literature regarding EEG alterations in trauma exposed people with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) to identify putative EEG biomarkers of PTSS severity. Method: A systematic review of EEG studies of trauma-exposed participants with PTSS that reported dimensional analyses (e.g., correlations or regressions) between PTSS and EEG measures was performed. Results: The literature search yielded 1178 references, of which 34 studies were eligible for inclusion. Despite variability among the reviewed studies, the PTSS severity was often associated with P2, P3-family event-related potentials (ERPs) and alpha rhythms. Limitations: The search was limited to articles published in English; no information about non published studies or studies reported in other languages was obtained. Another limitation was the heterogeneity of studies, which made meta-analysis challenging. Conclusions: EEG provides promising candidates to act as biomarkers, although further studies are required to confirm the findings. Thus, EEG, in addition to being cheaper and easier to implement than other central techniques, has the potential to reveal biomarkers of PTSS severity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many previous studies have found that response inhibition abilities are damaged in those with drug dependence. However, whether heroin addicts who are treated with methadone maintenance have an abnormal response inhibition ability is not clear. In order to investigate the response inhibition functions in heroin addicts who were treated with methadone maintenance, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to examine 14 heroin addicts treated with methadone maintenance (HDM), 17 heroin addicts (HD), and 18 healthy controls (HC) in an equiprobability Go \ NoGo task. The reaction times (RTs) for the Go stimuli in the HD group were slower than those in the HDM and HC groups. Event-related potential (ERP) measurements showed that NoGo stimuli elicited larger N2 amplitudes than Go stimuli in the HDM and HC groups. However, for the HD group, the N2 amplitudes were similar for the two conditions. In addition, the HDM and HD groups were associated with longer P3 latencies. Our results demonstrated that methadone maintenance treatment might ease the deficits in response inhibition that result from long-term drug abuse. However, compared to normal people, HDM patients have serious problems evaluating and inhibiting inappropriate behaviors. Copyright (C) 2014, Food and Drug Administration, Taiwan.

Specifically, for EEG-based BCI typing systems, different symbol presentation paradigms have been utilized to induce ERPs. In this manuscript, through an experimental study, we assess the speed, recorded signal quality, and system accuracy of a language-model-assisted BCI typing system using three different presentation paradigms: a 4 7 matrix paradigm of a 28-character alphabet with row-column presentation (RCP) and single-character presentation (SCP), and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of the same. Our analyses show that signal quality and classification accuracy are comparable between the two visual stimulus presentation paradigms. In addition, we observe that while the matrix-based paradigm can be generally employed with lower inter-trial-interval (ITI) values, the best presentation paradigm and ITI value configuration is user dependent. This potentially warrants offering both presentation paradigms and variable ITI options to users of BCI typing systems.

This would expand current methodologies for studying the cognitive processes underlying braille reading. An N400 effect paradigm was utilised, whereby proficient blind braille readers read congruent- and incongruent-ending braille sentences. Kinematic and electroencephalography (EEG) data were obtained simultaneously and synchronised. The ERPs differed between the incongruent and congruent sentences in a manner consistent with the N400 effect found with a previous sighted reading paradigm, demonstrating that ERPs can be obtained during braille reading. The frequency of finger reversals and the degree of intermittency in the finger velocity were significantly higher when reading incongruent versus congruent sentence endings. Both reversals and the potential N400 effect may reflect processes involved in semantic unification. These findings have significant implications for the modelling of braille reading. The refinement of the technique will enable other ERPs to be identified and related to behavioural responses, to further our understanding of the braille reading process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little research has been devoted to integrating data from these two fields. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a specific type of eye movement, microsaccades, to analyze cognitive activity. We assess mental workload using event related potentials (ERPs) correlated with microsaccades during experiments where task complexity is designed to be greater with an increase in visual degradation. We also develop a modified eye movement algorithm to identify microsaccades during tasks that permit regular saccades and blinks. We compare ERPs at microsaccade onset locked epochs to those of stimulus onset locked epochs. Our results show a clear correlation of ERP activations to both latency and activation areas. These findings provide important insights for analyzing sophisticated tasks in a non-invasive fashion.

The ability to recreate these deficits in animal models is limited, hampering ongoing translational drug development efforts. This paper reviews the use of electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurophysiological measures, such as event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), as novel translational biomarkers for both etiological and treatment development research in neuropsychiatry. In schizophrenia, cognitive impairments manifest as deficits not only in high-level processes, such as working memory or executive processing, but also as deficits in neurophysiological responses to simple auditory and visual stimuli. Moreover, neurophysiological responses can be assessed even in untrained animals and are therefore particularly amenable to translational, cross-species investigation. To date, several sensory-level ERP measures, including auditory mismatch negativity and N1, and visual P1 and steady state responses, have been validated in both human clinical investigations and animal models. Deficits have been tied to impaired neurotransmission at N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Time-frequency analysis of ERSP permits further extension of these findings from physiological to circuit/cellular levels of analysis.

But the performance is still limited when large illumination, pose, and facial expression variations are presented. In contrast, the human brain has powerful cognitive capability to recognize faces and demonstrates robustness across viewpoints, lighting conditions, even in the presence of partial occlusion. This paper proposes a closed-loop face retrieval system that combines the state-of-the-art face recognition method with the powerful cognitive function of the human brain illustrated in electroencephalography signals. The system starts with a random face image and outputs the ranking of all of the images in the database according to their similarity to the target individual. At each iteration, the single trial event related potentials (ERP) detector scores the user's interest in rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, where the presented images are selected from the computer face recognition module. When the system converges, the ERP detector further refines the lower ranking to achieve better performance. In total, 10 subjects participated in the experiment, exploring a database containing 1,854 images of 46 celebrities. Our approach outperforms existing methods with better average precision, indicating human cognitive ability complements computer face recognition and contributes to better face retrieval.

Individual Differences in Language Processing: Electrophysiological Approaches	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS COMPASS			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LEXICAL QUALITY; READING SKILL; COMPREHENSION; ATTENTION; MECHANISMS; RESOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; CONTEXT	Language processing is a complex task that requires both specialized cognitive processes (e.g. speech decoding) and more general cognitive processes (e.g. working memory). Research on how individual differences in these processes influence language processing and comprehension has primarily relied on behavioral methods, such as reaction time measures, self-paced reading, and eye-tracking. However, a growing number of studies have used electrophysiological (EEG) techniques to study individual differences in language processing. EEG and event-related potential (ERP) methods provide a unique link between neural activity and cognitive processing and can be used to draw specific inferences about the neural basis of language processing and its variability. The primary goal of this paper is to showcase EEG/ERP studies that have made significant contributions to the study of individual differences in how the brain processes language, over and above what would be possible using behavioral methods alone. A secondary goal of this paper is to highlight several methodological issues specific to research on individual differences in language processing and identify ways in which EEG/ERP studies can take advantage of what has been learned from previous research to minimize these issues.

To handle this problem, a number of artifact removal methods has been proposed. Specifically, we focus on a method using a multi-channel Wiener filters based on a probabilistic generative model. This method assumes that the observed signal is the sum of multiple signals elicited by psychological or physical events, and separates the observed signal into each event signal using estimated model parameters. Based on this scheme, we have proposed a model parameter estimation method using prior information of each event signal. In this paper, we examine the potential of this model to deal with highly contaminated signals by collecting EEG data intentionally contaminated by eye blinks and relatively clean ERP data, and using them as prior information of each event signal. We conducted an experimental evaluation using a classical attention task. The results showed the proposed method effectively enhances the target ERP component while reducing the contamination caused by eye blinks.

Although telemedicine is one of the solutions to avoid people insti-tutionalization, it has severe limitations and not all medical services can be of-fered. While few years ago the electrical complexity and cost of EEG systems prevented execution of clinical EEG tests out of hospital, now services such as home-based video-EEG are possible. Conversely, some important clinical tests such as event-related potentials cannot be executed remotely. The reason for that is the accurate synchrony between local stimulus onset and remote starting of EEG acquisition. In hospital, synchrony is guaranteed by means of a wired connection between stimulus display that triggers EEG recording while in home-based testing this link normally does not exist. In this study we show an effective way to execute event-related potentials based on asynchronous EEG data transmission. We executed a dichotic listening paradigm with forced-attention modality. The user goal was to detect the attended audio sentence from the analysis of evoked auditory event-related potentials. The rate of successful detection in both synchronous and asynchronous modalities was compared and results revealed no significant difference. Our asynchronous approach can be used in on-line acquisition of home-based event-related potentials with remote processing.	[Lopez-Gordo, M.

J	Michalopoulos, K; Bourbakis, N				Michalopoulos, Kostas; Bourbakis, Nikolaos			Combining EEG Microstates with fMRI Structural Features for Modeling Brain Activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; fusion; Hidden markov models; partial least squares; fusion; classification	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; FUSION; FRACTALITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DIAGNOSIS; TUTORIAL; NETWORKS; SIGNAL; ERP	Combining information from Electroencephalography (EEG) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been a topic of increased interest recently. The main advantage of the EEG is its high temporal resolution, in the scale of milliseconds, while the main advantage of fMRI is the detection of functional activity with good spatial resolution. The advantages of each modality seem to complement each other, providing better insight in the neuronal activity of the brain. The main goal of combining information from both modalities is to increase the spatial and the temporal localization of the underlying neuronal activity captured by each modality. This paper presents a novel technique based on the combination of these two modalities (EEG, fMRI) that allow a better representation and understanding of brain activities in time. EEG is modeled as a sequence of topographies, based on the notion of microstates. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used to model the temporal evolution of the topography of the average Event Related Potential (ERP). For each model the Fisher score of the sequence is calculated by taking the gradient of the trained model parameters. The Fisher score describes how this sequence deviates from the learned HMM. Canonical Partial Least Squares (CPLS) were used to decompose the two datasets and fuse the EEG and fMRI features. In order to test the effectiveness of this method, the results of this methodology were compared with the results of CPLS using the average ERP signal of a single channel. The presented methodology was able to derive components that co-vary between EEG and fMRI and present significant differences between the two tasks.

However, the cortical activities related with P300 amplitudes under different memory loads remains unclear. Joint fMRI and EEG analysis which fusions the time and spatial information in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording can reveal the regional activation at each ERP time point. In this paper, we first used wavelet transform to obtain the single-trial amplitudes of P300 caused by a digital N-back task in the simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording as the ERP feature sequences. Then the feature sequences in 1-back condition and 3-back condition were introduced into general linear model (GLM) separately as parametric modulations to compare the cortical activation under different memory loads. The results showed that the average amplitudes of P300 in 3-back significantly decreased than that in 1-back, and the activities induced by ERP feature sequences in 3-back also significantly decreased than that in the 1-back, including the insular, anterior cingulate cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus, which were relevant to the storage, monitoring, and manipulation of information in working memory task. Moreover, the difference in the activation caused by ERP feature showed a positive correlation with the difference in behavioral performance. These findings demonstrated the locations of P300 amplitudes differences modulated by the memory load and its relationship with the behavioral performance.

Thus predicting emotions become necessary to understand the behavior of humans. Emotions can be predicted from gestures, sound processing but emotion recognition using EEG signals is very powerful method to know the internal state of mind accurately. This paper describes the acquisition of EEG signals on frontal electrodes such as F3, F4 and FZ from five subjects for classification of emotions into two classes. The emotions were induced by showing images from International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset to the subjects. The event related potential (ERP) features were determined from the processed EEG signals for every class of emotions. The classification was performed using LIBSVM classifier with 3 fold cross validation and RBF kernel to classify emotions into two classes along the arousal axis. It was found that accuracy remained consistently high on F4 electrode. An accuracy of 79.16% was obtained on F4 electrode, 76.19% on F3 electrode and 73.07% on FZ electrode when classifying emotions subject wise.

In this paper, we proposed a multi-ganglion artificial neural network based feature learning (ANNFL) method to extract a deep feature structure of single-trial multi-channel ERP signals and improve classification accuracy. Five subjects took part in the Imitating-Reading ERP experiments. We recorded the target electroencephalography (EEG) samples (elicited by target stimuli) and non-target samples (elicited by non-target stimuli) for each subjects. Then we applied ANNFL method to extract the feature vectors and classified them by using support vector machine (SVM). The ANNFL method outperforms the principal component analysis (PCA) method and conventional three-layer auto-encoder, and then leads to higher classification accuracies of five subjects' BCI signals than using the single-channel temporal features. ANNFL is an unsupervised feature learning method, which can automatically learn feature vector from EEG data and provide more effective feature representation than PCA method and single-channel temporal feature extraction method.

Methods: We performed EEG on 20 AN, 20 BDD, 20 healthy controls, all unmedicated. In order to probe configural/holistic and detailed processing, participants viewed photographs of faces and houses that were unaltered or filtered to low or high spatial frequencies, respectively. We calculated the early ERP components P100 and N170, and compared amplitudes and latencies among groups. Results: P100 amplitudes were smaller in AN than BDD and healthy controls, regardless of spatial frequency or stimulus type (faces or houses). Similarly, N170 latencies were longer in AN than healthy controls, regardless of spatial frequency or stimulus type, with a similar pattern in BDD at trend level significance. N170 amplitudes were smaller in AN than controls for high and normal spatial frequency images, and smaller in BDD than controls for normal spatial frequency images, regardless of stimulus type. Poor insight correlated with lower N170 amplitudes for normal and low spatial frequency faces in the BDD group. Conclusions: Individuals with AN exhibit abnormal early visual system activity, consistent with reduced configural processing and enhanced detailed processing. This is evident regardless of whether the stimuli are appearance or non-appearance-related, and thus may be a reflection of general, early perceptual abnormalities. As N170 amplitude could be a marker of structural encoding of faces, lower values may be associated with perceptual distortions and could contribute to poor insight in BDD. Future studies may explore visual ERP measures as potential biomarkers of illness phenotype.

Multiple linear regression to estimate time-frequency electrophysiological responses in single trials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Single-trial analysis; Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Multiple linear regression; Neuronal oscillations	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PAIN PERCEPTION; EEG RESPONSES; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS	Transient sensory, motor or cognitive event elicit not only phase-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), but also induce non-phase-locked modulations of ongoing EEG oscillations. These modulations can be detected when single-trial waveforms are analysed in the time-frequency domain, and consist in stimulus-induced decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) or increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) of synchrony in the activity of the underlying neuronal populations. ERD and ERS reflect changes in the parameters that control oscillations in neuronal networks and, depending on the frequency at which they occur, represent neuronal mechanisms involved in cortical activation, inhibition and binding. ERD and ERS are commonly estimated by averaging the time-frequency decomposition of single trials. However, their trial-to-trial variability that can reflect physiologically-important information is lost by across-trial averaging. Here, we aim to (1) develop novel approaches to explore single-trial parameters (including latency, frequency and magnitude) of ERP/ERD/ERS; (2) disclose the relationship between estimated single-trial parameters and other experimental factors (e.g., perceived intensity). We found that (1) stimulus-elicited ERP/ERD/ERS can be correctly separated using principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition with Varimax rotation on the single-trial time-frequency distributions; (2) time-frequency multiple linear regression with dispersion term (TF-MLRd) enhances the signal-tonoise ratio of ERP/ERD/ERS in single trials, and provides an unbiased estimation of their latency, frequency, and magnitude at single-trial level; (3) these estimates can be meaningfully correlated with each other and with other experimental factors at single-trial level (e.g., perceived stimulus intensity and ERP magnitude). The methods described in this article allow exploring fully non-phase-locked stimulus-induced cortical oscillations, obtaining single-trial estimate of response latency, frequency, and magnitude. This permits within-subject statistical comparisons, correlation with pre-stimulus features, and integration of simultaneously-recorded EEG and fMRI. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The spatial-spectral-temporal patterns in event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activities (i.e., power and phase) were measured at four selected channels, i.e., FCz, Pz, O1 and O2, from original EEG data after preprocessing, EEG data after additional current source density (CSD) transform, and back-projected EEG data from individual ICs after additional ICA analysis. Pair-wise correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI), calculated from three EEG data at four selected channels, were compared to examine mutual correlations in EEG signals obtained through three different means. Thereafter, EEG signatures of errors from these three means were statistically compared at multiple time windows in the contrast of error and correct responses. Significantly decreased CC and MI values were observed in CSD- and ICA-processed EEGs as compared with original EEG, with the smallest CC and MI in ICA EEG. Similar error patterns in ERPs and peri-response oscillatory activities were detected in all three EEGs, whereas the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus error-related oscillatory patterns identified in ICA EEG were either not or only partially detected in both original EEG and CSD EEGs in general. Both CSD and ICA processes can largely reduce signal correlations due to the volume conduction effect in original EEG, and EEG signatures of errors are better detected by ICA-based method than channel-based method (i.e., original and CSD EEGs). ICA provides the best sensitivity to detect EEG signatures linked to specific neural processes via disentangling superimposed channel-level EEG signals into distinct neurocognitive process-related component signals.

J	Ouyang, G; Sommer, W; Zhou, CS				Ouyang, Guang; Sommer, Werner; Zhou, Changsong			Updating and validating a new framework for restoring and analyzing latency-variable ERP components from single trials with residue iteration decomposition (RIDE)	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Latency variability; ERP decomposition methods; Residue iteration decomposition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WAVE-FORMS; SEPARATION; STIMULUS; P300; EEG; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY; SIMULATION; AMPLITUDE	Trial-to-trial latency variability pervades cognitive EEG responses and may mix and smear ERP components but is usually ignored in conventional ERP averaging. Existing attempts to decompose temporally overlapping and latency-variable ERP components show major limitations. Here, we propose a theoretical framework and model of ERPs consisting of temporally overlapping components locked to different external events or varying in latency from trial to trial. Based on this model, a new ERP decomposition and reconstruction method was developed: residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). Here, we describe an update of the method and compare it to other decomposition methods in simulated and real datasets. The updated RIDE method solves the divergence problem inherent to previous latency-based decomposition methods. By implementing the model of ERPs as consisting of time-variable and invariable single-trial component clusters, RIDE obtains latency-corrected ERP waveforms and topographies of the components, and yields dynamic information about single trials.

The key contribution of this paper is to complement the advancement of traditional consumer research through the investigation of the event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with preferences elicited during a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Five subjects participated in the experiment as they chose their preferred computer background image from a set of images with different colors and patterns. Emotiv EPOC, a commercial wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset with 14 channels, was utilized to collect EEG signals from the subjects while making one hundred and fifty choice observations. The collected EEG signals were filtered and cleaned from artifacts before being epoched into segments of 1000 msec each for ERP analysis. When observing the average of EEG epochs, collected while the subjects chose their preferred background images, there was a clear P300-ERP component with its largest power shown at the left frontal channel (F3 from the international 10-20 system). A significant difference was revealed between the average ERP potential on F3 during the epochs that coincided with the images containing the preferred objects against that coinciding with the images that did not contain the objects of interest (with p < 0.01). A clear N400-ERP component on the parietal lobe sensor at P7 was also revealed to be significantly related to the difference in absolute preference (with p < 0.02). Our experimental results also showed that there was a negative relationship between the speed of the decision and the difference in preference for the objects in the decision. (c) 2015 The Authors.

There have been mobile EEG units, for instance ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG), a portable device designed for recording ictal events or interictal epileptiform discharge. However, these were never intended for motion related EEG recordings. Such techniques constrain motion related brain potential tests. A number of papers have considered this issue and as a result a new research area was established. This paper is a review on the different aspects of this problem, such as algorithms and hardware design, for the reduction of motion related EEG artifacts. Finally, this paper recommends several proper strategies on EEG artifact reduction.

Cognitive workload modulation through degraded visual stimuli: a single-trial EEG study	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						work load; single trial; EEG ERP	MENTAL WORKLOAD; TASK-DIFFICULTY; P300; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; FILTERS; NOISE	Objective. Our experiments explored the effect of visual stimuli degradation on cognitive workload. Approach. We investigated the subjective assessment, event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as electroencephalogram ( EEG) as measures of cognitive workload. Main results. These experiments confirm that degradation of visual stimuli increases cognitive workload as assessed by subjective NASA task load index and confirmed by the observed P300 amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, the single-trial multi-level classification using features extracted from ERPs and EEG is found to be promising. Specifically, the adopted single-trial oscillatory EEG/ERP detection method achieved an average accuracy of 85% for discriminating 4 workload levels. Additionally, we found from the spatial patterns obtained from EEG signals that the frontal parts carry information that can be used for differentiating workload levels. Significance. Our results show that visual stimuli can modulate cognitive workload, and the modulation can be measured by the single trial EEG/ERP detection method.

The detection of the direction intended movements and the type of intended movement is a challenging goal in neuroscience and engineering applications such as brain-computer interfacing (BCI). In previous studies, it has been reported that EEG signals extracted from PPC can be used to decode intended movement direction. However, it is not clear whether extracted EEG signals are related to motor intention, because visually evoked potential (VEP) which evoked by visual cue in their experiment may be included in their extracted EEG signals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of VEP mixed into extracted EEG signals. Therefore experiments with not only visual but also tactile cues were conducted. EEG components that could be related to PPC were extracted by using independent component analysis (ICA). We compared event related potential (ERP) waveforms between two experiments. In the result, ERP waveforms of the experiment with tactile cue were significantly different from that of the experiment with visual cue. This result suggests that VEP was included in the EEG signals extracted from PPC in the experiment with visual cue.

The N170's potential to provide insight into the neural processing of faces in certain populations (e.g., children and adults with cognitive impairments) is limited by its measurement in scientific laboratories that can appear threatening to some people. New method: The advent of cheap, easy-to-use portable gaming EEG systems provides an opportunity to record EEG in new contexts and populations. This study tested the validity of the face-sensitive N170 ERP measured with an adapted commercial EEG system (the Emotiv EPOC) that is used at home by gamers. Results: The N170 recorded through both the gaming EEG system and the research EEG system exhibited face-sensitivity, with larger mean amplitudes in response to the face stimuli than the non-face stimuli, and a delayed N170 peak in response to face inversion. Comparison with existing method: The EPOC system produced very similar N170 ERPs to a research-grade Neuroscan system, and was capable of recording face-sensitivity in the N170, validating its use as research tool in this arena. Conclusions: This opens new possibilities for measuring the face-sensitive N170 ERP in people who cannot travel to a traditional ERP laboratory (e.g., elderly people in care), who cannot tolerate laboratory conditions (e.g., people with autism), or who need to be tested in situ for practical or experimental reasons (e.g., children in schools) (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) event-related potentials (ERPs): People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) vs. age-matched controls	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Alternative and augmentative communication (AAC); Event-related potentials (ERP); Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); Brain-machine interface (BMI); Electroencephalography (EEG)	LOCKED-IN STATE; P300 SPELLER; COMMUNICATION; HEALTHY; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; COGNITION; BEHAVIOR; TACTILE; TESTS	Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aimed at restoring communication to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities often use event-related potentials (ERPs) in scalp-recorded EEG activity. Up to the present, most research and development in this area has been done in the laboratory with young healthy control subjects. In order to facilitate the development of BCI most useful to people with disabilities, the present study set out to: (1) determine whether people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy, age-matched volunteers (HVs) differ in the speed and accuracy of their ERP-based BCI use; (2) compare the ERP characteristics of these two groups; and (3) identify ERP-related factors that might enable improvement in BCI performance for people with disabilities. Methods: Sixteen EEG channels were recorded while people with ALS or healthy age-matched volunteers (HVs) used a P300-based BCI. The subjects with ALS had little or no remaining useful motor control (mean ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised 9.4 (+/- 9.5SD) (range 0-25)). Each subject attended to a target item as the items in a 6 x 6 visual matrix flashed. The BCI used a stepwise linear discriminant function (SWLDA) to determine the item the user wished to select (i.e., the target item). Offline analyses assessed the latencies, amplitudes, and locations of ERPs to the target and non-target items for people with ALS and age-matched control subjects. Results: BCI accuracy and communication rate did not differ significantly between ALS users and HVs. Although ERP morphology was similar for the two groups, their target ERPs differed significantly in the location and amplitude of the late positivity (P300), the amplitude of the early negativity (N200), and the latency of the late negativity (LN). Conclusions: The differences in target ERP components between people with ALS and age-matched HVs are consistent with the growing recognition that ALS may affect cortical function. The development of BCIs for use by this population may begin with studies in HVs but also needs to include studies in people with ALS. Their differences in ERP components may affect the selection of electrode montages, and might also affect the selection of presentation parameters (e.g., matrix design, stimulation rate). Significance: P300-based BCI performance in people severely disabled by ALS is similar to that of age-matched control subjects. At the same time, their ERP components differ to some degree from those of controls. Attention to these differences could contribute to the development of BCIs useful to those with ALS and possibly to others with severe neuromuscular disabilities.

The meditators' (N = 20), contrary to control (N = 20), did not demonstrate arousal-related increases in the mid-latency (200-400 ms) ERP positivity over the right hemisphere. We also found in the same time window stronger ERP negativity for meditators over central regions, regardless of picture valence. We assume that long-term meditation practice enhances frontal top-down control over fast automatic detection of stimulus salience.	[Reva, N. V.; Pavlov, S. V.; Korenyok, V. V.; Loktev, K.

J	Spuler, M; Niethammer, C				Spueler, Martin; Niethammer, Christian			Error-related potentials during continuous feedback: using EEG to detect errors of different type and severity	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						error-related potential (ErrP); error-related negativity (Ne/ERN); feedback related negativity (FRN); brain-computer interface (BCI); human-computer interaction; performance monitoring; asynchronous classification	ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; SPECTRA	When a person recognizes an error during a task, an error-related potential (ErrP) can be measured as response. It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time discrete feedback, which is widely applied in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for error correction or adaptation. However, there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study, we wanted to answer three different questions: (i) Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? (ii) Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? (iii) Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task, different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response, we show that also a continuous, asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study, we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG.

However, it is still unclear whether the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal in everyday life is related to brain activity involved in reward processing. In the present study, participants' neural responses to reward were measured using electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during a gambling task and their tendency to use cognitive reappraisal was assessed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Event-related potential (ERP) results indicated that losses on the gambling task elicited greater negative reward-related feedback negativity (FN) than gains. The differential FN between losses and gains was significantly correlated with cognitive reappraisal scores across participants such that individuals with a higher tendency to use cognitive reappraisal showed stronger reward processing (i.e., amplified FN difference between losses and gains). This correlation remained significant after controlling for expressive suppression scores. However, expressive suppression per se was not correlated with FN differences. Taken together, these results suggest that the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal is associated with increased neural processing of reward.

In the current paper, I review a programmatic line of research indicating that this apparent negativity actually reflects a reward-related positivity (RewP) that is absent or suppressed following nonreward. I situate the RewP within a broader nomological network of reward processing and individual differences in sensitivity to rewards. Further, I review work linking reductions in the RewP to increased depressive symptoms and risk for depression. Finally, I discuss future directions for research on the RewP.

Learning to decode human emotions from event-related potentials	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Affective computing; Emotion valence recognition; Feature reduction; Clustering; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	AROUSAL; FEARFUL	Reported works on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition systems generally employ the principles of supervised learning to build subject-dependent (single/intra-subject) models. Building subject-independent (multiple/inter-subject) models is a harder problem due to the EEG data variability between subjects. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a framework for selection of a small number of basic temporal features, event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes, and latencies that are sufficiently robust to discriminate emotion states across multiple subjects. Second, we test comparatively the feasibility of six standard unsupervised (clustering) techniques to build intra-subject and inter-subject models to discriminate emotion valence in the ERPs collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content.

The present study investigated neurocognitive changes arising from chronic sleep restriction outside the laboratory. Methods: Sleep patterns of 24 undergraduates were tracked via actigraphy across a 15-week semester. At the semester beginning, at a midpoint, and a week before finals, students performed the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) and cortical arousal was measured via event-related potentials (ERP) and resting state electroencephalography (EEG). Results: Average daily sleep decreased between Session 1 and Sessions 2 and 3. Calculated circadian rhythm measures indicated nighttime movement increased and sleep quality decreased from Sessions 1 and 2 to Session 3. Parallel to the sleep/activity measures, PVT reaction time increased between Session 1 and Sessions 2 and 3 and resting state alpha EEG reactivity magnitude and PVT-evoked P3 ERP amplitude decreased between Session 1 and Sessions 2 and 3. Cross-sectional regressions showed PVT reaction time was negatively associated with average daily sleep, alpha reactivity, and P3 changes; sleep/circadian measures were associated with alpha reactivity and/or P3 changes. Conclusions: Small, but persistent sleep deficits reduced cortical arousal and impaired vigilant attention. Significance: Chronic sleep restriction impacts neurocognition in a manner similar to laboratory controlled sleep deprivation. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Obleser, J				Obleser, Jonas			Re-visiting the electrophysiology of language	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Event-related potentials; EEG; ECoG; Speech comprehension; Prediction	OSCILLATIONS	This editorial accompanies a special issue of Brain and Language re-visiting old themes and new leads in the electrophysiology of language. The event-related potential (ERP) as a series of characteristic deflections ("components") over time and their distribution on the scalp has been exploited by speech and language researchers over decades to find support for diverse psycholinguistic models. Fortunately, methodological and statistical advances have allowed human neuroscience to move beyond some of the limitations imposed when looking at the ERP only. Most importantly, we currently witness a refined and refreshed look at "event-related" (in the literal sense) brain activity that relates itself more closely to the actual neurobiology of speech and language processes. It is this imminent change in handling and interpreting electrophysiological data of speech and language experiments that this special issue intends to capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

MULTIPLE STAGES OF INFORMATION PROCESSING ARE MODULATED DURING ACUTE BOUTS OF EXERCISE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; physical activity; aerobic exercise; cognition; EEG; ERP	ACUTE AEROBIC EXERCISE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; REACTION-TIME; CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; INCREMENTAL EXERCISE; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; MOTOR PROCESSES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GAIN-CONTROL; PERFORMANCE	Acute bouts of aerobic physical exercise can modulate subsequent cognitive task performance and oscillatory brain activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG). Here, we investigated the sequencing of these modulations of perceptual and cognitive processes using scalp recorded EEG acquired during exercise. Twelve participants viewed pseudo-random sequences of frequent non-target stimuli (cars), infrequent distractors (obliquely oriented faces) and infrequent targets that required a simple detection response (obliquely oriented faces, where the angle was different than the infrequent distractors). The sequences were presented while seated on a stationary bike under three conditions during which scalp recorded EEG was also acquired: rest, low-intensity exercise, and high-intensity exercise. Behavioral target detection was faster during highintensity exercise compared to both rest and low-intensity exercise. An event-related potential (ERP) analysis of the EEG data revealed that the mean amplitude of the visual P1 component evoked by frequent non-targets measured at parietal-occipital electrodes was larger during lowintensity exercise compared to rest. The P1 component evoked by infrequent targets also peaked earlier during low-intensity exercise compared to rest and high-intensity exercise. The P3a ERP component evoked by infrequent distractors measured at parietal electrodes peaked significantly earlier during both low-and high-intensity exercise when compared to rest. The modulation of the visual P1 and the later P3a components is consistent with the conclusion that exercise modulates multiple stages of neural information processing, ranging from early stage sensory processing (P1) to post-perceptual target categorization (P3a).

It is still unknown how exactly EEG signals correlate with the haemodynamic response, although the activation in the premotor area during motor preparation has been captured by EEG and haemodynamic approaches separately. We conducted EEG-NIRS simultaneous recordings over the sensorimotor area with a self-paced button press task. Participants were instructed to press a button at their own pace after a cue was shown. The result showed that the readiness potential (RP), a negative slow potential shift occurring during motor preparation, on C3 in the extended 10-20 system occurred about 1000 ms before the movement onset. An increase in concentration of oxyhaemoglobin (oxyHb) in the premotor cortex during motor preparation was also confirmed by NIRS, which resulted in a significant correlation between the amplitude of the RP and the change in oxyHb concentration (Pearson's correlation r(2) = 0.235, p = 0.03). We show that EEG-NIRS simultaneous recording can demonstrate the correlation between the RP and haemodynamic response in the premotor cortex contralateral to the performing hand.

The shape of dementia: new measures of morphological complexity in event-related potentials (ERP) and its application to the detection of Alzheimer's disease	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Morphological complexity of curves; Event-related potentials; Spectral matching complexity; Spectral matching entropy; Alzheimer's disease	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; CLINICAL UTILITY; P300; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS	In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying the commonly observed disorganization of the stereotyped wave form of the ERP associated with the P300 component in patients with Alzheimer's disease. To that extent, we propose two new measures of complexity which relate the spectral content of the signal with its temporal waveform: the spectral matching coefficient and the spectral matching entropy. We show by means of experiments that those measures effectively measure complexity and are related to the shape in an intuitive way. Those indexes are compared with commonly used measures of complexity when comparing AD patients against age-matched healthy controls. The results indicate that AD ERP signals are, indeed, more complex in the shape than that of controls, and this result is evidenced mainly by means of our new measures which have a better performance compared to similar ones. Finally, we try to explain this increase in complexity in light of the communication through coherence hypothesis framework, relating commonly found changes in the EEG with our own results.

J	Cecotti, H				Cecotti, Hubert			Toward shift invariant detection of event-related potentials in non-invasive brain-computer interface	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Multimodal Pattern Recognition of Social Signals in Human Computer Interaction (MPRSS)	NOV 11, 2012	Tsukuba, JAPAN	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit (IAPR), TC3		Event related potentials (ERP); Brain-computer interface; Shift invariant detection; Feature extraction	HIGHER-ORDER SPECTRA; RECOGNITION; P300; CLASSIFICATION; BCI	Non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) is a relatively new type of human-computer interaction. BCIs that are based on the detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually synchronous. They require the knowledge of the stimulus onsets that evoke ERPs, which is time locked to the presence of a potentially relevant stimulus. The detection of ERPs like the P300 has been successfully used in BCI thanks to the oddball paradigm. The time locked detection is directly related to the synchronous aspect of a BCI. However, asynchronous detection is a critical issue in developing BCIs for real-life applications, where the machine should be able to detect the presence of an ERP independently from the knowledge of the stimulus onsets, or when wireless devices do not allow a precise knowledge of the stimulus onsets. Although the detection of single-trial ERP is already a challenge, when the stimulus onsets are well identified, we propose to investigate further the detection of single-trial ERP by considering different time locked stimuli. We propose and compare shift invariant ERP detection strategies on data from ten subjects obtained in a P300 speller experiment. With a shift invariant distance, we show that it is possible to obtain an AUC of 0.834 while allowing a jitter of +/- 40 ms. With inputs in the Fourier domain, the mean area under the ROC curves of 0.633 allowing a jitter of +/- 200 ms in the stimulus onsets. The results support the conclusion that ERP detection can be achieved without a precise knowledge of the stimulus onsets, and hence can be used with EEG amplifiers that do not allow a precise synchronization between the EEG signal and stimulus onsets.

We examined event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with semantic memory retrieval in 16 individuals with aMCI as compared to 17 normal controls using the Semantic Object Retrieval Task (EEG SORT). In this task, subjects judged whether pairs of words (object features) elicited retrieval of an object (retrieval trials) or not (non-retrieval trials). Behavioral findings revealed that aMCI subjects had lower accuracy scores and marginally longer reaction time compared to controls. We used a multivariate analytical technique (STAT-PCA) to investigate similarities and differences in ERPs between aMCI and control groups. STAT-PCA revealed a left fronto-temporal component starting at around 750 ms post-stimulus in both groups. However, unlike controls, aMCI subjects showed an increase in the frontal-parietal scalp potential that distinguished retrieval from non-retrieval trials between 950 and 1050 ms post-stimulus negatively correlated with the performance on the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III. Thus, individuals with aMCI were not only impaired in their behavioral performance on SORT relative to controls, but also displayed alteration in the corresponding ERPs. The altered neural activity in aMCI compared to controls suggests a more sustained and effortful search during object memory retrieval, which may be a potential marker indicating disease processes at the pre-dementia stage.

Accordingly, it is necessary to explore the effect of such algorithms on actual human perception. In this paper, we analyze the properties of the human auditory system using two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. First, the magnitude spectra of the EEG signals in several brain cortexes were investigated depending on the sound rendering method. Then, we observed the effects of amplitude panning applied to virtual sound source localization in the human brain using auditory evoked potentials. In particular, the panned audio sources were generated using the stereophonic law of sines, which is a typical amplitude panning technique for stereo loudspeaker listening environments. Depending on the azimuth direction, the event-related potentials (ERPs) between the actually located sound and the virtually panned ones were compared. It is implied from the experiments that the subjects can distinguish actually located sound sources, depending on the azimuth direction, while it is difficult to distinguish between virtually panned sound sources. Finally, it was also demonstrated that the performance of sound source localizations could be measured using EEG signals.

Brain Evoked Potential Latencies Optimization for Spatial Auditory Brain-Computer Interface	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Auditory BCI; Spatial auditory cognition; EEG; Event-related potential (ERP); Feature extraction; Statistical signal processing		We propose a novel method for the extraction of discriminative features in electroencephalography (EEG) evoked potential latency. Based on our offline results, we present evidence indicating that a full surround sound auditory brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm has potential for an online application. The auditory spatial BCI concept is based on an eight-directional audio stimuli delivery technique, developed by our group, which employs a loudspeaker array in an octagonal horizontal plane. The stimuli presented to the subjects vary in frequency and timbre. To capture brain responses, we utilize an eight-channel EEG system. We propose a methodology for finding and optimizing evoked response latencies in the P300 range in order later to classify them correctly and to elucidate the subject's chosen targets or ignored non-targets. To accomplish the above, we propose an approach based on an analysis of variance for feature selection. Finally, we identify the subjects' intended commands with a Naive Bayesian classifier for sorting the final responses. The results obtained with ten subjects in offline BCI experiments support our research hypothesis by providing higher classification results and an improved information transfer rate compared with state-of-the-art solutions.

In the present follow-up study, the signal quality of Emotiv headset was tested by the accuracy rate of discriminating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients from the normal subjects. ERPs of 22 MDD patients and 15 normal subjects were induced by an auditory oddball task and the amplitude of N1, N2 and P3 of ERP components were specifically analyzed. The features of ERPs were statistically investigated. It is found that Emotiv headset is capable of discriminating the abnormal N1, N2 and P3 components in MDD patients. Relief-F algorithm was applied to all features for feature selection. The selected features were then input to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation to characterize the ERP features of MDD. 127 possible combinations out of the selected 7 ERP features were classified using LDA. The best classification accuracy was achieved to be 89.66%. These results suggest that MDD patients are identifiable from normal subjects by ERPs measured by Emotiv headset.

The device functions by detecting the Event Related Potentials (ERP), which can be measured in an electroencephalogram (EEG), that occur when the letter that the subject is looking at flashes (unexpectedly). In this work, after a careful analysis of the EEG signals involved, we propose a preprocessing method that allows us to improve on the state-of-the-art results for this kind of applications. Our results are comparable, and sometimes better, than the best results published, and do not require a feature (channel) selection step, which is extremely costly, and which must be adapted to each user of the P300 speller separately.

Progesterone-associated increase in ERP amplitude correlates with an improvement in performance in a spatial attention paradigm	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Attention; Menstrual cycle; Progesterone; Event-related potential; Alpha oscillation	MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; EEG; PREFERENCES; MASCULINITY; ESTROGEN; ACCESS; SYSTEM; MEMORY	Ovarian sex hormones modulate neuronal circuits not directly involved in reproductive functions. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenous fluctuations of estradiol and progesterone during the menstrual cycle are associated with early cortical processing stages in a cued spatial attention paradigm. EEG was monitored while young women responded to acoustically cued visual stimuli. Women with large mean amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP) (80-120 ms following visual stimuli) responded faster to visual stimuli. In luteal women, mean amplitude of the ERP as well as alpha amplitude, an indicator of attentional modulation, correlated positively with progesterone. Further, cerebral asymmetry in ERP amplitude in the alpha frequency band following target presentation was restricted to luteal women. Critically, early follicular women responded slower to right hemifield compared to left hemifield targets. In late follicular or luteal women, we did not detect a right hemifield disadvantage. Progesterone correlated negatively with RTs in luteal women. Therefore, whereas our behavioral data indicate a functional cerebral asymmetry in early follicular women, EEG recording reveal a physiological cerebral hemisphere asymmetry in the alpha frequency band in luteal women. We assume that a progesterone-associated enhancement in synchronization of synaptic activity in the alpha frequency band in luteal women improves early categorization of visual targets in a cued spatial attention paradigm.

Here we explore the neurophysiology of visual food cue-reactivity in overweight and obese women, as compared with normal weight women, by assessing differences in cortical arousal and attentional processing elicited by food and neutral image inserts in a Stroop task with record of EEG spectral band power and ERP responses. Results show excess right frontal (F-8) and left central (C-3) relative beta band activity in overweight women during food task performance (indicative of pronounced early visual cue-reactivity) and blunted prefrontal (F-p, and F-p2) theta band activity in obese women during office task performance (suggestive of executive dysfunction). Moreover, as compared to normal weight women, food images elicited greater right parietal (P-4) ERP P200 amplitude in overweight women (denoting pronounced early attentional processing) and shorter right parietal (P-4) ERP P300 latency in obese women (signifying enhanced and efficient maintained attentional processing). Differential measures of cortical arousal and attentional processing showed significant correlations with self-reported eating behaviour and body shape dissatisfaction, as well as with objectively assessed percent fat mass. The findings of the present study suggest that heightened food cue-reactivity can be neurophysiologically measured, that different neural circuits are implicated in the pathogenesis of overweight and obesity, and that EEG techniques may serve useful in the identification of endophenotypic markers associated with an increased risk of externally mediated food consumption.

Furthermore, the ERP characteristics, their field distribution and the area of their maximum field intensity were extracted and compared between young and elderly, as well as between females and males. A two tone oddball experiment was conducted, involving 27 young adults and 18 elderly, healthy and right handed, and HD-EEG data were acquired. These data were then subjected to auditory ERPs extraction and thorough statistical analysis. The derived experimental results revealed significant age-related differences to both the latencies and the amplitudes of the MMN and the P300 and the topographic distribution of the HD-EEG amplitudes. Additionally, a shift in the maximum intensities from frontal to temporal lobe with aging appeared in the case of the P300, whereas no effect was observed for the MMN component. No statistical significant differences (p > 0.05) due to age was found in N400 characteristics. Finally, gender-related differences were significant in the response time of the subjects, finding males response faster. The level and the location of the maximum intensity of sources also differed between genders, especially in young subjects. These findings justify the enhanced potential of HD-EEG data to accurately reflect the age and gender dependencies at the three components of simple auditory ERPs and pave the way for the investigation of neurodegenerative pathologies, such as the Alzheimer's disease.

In this study, we investigated the role of task focus for change detection in emotional prosody by measuring changes in event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power. EEG was recorded for prosodies with and without emotion change while subjects performed emotion change detection task (explicit) and visual probe detection task (implicit). We found that vocal emotion change induced theta event-related synchronization during 100-600 ms regardless of task focus. More importantly, vocal emotion change induced significant beta event-related desynchronization during 400-750 ms under explicit instead of implicit task condition. These findings suggest that the detection of emotional changes is independent of task focus, while the task focus effect in neural processing of vocal emotion change is specific to the integration of emotional deviations.

Here we study whether similar correlates can also be identified in driver's electroencephalography (EEG) activity when they perform steering actions triggered by exogenous stimuli (e.g. obstacles along the road). We report analysis of the EEG signals of fifteen subjects while they drive in a realistic car simulator. We found that the peak latency of the event-related potentials in frontal and parietal areas significantly correlates with the onset of the steering behavior. Similarly, modulations of the power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) prior to the action also correlates with the reaction times. These results provide evidence of reliable neural markers of the driver's response variability.

However, as EEG signals easily suffer from various artifacts, ERPs are often collapsed and hard to observe. There are several attempts at using multi-channel EEG signals to enhance EEG signals of interest and make ERPs more clearly observed. For example, a previous work has proposed a blind EEG signal separation method using a multi-channel Wiener filter designed with a probabilistic generative model of observed EEG signals. This method copes with the under-determination of EEG signal separation by assuming sparseness of each EEG component in the time-frequency domain. Although this method blindly separates EEG signals into individual EEG components using time-varying scaled spatial correlation matrices, target EEG components, such as P300 of ERP, are often known in advance in some applications. In this paper, inspired by this previous work, we propose a probabilistic EEG signal enhancement method using a multi-channel Wiener filter, newly incorporating prior information of the spatial correlation matrices related to the target EEG component in the probabilistic generative model to improve performance of EEG signal enhancement. An experimental evaluation for P300 enhancement shows that the proposed method significantly reduces artifacts.

Early event-related brain potentials and hemispheric asymmetries reveal mind-wandering while reading and predict comprehension	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Event related potentials; Hemispheric asymmetry; Individual differences; Language; Mind wandering	WORD RECOGNITION; DEFAULT NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EYE-MOVEMENTS; ATTENTION; ALPHA; ERP; P1	The electroencephalogram (EEG) of mind-wandering (MW) was examined in event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (8-12 Hz), over lateral-posterior sites of left and right brain hemispheres, while individuals read text passages. After controlling for individual differences in general intelligence (g), P1-asymmetry was greater (right-minus- left) and N1 amplitudes were more negative, when individuals were not MW (i.e., they were reading attentively). Approximately 82% of variance in reading comprehension was accounted for by the predictors: g, pre-stimulus alpha, left- and right-hemisphere P1, and left-hemisphere N1 (when individuals were not MW). Together, individual differences in MW-sensitive ERPs uniquely accounted for approximately 38% of the variance in reading comprehension, over and above prediction by g and pre-stimulus alpha. The within-person effect of MW on P1-asymmetry was estimated to account for an additional 4.6% of criterion variance. Implications for EEG/ERP research into attention, language processing, hemispheric asymmetries, and individual differences are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the trial-to-trial variation is evitable in EEG signals, it is a challenge to capture the consistent classification features distribution. Clustering EEG trials with similar features and utilizing a specific classifier adjusted to each cluster can improve EEG classification. In this paper, instead of measuring the similarity of ERP features, the brain states during image stimuli presentation that evoked N1 responses were used to group EEG trials. The correlation between momentary phases of pre-stimulus EEG oscillations and N1 amplitudes was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the phases of time-frequency points about 5.3 Hz and 0.3 s before the stimulus onset have significant effect on the ERP classification accuracy. Our findings revealed that N1 components in ERP fluctuated with momentary phases of EEG. We also further studied the influence of pre-stimulus momentary phases on classification of N1 features. Results showed that linear classifiers demonstrated outstanding classification performance when training and testing trials have close momentary phases. Therefore, this gave us a new direction to improve EEG classification by grouping EEG trials with similar pre-stimulus phases and using each to train unit classifiers respectively.

The efficacy of auditory probes in indexing cognitive workload is dependent on stimulus complexity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive workload; Response orienting; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS; NOVELTY; CHILDREN; ADULTS; SOUND; TASK	We examined whether the utility of a recently developed auditory probe technique for indexing cognitive workload was dependent on the stimulus properties of the probes. EEG was recorded while participants played a videogame under various levels of cognitive workload. At each level of workload, participants were probed with one of four different types of auditory stimuli: novel complex, repeated complex, novel simple, or repeated simple sounds. Probe efficacy at indexing cognitive workload was assessed by determining which probes elicited ERP components that decreased monotonically as a function of workload. Results suggest that complex auditory stimuli were significantly more effective in indexing cognitive workload than simple stimuli. The efficacy of complex stimuli was due to their ability to elicit a robust orienting response, indexed by the early P3a component of the ERP, which decreased monotonically as a function of cognitive workload.

Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions.

However, the underlying neural mechanism regarding such pain-buffering effect of money is not clear. In this paper, we applied event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate the neural effect of money reminders on induced negative emotions. Subjects were first primed of money images and subsequently viewing unpleasant pictures, while EEG was recorded. Behavioral results suggested a reduced sensitivity to unpleasant pictures after participants being reminded of money. ERP data showed that money priming, compared to neutral priming, generated a larger N2 in frontal and posterior areas, reflecting an endogenous mental conflict and the recruitment of attention resources, and a smaller late positive potential (LPP) in parietal and occipital regions, indicating a regulating process of negative emotions. Additionally, how brain responded to money and neutral stimuli were also examined, indexed by "N170-P2" complex. This study provided additional neurophysiological evidences to support previous behavioral researches on money priming and discussed the two separated neural dynamic stages involved in emotion regulation.

A WESN is conceived as a modular neuromonitoring platform for high-density EEG recordings, in which each node is equipped with an electrode array, a signal processing unit, and facilities for wireless communication. We first address the advantages of such a modular approach, and we explain how distributed signal processing algorithms make WESNs more power-efficient, in particular by avoiding data centralization. We provide an overview of distributed signal processing algorithms that are potentially applicable in WESNs, and for illustration purposes, we also provide a more detailed case study of a distributed eye blink artifact removal algorithm. Finally, we study the power efficiency of these distributed algorithms in comparison to their centralized counterparts in which all the raw sensor signals are centralized in a near-end or far-end fusion center.

However, it is still under debate whether the uncertainty effects occur after the occurrence of the event. To address this issue, participants were asked to view emotional pictures that were shortly after a cue, which either indicated a certain emotion of the picture or not. Both certain and uncertain cues were used by neutral symbols. The anticipatory phase (i.e., inter-trial interval, ITI) between the cue and the picture was short to enhance the effects of uncertainty. In addition, we used positive and negative pictures that differed only in valence but not in arousal to investigate whether the uncertainty effect was dependent on emotional valence. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the presentation of the pictures. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that negative pictures evoked smaller P2 and late LPP but larger N2 in the uncertain as compared to the certain condition; whereas we did not find the uncertainty effect in early LPP. For positive pictures, the early LPP was larger in the uncertain as compared to the certain condition; however, there were no uncertainty effects in some other ERP components (e.g., P2, N2, and late LPP). The findings suggest that uncertainty modulates neural activity to emotional pictures and this modulation is altered by the valence of the pictures, indicating that individuals alter the allocation of attentional resources toward uncertain emotional pictures dependently on the valence of the pictures.

The aim of this study was to identify the neural sources, which contribute to scalp ERPs including N450. Methods: Dense-array EEG data were obtained from 20 participants performing numerical Stroop task. By applying ICA, artifacts were identified and removed. The remaining neural sources underwent clustering and further clusters' ERP analysis. Results: While the traditional channels' ERP analysis confirmed the occurrence of conflict-related N450 potential, the ICA results revealed two sources contributing to its variance: the mid-parietal cluster with source estimated in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and fronto-central cluster with source in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The former showed increased (prolonged) activity before the response for cognitively demanding trials, whereas the latter showed negative deflection after the response. PCC activity was decreased (shortened) before erroneous responses, while ACC showed strong error-related negativity. Conclusions: PCC is responsible for stimulus evaluation, while ACC is responsible for evaluating the action-outcome. Moreover, errors are committed due to insufficient stimuli processing within PCC. Significance: ICA proved to be reliable and effective method for ERP analysis, which shed new light into the brain potentials evoked by the numerical Stroop task.

Stimulus Presentation and Data Acquisition	QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; data acquisition; stimulus parameters; EEG; noise; artifact		Event-related potentials (ERPs) are the changes in the ongoing electrical activity of the brain (the EEG) that are elicited by either an external physical stimulus or an internal psychological "event". This article provides a tutorial review of the methods used for the collection of ERP data. Because ERPs are influenced by both stimulus parameters and the mental state of the subject (what the subject is "doing"), precise control over how the stimulus is presented and how the subject's response is monitored must be described. ERPs are generally recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp. How the electrodes are placed (the montage) and the choice of the reference to which the electrical activity of the scalp are compared will have a large influence on the results. Electrodes will also pick up extraneous artifact or "noise". Methods to reduce this noise are described. ERPs provide high temporal resolution of the extent of information processing allowing researchers to access to both sensory and cognitive processes involved in complex decision-making.

This can be problematic due to trial-to-trial latency variability. Residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) was developed to decompose ERPs into component clusters with different latency variability and to re-synchronize the separated components into a reconstructed ERP. New method: RIDE has been continuously upgraded and now converges to a robust version. We describe the principles of RIDE and detailed algorithms of the functional modules of a toolbox. We give recommendations and provide caveats for using RIDE from both methodological and psychological perspectives. Results: RIDE was applied to several data samples to demonstrate its ability to decompose and reconstruct latency-variable components of ERPs and to retrieve single trial variability information. Different functionalities of RIDE were shown in appropriate examples. Comparison with existing methods: RIDE employs several modules to achieve a robust decomposition of ERP. As main innovations RIDE (1) is able to extract components based on the combination of known event markers and estimated latencies, (2) prevents distortions much more effectively than previous methods based on least-square algorithms, and (3) allows time window confinements to target relevant components associated with sub-processes of interest. Conclusions: RIDE is a convenient method that decomposes ERPs and provides single trial analysis, yielding rich information about sub-components, and that reconstructs ERPs, more closely reflecting the combined activity of single trial ERPs. The outcomes of RIDE provide new dimensions to study brain behavior relationships based on EEG data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG signals tend to be represented by a vector or a matrix to facilitate data processing and analysis with generally understood methodologies like time-series analysis, spectral analysis and matrix decomposition. Indeed, EEG signals are often naturally born with more than two modes of time and space, and they can be denoted by a multi-way array called as tensor. This review summarizes the current progress of tensor decomposition of EEG signals with three aspects. The first is about the existing modes and tensors of EEG signals. Second, two fundamental tensor decomposition models, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD, it is also called parallel factor analysis-PARAFAC) and Tucker decomposition, are introduced and compared. Moreover, the applications of the two models for EEG signals are addressed. Particularly, the determination of the number of components for each mode is discussed. Finally, the N-way partial least square and higher-order partial least square are described for a potential trend to process and analyze brain signals of two modalities simultaneously.

Sequential processing in an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task with variable interstimulus interval	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Principal components analysis (PCA); Auditory Go/NoGo task; Sequential processing; Variable ISI; Temporally uncertain stimulus; Expectancy processing	ERP RESPONSES; PROBABILITY; COMPONENT; EEG; PCA; DETERMINANTS; EXPECTATIONS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN	A recent series of studies of the auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task, using fixed interstimulus intervals (ISIS), proposed a processing schema relating observed event-related potential (ERP) components to sequential processing stages. However, it has been demonstrated that attention and ERP components can be affected by the predictable rhythmic timing of fixed ISIs. Hence the aim of the current study was to test the robustness of that processing schema with an unpredictable arrhythmic variable ISI. EEG was recorded from 30 university students at 30 scalp sites in an unwarned auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task using a variable ISI. Following our previous studies, Go and NoGo ERP components were derived using temporal principal components analysis (PCA). Of the unrestricted Varimax-rotated factors, seven were identifiable as components based on their topography, polarity, and latency: two subcomponents of the N1 (N1-1, and processing negativity, PN), P2/N2b, N2c/P3a, P3b, and two subcomponents of the slow wave (SW-1 and SW-2). These components showed Go/NoGo effects comparable to those previously noted with fixed ISI, supporting the proposed processing schema. The Late Positivity (LP) component, previously speculated to mark cortical deactivation after processing the NoGo stimulus, was not present in the sequence of components. In its absence, activity underlying the observed sustained P300/late positive complex may be involved in processing temporally-uncertain stimuli. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We developed a simulated driving environment for studying neural correlates of emergency braking in diversified driving situations. We further investigated to what extent these neural correlates can be used to detect a participant' s braking intention prior to the behavioral response. Approach. We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic signals during simulated driving. Fifteen participants drove a virtual vehicle and were exposed to several kinds of traffic situations in a simulator system, while EEG signals were measured. After that, we extracted characteristic features to categorize whether the driver intended to brake or not. Main results. Our system shows excellent detection performance in a broad range of possible emergency situations. In particular, we were able to distinguish three different kinds of emergency situations (sudden stop of a preceding vehicle, sudden cutting-in of a vehicle from the side and unexpected appearance of a pedestrian) from non-emergency (soft) braking situations, as well as from situations in which no braking was required, but the sensory stimulation was similar to stimulations inducing an emergency situation (e.g., the sudden stop of a vehicle on a neighboring lane). Significance. We proposed a novel feature combination comprising movement-related potentials such as the readiness potential, event-related desynchronization features besides the event-related potentials (ERP) features used in a previous study. The performance of predicting braking intention based on our proposed feature combination was superior compared to using only ERP features. Our study suggests that emergency situations are characterized by specific neural patterns of sensory perception and processing, as well as motor preparation and execution, which can be utilized by neurotechnology based braking assistance systems.

Dissociation of category-learning systems via brain potentials	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						category learning; event-related potentials; explicit; implicit; EEG	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; RECOGNITION MEMORY; MULTIPLE SYSTEMS; CATEGORIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; PERCEPTION; EXPERTISE; FEEDBACK; IMPLICIT; SURPRISE	Behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evidence has suggested that categories can often be learned via either an explicit rule-based (RB) mechanism critically dependent on medial temporal and prefrontal brain regions, or via an implicit information-integration (II) mechanism relying on the basal ganglia. In this study, participants viewed sine wave gratings (Gabor patches) that varied on two dimensions and learned to categorize them via trial-by-trial feedback. Two different stimulus distributions were used; one was intended to encourage an explicit RB process and the other an implicit II process. We monitored brain activity with scalp electroencephalography (EEG) while each participant: (1) passively observed stimuli represented of both distributions; (2) categorized stimuli from one distribution, and, 1 week later; (3) categorized stimuli from the other distribution. Categorization accuracy was similar for the two distributions. Subtractions of Event Related Potentials (ERPs) for correct and incorrect trials were used to identify neural differences in RB and II categorization processes. We identified an occipital brain potential that was differentially modulated by categorization condition accuracy at an early latency (150-250 ms), likely reflecting the degree of holistic processing. A stimulus locked Late Positive Complex (LPC) associated with explicit memory updating was modulated by accuracy in the RB, but not the II task. Likewise, a feedback-locked P300 ERP associated with expectancy was correlated with performance only in the RB, but not the II condition. These results provide additional evidence for distinct brain mechanisms supporting RB vs. implicit II category learning and use.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an inexpensive and non-invasive procedure with very high temporal resolution which enables analysis of short and fast swallowing events, as well as an analysis of the organizational and behavioral aspects of cortical motor preparation, swallowing execution and swallowing regulation. EEG is a powerful technique which can be used alone or in combination with other techniques for monitoring swallowing, detection of swallowing motor imagery for diagnostic or biofeedback purposes, or to modulate and measure the effects of swallowing rehabilitation. This paper provides a review of the existing literature which has deployed EEG in the investigation of oropharyngeal swallowing, smell, taste and texture related to swallowing, cortical pre-motor activation in swallowing, and swallowing motor imagery detection. Furthermore, this paper provides a brief review of the different modalities of brain imaging techniques used to study swallowing brain activities, as well as the EEG components of interest for studies on swallowing and on swallowing motor imagery. Lastly, this paper provides directions for future swallowing investigations using EEG.

Eric; Du, Fei; Smoller, JordanW.; O'Connor, Lauren; Spencer, Kevin M.; Oenguer, Dost			Frontal P3 event-related potential is related to brain glutamine/glutamate ratio measured in vivo	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						P3; Event-related potential; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); Glutamate	SCHIZOPHRENIA; GLUTAMATE; COMPONENTS; ASTROCYTES; MODULATION; AMPLITUDE; SPECTRA; NOVELTY; MRS	Background: The auditory P3 event-related potential (ERP) is thought to index cognitive processing relevant to attention and working memory processes. Drug challenge studies suggest that glutamate neurotransmission plays an important role in modulating P3 ERP. However, while direct links between glutamate activity and P3 ERP response in humans are suspected, mechanistic details remain largely unknown. We investigated here the relationships between P3 ERP and indices of glutamatergic processing measured in vivo with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS). We hypothesized that a higher index of glutamatergic processing (glutamine/glutamate ratio; abbreviated Gln/Glu) in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and in the parietal-occipital (POC) cortices would associate with larger frontal P3a and parietal P3b amplitudes, respectively. Methods: Frontal P3a (Fz) and parietal P3b (Pz) were collected from 32 healthy participants who performed an auditory oddball task. Resting glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and Gln/Glu (an index of glutamatergic processing) measures were obtained on a 4 T MR scanner using J-resolved MR spectroscopy. Linear regression and partial correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln/Glu ratio (partial R = 0.57; P = 0.001) and between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln concentration (partial R = 0.43; P = 0.02). Relationships between parietal P3b and the glutamate indices in the POC were not significant. Conclusions: These results indicate a specific connection between an index of glutamate neurotransmitter function in ACC and frontal P3 ERP, providing a novel insight into the neurochemistry underlying scalp recorded EEG response. Abnormalities in glutamate neurotransmission have been observed in schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions and may underlie illness related deficits of P3 ERP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Three groups of emotion pictures, positive, negative (or violent) and neutral, were viewed by 19 PTSD patients and 15 normal controls. Each picture had a frame, and participants reacted to the color of the frame by clicking buttons. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavior data were recorded. Peak latencies and amplitudes of P2 were measured. Results: For the three groups of pictures, PTSD patients had longer reaction time than the controls. Significant difference was found between PTSD patients and controls in response to violent, positive and neutral pictures.

Evaluating Methods for Constructing Average High-Density Electrode Positions	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Electrode positions; Electroencehalography; EEG recording	SOURCE LOCALIZATION; EEG; BRAIN; REGISTRATION; INFANT; SYSTEM; ATLAS	Accurate analysis of scalp-recorded electrical activity requires the identification of electrode locations in 3D space. For example, source analysis of EEG/ERP (electroencephalogram, EEG; event-related-potentials, ERP) with realistic head models requires the identification of electrode locations on the head model derived from structural MRI recordings. Electrode systems must cover the entire scalp in sufficient density to discriminate EEG activity on the scalp and to complete accurate source analysis. The current study compares techniques for averaging electrode locations from 86 participants with the 128 channel "Geodesic Sensor Net" (GSN; EGI, Inc.), 38 participants with the 128 channel "Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net" (HGSN; EGI, Inc.), and 174 participants with the 81 channels in the 10-10 configurations. A point-set registration between the participants and an average MRI template resulted in an average configuration showing small standard errors, which could be transformed back accurately into the participants' original electrode space. Average electrode locations are available for the GSN (86 participants), Hydrocel-GSN (38 participants), and 10-10 and 10-5 systems (174 participants).

The present study extended the validation of Emotiv system using Neuroscan system by comparison of the characteristics of behavioral data and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs of 30 normal subjects were induced by an auditory oddball task, in which the amplitudes and latencies of Ni, N2, and P3 were specifically analyzed. Reaction time (RT) and response accuracy were derived from synchronously recorded behavioral data. Compared to Neuroscan system, RT detected by Emotiv device was longer; however, the RT variations in both systems were not significantly different. Response accuracy in two systems was consistent. The patterns of amplitude Ni, N2, and P3 in ERPs were similar. These comparative results confirmed that Emotiv device could provide reliable auditory ERP signals, suggesting its potential for further development in medical applications.

Each of these sub-matrices has a complex interaction depending upon the brain state i.e., rest, cognition, seizures and interictal periods. This interaction presents significant challenges for interpretation but also potential for developing further insights into individual event types. Successful treatments in epilepsy hinge on unravelling these complexities, and also on the sensitivity and specificity of methods that characterize the nature and localization of underlying physiological and pathological networks. Limitations of pharmacological and surgical treatments call for refinement and elaboration of methods to improve our capability to localise the generators of seizure activity and our understanding of the neurobiology of epilepsy. Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), by potentially circumventing some of the limitations of EEG in terms of sensitivity, can allow the mapping of haemodynamic networks over the entire brain related to specific spontaneous and triggered epileptic events in humans, and thereby provide new localising information. In this work we review the published literature, and discuss the methods and utility of EEG-fMRI in localising the generators of epileptic activity. We draw on our experience and that of other groups, to summarise the spectrum of information provided by an increasing number of EEG-fMRI case-series, case studies and group studies in patients with epilepsy, for its potential role to elucidate epileptic generators and networks. We conclude that EEG-fMRI provides a multidimensional view that contributes valuable clinical information to localize the epileptic focus with potential important implications for the surgical treatment of some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and insights into the resting state and cognitive network dynamics.

The rERP framework	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Other; Language; Speech; Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; PROCESSING EVIDENCE; PREDICTABILITY; TRACKING	ERP averaging is an extraordinarily successful method, but can only be applied to a limited range of experimental designs. We introduce the regression-based rERP framework, which extends ERP averaging to handle arbitrary combinations of categorical and continuous covariates, partial confounding, nonlinear effects, and overlapping responses to distinct events, all within a single unified system. rERPs enable a richer variety of paradigms (including high-N naturalistic designs) while preserving the advantages of traditional ERPs. This article provides an accessible introduction to what rERPs are, why they are useful, how they are computed, and when we should expect them to be effective, particularly in cases of partial confounding. A companion article discusses how nonlinear effects and overlap correction can be handled within this framework, as well as practical considerations around baselining, filtering, statistical testing, and artifact rejection. Free software implementing these techniques is available.

The method could potentially enable robust recording of EEG in natural environments. The objective of this study was to substantiate the ear-EEG method by using a larger population of subjects and several paradigms. For rigor, we considered simultaneous scalp and ear-EEG recordings with common reference. More precisely, 32 conventional scalp electrodes and 12 ear electrodes allowed a thorough comparison between conventional and ear electrodes, testing several different placements of references. The paradigms probed auditory onset response, mismatch negativity, auditory steady-state response and alpha power attenuation. By comparing event related potential (ERP) waveforms from the mismatch response paradigm, the signal measured from the ear electrodes was found to reflect the same cortical activity as that from nearby scalp electrodes. It was also found that referencing the ear-EEG electrodes to another within ear electrode affects the time domain recorded waveform (relative to scalp recordings), but not the timing of individual components. It was furthermore found that auditory steady-state responses and alpha-band modulation were measured reliably with the ear-EEG modality. Finally, our findings showed that the auditory mismatch response was difficult to monitor with the ear-EEG. We conclude that ear-EEG yields similar performance as conventional EEG for spectrogram-based analysis, similar timing of ERP components, and equal signal strength for sources close to the ear. Ear-FEG can reliably measure activity from regions of the cortex which are located close to the ears, especially in paradigms employing frequency domain analyses.

Assessment of nonlinear interactions in event-related potentials elicited by stimuli presented at short interstimulus intervals using single-trial data	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG; mixed effects models; analysis of variance	EEG RESPONSES; ERPS	The recording of brain event-related potentials (ERPs) is a widely used technique to investigate the neural basis of sensory perception and cognitive processing in humans. Due to the low magnitude of ERPs, averaging of several consecutive stimuli is typically employed to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) before subsequent analysis. However, when the temporal interval between two consecutive stimuli is smaller than the latency of the main ERP peaks, i.e., when the stimuli are presented at a fast rate, overlaps between the corresponding ERPs may occur. These overlaps are usually dealt with by assuming that there is a simple additive superposition between the elicited ERPs and consequently performing algebraic waveform subtractions. Here, we test this assumption rigorously by providing a statistical framework that examines the presence of nonlinear additive effects between overlapping ERPs elicited by successive stimuli with short interstimulus intervals (ISIs). The results suggest that there are no nonlinear additive effects due to the time overlap per se but that, for the range of ISIs examined, the second ERP is modulated by the presence of the first stimulus irrespective of whether there is time overlap or not. In other words, two ERPs that overlap in time can still be written as an addition of two ERPs but with the second ERP being different from the first. This difference is also present in the case of nonoverlapping ERPs with short ISIs. The modulation effect elicited on the second ERP by the first stimulus is dependent on the ISI value.

Allelic variations of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) have recently been shown to impact memory performance. Common variants of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) of the SLC6A4 gene result in long (I) and short (s) allelic variants with carriers of the s allele having lowered transcriptional efficiency. Thus, the current study examines the effects polymorphisms of the SLC6A4 gene have on performance and ERP amplitudes commonly associated with recognition memory. Electroencephalogram (EEG), genetic, and behavioral data were collected from sixty participants as they performed an item and source memory recognition task. In both tasks, participants studied and encoded 200 words, which were then mixed with 200 new words during retrieval. Participants were monitored with EEG during the retrieval portion of each memory task. EEG electrodes were grouped into four ROIs, left anterior superior, right anterior superior, left posterior superior, and right posterior superior. ERP mean amplitudes during hits in the item and source memory task were compared to correctly recognizing new items (correct rejections). Results show that s-carriers have decreased mean hit amplitudes in both the right anterior superior ROI 1000-1500 ms post stimulus during the source memory task and the left anterior superior ROI 300-500 ms post stimulus during the item memory task. These results suggest that individual differences due to genetic variation of the serotonin transporter gene influences recognition memory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are several reviews in the field of social commerce or e-commerce; these have great potential value and mining them is fundamental and significant. To our knowledge, EEG is rarely applied to study these. In this study, we examined the neural correlates of social commerce reviews (SCRs) and e-commerce reviews (ECRs) by using them as stimuli to evoke event-related potentials. All SCRs were from friends through a social media platform, whereas ECRs were from strangers through an e-commerce platform. The experimental design was similar to that of a priming paradigm, and included 40 pairs of stimuli consisting of product information (prime stimulus) and reviews (target stimulus). The results showed that the P300 component was successfully evoked by SCR and ECR stimuli. Moreover, the P300 components elicited by SCRs had higher amplitudes than those elicited by ECRs. These findings indicate that participants paid more attention to SCRs than to ECRs. In addition, the associations between neural responses and reviews in social commerce have the potential to assist companies in studying consumer behaviors, thus permitting them to enhance their social commerce strategies.

Event-Related Potential and Time-Frequency Endophenotypes for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory Oddball; ERP; P300; PCA; Psychosis; Time-Frequency	P300 AMPLITUDE; AUDITORY P300; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; NEURAL ACTIVATIONS; ABNORMALITIES; RELATIVES; PROBANDS; TARGET; FAMILY	BACKGROUND: The investigators compared event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes and event-related oscillations across a broad frequency range during an auditory oddball task using a comprehensive analysis approach to describe shared and unique neural auditory processing characteristics among healthy subjects (HP), schizophrenia probands (SZ) and their first-degree relatives, and bipolar disorder I with psychosis probands (BDP) and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: This Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes sample consisted of clinically stable SZ (n = 229) and BDP (n = 188), HP (n = 284), first-degree relatives of schizophrenia probands (n = 264), and first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder I with psychosis probands (n = 239). They were administered an auditory oddball task in the electroencephalography environment. Principal components analysis derived data-driven frequency bands evoked power. Spatial principal components analysis reduced ERP and frequency data to component waveforms for each subject. Clusters of time bins with significant group differences on response magnitude were assessed for proband/relative differences from HP and familiality. RESULTS: Nine variables survived a linear discriminant analysis between HP, SZ, and BDP. Of those, two showed evidence (deficit in relatives and familiality) as genetic risk markers more specific to SZ (N1, P3b), one was specific to BDP (P2) and one for psychosis in general (N2). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports for both shared and unique deficits in early sensory and late cognitive processing across psychotic diagnostic groups. Additional ERP and time-frequency component alterations (frontal N2/P2, late high, early, mid, and low frequency) may provide insight into deficits in underlying neural architecture and potential protective/compensatory mechanisms in unaffected relatives.

This may be particularly problematic during everyday multitasking situations when cognitively demanding tasks are performed while walking. Due to previous limitations in neuroimaging technology, much remains unknown about the cortical mechanisms underlying resource allocation during locomotion. Here, we utilized an EEG-based mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) technique that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity concurrently. To assess effects of motor load on cognition we evaluated young (N = 17; mean age = 27.2) and older adults (N = 16; mean age = 63.9) and compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/No-Go response inhibition task as participants sat stationary or walked on a treadmill. Stride time and variability were also measured during task performance and compared to stride parameters obtained without task performance, thereby assessing effects of cognitive load on gait. Results showed that older, but not young adults' accuracy dropped significantly when performing the inhibitory task while walking. Young adults revealed ERP modulations at relatively early (N2 amplitude reduction) and later (earlier P3 latency) stages within the processing stream as motor load increased while walking. In contrast, older adults' ERP modulations were limited to later processing stages (increased P3 amplitude) of the inhibitory network. The relative delay and attenuation of ERP modulations accompanied by behavioral costs in older participants might indicate an age-associated loss in flexible resource allocation across multiple tasks. Better understanding of the neural underpinnings of these age-related changes may lead to improved strategies to reduce fall risk and enhance mobility in aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It provides the opportunity to gather detailed information for analysis. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging is one good example of it. The information we get after fusing data from EEG and fMRI have both high temporal and spatial resolution. On the other side, this EEG recording suffers from some additional artifacts due to the fMRI environment, in particular, the Ballistocardiogram artifact. In this article, a new method of removing Ballistocardiogram Artifact from evoked potential studies is proposed. The method does not require any reference signal or prior information. The results presented are using the data of three subjects (volunteers). The results show that the proposed method can efficiently reduce Ballistocardiogram artifact and has performed better compared to the conventional methods.

They, moreover, allow to predict their probable development. Today, we know that certain brain responses (e.g., event-related potentials or oscillatory changes) to stimulation, circadian rhythmicity, the presence or absence of sleep patterns as well as measures of resting state brain activity can serve the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation process. Still, the paradigms we are using nowadays do not allow to disentangle VS/UWS and minimally conscious state (MCS) patients with the desired reliability and validity. Furthermore, even rather well established methods have, unfortunately, not found their way into clinical routine yet. We here review current literature as well as recent findings from our group and discuss how neuroimaging methods (fMRI, PET) and particularly electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to investigate cognition in DOG or even to assess the degree of residual awareness. We, moreover, propose that circadian rhythmicity and sleep in brain-injured patients are promising fields of research in this context.

Hemifield-dependent N1 and event-related theta/delta oscillations: An unbiased comparison of surface Laplacian and common EEG reference choices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Current source density (CSD); EEG recording reference; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs); Principal components analysis (PCA); Visual half-field (VHF) paradigm; N1pc; Signal-to-noise; Sample size; Time-frequency analysis; ERS/ERD; Reference electrode standardization technique (REST); Volume conduction; Surface Laplacian; Permutation tests	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ELECTRICAL DISTANCE; REFERENCE ELECTRODE; DEPRESSED PARENTS; SPHERICAL SPLINES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Surface Laplacian methodology has been used to reduce the impact of volume conduction and arbitrary choice of EEG recording reference for the analysis of surface potentials. However, the empirical implications of employing these different transformations to the same EEG data remain obscure. This study directly compared the statistical effects of four commonly-used (nose, linked mastoids, average) or recommended (reference electrode standardization technique [REST]) references and their spherical spline current source density (CSD) transformation for a large data set stemming from a well-understood experimental manipulation. ERPs (72 sites) recorded from 130 individuals during a visual half-field paradigm with highly-controlled emotional stimuli were characterized by mid-parietooccipital N1 (125 ms peak latency) and event-related synchronization (ERS) of theta/delta (160 ms), which were most robust over the contralateral hemisphere. All five data transformations were rescaled to the same covariance and submitted to a single temporal or time-frequency PCA (Varimax) to yield simplified estimates of N1 or theta/delta ERS. Unbiased nonparametric permutation tests revealed that these hemifield-dependent asymmetries were by far most focal and prominent for CSD data, despite all transformations showing maximum effects at mid-parietooccipital sites. Employing smaller subsamples (signal-to-noise) or window-based ERP/ERS amplitudes did not affect these comparisons. Furthermore, correlations between N1 and theta/delta ERS at these sites were strongest for CSD and weakest for nose-referenced data. Contrary to the common notion that the spatial high pass filter properties of a surface Laplacian reduce important contributions of neuronal generators to the EEG signal, the present findings demonstrate that instead volume conduction inherent in surface potentials weakens the representation of neuronal activation patterns at scalp that directly reflect regional brain activity.

To this aim, EEG activities must be interpreted in terms of brain and/or mental processes. EEG signals being a direct manifestation of neuronal activity it is often assumed that such interpretations are quite obvious or, at least, straightforward. However, they often rely on (explicit or even implicit) assumptions regarding the structures supposed to generate the EEG activities of interest. For these assumptions to be used appropriately, reliable links between EEG activities and the underlying brain structures must be established. Because of volume conduction effects and the mixture of activities they induce, these links are difficult to establish with scalp potential recordings. We present different examples showing how the Laplacian transformation, acting as an efficient source separation method, allowed to establish more reliable links between EEG activities and brain generators and, ultimately, with mental operations. The nature of those links depends on the depth of inferences that can vary from weak to strong. Along this continuum, we show that 1) while the effects of experimental manipulation can appear widely distributed with scalp potentials, Laplacian transformation allows to reveal several generators contributing (in different manners) to these modulations, 2) amplitude variations within the same set of generators can generate spurious differences in scalp potential topographies, often interpreted as reflecting different source configurations. In such a case, Laplacian transformation provides much more similar topographies, evidencing the same generator(s) set, and 3) using the LRP as an index of response activation most often produces ambiguous results, Laplacian-transformed response-locked ERPs obtained over motor areas allow resolving these ambiguities.

How culture gets embrained: Cultural differences in event-related potentials of social norm violations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						culture; social norms; N400; electroencephalography; EEG	BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL BASIS; INCONGRUITIES; COMPONENT; BLIND	Humans are unique among all species in their ability to develop and enforce social norms, but there is wide variation in the strength of social norms across human societies. Despite this fundamental aspect of human nature, there has been surprisingly little research on how social norm violations are detected at the neurobiological level. Building on the emerging field of cultural neuroscience, we combine noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) with a new social norm violation paradigm to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the detection of norm violations and how they vary across cultures. EEG recordings from Chinese and US participants (n = 50) showed consistent negative deflection of event-related potential around 400 ms (N400) over the central and parietal regions that served as a culture-general neural marker of detecting norm violations. The N400 at the frontal and temporal regions, however, was only observed among Chinese but not US participants, illustrating culture-specific neural substrates of the detection of norm violations. Further, the frontal N400 predicted a variety of behavioral and attitudinal measurements related to the strength of social norms that have been found at the national and state levels, including higher culture superiority and self-control but lower creativity. There were no cultural differences in the N400 induced by semantic violation, suggesting a unique cultural influence on social norm violation detection. In all, these findings provided the first evidence, to our knowledge, for the neurobiological foundations of social norm violation detection and its variation across cultures.

Although Laplacian methods have been applied, apprehensions about loss of global activity dissuade researchers from greater use except as a supplement to reference-dependent measures. The unfortunate result has been continued reliance on reference strategies that differ across labs, and a systemic preference for a montage-dependent average reference over true reference-free measures. We addressed these concerns by comparing resting- and task-related EEG alpha using three EEG transformations: nose- (NR) and average-referenced (AR) EEG, and the corresponding CSD. Amplitude spectra of resting and prestimulus task-related EEG (novelty oddball) and event-related spectral perturbations were scaled to equate each transformation. Alpha measures quantified for 8-12 Hz bands were: 1) net amplitude (eyes-closed minus eyes-open) and 2) overall amplitude (eyes-closed plus eyes-open); 3) task amplitude (prestimulus baseline) and 4) task event-related desynchronization (ER])). Mean topographies unambiguously represented posterior alpha for overall, net and task, as well as poststimulus alpha ERD. Topographies were similar for the three transformations, but differed in dispersion, CSD being sharpest and NR most broadly distributed. Transformations also differed in scale, AR showing less attenuation or spurious secondary maxima at anterior sites, consistent with simulations of distributed posterior generators. Posterior task alpha and alpha ER]) were positively correlated with overall alpha, but not with net alpha. CSD topographies consistently and appropriately represented posterior EEG alpha for all measures. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lu, N; Yin, T				Lu, Na; Yin, Tao			Motor imagery classification via combinatory decomposition of ERP and ERSP using sparse nonnegative matrix factorization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Classification; Event related potential; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Brain computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; EEG; COMPONENTS; ALGORITHMS; ICA	Background: Brain activities could be measured by devices like EEG, MEG, MRI etc. in terms of electric or magnetic signal, which could provide information from three domains, i.e., time, frequency and space. Combinatory analysis of these features could definitely help to improve the classification performance on brain activities. NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization) has been widely applied in pattern extraction tasks (e.g., face recognition, gene data analysis) which could provide physically meaningful explanation of the data. However, brain signals also take negative values, so only spectral feature has been employed in existing NMF studies for brain computer interface. In addition, sparsity is an intrinsic characteristic of electric signals. New method: To incorporate sparsity constraint and enable analysis of time domain feature using NMF, a new solution for motor imagery classification is developed, which combinatorially analyzes the ERP (event related potential, time domain) and ERSP (event related spectral perturbation, frequency domain) features via a modified mixed alternating least square based NMF method (MALS-NMF for short). Results: Extensive experiments have verified the effectivity the proposed method. The results also showed that imposing sparsity constraint on the coefficient matrix in ERP factorization and basis matrix in ERSP factorization could better improve the algorithm performance. Comparison with existing methods: Comparisons with other eight representative methods have further verified the superiority of the proposed method. Conclusions: The MALS-NMF method is an effective solution for motor imagery classification and has shed some new light into the field of brain dynamics pattern analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The identification of a late-event related potential for LP listeners in the intelligible condition and in all listeners when challenged with a 6-Ch signal supports the notion that this induced potential may be related to either processing degraded speech, or degraded processing of intelligible speech. Different cortical locations are identified as neural generators responsible for this activity; HP listeners are engaging motor aspects of their language system, utilizing an acoustic-phonetic based strategy to help resolve the sentence, while LP listeners do not. This study presents evidence for neurophysiological indices associated with more or less successful speech comprehension performance across listening conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling nonlinear relationships in ERP data using mixed-effects regression with R examples	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Nonlinear relationships; GAMM; Regression splines	WORD-LENGTH; MULTIMODEL INFERENCE; BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY; SELECTION; BRAIN; LINE	In the analysis of psychological and psychophysiological data, the relationship between two variables is often assumed to be a straight line. This may be due to the prevalence of the general linear model in data analysis in these fields, which makes this assumption implicitly. However, there are many problems for which this assumption does not hold. In this paper, we show that, in the analysis of event-related potential (ERP) data, the assumption of linearity comes at a cost and may significantly affect the inferences drawn from the data. We demonstrate why the assumption of linearity should be relaxed and how to model nonlinear relationships between ERP amplitudes and predictor variables within the familiar framework of generalized linear models, using regression splines and mixed-effects modeling.

The measured brain activities usually constitute the signals of interest and noises. Applying the portable device and removing noise are the benefits to real-world BCI. In this study, one portable electroencephalogram (EEG) system non-invasively acquired brain dynamics through wireless transmission while six subjects participated in the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The event-related potential (ERP) was traditionally estimated by ensemble averaging (EA) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. One adaptive filter of data-reusing radial basis function network (DR-RBFN) was also utilized as the estimator. The results showed that this portable EEG system stably acquired brain activities. Furthermore, the task-related potentials could be clearly explored from the limited samples of EEG data through DR-RBFN. According to the artifact-free data from the portable device, this study demonstrated the potential to move the BCI from laboratory research to real-life application in the near future.

Delayed emergence of behavioral and electrophysiological effects following juvenile ketamine exposure in mice	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DEPARTMENT SAFETY PROFILE; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; ARM WATER MAZE; APOPTOTIC NEURODEGENERATION; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; INTRAMUSCULAR KETAMINE; EMOTION RECOGNITION; PEDIATRIC SEDATION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT	Frequent ketamine abuse in adulthood correlates with increased risk of psychosis, as well as cognitive deficits, including disruption of higher-order executive function and memory formation. Although the primary abusers of ketamine are adolescents and young adults, few studies have evaluated its effects on juvenile cognition. Therefore, the current study analyzes the effect of adolescent ketamine exposure on cognitive development. Juvenile mice (4 weeks of age) were exposed to chronic ketamine (20 mg kg(-1), i.p. daily) for 14 days. Mice were tested immediately after exposure in the juvenile period (7 weeks of age) and again as adults (12 weeks of age). Measures included electroencephalography (EEG) in response to auditory stimulation, the social choice test, and a 6-arm radial water maze task. Outcome measures include low-frequency EEG responses, event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes, indices of social behavior and indices of spatial working memory. Juvenile exposure to ketamine was associated with electrophysiological abnormalities in adulthood, particularly in induced theta power and the P80 ERP. The social choice test revealed that ketamine-exposed mice failed to exhibit the same age-related decrease in social interaction time as controls. Ketamine-exposed mice outperformed control mice as juveniles on the radial water maze task, but did not show the same age-related improvement as adult controls. These data support the hypothesis that juvenile exposure to ketamine produces long-lasting changes in brain function that are characterized by a failure to progress along normal developmental trajectories.

In the present study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of neural activities in multiple brain regions using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously during somatosensory Go/No-go paradigms. The results of MEG showed that neural activities in the bilateral premotor area at approximately 150ms and in the primary motor cortex at approximately 250ms were only detected in Go trials, while brain responses in the bilateral prefrontal cortex at approximately 170ms were only observed in No-go trials. In addition, the amplitudes of the N140 and P300 components in EEG was significantly larger in No-go trials than in Go trials, and the latencies of N140 and P300 were significantly later in No-go trials than in Go trials. Our results indicated the time courses of neural processing in response execution and inhibition processing, and revealed differences in their underlying neural mechanisms.

While both of these approaches have proven valuable, they lack the ability to determine a direct locus of function while concurrently having the necessary temporal precision needed to understand millisecond scale neural interactions respectively. In this review we summarize some seminal behavioral findings across three broad areas (target perturbation, feed-forward control, and feedback processing) and for each discuss the application of electroencephalography (EEG) to the understanding of the temporal nature of visual cue utilization during movement planning, control, and learning using four existing scalp potentials. Specifically, we examine the appropriateness of using the N100 potential as an indicator of corrective behaviors in response to target perturbation, the N200 as an index of movement planning, the P300 potential as a metric of feed-forward processes, and the feedback-related negativity as an index of motor learning. Although these existing components have potential for insight into cognitive contributions and the timing of the neural processes that contribute to motor control further research is needed to expand the control-related potentials and to develop methods to permit their accurate characterization across a wide range of behavioral tasks.

Although cognitive dysfunction is a common manifestation, it may go unnoticed in recently-diagnosed patients. Prior studies suggest MS patients develop compensatory mechanisms potentially involving enhanced performance monitoring. Here we assessed the performance monitoring system in early-stage MS patients using the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related brain potential (ERP) observed following behavioral errors. Twenty-seven early-stage MS patients and 31 controls were neuropsychologically assessed. Electroencephalography recordings were obtained while participants performed: a) a stop task and b) an auditory oddball task. Behavior and ERP measures were assessed. No differences in performance were found between groups in most neuropsychological tests or in behavior or ERP components in the auditory oddball task. However, the amplitude of the ERN associated with stop errors in the stop task was significantly higher in patients. ERN amplitude correlated positively with scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, and negatively with the time since last relapse. Patients showed higher neuronal recruitment in tasks involving performance monitoring. Results suggest the development of compensatory brain mechanisms in early-stage MS and reflect the sensitivity of the ERN to detect these changes.

Using role-reverse sentences, recent ERPs studies, in light of Semantic Illusion Theory, have challenged the assumption that syntactic-semantic processes are coupled. We ran two ERP experiments (active and passive voice) using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in role-reversed sentences in three conditions, trying to reestablish a direct correspondence between syntax-first models and on-line sentence processing and relating them to new neurophysiological findings of two processing pathways, a ventral and a dorsal, the first for words and coordinated items and the second for hierarchical structures. We found evidence in favor of a syntax-first account. The N400 and P600 appear to be modulated by the subject-object asymmetry, reflecting, respectively, the merge of the internal argument with the verb and, the integration of the external argument.

The current study determined whether experimental sleep restriction had an effect on experimentally induced pain and pain-elicited electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Design: A paired crossover study. Intervention: Pain testing was performed after 2 nights of 50% SR and after 2 nights with habitual sleep (HS). Setting: Laboratory experiment at research center. Participants: Self-reported healthy volunteers (n = 21, age range: 18-31 y). Measurements and Results: Brief high-density electrical stimuli to the forearm skin produced pinprick-like pain. Subjective pain ratings increased after SR, but only in response to the highest stimulus intensity (P = 0.018). SR increased the magnitude of the pain-elicited EEG response analyzed in the time-frequency domain (P = 0.021). Habituation across blocks did not differ between HS and SR. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was reduced after SR (P = 0.039). Pressure pain threshold of the trapezius muscle region also decreased after SR (P = 0.017). Conclusion: Sleep restriction (SR) increased the sensitivity to pressure pain and to electrically induced pain of moderate, but not low, intensity. The increased electrical pain could not be explained by a difference in habituation.

We investigate whether event-related potentials (ERPs), too, are predicted by information measures. Three types of language models estimated four different information measures on each word of a sample of English sentences. Six different ERP deflections were extracted from the EEG signal of participants reading the same sentences. A comparison between the information measures and ERPs revealed a reliable correlation between N400 amplitude and word surprisal. Language models that make no use of syntactic structure fitted the data better than did a phrase-structure grammar, which did not account for unique variance in N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that different information measures quantify cognitively different processes and that readers do not make use of a sentence's hierarchical structure for generating expectations about the upcoming word.

However, it is unknown whether the congruency ERP effects to facial expressions can be modulated by cognitive manipulations during stimulus expectation. To this end, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants viewed (neutral and fearful) facial expressions. Each trial started with a cue, predicting a facial expression, followed by an expectancy interval without any cues and subsequently the face. In half of the trials, participants had to solve a cognitive task in which different letters were presented for target letter detection during the expectancy interval. Furthermore, facial expressions were congruent with the cues in 75% of all trials. ERP results revealed that for fearful faces, the cognitive task during expectation altered the congruency effect in N170 amplitude; congruent compared to incongruent fearful faces evoked larger N170 in the non-task condition but the congruency effect was not evident in the task condition. Regardless of facial expression, the congruency effect was generally altered by the cognitive task during expectation in P3 amplitude; the amplitudes were larger for incongruent compared to congruent faces in the non-task condition but the congruency effect was not shown in the task condition. The findings indicate that cognitive tasks during expectation reduce the processing of expectation and subsequently, alter congruency ERP effects to facial expressions.

Perigenual anterior cingulate event-related potential precedes stop signal errors	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Default-mode network (DMN); Attentional lapse; Event-related potential (ERP); Error preceding positivity (EPP); Stop-signal task	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LOCALIZATION ACCURACY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IMPLANTED SOURCES; MOTOR AREA; TASK	Momentary lapses in attention disrupt goal-directed behavior. Attentional lapse has been associated with increased "default-mode" network (DMN) activity. In our previous fMRI study of a stop signal task (SST), greater activation of the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) - an important node of the DMN - predicts stop signal errors. In event-related potential (ERP) studies, the amplitude of an error-preceding positivity (EPP) also predicts response error. However, it is not clear whether the EPP originates from DMN regions. Here, we combined high-density array EEG and an SST to examine response-locked ERPs of error preceding trials in twenty young adult participants. The results showed an EPP in go trials that preceded stop error than stop success trials. Importantly, source modeling identified the origin of the EPP in the pgACC. By employing a bootstrapping procedure, we further confirmed that pgACC rather than the dorsal ACC as the source provides a better fit to the EPP. Together, these results suggest that attentional lapse in association with EPP in the pgACC anticipates failure in response inhibition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, HY; Schulz, C; Straube, T				Lin, Huiyan; Schulz, Claudia; Straube, Thomas			Fearful contextual expression impairs the encoding and recognition of target faces: an ERP study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						facial expression; ERP; emotional context; encoding; recognition; N170	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MEMORY; INFORMATION; IMPACT; SHAPE	Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that the N170 to faces is modulated by the emotion of the face and its context. However, it is unclear how the encoding of emotional target faces as reflected in the N170 is modulated by the preceding contextual facial expression when temporal onset and identity of target faces are unpredictable. In addition, no study as yet has investigated whether contextual facial expression modulates later recognition of target faces. To address these issues, participants in the present study were asked to identify target faces (fearful or neutral) that were presented after a sequence of fearful or neutral contextual faces. The number of sequential contextual faces was random and contextual and target faces were of different identities so that temporal onset and identity of target faces were unpredictable. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was recorded during the encoding phase. Subsequently, participants had to perform an unexpected old/new recognition task in which target face identities were presented in either the encoded or the nonencoded expression. ERP data showed a reduced N170 to target faces in fearful as compared to neutral context regardless of target facial expression. In the later recognition phase, recognition rates were reduced for target faces in the encoded expression when they had been encountered in fearful as compared to neutral context. The present findings suggest that fearful compared to neutral contextual faces reduce the allocation of attentional resources towards target faces, which results in limited encoding and recognition of target faces.

Methods: 17 normoacousic chronic, unilateral high-pitched tinnitus sufferers (6 females, 43.6 +/- 9.8 y.o, disease duration 22 +/- 35 months) underwent a 29-channel resting-state electroencephalography (EEG - 5 min opened-eyes, 5 min closed-eyes) and auditory oddball paradigm for event-related potentials analyses (ERPs - N1, P2 and P300). Cortical 3D distribution of current source density was computed with sLORETA. Results were compared with 17 controls (9 females, 45.7 +/- 15.1 y.o). Results: Eyes opened, tinnitus sufferers had lower alpha and beta sources in the left inferior parietal lobule. Eyes closed, tinnitus sufferers had decreased alpha sources in the left inferior temporal and post-central gyri, and low gamma sources in the left middle temporal gyrus. EEG data did not correlate with tinnitus sufferers' clinical features. Subjects with tinnitus had shorter N1 and P2 latencies. P300 did not differ between groups. sLORETA solutions showed decreased sources of these ERPs in the left inferior temporal gyrus in the tinnitus group. Conclusions: We showed cortico-thalamo-cortical involvements in normoacousic tinnitus with hyperexcitability of the left auditory cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. Significance: This might reflect processes of maladaptive cortical plasticity and memory consolidation. Further validation is needed to establish the value of this tool in customizing therapeutic approach. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, the mechanisms of keystroke preparation were studied with a typed picture-naming task performed by expert typists. Electroencephalographic activities recorded over sensorimotor areas prior to first-keystroke onset were examined with time-frequency and event-related potential (ERP) analyses. In the time-frequency domain, a beta event-related desynchronization was present bilaterally. In the ERP analyses, the activity was asymmetric, with negativity and positivity patterns developing over, respectively, contra- and ipsilateral recording sites. This pattern is similar to that observed in choice reaction time tasks, and thus can be interpreted as evidence of contralateral motor cortex activation accompanied by inhibition of the ipsilateral motor cortex. These data constitute the first electrophysiological demonstration of inhibitory activity in typing and pave the way to a thorough study of typing.

Familiarity may also contribute to associative recognition when stimuli are perceived as a 'unitized' representation. Given that familiarity is relatively preserved in older adults, we explored whether age-related associative memory deficits could be attenuated when associations were unitized (i.e., compounds) compared with those non-unitized (i.e., unrelated word pairs). Young and older adults performed an associative recognition task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Behavioral results showed that age differences were smaller for recognition of compounds than for unrelated word pairs. ERP results indicated that only compounds evoked an early frontal old/new effect in older adults. Moreover, the early frontal old/new effect was positively correlated with associative discrimination accuracy.

The neurophysiology of biological motion perception in schizophrenia	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Biological motion; electroencephalography; event-related potential; schizophrenia; visual perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION; COGNITION; SPECTRUM; FORM	Introduction: The ability to recognize human biological motion is a fundamental aspect of social cognition that is impaired in people with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the neural substrates of impaired biological motion perception in schizophrenia. In the current study, we assessed event-related potentials (ERPs) to human and nonhuman movement in schizophrenia. Methods: Twenty-four subjects with schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls completed a biological motion task while their electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded. Subjects watched clips of point-light animations containing 100%, 85%, or 70% biological motion, and were asked to decide whether the clip resembled human or nonhuman movement. Three ERPs were examined: P1, N1, and the late positive potential (LPP). Results: Behaviorally, schizophrenia subjects identified significantly fewer stimuli as human movement compared to healthy controls in the 100% and 85% conditions. At the neural level, P1 was reduced in the schizophrenia group but did not differ among conditions in either group. There were no group differences in N1 but both groups had the largest N1 in the 70% condition. There was a conditionxgroup interaction for the LPP: Healthy controls had a larger LPP to 100% versus 85% and 70% biological motion; there was no difference among conditions in schizophrenia subjects. Conclusions: Consistent with previous findings, schizophrenia subjects were impaired in their ability to recognize biological motion. The EEG results showed that biological motion did not influence the earliest stage of visual processing (P1). Although schizophrenia subjects showed the same pattern of N1 results relative to healthy controls, they were impaired at a later stage (LPP), reflecting a dysfunction in the identification of human form in biological versus nonbiological motion stimuli.

Its estimation can be performed using event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from electroencephalographic recordings (EEG). Several ERP spatial filtering methods have been designed to enhance relevant EEG activity for active brain-computer interfaces. However, to our knowledge, they have not yet been used and compared for mental state monitoring purposes. This paper presents a thorough comparison of three ERP spatial filtering methods: principal component analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the xDAWN algorithm. Those methods are compared in their performance to allow for an accurate classification of mental workload when applied in an otherwise similar processing chain. The data of 20 healthy participants that performed a memory task for 10 minutes each was used for classification. Two levels of mental workload were considered depending on the number of digits participants had to memorize (2/6). The highest performances were obtained using the CCA filtering and the xDAWN algorithm respectively with 98% and 97% of correct classification. Their performances were significantly higher than that obtained using the PCA filtering (88%).

An EEG you do not see?	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Ear EEG; miniaturized; P300 speller; ton-electrodes		Electroencephalography (EEG) allows the study of the brain-behavior relationship in humans. Most of what we have learned with EEG was through observing the brain-behavior relationship under well-controlled laboratory conditions. However, by reducing "normal" behavior to a minimum the ecological validity of the results can be limited. Recent developments toward mobile EEG solutions allow to study the brain-behavior relationship outside the laboratory in more natural situations. Besides mobility and robustness with respect to motion, mobile EEG systems should also interfere as little as possible with the participant's behavior. For example, natural interaction with other people could be hindered when it is obvious that a participant wears an EEG cap. This study evaluates the signal quality obtained with an unobtrusive solution for EEG monitoring through the integration of miniaturized EEG ton-electrodes into both a discreet baseball cap and an individualized ear piece. We show that such mini electrodes located at scalp and ear locations can reliably record event related potentials in a P300 brain-computer-interface application.

The present study examined the temporal dynamics of the effects of light exposure on cortical activity related to cognitive processes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured while participants performed an auditory oddball task during exposure to short-, medium- or long-wavelength light or darkness. Experiments were conducted in the daytime. After a 10-min period of darkness, one of the three lights was presented for 28 min. In the control condition, darkness was maintained for the entire session. The ERP component observed approximately 300 ms after the onset of the target stimulus (P300) was analyzed. The amplitude of P300 was larger after 5-20 min of exposure to short-wavelength light than at equivalent time points in the darkness. No differences were observed in the amplitude of P300 between the medium- or long-wavelength light condition and darkness at any time point. These results suggest that the amount of attentional resource allocated to the oddball task was increased by daytime exposure to short-wavelength light, and that following approximately 5 min of exposure the impact of light on cortical activity related to cognitive processes was able to be detected.

The Fixation Distance to the Stimulus Influences ERP Quality: An EEG and Eye Tracking N400 Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AVERAGE REFERENCE; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; INFANT; FOVEAL	In a typical visual Event Related Potential (ERP) study, the stimulus is presented centrally on the screen. Normally an ERP response will be measured provided that the participant directs their gaze towards the stimulus. The aim of this study was to assess how the N400 component of an ERP was affected when the stimulus was presented in the foveal, parafoveal or peripheral vision of the participant's visual field. Utilizing stimuli that have previously produced an N400 response to action incongruities, the same stimuli sequences were presented at 0 degrees, 4 degrees, 8 degrees and 12 degrees of visual angle from a fixation location. In addition to the EEG data, eye tracking data were recorded to act as a fixation control method and to allow for eye artifact detection. The results show a significant N400 effect in the right parietotemporal electrodes within the 0 degrees visual angle condition. For the other conditions, the N400 effect was reduced (4 degrees) or not present (8 degrees and 12 degrees). Our results suggest that the disappearance of the N400 effect with eccentricity is due to the fixation distance to the stimulus. However, variables like attentional allocation could have also had an impact on the results. This study highlights the importance of presenting a stimulus within the foveal vision of the participant in order to maximize ERP effects related to higher order cognitive processes.

In the present study, twenty human participants completed a delayed match-to-sample task in two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) sessions. Targets and non-target items were presented at different within-trial positions. We used fMRI-constrained source analysis to investigate the spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics of probe processing. Probe type-related differences were modulated by position in the trial or by the ratio of target stimuli to nontarget stimuli at different trial positions. fMRI-constrained source analysis revealed a temporal pattern of source activities starting in occipital and temporal brain regions, followed by a simultaneous engagement of parietal and frontal brain regions and a later activity of a source in pre-SMA (supplementary motor area). Source activities demonstrated a specific involvement of left fusiform gyrus in the non-target condition compared to the target condition that might be associated with mental imagination of the target stimulus during non-target probe processing. Source activities, furthermore, showed the anterior cingulate to be particularly involved in target processing compared to non-target processing before response execution and the pre-SMA before and during response execution. These brain areas appear to be activated in different stages of conflict managing operations due to a lower stimulus frequency of target trials compared to non-target trials at different target positions in the present design.

To test this assumption, we measured somatosensory event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a tactile delayed match-to-sample task. Participants memorized a tactile sample set at one task-relevant hand to compare it with a subsequent test set on the same hand. During the retention period, a sustained negativity (tactile contralateral delay activity, tCDA) was elicited over primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the relevant hand. The amplitude of this component increased with memory load and was sensitive to individual limitations in memory capacity, suggesting that the tCDA reflects the maintenance of tactile information in somatosensory working memory. The tCDA was preceded by a transient negativity (N2cc component) with a similar contralateral scalp distribution, which is likely to reflect selection of task-relevant tactile stimuli at the encoding stage. The temporal sequence of N2cc and tCDA components mirrors previous observations from ERP studies of working memory in vision.

The Application of Electroencephalography to Investigate the Neural Bases of Parenting: A Review	PARENTING-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Review							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INFANT EMOTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; MOTHERS; FACE; ATTACHMENT; RESPONSES; OWN; PREGNANCY	SYNOPSIS Parents play a significant role in their child's development. Recent neuroimaging research has begun to evaluate the neural circuitry of human parenting to better understand parental responsiveness to infant affective cues. Here, the authors introduce the value of using electroencephalography and event-related potentials as a methodology to probe the neural correlates of parenting. Given the precise temporal resolution of this technique, it affords the opportunity to explore, with millisecond accuracy, the temporal dynamics of stimulus processing. The emerging research was reviewed that has utilized electroencephalography/event-related potentials to explore typical normative processes and mechanisms in parental responsiveness, and consider how these processes might be compromised by psychopathology. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed as the unique contribution this approach can make to the field of parenting research is highlighted.	[Rutherford, Helena J.

We particularly focus on removing ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact from EEG. BCG mainly appears in EEG signals during simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Different from most existing artifact removal techniques, we propose a method based on dictionary learning framework. Due to strength of sparsifying dictionaries in applications such as image denoising, it is expected to succeed in BCG removal task as well. This is investigated in the proposed approach where a dictionary is learned from original EEG recording. The dictionary is designed to locally model BCG characteristics. After achieving the dictionary, BCG can be simply subtracted from the original signal and the clean EEG is obtained. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal the flexibility of learned dictionary for modeling the fluctuations in artifact, and removing it from original EEG signals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Technological approaches can enhance these diagnostic methodologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art review of various technological approaches for spotting psychopathy, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and other measures. Results of EEG event-related potential (ERP) experiments support the theory that impaired amygdala function may be responsible for abnormal fear processing in psychopathy, which can ultimately manifest as psychopathic traits, as outlined by the PCL-R or PPI-R. Imaging studies, in general, point to reduced fear processing capabilities in psychopathic individuals. While the human element, introduced through researcher/participant interactions, can be argued as unequivocally necessary for diagnosis, these purely objective technological approaches have proven to be useful in conjunction with the subjective interviewing and questionnaire methods for differentiating psychopaths from non-psychopaths. Furthermore, these technologies are more robust than behavioral measures, which have been shown to fail.

The electrical brain responses due to motory, sensory, or cognitive stimuli, i.e. event related potentials (ERPs), particularly P300, have been used for cognitive information processing. P300 has two subcomponents, P3a and P3b which are correlated and therefore, the traditional blind source separation approaches cannot solve the problem. In this work, a complex-valued tensor factorisation of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is introduced with the aim of separating P300 subcomponents. The proposed method uses complex-valued statistics to exploit the data correlation. In this way, the variations of P3a and p3b can be tracked for the assessment of the brain state. The results of this work will be compared with those of spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) method.

Changes in attention to an emotional task after sleep deprivation: Neurophysiological and behavioral findings	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Emotion; ERP; IAPS; LPP; Sleep deprivation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERP ANALYSIS; PICTURES; AROUSAL; BRAIN; RATS; FRAGMENTATION; REPETITION; INCREASES; VALENCE	While sleep loss is shown to have widespread effects on cognitive processes, little is known about the impact of sleep loss on emotion processes. In order to expand on previous behavioral and physiological findings on how sleep loss influences emotion processing, we administered positive, negative, and neutral affective visual stimuli to individuals after one night of sleep deprivation while simultaneously acquiring EEG event related potential (ERP) data and recording affective behavioral responses. We compared these responses to a baseline testing session. We specifically looked at the late positive potential (LPP) component of the visual ERP as an established sensitive measure of attention to emotionally-charged visual stimuli. Our results show that after sleep deprivation, the LPP no longer discriminates between emotional and non-emotional pictures; after sleep deprivation the LPP amplitude was of similar amplitude for neutral, positive, and negative pictures. This effect was driven by an increase in the LPP to neutral pictures. Our behavioral measures show that, relative to baseline testing, emotional pictures are rated as less emotional following sleep deprivation with a concomitant reduction in emotional picture-induced anxiety. We did not observe any change in cortisol concentrations after sleep deprivation before or after emotional picture exposure, suggesting that the observed changes in emotion processing are independent of potential stress effects of sleep deprivation. Combined, our findings suggest that sleep loss interferes with proper allocation of attention resources during an emotional task. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This aids the development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI), facilitating communication between the human brain and computer, by converting the brain waves (EEG waves -Electroencephalography) into control signals. These control signals can then be used to trigger an external device, thereby enabling a seamless communication with the intelligent system. It unfolds various avenues for research and further applications in the realm of prosthetic device control, development of thought controlled intelligent systems and other complex interfaces. This will also be an aid to persons with disabilities or various other amputations. In this work, a novel feature extraction algorithm is proposed for extracting event related potentials from the EEG signals using wavelet sub band entropy which can be used in BCI applications. An attention index is defined which gives a measure of the amount of concentration or attention the subject has, upon focussing on a particular event or thought. (C) 2015 The Authors.

To test some of these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study in which we investigated how the late positive ERP response to deviant stimuli is modulated by (a) clonidine, an alpha(2) agonist that attenuates baseline noradrenergic activity; and (b) scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist of acetylcholine receptors. We collected EEG data from 18 healthy volunteers during the performance of an auditory oddball task with several active and passive task conditions. We then used temporospatial principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the ERP waveforms. The PCA revealed two distinct late positive ERP components: the classic parietal P300 and the frontal novelty P3. Statistical analysis of the temporospatial factor scores indicated that in most conditions the amplitude of the classic P300 was increased by clonidine and scopolamine. In contrast, the amplitude of the novelty P3 was decreased by both drugs. The similar pattern of results for clonidine and scopolamine probably reflects the strong interactions between the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. The results, in combination with previous pharmacological studies, suggest a critical role for both neuromodulator systems in the generation of the P300 and the novelty P3.	[Brown, Stephen B. R.

Though these effects have often been replicated, they remain poorly understood. We investigate the psychophysiology of the effect using remotely transmitted, precisely timed, tactile messages in an economic decision-making game called Ultimatum. Participants were more likely to accept offers after receiving a remotely transmitted touch. Furthermore, we found distinct effects of touch on event-related potentials evoked by (a) feedback regarding accepted and rejected offers, (b) decision cues related to proposals, and (c) the haptic and auditory cues themselves. In each case, a late positive effect of touch was observed and related to the P3. Given the role of the P3 in memory-related functions, the results indicate an indirect relationship between touch and generosity that relies on memory.

However, a reliable detection of single trial potentials is challenging, because they are strongly affected by noise. Furthermore, potentials with their subcomponents are often distributed over several channels. With high density sensor arrays, a hypothesis-driven selection of channels, as often performed in BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG), is challenging. We present a new data-driven approach that constructs spatio-temporal filters, considerably reducing the number of channels, reducing noise, and simultaneously determining the underlying brain dynamics. The extracted signals can be easily used to recognize the event sequence on which users focus their attention, without applying multivariate classification. We evaluated the approach using high density magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, recorded during a BCI experiment based on P300 responses. Compared to the subject's performance achieved with the initial decoding approach, the recognition rate increased significantly from 74.1% (std: 14.8%) to 95.1% (std: 4.9%) correct detections, which implies an information transfer rate improvement from 6.9 bit/min to 13.1 bit/min on average over 17 subjects.

In the current study we examine multi-session training in a P3 speller application which uses P300 evoked response potentials to identify the letter of a word a participant is attempting to spell. Because neurofeedback training is most effective over time, there is an advantage to using low-cost hardware that can be used in the home rather than expensive research-grade equipment. This study is performed on an Emotiv Epoc EEG headset and some of the problems and workarounds inherent in this are discussed. This headset is sensitive enough to detect evoked response potentials and evidence of a training effect is found. Motivational aspects of ERP training are discussed and an alternate P300 training paradigm is presented.

In the present study, we used a basic and rigorous paradigm contrasting pairs of words orthogonally. This paradigm enables the probing of semantic processing by comparing neural activity elicited by similar words delivered in various combinations. We describe the respective timing, topography and estimated cortical sources of two successive event-related potentials (ERP) components (N400 and late positive component (LPC)) using high-density EEG in conscious controls (N=20) and in minimally conscious (MCS; N=15) and vegetative states (VS; N=15) patients recorded at bedside. Whereas N400-like ERP components could be observed in the VS, MCS and conscious groups, only MCS and conscious groups showed a LPC response, suggesting that this late effect could be a potential specific marker of conscious semantic processing. This result is coherent with recent findings disentangling early and local nonconscious responses (e.g.: MMN in odd-ball paradigms, N400 in semantic violation paradigms) from late, distributed and conscious responses (e.g.: P3b to auditory rule violation) in controls and in patients with disorders of consciousness. However, N400 and LPC responses were not easily observed at the individual level, - even in conscious controls -, with standard ERP analyses, which is a limiting factor for its clinical use. Of potential interest, the only 3 patients presenting both significant N400 and LPC effects were MCS, and 2 of them regained consciousness and functional language abilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As the importance of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the detection of traces of consciousness increases, we investigated the retest reliability of ERPs with repeated tests at four different time points. Twelve healthy controls and 12 inpatients (8 UWS, 4 MCS; 6 traumatic, 6 non-traumatic) were tested twice a day (morning, afternoon) for 2 days with an auditory oddball task. ERPs were recorded with a 256-channel-EEG system, and correlated with behavioural test scores in the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R). The number of identifiable P300 responses varied between zero and four in both groups. Reliabilities varied between Krippendorff's alpha = 0.43 for within-day comparison, and alpha = 0.25 for between-day comparison in the patient group. Retest reliability was strong for the CRS-R scores for all comparisons (alpha = 0.83-0.95). The stability of auditory information processing in patients with disorders of consciousness is the basis for other, even more demanding tasks and cognitive potentials. The relatively low ERP-retest reliability suggests that it is necessary to perform repeated tests, especially when probing for consciousness with ERPs. A single negative ERP test result may be mistaken for proof that a UWS patient truly is unresponsive.

Automatic emotions are direct reactions to stimuli whereas reflective emotions are always based on verbalized (and often abstract) criteria of evaluation. We conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) study in which 25 women were required to read and respond to emotional words which engaged either the automatic or reflective system. Stimulus words were emotional (positive or negative) and neutral. We found an effect of valence on an early response with dipolar fronto-occipital topography; positive words evoked a higher amplitude response than negative words. We also found that topographically specific differences in the amplitude of the late positive complex were related to the system involved in processing. Emotional stimuli engaging the automatic system were associated with significantly higher amplitudes in the left-parietal region; the response to neutral words was similar regardless of the system engaged. A different pattern of effects was observed in the central region, neutral stimuli engaging the reflective system evoked a higher amplitudes response whereas there was no system effect for emotional stimuli. These differences could not be reduced to effects of differences between the arousing properties and concreteness of the words used as stimuli.

Previous researchers have found that altruistic tendencies, as an individual difference, can affect resource division. Here, using the event-related potential (ERP) technique and a third-party punishment of dictator game paradigm, we explored third-party punishments in high and low altruists and recorded their EEG data. Behavioral results showed high altruists (vs. low altruists) were more likely to punish the dictators in unfair offers. ERP results revealed that patterns of medial frontal negativity (MFN) were modulated by unfairness. For high altruists, high unfair offers (90:10) elicited a larger MFN than medium unfair offers (70:30) and fair offers (50:50). By contrast, for low altruists, fair offers elicited larger MFN while high unfair offers caused the minimal MFN. It is suggested that the altruistic tendency effect influences fairness consideration in the early stage of evaluation. Moreover, the results provide further neuroscience evidence for inequity aversion.

A Comparative Study of Visual Event Related Potential (P300 Wave Amplitude and Latency) With Novel and Repeat Stimulus in Young Healthy Adult Males	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Event Related Potential; P 300 wave; Cognition; Odd ball Paradigm		Event Related Potential (ERP) is a time locked measure of electrical activity of the cerebral surface representing a distinct phase of cortical processing. The P300 wave is a centro parietal positivity that occurs when a subject detects an informative task relevant stimulus. The latency and amplitude of P300 can be used as an index for the assessment of neural processing time and the neural cognitive activity. 32 Right handed healthy males (18-23years) with normal visual acuity were randomly selected for the study. Visual ERP recording was done using odd ball paradigm on Brain Electro Scan System, version 4.0. Each stimulus was presented for 2 seconds followed by next stimulus with 2 seconds inter stimulus interval. They were asked to count the novel stimuli whenever it appears on the screen. EEG electrodes were positioned on scalp as per the International 10-20 system. Centro Parietal sensors Cz & Pz electrodes were used as active recording electrodes. Mean P300 wave amplitude and latency was calculated. P300 wave amplitude and latency is found to be significantly higher (P <= 0.001) with novel stimulus as compared to repeat stimulus in the study. Hence it is concluded that novelty influences the P300 wave amplitude and latency.											23	0	0	0	0	RJPBCS RESEARCH JOURNAL PHARMACEUTICAL, BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL SCIENCES	PRODDATUR	RJPBCS RESEARCH JOURNAL PHARMACEUTICAL, BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL SCIENCES, PRODDATUR, 00000, INDIA	0975-8585			RES J PHARM BIOL CHE	Res.

In particular, the question whether language lateralisation depends on semantic processing or is already evident in early perceptual stimulus processing has not been answered unequivocally. In the present study, we therefore recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during tachistoscopic presentation of horizontally or vertically presented verbal stimuli in the left (LVF) and the right visual field (RVF). Participants were asked to indicate, whether the presented stimulus was a word or a non-word. On the behavioural level, participants showed stronger hemispheric asymmetries for horizontal, than for vertical stimulus presentation. In addition, ERP asymmetries were also modulated by stimulus presentation format, as the electrode by visual field interactions for P1 and N1 were stronger after vertical, than after horizontal stimulus presentation. Moreover, sLORETA revealed that ERP left-right asymmetries were mainly driven by the extrastriate cortex and reading-associated areas in the parietal cortex. Taken together, the present study shows electrophysiological support for the assumption that language lateralisation during speech perception arises from a left dominance for the processing of early perceptual stimulus aspects.

The benefits of chronic exercise on cognitive performance are well documented in non-VE neurophysiological and behavioural studies. Based on event-related potentials (ERP) such as the N200 and P300, cognitive processing may be interpreted on a neuronal level. However, exercise-related neuroelectric adaptation in VE remains widely unclear and thus characterizes the primary aim of the present study. Twenty-two healthy participants performed active (moderate cycling exercise) and passive (no exercise) sessions in three VEs (control, front, surround), each generating a different sense of presence. Within sessions, conditions were randomly assigned, each lasting 5 min and including a choice reaction-time task to assess cognitive performance. According to the international 10:20 system, EEG with real-time triggered stimulus onset was recorded, and peaks of N200 and P300 components (amplitude, latency) were exported for analysis. Heart rate was recorded, and sense of presence assessed prior to and following each session and condition. Results revealed an increase in ERP amplitudes (N200: p < 0.001; P300: p < 0.001) and latencies (N200: p < 0.001) that were most pronounced over fronto-central and occipital electrode sites relative to an increased sense of presence (p < 0.001); however, ERP were not modulated by exercise (each p > 0.05). Hypothesized to mirror cognitive processing, decreases of cognitive performance's accuracy and reaction time failed significance. With respect to previous research, the present neuroelectric adaptation gives reason to believe in compensative neuronal resources that balance demanding cognitive processing in VE to avoid behavioural inefficiency.

We analyze the effect of pseudoword repetition through the recording of EEG during a lexical decision task. Results showed a functional dissociation between two well-known ERP components: FN400 (Frontal N400, traditionally related to semantic processes) and LPC (Late Positive Complex, related to memory processes). On the one hand, FN400 was unaffected by pseudoword repetition and showed the typical lexicality effect. On the other hand, topographic and neural source analyses showed that LPC amplitude increased across repetitions, causing the lexicality effect to disappear, with the left inferior frontal, left superior temporal and right superior frontal gyri identified as the most likely neural sources. The lack of repetition effect on FN400 suggests that this component is unrelated to familiarity processes and is only influenced by semantic differences between stimuli. The LPC observations, however, reflect the construction and strengthening of visual memory traces for repeated pseudowords, facilitating their processing over the course of the task.

This categorization is very fast and occurs in few millisecond time scales. Due to the excellent temporal resolution, on the order of millisecond, of the Electroencephalogram (EEG), categorization of images containing visual objects can be effectively recognized using Event Related Potentials (ERPs) derived from EEG signals recorded when images are presented in screen in front of the subjects. The aiming of this paper is to show preliminary results about how the processing of objects in the human brain unfolds in time using dense EEG. In this paper, we show a time-resolved view of the human brain for objects and animals. We showed a difference between the spatiotemporal behaviors of ERP signals recorded in two conditions: objects and animals. Using The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, results showed a high performance of the dense EEGs to differentiate between objects and animals.

Our method assumes that only a small number of brain sources are active throughout a measurement, where each of the sources exhibits focal (smooth but localized) characteristics in space, time and frequency. This structure is enforced through an expansion of the source current density into appropriate spatio-temporal basis functions in combination with sparsity constraints. This approach combines the main strengths of two existing methods, namely Sparse Basis Field Expansions (Haufe et al., 2011) and Time-Frequency Mixed-Norm Estimates (Gramfort et al., 2013). By adjusting the ratio between two regularization terms, STOUT is capable of trading temporal for spatial reconstruction accuracy and vice versa, depending on the requirements of specific analyses and the provided data. Due to allowing for non-stationary source activations, STOUT is particularly suited for the localization of event-related potentials (ERP) and other evoked brain activity. We demonstrate its performance on simulated ERP data for varying signal-to-noise ratios and numbers of active sources. Our analysis of the generators of visual and auditory evoked N200 potentials reveals that the most active sources originate in the temporal and occipital lobes, in line with the literature on sensory processing.

FROM COGNITIVE MOTOR PREPARATION TO VISUAL PROCESSING: THE BENEFITS OF CHILDHOOD FITNESS TO BRAIN HEALTH	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; cognition; fitness; adolescence; motor preparation	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AEROBIC FITNESS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; TASK-PERFORMANCE; AGE; CHILDREN; EXERCISE; INDEXES; ACTIVATION	The association between a fit body and a fit brain in children has led to a rise of behavioral and neuroscientific research. Yet, the relation of cardiorespiratory fitness on premotor neurocognitive preparation with early visual processing has received little attention. Here, 41 healthy, lower and higher fit preadolescent children were administered a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task while electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to the stimulus onset with an earlier than usual baseline (-900/-800 ms) allowed investigation of both the usual post-stimulus (i.e., the P1, N1 and P2) as well as the pre-stimulus ERP components, such as the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and the prefrontal negativity (pN component). At the behavioral level, aerobic fitness was associated response accuracy, with higher fit children being more accurate than lower fit children. Fitness-related differences selectively emerged at prefrontal brain regions during response preparation, with larger pN amplitude for higher than lower fit children, and at early perceptual stages after stimulus onset, with larger P1 and N1 amplitudes in higher relative to lower fit children. Collectively, the results suggest that the benefits of being aerobically fit appear at the stage of cognitive preparation prior to stimulus presentation and the behavioral response during the performance of a task that challenges cognitive control. Further, it is likely that enhanced activity in prefrontal brain areas may improve cognitive control of visuo-motor tasks, allowing for stronger proactive inhibition and larger early allocation of selective attention resources on relevant external stimuli.

To explain this finding, the task-set inertia hypothesis asserts that an antisaccade requires a cognitively mediated non-standard task-set that persists inertially and delays the planning of a subsequent prosaccade. The present study sought to directly test the theoretical tenets of the task-set inertia hypothesis by examining the concurrent behavioural and the event-related brain potential (ERP) data associated with the unidirectional prosaccade switch-cost. Participants pseudo-randomly alternated between pro- and antisaccades while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. As expected, the completion of an antisaccade selectively increased the RT of a subsequent prosaccade, whereas the converse switch did not influence RTs. Thus, the behavioural results demonstrated the unidirectional prosaccade switch-cost. In terms of the ERP findings, we observed a reliable change in the amplitude of the P3 - time-locked to task-instructions when trials were switched from a prosaccade to an antisaccade; however, no reliable change was observed when switching from an antisaccade to a prosaccade. This is a salient finding because extensive work has shown that the P3 provides a neural index of the task-set required to execute a to-be-completed response. As such, results showing that prosaccades completed after antisaccades exhibited increased RTs in combination with a P3 amplitude comparable to antisaccades provides convergent evidence that the unidirectional prosaccade switch-cost is attributed to the persistent activation of a non-standard antisaccade task-set.

Recent neuropsychological and neuroscience studies have suggested that problematic Internet use is notably associated with increased cue-reactivity and reduced inhibitory control. This review of the electroencephalography (EEG) literature shows that most studies have found that impaired self-control abilities (i.e., inhibition and error monitoring) are associated with underactivated frontal regions in problematic Internet users (PIUs). However, some EEG studies in the domain have also demonstrated alterations in the processing of Internet-related cues and emotional stimuli. As a whole, these data therefore suggest that both reflective (top-down) and automatic/affective (bottom-up) systems, postulated by dual-process models as being determinants in decision making, are impaired among PIUs. On this basis, new research avenues are proposed to better understand the development and maintenance of problematic Internet use, according to six main directions respectively related to (1) the identification of vulnerability biomarkers, (2) the investigation of possible lower level cognitive impairments, (3) the exploration of core reflective and automatic/affective symptoms, (4) the evaluation of Internet use heterogeneity and comorbidities, (5) the development of new neuroscience strategies and (6) the elaboration of behavioral and cognitive interventions.

Turn-taking: From perception to speech preparation	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related potential; Readiness potential; Spoken language; Articulation preparation; Turn-taking; Human	ARTIFACTS	We investigated the preparation of a spoken answer response to interrogative sentences by measuring response time (RT) and the response-related readiness potential (RP). By comparing the RT and RP results we aimed to identify whether the RP-onset is more related to the actual speech preparation process or the pure intention to speak after turn-anticipation. Additionally, we investigated if the RP-onset can be influenced by the syntactic structure (one or two completion points). Therefore, the EEG data were sorted based on two variables: the cognitive load required for the response and the syntactic structure of the stimulus questions. The results of the response utterance preparation associated event-related potential (ERP) and the RT suggest that the RP-onset is more related to the actual speech preparation process rather than the pure intention to speak after turn-anticipation. However, the RP-onset can be influenced by the syntactic structure of the question leading to an early response preparation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that significant variations in both of the time-frequency measurements underlie the specific changes in the ERP directly related to MI. For the MI task, we chose a simple everyday task (throwing a tennis ball), that does not require any particular motor expertise, set within the controlled virtual reality scenario of a tennis court. When compared to the rest condition a consistent, long-lasting negative fronto-central ERP wave was accompanied by significant changes in both time frequency measurements suggesting long-lasting cortical activity reorganization. The ERP wave was characterized by two peaks at about 300 ms (N300) and 1000 ms (N1000). The N300 component was centrally localized on the scalp and was accompanied by significant phase consistency in the delta brain rhythms in the contralateral central scalp areas. The N1000 component spread wider centrally and was accompanied by a significant power decrease (or event related desynchronization) in low beta brain rhythms localized in fronto-precentral and parieto-occipital scalp areas and also by a significant power increase (or event related synchronization) in theta brain rhythms spreading fronto-centrally. During the transition from N300 to N1000, a contralateral alpha (mu) as well as post-central and parieto-theta rhythms occurred. The visual representation of movement formed in the minds of participants might underlie a top-down process from the fronto-central areas which is reflected by the amplitude changes observed in the fronto-central ERPs and by the significant phase synchrony in contralateral fronto-central delta and contralateral central mu to parietal theta presented here.

The neural speed of familiar face recognition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERP, explicit famous face recognition; Familiarity; MVPA; N170; N250	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAMOUS FACES; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; PERSONALLY FAMILIAR; HUMAN BRAIN; ERP EVIDENCE; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSES; REPRESENTATIONS	Rapidly recognizing familiar people from their faces appears critical for social interactions (e.g., to differentiate friend from foe). However, the actual speed at which the human brain can distinguish familiar from unknown faces still remains debated. In particular, it is not clear whether familiarity can be extracted from rapid face individualization or if it requires additional time consuming processing. We recorded scalp EEG activity in 28 subjects performing a go/no-go, famous/non-famous, unrepeated, face recognition task. Speed constraints were used to encourage subjects to use the earliest familiarity information available. Event related potential (ERP) analyses show that both the N170 and the N250 components were modulated by familiarity. The N170 modulation was related to behaviour: subjects presenting the strongest N170 modulation were also faster but less accurate than those who only showed weak N170 modulation. A complementary Multi-Variate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) confirmed ERP results and provided some more insights into the dynamics of face recognition as the N170 differential effect appeared to be related to a first transitory phase (transitory bump of decoding power) starting at around 140 ms, which returned to baseline afterwards. This bump of activity was henceforth followed by an increase of decoding power starting around 200 ms after stimulus onset. Overall, our results suggest that rather than a simple single-process, familiarity for faces may rely on a cascade of neural processes, including a coarse and fast stage starting at 140 ms and a more refined but slower stage occurring after 200 ms.

J	Kimura, M; Takeda, Y				Kimura, Motohiro; Takeda, Yuji			Automatic prediction regarding the next state of a visual object: Electrophysiological indicators of prediction match and mismatch	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Automatic visual prediction; Sequential rule; Match; Mismatch; Event-related brain potential (ERP)	CONTEXT-BASED PREDICTION; REPRESENTATIONAL MOMENTUM; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DEVIANCE DETECTION; NEGATIVITY; MEMORY; SEQUENCE; EEG; PSYCHOPHYSICS; INVOLVEMENT	Behavioral phenomena such as representational momentum suggest that the brain can automatically predict the next state of a visual object, based on sequential rules embedded in its preceding spatiotemporal context. To identify electrophysiological indicators of automatic visual prediction in terms of prediction match and mismatch, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants passively viewed three types of task-irrelevant sequences of a bar stimulus: (1) an oddball sequence, which contained a sequential rule defined by stimulus repetition, providing repetition-rule-conforming (standard) and -violating (deviant) stimuli; (2) a rotating-oddball sequence, which contained a sequential rule defined by stimulus change (i.e., rotation), providing change-rule-conforming (regular) and -violating (irregular) stimuli; and (3) a random sequence, which did not contain a sequential rule, providing a neutral (control) stimulus. This protocol allowed us to expect that (1) an ERP effect that reflects a prediction-mismatch process should be exclusively observed in both the deviant-minus-control and irregular-minus-control comparisons and (2) an ERP effect that reflects a prediction-match process should be exclusively observed in both the standard-minus-control and regular-minus-control comparisons. The results showed that the ERP effect that met the criterion for prediction mismatch was an occipito-temporal negative deflection at around 170-300 ms (visual mismatch negativity), while the ERP effect that met the criterion for prediction match was a frontal/central negative deflection at around 150-270 ms (probably, the reduction of P2). These two contrasting ERP effects support a hypothetical view that automatic visual prediction would involve both an increase in the neural response to predictionin-congruent (i.e., novel) events and a decrease in the neural response to prediction-congruent (i.e., redundant) events.

J	Jennings, BJ; Martinovic, J				Jennings, Ben J.; Martinovic, Jasna			Chromatic contrast in luminance-defined images affects performance and neural activity during a shape classification task	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						object representation; shape perception; luminance; chromatic mechanisms; contrast; electroencephalography	WAVELENGTH-SENSITIVE CONES; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; RED-GREEN GRATINGS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; TRANSIENT VEP; COLOR; ORIENTATION; CHANNELS; LEVEL	Models of object recognition generally emphasize the importance of luminance-defined shape. However, it is still not fully understood how color signals combine with luminance signals to affect object-related form processing. This electroencephalographic study aimed to examine the contribution of chromatic contrast by assessing its effects on the time course of shape-related processing. Participants classified Gaborized images of object shapes, nonobject shapes, and patches of pseudorandomly scattered Gabors. Stimuli excited (a) the luminance (L+M) channel alone, (b) luminance and L-M channels, or (c) luminance, L-M, and S-(L+M) channels and were presented either at mean discrimination threshold or at twice this mean threshold. As expected, classification accuracy was comparable at threshold, as were the attributes of the early, perceptual first negative (N1) component of the event-related potential (ERP). Differences emerged at suprathreshold: Objects defined by the full combination of channels were associated with the poorest performance and the lowest N1 amplitude. Shape sensitivity was not consistently observed in the N1 but was more evident in the late positive potential (LPP), a cognitive ERP component. Both the N1 and the LPP were affected by the amount and type of contrast in the image. While the effects of luminance and L-M contrast were similar, affecting the ERP selectively during the N1 and LPP period, S-(L+M) contrast elicited a sustained shift in amplitude. Our results demonstrate, for the first time using a combination of behavioral as well as early and late electrophysiological effects, that shape classification is determined by both the chromatic and the luminance content of the image.

This forward-model is updated based on on-line performance monitoring. A previous study has shown that performance monitoring is altered in patients with focal vascular cerebellar lesions, but altered neural responses are not paralleled by impaired behaviour, and the critical cerebellar sites have yet to be identified. The present study investigated if saccadic performance monitoring is more severely altered in patients with cerebellar degenerative disease relative to the previously examined patients with focal vascular cerebellar lesions, and which cerebellar regions support performance monitoring. 16 patients and 16 healthy controls performed an antisaccade task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Error rates were increased, and the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential (ERP) component associated with error processing/performance monitoring, was reduced while the error positivity (Pe), a later ERP component related to more conscious aspects of error processing, was preserved in patients. Thus, performance monitoring is altered in patients with cerebellar degeneration, confirming a critical role of the cerebellum for fast classification of saccadic accuracy. In contrast to patients with focal lesions, post-acute functional reorganization and compensation presumably is hampered by disease progression, resulting in altered neural processing and impaired behavioural performance. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) indicated the strongest effects for behavioural performance, with correlations between gray matter volume reduction in bilateral posterolateral regions (left Crus II and right lobule VI) and increased error rates. Moreover, somewhat smaller correlations were found for volume loss in left lobule VIIb/VIIIa and right lobule V and ERN amplitude, and in right Crus I and Pe amplitude. The present findings are consistent with involvement of posterolateral cerebellar regions in motor and cognitive functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our goal was to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the familiarity effect at all time points at the single-subject level. Ten subjects were shown faces of anonymous people or celebrities. Individual results were analysed using a point-by-point bootstrap analysis. While familiarity effects were less consistent at later epochs, all subjects showed them between 130 and 195ms in occipitotemporal electrodes. However, the relation between the time course of familiarity effects and the peak latency of the N170 was variable. We concluded that familiarity effects between 130 and 195ms are robust and can be shown in single subjects. The variability of their relation to the timing of the N170 potential may lead to underestimation of familiarity effects in studies that use group-based statistics.

Our approach is based on the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of polygon primitives and brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The presentation of polygons that contribute to building a target image (because they match the shape and/or color of the target) trigger attention-related EEG patterns. Accordingly, these target primitives can be determined using BCI classification of event-related potentials (ERPs). They are then accumulated in the display until a satisfactory reconstruction is reached. Selection steps have an average classification accuracy of 75%. Twenty-five percent of the images could be reconstructed completely, while more than 65% of the available visual details could be captured on average. Most of the misclassifications were not misinterpretations of the BCI concerning users' intent; rather, users tried to select polygons that were different than what was intended by the experimenters. Open problems and alternatives to develop a practical BCI-based image reconstruction application are discussed.

A BCI provides an arena for a human brain to communicate with a computer directly without the normal neurophysiologic pathways. The electrical signals of the brain, with their fast responsivity with cognitive processes are most suitable as non-motor control mediation between the human and a computer. This can serve as a communication and control channel for various applications. One of the most intriguing uses of EEG is in forensic investigation, used as a tool in lie detection. Lie detection technology has been applied increasingly to investigate and solve criminal cases. Though the contributions of neurobiological research to forensic technology remain largely hypothetical, the evidences appear promising and further research is both feasible and warranted. The brain based lie detection may veritably give solution to many complicated investigation. This paper explores the evolvement of lie detection technology, their working principles, the latest development, and the prospect of their application in forensic science.

Cortical dysfunctions have been demonstrated to be key components of MS condition, and plasticity of the corticospinal motor system is highly involved in major MS symptoms, such as fatigue, spasticity, or pain. Cortical dysfunction in MS can be studied with neurophysiological tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related techniques (evoked potentials) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These techniques are now widely used to provide essential elements of MS diagnosis and can also be used to modulate plasticity. Indeed, the recent development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques able to induce cortical plasticity, such as repetitive TMS or transcranial direct current stimulation, has brought promising results as add-on treatments. In this review, we will focus on the use of these tools (EEG and TMS) to study plasticity in MS and on the major techniques used to modulate plasticity in MS.

Haemodynamic and electrophysiological markers of pragmatic language comprehension in schizophrenia	WORLD JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						figurative language comprehension; schizophrenia; event-related potentials; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; inferior frontal cortex	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; METAPHOR COMPREHENSION; THOUGHT DISORDERS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; N400 COMPONENT; SENTENCES; FMRI; CONTEXT; SPEECH	Objectives. The present study aimed at investigating neurophysiological markers of language perception in schizophrenia using simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and event-related potentials (ERPs), which have been proven to be useful for studying language processing abilities in psychiatric patients. The study shall help to integrate previous findings from ERP and fMRI studies on figurative language comprehension in schizophrenia and elucidate how electrophysiological and haemodynamic markers of language processing are related. Methods. Twenty-two healthy subjects and 22 schizophrenia patients judged 120 sentences regarding their meaningfulness. Phrases were literal, metaphoric, or meaningless. EEG-fNIRS signals were recorded throughout the entire experiment. Results. Schizophrenia patients showed deficient and delayed sentence comprehension. Both the early N400 and left-hemispheric activation during language comprehension were altered in patients. Correlation analyses showed that metaphor-related ERPs were strongly linked to haemodynamic cortical activity in healthy subjects, but not in patients. Conclusions. Our results indicate group differences in cortical electrophysiological and haemodynamic activation that represent rather general impairments in the processing of complex language. Simultaneous EEG/NIRS applications are useful to depict these neural markers and to investigate their relationship. Future studies are needed to clarify the nature of respective anomalies and their potential as putative neural markers in schizophrenia research.

Cumulative evidence suggests that both stimulus and response conflict contribute to the Stroop interference effect. However, it remains unclear whether there are dissociable event-related potential (ERP) or frequency band-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) power changes associated with stimulus conflict and response conflict. To investigate potential markers for each form of conflict, we applied a Stroop 2-1 mapping task in 20 healthy young adults. Results showed that a negative deflection in the 350-500 ms time window (N450) and a positive deflection in the 600-900 ms time window (late positive component, LPC) were associated with response conflict and stimulus conflict, respectively. Time-frequency analyses found that both stimulus and response conflict induced theta band power changes and that response conflict additionally induced a beta band power change. These results indicate that stimulus and response conflict in the Stroop task are associated with different ERP effects and brain oscillatory features. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These deficits are primarily reflected on daily memory tasks. In the present work, we use the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) task to assess P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) as a marker for aging. Considering age-related effects, WCST was applied to young, middle-aged and elder participants. Early-late trial analysis tested the attentional set shifting and working memory updating hypothesis for the mechanisms behind WCST. The results suggest that, as people age, P3b peak latency highly correlates with age on both early and late trials, increasing as people gets older. P3b peak amplitude significantly distinguished between early and late trials regardless the subjects' age, while there were no differences on P300 peak latency.	[Fernandes, L.

In brain dynamics, there is ample evidence that event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect such quasi-stationary states. In order to detect them from time series, several segmentation techniques have been proposed. In this study, we elaborate a recent approach for detecting quasi-stationary states as recurrence domains by means of recurrence analysis and subsequent symbolization methods. We address two pertinent problems of contemporary recurrence analysis: optimizing the size of recurrence neighbourhoods and identifying symbols from different realizations for sequence alignment. As possible solutions for these problems, we suggest a maximum entropy criterion and a Hausdorff clustering algorithm. The resulting recurrence domains for single-subject ERPs are obtained as partition cells reflecting quasi-stationary brain states.

Subjects had to perform a simple discrimination task while undergoing EEG recordings. The ERPs elicited by semantically incongruent gestures produced larger N400 and possibly N300 components. While the N400 is indicative of semantic processing showing that emblematic gestures are lexicalized, the N300 likely reflects the cognitive processing of picture stimuli.

Various issues in translating findings from animal to human studies can be identified. Here we discuss whether EEG could be considered as a possible tool to translate the effects of cognition enhancers across species. Three different aspects of EEG measures are evaluated: frequency bands, event-related potentials, and coherence analysis. On basis of the comparison of these measures between species, and effects of drugs that improve or impair memory performance (mainly cholinergic drugs), it appears that event-related potentials and coherence analyses could be considered as potential translational tools to study cognition-enhancing drug effects in rodents and animals.

The Effect of Affective Context on Visuocortical Processing of Neutral Faces in Social Anxiety	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						social anxiety; face processing; context effects; ERPs (Event-Related Potentials); EEG/ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; THREATENING FACES; EMOTIONAL FACES; ATTENTION BIAS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AMYGDALA ACTIVATION; VISUAL SCANPATH; NEGATIVE AFFECT; NEURAL SYSTEM	It has been demonstrated that verbal context information alters the neural processing of ambiguous faces such as faces with no apparent facial expression. In social anxiety, neutral faces may be implicitly threatening for socially anxious individuals due to their ambiguous nature, but even more so if these neutral faces are put in self-referential negative contexts. Therefore, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in response to neutral faces which were preceded by affective verbal information (negative, neutral, positive). Participants with low social anxiety (LSA; n = 23) and high social anxiety (HSA; n = 21) were asked to watch and rate valence and arousal of the respective faces while continuous EEG was recorded. ERP analysis revealed that HSA showed elevated P100 amplitudes in response to faces, but reduced structural encoding of faces as indexed by reduced N170 amplitudes. In general, affective context led to an enhanced early posterior negativity (EPN) for negative compared to neutral facial expressions. Moreover, HSA compared to LSA showed enhanced late positive potentials (LPP) to negatively contextualized faces, whereas in LSA this effect was found for faces in positive contexts. Also, HSA rated faces in negative contexts as more negative compared to LSA. These results point at enhanced vigilance for neutral faces regardless of context in HSA, while structural encoding seems to be diminished (avoidance). Interestingly, later components of sustained processing (LPP) indicate that LSA show enhanced visuocortical processing for faces in positive contexts (happy bias), whereas this seems to be the case for negatively contextualized faces in HSA (threat bias). Finally, our results add further new evidence that top-down information in interaction with individual anxiety levels can influence early stage aspects of visual perception.

Unknown is whether they can combine two strategies. The present study found that such strategy combination can occur and improves participants' performance. Participants verified complex multiplication problems that violated the five rule (5 x 32 = 164), parity rule (5 x 12 = 65), both parity and five rules (5 x 31 = 158), or no rule (5 x 26 = 140). Participants obtained better performance on problems violating both five and parity rules than on problems violating either (or no) rule. Moreover, we found event-related potential (ERP) differences between two-rule and one-rule violation problems between 550 ms and 850 ms post-stimulus presentation, and ERP differences between parity-rule and five-rule violation problems between 850 ms and 1,400 ms. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of strategic variations in human cognition and suggest that strategy combination may occur in a wide variety of cognitive domains.

Many efforts have been done to improve the speed and accuracy of the P300-speller. Recently, some researchers improve the performance of the P300-speller through replacing the flashing rows or columns target characters located with that the familiar faces overlaid on, which was called FF spelling paradigm. In this paper, an experiment based FF spelling paradigm was proposed and operated to make clear the neural mechanism when subjects facing the P300-speller using FF spelling paradigm. The result showed that more Event-related Potentials (ERPs) would be elicited contributing to classify, which would provide relevant theoretical basis for designing better graphical interface based on BCI.

How Attention Changes in Response to Incentives	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SEARCH; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; MOTIVATION; COMPONENT; SALIENCE; PRIORITY	Although the performance of simple cognitive tasks can be enhanced if an incentive is provided, the mechanisms enabling such motivational control are not known. This study sought to uncover how mechanisms of attention and readiness are altered by reward-associated incentive stimuli. We measured EEG/ERP activity as human adults viewed a high- or low-incentive cue, experienced a short preparation interval, and then performed a simple visual search task to gain the predicted reward. Search performance was faster with high versus low incentives, and this was accompanied by distinct incentive-related EEG/ERP patterns at each phase of the task (incentive, preparation, and search). First, and most surprisingly, attention to high but not low incentive cues was actively suppressed, as indexed by a P-D component in response to the incentive display. During the subsequent preparation interval, neural oscillations in the alpha frequency range were reduced after high-incentive cues, indicating heightened visual readiness. Finally, attentional orienting to the target in the search array was deployed with relatively little effort on high-incentive trials, as indexed by a reduced N2pc component. These results reveal the chain of events by which the brain's executive control mechanisms respond to incentives by altering the operation of multiple processing systems to produce optimal performance.

Cognitive aspects of executive functioning will then be clarified resulting in a hierarchical taxonomy of executive control. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the field of cognitive psychophysiology, its merits and its limitations. 2 exemplary studies from our laboratory are finally used to illustrate the possibilities associated with the combined study of executive functions and psychophysiological measures.

J	Mahajan, R; Bansal, D				Mahajan, Rashima; Bansal, Dipali			Depression diagnosis and management using EEG-based affective brain mapping in real time	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						affective brain mapping; BCI; brain-computer interface; depression; early diagnosis; EEG; electroencephalogram; emotions; ERP; event-related potential; real time; spectral power	EMOTION RECOGNITION; FEATURES; SIGNALS; POWER; PREDICTION; ARTIFACTS; FREQUENCY; SPECTRUM	Development of affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) via Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a cynosure of research in early diagnosis and effective management of depression. However, conventional BCIs are still lacking in terms of high computational complexity, less accuracy due to Fourier phase suppression and lack of substantial conclusion for depression diagnosis. An automated, EEG-based depression diagnostic and management tool is proposed to overcome these limitations. Channel eventrelated potentials, cross-coherence and power spectra plots in MATLAB are quantified and studied as an outcome to map real-time, emotion-specific multichannel EEG data set into distinct emotional states. A fast and stable fourth-order statistics-based independent component analysis is incorporated to reject temporal/spatial artefacts. Increases in frontal alpha (8-13 Hz) and delta (0.5-4 Hz) power/coherence are during depressed and normal/relaxed states, respectively. Devotional music (relaxed state) is found to facilitate depression elimination. Results are found to be statistically significant across all subjects with minimal p-values. Hence, it has been inferred that the proposed model has the potential to aid early and accurate depression diagnostic and management process.

EEG Findings of Reduced Neural Synchronization during Visual Integration in Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GESTALT PERCEPTION; ILLUSORY CONTOURS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; INTERNEURONS; MODULATION; RESPONSES; COGNITION; DYNAMICS; DEFICITS	Schizophrenia patients exhibit well-documented visual processing deficits. One area of disruption is visual integration, the ability to form global objects from local elements. However, most studies of visual integration in schizophrenia have been conducted in the context of an active attention task, which may influence the findings. In this study we examined visual integration using electroencephalography (EEG) in a passive task to elucidate neural mechanisms associated with poor visual integration. Forty-six schizophrenia patients and 30 healthy controls had EEG recorded while passively viewing figures comprised of real, illusory, or no contours. We examined visual P100, N100, and P200 event-related potential (ERP) components, as well as neural synchronization in the gamma (30-60 Hz) band assessed by the EEG phase locking factor (PLF). The N100 was significantly larger to illusory vs. no contour, and illusory vs. real contour stimuli while the P200 was larger only to real vs. illusory stimuli; there were no significant interactions with group. Compared to controls, patients failed to show increased phase locking to illusory versus no contours between 40-60 Hz. Also, controls, but not patients, had larger PLF between 30-40 Hz when viewing real vs. illusory contours. Finally, the positive symptom factor of the BPRS was negatively correlated with PLF values between 40-60 Hz to illusory stimuli, and with PLF between 30-40 Hz to real contour stimuli. These results suggest that the pattern of results across visual processing conditions is similar in patients and controls. However, patients have deficits in neural synchronization in the gamma range during basic processing of illusory contours when attentional demand is limited.

Neural evidence that conscious awareness of errors is reduced in depression following a traumatic brain injury	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Error related negativity (ERN); Major depressive disorder (MDD); Error positivity (Pe); Traumatic brain injury (TBI)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; NEGATIVE AFFECT; DEFICITS; DECREMENTS; COMPONENTS; SIGNALS; ANXIETY; IMPACT; TASK	Impaired error awareness is related to poorer outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Error awareness deficits are also found in major depressive disorder (MDD), but have not been examined in the MDD that follows a TBI (TBI-MDD). This study assessed neural activity related to error awareness in TBI-MDD. Four groups completed a response inhibition task while EEG was recorded-healthy controls (N=15), MDD-only (N=15), TBI-only (N=16), and TBI-MDD (N=12). Error related EEG activity was compared using powerful randomisation statistics that included all electrodes and time points. Participants with TBI-MDD displayed less frontally distributed neural activity, suggesting reduced contribution from frontal generating sources. Neural activity during this time window is thought to reflect conscious awareness of errors. The TBI-only and MDD-only groups did not differ from controls, and early error processing was unaffected, suggesting early error detection is intact. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Migraine and attention to visual events during mind wandering	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mind wandering; Migraine; EEG; Event-related potentials; Visual; Cortical hyperexcitability	PRIMARY HEADACHE; DEFAULT NETWORK; THOUGHT; EXCITABILITY; HABITUATION; EXPERIENCE; BRAIN; LAPSE	Although migraine is traditionally categorized as a primary headache disorder, the condition is also associated with abnormalities in visual attentional function in between headache events. Namely, relative to controls, migraineurs show both a heightened sensitivity to nominally unattended visual events, as well as decreased habituation responses at sensory and post-sensory (cognitive) levels. Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether cortical hypersensitivities in migraineurs extend to mind wandering, or periods of time wherein we transiently attenuate the processing of external stimulus inputs as our thoughts drift away from the on-going task at hand. Participants performed a sustained attention to response task while they were occasionally queried as to their attentional state-either "on-task" or "mind wandering." We then analyzed the ERP responses to task-relevant stimuli as a function of whether they immediately preceded an on-task versus mind wandering report. We found that despite the commonly reported heightened visual sensitivities in our migraine group, they nevertheless manifest a reduced cognitive response during periods of mind wandering relative to on-task attentional states, as measured via amplitude changes in the P3 ERP component. This suggests that our capacity to attenuate the processing of external stimulus inputs during mind wandering is not necessarily impaired by the class of cortical hypersensitivities characteristic of the interictal migraine brain.

J	Devillez, H; Guyader, N; Guerin-Dugue, A				Devillez, Helene; Guyader, Nathalie; Guerin-Dugue, Anne			An eye fixation-related potentials analysis of the P300 potential for fixations onto a target object when exploring natural scenes	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						eye movements; electroencephalography; eye fixation-related potentials; P300; natural scenes; visual search	VISUAL-SEARCH; EEG; SURPRISE	The P300 event-related potential has been extensively studied in electroencephalography with classical paradigms that force observers to not move their eyes. This potential is classically used to infer whether a target or a task-relevant stimulus was presented. Few researches have studied this potential through more ecological paradigms where observers were able to move their eyes. In this study, we examined with an ecological paradigm and an adapted methodology the P300 potential using a visual search task that involves eye movements to actively explore natural scenes and during which eye movements and electroencephalographic activity were coregistered. Averaging the electroencephalography signal time-locked to fixation onsets, a P300 potential was observed for fixations onto the target object but not for other fixations recorded for the same visual search or for fixations recorded during the free viewing without any task. Our approach consists of using control experimental conditions with similar eye movements to ensure that the P300 potential was attributable to the fact that the observer gazed at the target rather than to other factors such as eye movement pattern (the size of the previous saccade) or the "overlap issue'' between the potentials elicited by two successive fixations. We also proposed to model the time overlap issue of the potentials elicited by consecutive fixations with various durations. Our results show that the P300 potential can be studied in ecological situations without any constraint on the type of visual exploration, with some precautions in the interpretation of results due to the overlap issue.

Prodromal AD is known to involve deficits in executive control processes. In the present study, we examined such deficits by recording EEG in 13 single domain amnestic MCI (sdaMCI), 12 multiple-domain amnestic MCI (mdaMCI) and 18 healthy elderly (control group, CG) participants while they performed a Simon task. The Simon task demands deployment of executive processes because participants have to respond to non-spatial features of a lateralized stimulus and inhibit the more automatic spatial tendency of the response. We specifically focused on the negativity central contralateral (N2cc), an event-related potential (ERP) component related to brain activity that prevents the cross-talk between direction of spatial attention and manual response preparation. The reaction time (RI) was not significantly different among the three groups of participants. The percentage of errors (PE) was higher in mdaMCI than in CG and sdaMCI participants. In addition, N2cc latency was delayed in mdaMCI (i.e., delayed implementation of mechanisms for controlling the spatial tendency of the response). The N2cc latency clearly distinguished among mdaMCI and CG/sdaMCI participants (area under curve: 0.91). Longer N2cc was therefore associated with executive control deficits, which suggests that N2cc latency is a correlate of mdaMCI.

Social interactions with primary caregivers may play a key role in the development of this complex ability. This study aimed to investigate how variations in parenting behavior affect infants' neural responses to emotional faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to emotional faces were recorded from 40 healthy 7-month-old infants (24 males). Parental behavior was assessed and coded using the Emotional Availability Scales during free-play interaction. Sensitive parenting was associated with increased amplitudes to positive facial expressions on the face-sensitive ERP component, the negative central. Findings are discussed in relation to the interactive mechanisms influencing how infants neurally encode positive emotions.	[Taylor-Colls, Samantha; Fearon, R. M.

However, this association is disputed: some argue that P3 latency is too late relative to the timing of action stopping (stop-signal reaction time; SSRT) to index response inhibition. We tested whether P3 onset latency is a marker of response inhibition, and whether it coincides with the timing predicted by neurocomputational models. We measured EEG in 62 participants during the stop-signal task, and used independent component analysis and permutation statistics to measure the P3 onset in each participant. We show that P3 onset latency is shorter when stopping is successful, that it is highly correlated with SSRT, and that it coincides with the purported timing of the inhibition process (towards the end of SSRT). These results demonstrate the utility of P3 onset latency as a noninvasive, temporally precise neural marker of the response inhibition process.

The relationship between somatic and cognitive-affective depression symptoms and error-related ERPs	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depression; Somatic symptoms; Cognitive-affective symptoms; Error ERPs; Go/no-go; Cognitive control	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ANTISACCADE TASK; RESPONSE ERRORS; HAPPY MEMORIES; P300 AMPLITUDE; RATING-SCALE; INVENTORY-II; BLOOD-FLOW; SAD MOOD	Background: The symptoms that contribute to the clinical diagnosis of depression likely emerge from, or are related to, underlying cognitive deficits. To understand this relationship further, we examined the relationship between self reported somatic and cognitive affective Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-11) symptoms and aspects of cognitive control reflected in error event related potential (ERP) responses. Methods: Task and assessment data were analyzed within 51 individuals. The group contained a broad distribution of depressive symptoms, as assessed by BDI-11 scores. ERPs were collected following error responses within a go/no-go task. Individual error ERP amplitudes were estimated by conducting group independent component analysis (ICA) on the electroencephalographic (EEG) time series arid analyzing the individual reconstructed source epochs. Source error amplitudes were correlated with the subset of BDI-II scores representing somatic and cognitive affective symptoms. Results: We demonstrate a negative relationship between somatic depression symptoms (i.e. fatigue or loss of energy) (after regressing out cognitive affective scores, age and IQ) and the central-parietal ERP response that peaks at 359 ms. The peak amplitudes within this ERP response were not significantly related to cognitive-affective symptom severity (after regressing out the somatic symptom scores, age, and IQ). Limitations: These findings were obtained within a population of female adults horn a maximum-security correctional facility. Thus, additional research is required to verify that they generalize to the broad population. Conclusions: These results suggest that individuals with greater somatic depression symptoms demonstrate a reduced awareness of behavioral errors, and help clarify the relationship between clinical measures of self-reported depression symptoms and cognitive control.

Participants were 12 healthy males in their 20s (mean age = 23.1 +/- 2.0 years). One session consisted of a Control Phase (3 s), a Stimulation Phase (3 s), and a Rest Phase (9 s). During the Stimulation Phase, a 4-psi suction or puff stimulus was applied to the first joint of the right index finger. After completion of the session, a subjective magnitude test was presented. In all phases, electroencephalography signals were recorded. We extracted maximum positive amplitude and minimum negative amplitude as well as relevant latency values for C3 and FC5 signals. Suction and puff stimuli had similar subjective magnitude scores. For both C3 and FC5, the maximum and minimum amplitude latency was reached earlier for the suction stimulus than for the puff stimulus. In conclusion, when suction and puff stimuli of the same intensity were applied to the fingers, the suction stimulus caused a more sensitive response in the somatosensory area (C3) and motor area (FC5) than did the puff stimulus.

However, given that several studies examined the medial frontal event-related potentials (ERPs) by comparing signals triggered by different stimuli and different anticipations, it remains an open question whether the medial frontal signals are sensitive to the valence of prediction errors. Here we orthogonally manipulated expectation magnitude (i.e., large/small expectation) and expectation confirmation (i.e., fulfilled/violated expectation) in a target detection task with rewards. We found that the medial frontal ERPs were more negative-going for unexpected outcomes in comparison with expected outcomes, regardless of whether a large/small reward was expected. The result supports the idea that the medial frontal signals express prediction errors in general regardless of their valence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Albares, M; Lio, G; Boulinguez, P				Albares, Marion; Lio, Guillaume; Boulinguez, Philippe			Tracking markers of response inhibition in electroencephalographic data: why should we and how can we go beyond the N2 component?	REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						attention; response inhibition; source localization; source separation; time-frequency analyses	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUTOMATIC MOTOR ACTIVATION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TOP-DOWN; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS	Response inhibition is a pivotal component of executive control, which is especially difficult to assess. Indeed, it is a substantial challenge to gauge brain-behavior relationships because this function is precisely intended to suppress overt measurable behaviors. A further complication is that no single neuroimaging method has been found that can disentangle the accurate time-course of concurrent excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Here, we argue that this objective can be achieved with electroencephalography (EEG) on some conditions. Based on a systematic review, we emphasize that the standard event-related potential N2 (N200) is not an appropriate marker of prepotent response inhibition. We provide guidelines for assessing the cortical brain dynamics of response inhibition with EEG. This includes the combined use of inseparable data processing steps (source separation, source localization, and single-trial and time-frequency analyses) as well as the amendment of the classical experimental designs to enable the recording of different kinds of electrophysiological activity predicted by different models of response inhibition. We conclude with an illustration based on recent findings of how fruitful this approach can be.

In this study, a simulated driving environment was implemented to study the neural correlation of braking intention in diverse driving situations. We further investigated to what extent these neural correlates can be used to detect a participant's braking intention prior to the behavioral response. A feature combination method was proposed for the enhancement of detection performance and additional classification of emergency braking triggered by stimuli and voluntary braking. It consists of event-related potential (ERP), readiness potential (RP), and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features. Fifteen participants drove a virtual vehicle and were exposed to the diversified traffic situations in the constructed simulator framework, while technical signals (i.e., gas pedal and brake pedal), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals were measured. After that, the neural correlation of the measured signals was analyzed. The proposed framework shows excellent detection performance for various kinds of driver's braking intention. Our study suggests that a driver's braking intention is characterized by specific neural patterns of sensory perception and processing, as well as motor preparation and execution, which can be utilized by smart vehicle technology.

Neurophysiological evidence for a processing bias towards schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Communication abnormalities; N400; Stigma; Social exclusion; EEG	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCE; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION; COMMUNITY ATTITUDES; IMPLICIT; N400; DISCRIMINATION; INTEGRATION; COMPONENT; BEHAVIOR	Background: The current study aimed to examine the effects of diagnostic and symptomatic information on auditory linguistic event-related potentials (ERPs) in the listener, in response to speech containing schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities. Methods: 73 participants listened to conversation segments while continuous EEG was recorded. Participants were told that the responder in the conversation was either a university student, had symptoms from a stroke, had symptoms from schizophrenia, or had recovered from schizophrenia. The final word of the response was randomly presented as a typical ending, word approximation, neologism, or filler ending. Results: A significant N400 was observed over centro-parietal electrode sites in response to word approximations and neologisms in the university student condition only. There were no differences between conditions in the N100 ERP, and EEG measures were not related to either subjective or objective measures of stigmatizing attitudes. Conclusions: The N400 effect may represent disengagement, at a semantic level, from what an individual is saying based on symptomatic or diagnostic information about schizophrenia.

Some of recent results concerning BCI made a great contribution to the development of the HCI research area. In this paper we define "good-trained brain states", and then propose a method for discriminating good-trained brain states from other states. We believe that repetitious training might be effective to human brains. Human brain reactions can be quantified by ERPs (event related potentials). We analyze the data of ERPs reflecting the brain reactions, and then discuss the effect of repetitious training to the brain states.

Recent studies exploit the neural signal recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) to get a more objective measurement of perceived video quality. Most of these studies capitalize on the event-related potential component P3. We follow an alternative approach to the measurement problem investigating steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as EEG correlates of quality changes. Unlike the P3, SSVEPs are directly linked to the sensory processing of the stimuli and do not require long experimental sessions to get a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation of the EEG-based measures with the outcome of the standard behavioral assessment. Approach. As stimulus material, we used six gray-level natural images in six levels of degradation that were created by coding the images with the HM10.0 test model of the high efficiency video coding (H.265/MPEG-HEVC) using six different compression rates. The degraded images were presented in rapid alternation with the original images. In this setting, the presence of SSVEPs is a neural marker that objectively indicates the neural processing of the quality changes that are induced by the video coding. We tested two different machine learning methods to classify such potentials based on the modulation of the brain rhythm and on time-locked components, respectively. Main results. Results show high accuracies in classification of the neural signal over the threshold of the perception of the quality changes. Accuracies significantly correlate with the mean opinion scores given by the participants in the standardized degradation category rating quality assessment of the same group of images. Significance. The results show that neural assessment of video quality based on SSVEPs is a viable complement of the behavioral one and a significantly fast alternative to methods based on the P3 component.

Reliable activation to novel stimuli predicts higher fluid intelligence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Fluid intelligence; Time-frequency analysis; Inter-trial phase clustering; Neural variability	AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; FRONTAL-INTEGRATION-THEORY; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; CONTOUR LENGTH; FMRI ACTIVITY; EEG; COMPONENT; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY	The ability to reliably respond to stimuli could be an important biological determinant of differences in fluid intelligence (Gf). However, most electrophysiological studies of Gf employ event-related potential (ERP) measures that average brain activity over trials, and hence have limited power to quantify neural variability. Time-frequency analyses can capture cross-trial variation in the phase of neural activity, and thus can help address the importance of neural reliability to differences in Gf. This study recruited a community sample of healthy adults and measured inter-trial phase clustering (ITPC), total spectral power, and ERP amplitudes elicited by Repeated and Novel non-target stimuli during two visual oddball tasks. Condition effects, relations among the EEG measures, and relations with Gf were assessed. Early visual responses to Repeated stimuli elicited higher ITPC, yet only ITPC elicited by Novel stimuli was associated with Gf. Analyses of spectral power further highlighted the contribution of phase consistency to the findings. The link between Gf and reliable responding to changing inputs suggests an important role for flexible resource allocation in fluid intellectual skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we present a case study investigating auditory processing of GM, a nonverbal child with ASD and cerebral palsy. At the age of 8 years, GM was tested using magnetoencephalography (MEG) whilst passively listening to speech sounds and complex tones. Where typically developing children and verbal autistic children all demonstrated similar brain responses to speech and nonspeech sounds, GM produced much stronger responses to nonspeech than speech, particularly in the 65-165 ms (M50/M100) time window post-stimulus onset. GM was retested aged 10 years using electroencephalography (EEG) whilst passively listening to pure tone stimuli. Consistent with her MEG response to complex tones, GM showed an unusually early and strong response to pure tones in her EEG responses. The consistency of the MEG and EEG data in this single case study demonstrate both the potential and the feasibility of these methods in the study of minimally verbal children with ASD. Further research is required to determine whether GM's atypical auditory responses are characteristic of other minimally verbal children with ASD or of other individuals with cerebral palsy.

A common EEG BCI paradigm is based on the so called Event-Related Potentials (ERP) which arc responses of the brain to some external stimuli. For the present work at hand, the innermost part of a BCI is the pattern recognition stage whose aim is to detect the presence of ERPs with high accuracy. In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using a dictionary composed of prototype atoms, signals arc written as linear combinations of just a few of those atoms. This sparse representation is found to be appropriate for posterior classification purposes. In this work we propose a sparse representation and posterior classification of ERPs signals by means of an ad-hoc spatio-temporal dictionary composed of bidimensional Gaussian atoms. Based on fl-minimization we find the sparsest possible solution which allow us to design a robust classification based on nearest representation	[Peterson, Victoria; Rufiner, Hugo L.] Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Sinc I FICH UNL, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Hidr, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Compu, Ruta Nac 168,Km 472-4, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Rufiner, Hugo L.] UNER, FI, RA-3100 Oro Verde, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Spies, Ruben D.] UNL, CONICET, IMAL, RA-3000 Paraje El Pozo, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Spies, Ruben D.] UNL, FIQ, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina		Peterson, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Sinc I FICH UNL, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Hidr, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Compu, Ruta Nac 168,Km 472-4, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.	vpeterson@santafe-conicet.gov.ar; lrufiner@fich.unl.edu.ar; rspies@santafe-conicetgov.ar	Rufiner, Hugo Leonardo/R-7337-2019; Spies, Ruben/N-4100-2019	Rufiner, Hugo Leonardo/0000-0002-1083-5891; Spies, Ruben/0000-0002-4957-9979; Peterson, Victoria/0000-0003-0825-1018					15	0	0	0	0	INT CENTER NUMERICAL METHODS ENGINEERING	08034 BARCELONA	GRAN CAPITAN, S-N, CAMPUS NORTE UPC, MODULO C1, 08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN			978-84-943928-2-5				2015							1167	1178						12	Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mechanics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanics	BF3WF					2022-08-02	WOS:000380586300107

The aim of this study was to compare visual-motor integrated processing between execution and inhibition of a motor response using event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in the 15- to 80-Hz range and to investigate a relationship between event-related potentials (ERPs) and ERS/ERD in 10 normal young subjects. Methods: EEGs were recorded from 21 scalp sites during a visual go/no-go paradigm. For ERPs, 40 artifact-free trials were averaged off-line referenced to linked ear lobes. In the beta and gamma bands, ERS and ERD were calculated by time-frequency analysis. Results: Go N2 and no-go N2 were elicited 200-250 ms after stimuli, and their distributions were predominant at Fz. Go P3 was predominantly elicited 340-360 ms after stimuli at Pz, whereas no-go P3 was predominantly elicited 360-380 ms after stimuli at Cz. ERD of the beta band at Fz and Cz during 300-600 ms showed in the go condition, whereas ERD showed between 39 and 42 Hz at F3 in the no-go condition. Conclusion: Oscillatory cortical response-related beta and gamma activities differ between the processing of execution and inhibition in motor responses. beta ERDs in the sensorimotor areas with go stimuli may be related to motor responses, and gamma ERDs in the left frontal area with no-go stimuli may be involved in the processing of inhibition of motor responses.

J	Bress, JN; Meyer, A; Hajcak, G				Bress, Jennifer N.; Meyer, Alexandria; Hajcak, Greg			Differentiating Anxiety and Depression in Children and Adolescents: Evidence From Event-Related Brain Potentials	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TRIPARTITE MODEL; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL RESPONSE; RETEST RELIABILITY; EARLY INTERVENTION; REWARD PREDICTION	The current study, which was a reanalysis of previous data, focused on the error-related negativity (ERN)-an event-related potential (ERP) associated with error monitoring-and the feedback negativity (FN)-an ERP associated with reward processing. Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children. EEG was collected from twenty-five 11- to 13-year-old participants (12 female; 23 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 1 of Caucasian and Hispanic ethnicity) during tasks designed to elicit an ERN and an FN. Participants and a parent completed questionnaires assessing the participant's anxious and depressive symptomatology. Increasing anxiety was related to a larger ERN, and increasing depression was related to a smaller FN. Further analysis demonstrated that these relationships remained significant when controlling for the contribution of other variables; that is, the ERN continued to predict anxiety when controlling for the FN and depression, and the FN continued to predict depression when controlling for the ERN and anxiety. Thus, in late childhood and early adolescence, the ERN and the FN appear to relate uniquely to anxious and depressive symptoms, respectively. Although this research is still in early stages, the ERN and the FN have the potential to inform trajectories of risk for anxiety and depression, and could be utilized in clinical settings as cost- and labor-efficient neural biomarkers.

Specific electrophysiological components disentangle affective sharing and empathic concern in psychopathy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						affective sharing; empathy; empathic concern; event-related potentials; gamma coherence; mu suppression; high-density EEG; perception of distress; psychopathy	PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; NEURAL RESPONSE; MORAL JUDGMENTS; GAMMA-BAND; PAIN; BRAIN; OTHERS	Empathic impairment is one of the hallmarks of psychopathy, a personality dimension associated with poverty in affective reactions, lack of attachment to others, and a callous disregard for the feelings, rights, and welfare of others. Neuroscience research on the relation between empathy and psychopathy has predominately focused on the affective sharing and cognitive components of empathy in forensic populations, and much less on empathic concern. The current study used high-density electroencephalography in a community sample to examine the spatiotemporal neurodynamic responses when viewing people in physical distress under two subjective contexts: one evoking affective sharing, the other, empathic concern. Results indicate that early automatic (175-275 ms) and later controlled responses (LPP 400-1,000 ms) were differentially modulated by engagement in affective sharing or empathic concern. Importantly, the late event-related potentials (ERP) component was significantly impacted by dispositional empathy and psychopathy, but the early component was not. Individual differences in dispositional empathic concern directly predicted gamma coherence (25-40 Hz), whereas psychopathy was inversely modulatory. Interestingly, significant suppression in the mu/alpha band (8-13 Hz) when perceiving others in distress was positively associated with higher trait psychopathy, which argues against the assumption that sensorimotor resonance underpins empathy. Greater scores on trait psychopathy were inversely related to subjective ratings of both empathic concern and affective sharing. Overall, the study demonstrates that neural markers of affective sharing and empathic concern to the same cues of another's distress can be distinguished at an electrophysiological level, and that psychopathy alters later time-locked differentiations and spectral coherence associated with empathic concern.

J	Omedes, J; Iturrate, I; Minguez, J; Montesano, L				Omedes, Jason; Iturrate, Inaki; Minguez, Javier; Montesano, Luis			Analysis and asynchronous detection of gradually unfolding errors during monitoring tasks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; event related potentials; brain-machine interfaces; asynchronous classification; evidence accumulation; mismatch event	BRAIN-ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PREDICTION ERROR; EEG; POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Human studies on cognitive control processes rely on tasks involving sudden-onset stimuli, which allow the analysis of these neural imprints to be time-locked and relative to the stimuli onset. Human perceptual decisions, however, comprise continuous processes where evidence accumulates until reaching a boundary. Surpassing the boundary leads to a decision where measured brain responses are associated to an internal, unknown onset. The lack of this onset for gradual stimuli hinders both the analyses of brain activity and the training of detectors. This paper studies electroencephalographic (EEG)-measurable signatures of human processing for sudden and gradual cognitive processes represented as a trajectory mismatch under a monitoring task. Time-locked potentials and brain-source analysis of the EEG of sudden mismatches revealed the typical components of event-related potentials and the involvement of brain structures related to cognitive control processing. For gradual mismatch events, time-locked analyses did not show any discernible EEG scalp pattern, despite related brain areas being, to a lesser extent, activated. However, and thanks to the use of non-linear pattern recognition algorithms, it is possible to train an asynchronous detector on sudden events and use it to detect gradual mismatches, as well as obtaining an estimate of their unknown onset. Post-hoc time-locked scalp and brain-source analyses revealed that the EEG patterns of detected gradual mismatches originated in brain areas related to cognitive control processing. This indicates that gradual events induce latency in the evaluation process but that similar brain mechanisms are present in sudden and gradual mismatch events. Furthermore, the proposed asynchronous detection model widens the scope of applications of brain-machine interfaces to other gradual processes.

The EEG feature of interest for this study was the P300 event-related potential (ERP) component and P3a and P3b sub-components, as these components reflects the ones attention level. Nine students participated the study and completed the simulated manual assembly task, replicated from one of our industrial partner. We used sustained attention to response task (SART), instead of real industrial information that indicates the beginning of the operation. SART paradigm is "go/no-go" task, and in this version of SART, participants are required to respond to all "go" stimuli, in sense of initiating the action of manual assembly operation, and to withhold the action otherwise. The "no-go" condition was considered as micro-break period, since the participants had approximately five seconds to rest during a continuous simulated working routine. Fifty ERPs preceding and following the "no-go" condition were compared. The results revealed that, on the group level, the values of the amplitude of the P3b sub-component, which is related to the higher-level attention processing, were significantly higher for the ERPs following than preceding the micro-break period. This finding indicates that the frequent micro-breaks increase the attention of the manual assembly workers. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, we recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an antisaccade task, after the induction of a happy (n = 20) or neutral (n = 20) mood, to compare the same inhibition-related processes across these two affective contexts. Topographical evoked potential mapping methods were used to characterize changes in the electric field depending on mood and saccade type (pro vs. anti) concurrently. Results showed that prior to target onset, the CNV component was enhanced for anti-compared to prosaccades, selectively in the neutral mood group. Following target onset, the topography of the N2 was more strongly expressed in the happy mood group, and was also altered by saccade type. The subsequent P3 components were not modulated by mood. We discuss these new findings in light of recent neurobiological and neuropsychological models that posit that positive affect dynamically changes cognitive control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, an internal body trigger (heart evoked potential, HEP) was used to measure ongoing internally triggered signals during emotional states. We employed high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), source reconstruction analysis, and behavioral measures to assess healthy participants watching emotion-inducing video-clips (positive, negative, and neutral emotions). Results showed emotional modulation of the HEP at specific source-space nodes of the fronto-insulo-temporal networks related to affective-cognitive integration.

In this paper, a machine learning (ML) scheme is presented to automate the diagnose process. It is achieved by discriminating the study participants, i. e., the MDD patients and healthy controls based on the features computed from event-related potential (ERP) data. The ERP features such as the P300 amplitudes and the latencies are computed from the study participants at central locations, i. e, Fz, Cz, and Pz. The ERP features are further used as input to the proposed ML scheme. It is followed by rank-based feature selection involving criteria: t-test, receiver operating characteristics (roc) and wilcoxon. For classification purposes, the logistic regression (LR) classifier is utilized. Finally, the P300 intensities are observed significantly higher in the healthy controls as compared with the MDD patients. In addition, the larger P300 latencies are found in the MDD patients as compared with the healthy controls. Based on the differences of ERP features between the 2 groups, the highest classification accuracy is achieved, i. e., 90.5%. It is concluded that the input features such as the P300 intensities and latencies can discriminate the MDD patients from healthy controls based on a single channel ERP data.

Validation of mismatch negativity and P3a for use inmulti-site studies of schizophrenia: Characterization of demographic, clinical, cognitive, and functional correlates in COGS-2	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Mismatch negativity; P300; P3a; Cognition; Function; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; HIGH-RISK; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; PROCESSING DEFICITS; DURATION; NICOTINE; ATTENTION; EEG; MMN	Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a are auditory event-related potential (ERP) components that show robust deficits in schizophrenia (SZ) patients and exhibit qualities of endophenotypes, including substantial heritability, test-retest reliability, and trait-like stability. These measures also fulfill criteria for use as cognition and function-linked biomarkers in outcome studies, but have not yet been validated for use in large-scale multi-site clinical studies. This study tested the feasibility of adding MMN and P3a to the ongoing Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS) study. The extent to which demographic, clinical, cognitive, and functional characteristics contribute to variability in MMN and P3a amplitudes was also examined. Participants (HCS n=824, SZ n=966) underwent testing at 5 geographically distributed COGS laboratories. Valid ERP recordings were obtained from 91% of HCS and 91% of SZ patients. Highly significant MMN (d=0.96) and P3a (d=0.93) amplitude reductions were observed in SZ patients, comparable in magnitude to those observed in single-lab studies with no appreciable differences across laboratories. Demographic characteristics accounted for 26% and 18% of the variance in MMN and P3a amplitudes, respectively. Significant relationships were observed among demographically adjusted MMN and P3a measures and medication status as well as several clinical, cognitive, and functional characteristics of the SZ patients. This study demonstrates that MMN and P3a ERP biomarkers can be feasibly used in multi-site clinical studies. As with many clinical tests of brain function, demographic factors contribute to MMN and P3a amplitudes and should be carefully considered in future biomarker-informed clinical studies.

The proposed system allows for nine commands' application using a non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) brainwave monitoring. This paper presents the experiments results obtained by relying entirely on the visual oddball paradigm-based interaction. The visual stimuli are generated utilizing images on a computer screen arranged in a 3 x 3 matrix. The visual stimuli are used to elicit event related potentials (ERPs) with P300 components elicited to the intentional targets. The resulting ERPs are processed to extract the P300 responses in EEG features for a subsequent classification accuracy analysis. We propose to utilize a linear support vector machine (linSVM) classifier in offline EEG data post-processing analysis scenario. We discuss results of experiments conducted with five healthy users. We compare BCI accuracy results from two experimental setups with different ISI settings.

Although medial frontal regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in these functions, there is still considerable heterogeneity regarding their spatio-temporal activations. The timing of these functions has been associated with two separable event-related potentials (ERPs) usually localized to the medial frontal wall, one during error processing (ERN -error related negativity) and one during conflict monitoring (N2). In this study we aimed to spatially and temporally dissociate conflict and error processing using simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data fromamodified Flanker task in healthy adults. We demonstrate a spatial dissociation of conflict monitoring and error processing along the medial frontal wall, with selective conflict level dependent activation of the SMA/pre-SMA. Activation to error processing was located in the ACC, rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and pre-SMA. The EEG-informed fMRI analysis revealed that stronger ERN amplitudes are associated with increased activation in a large coherent cluster comprising the ACC, RCZ and pre-SMA, while N2 amplitudes increased with activation in the pre-SMA. Conjunction analysis of EEG-informed fMRI revealed common activation of ERN and N2 in the pre-SMA and divergent activation in the RCZ. No conjoint activation between error processing and conflict monitoring was found with standard fMRI analysis along the medial frontal wall. Our fMRI findings clearly demonstrate that conflict monitoring and error processing are spatially dissociable along the medial frontal wall. Moreover, the overlap of ERN-and N2-informed fMRI activation in the pre-SMA provides new evidence that these ERP components share conflict related processing functions and are thus not completely separable. c 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Because of large individual differences, some labeled subject-specific data are needed to calibrate the classifier for each new subject. This paper proposes an online weighted adaptation regularization (OwAR) algorithm to reduce the online calibration effort, and hence to increase the utility of the BCI system. We show that given the same number of labeled subject-specific training samples, OwAR can significantly improve the online calibration performance. In other words, given a desired classification accuracy, OwAR can significantly reduce the number of labeled subject-specific training samples. Furthermore, we also show that the computational cost of OwAR can be reduced by more than 50% by source domain selection, without a statistically significant sacrifice of classification performance.

In an overview on how this approach can take shape, multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) is treated in 2 main parts: by experiments without a task and in the experimentally cued working brain. It concentrates first on the alpha rhythm properties and next on data-driven search for patterns such as the default mode network. The high-resolution volumic distributions of neuronal metabolic indices result in distributed cortical regions and possibly relate to numerous nuclei, observable in a non-invasive manner in the central nervous system of humans. The second part deals with paradigms in which nowadays assessment of target-related networks can align level-dependent blood oxygenation, electrical responses and behaviour, taking the temporal resolution advantages of event-related potentials. Evidence-based electrical propagation in serial tasks during performance is now to a large extent attributed to interconnected pathways, particularly chronometry-dependent ones, throughout a chain including a dorsal stream, next ventral cortical areas taking the flow of information towards inferior temporal domains. The influence of aging is documented, and results of the first multimodal studies in neuropharmacology are consistent. Finally a scope on implementation of advanced clinical applications and personalized marker strategies in neuropsychiatry is indicated. (C) 2016 S.

They appear as a series of peaks and troughs interspersed in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves. The exact neural origins and neuropsychological meaning of the P300 are imprecisely known, even though appreciable progress has been made in the last 25 years. In this review, we will focus on the possible neural generators of this potential. Given the attention and memory operations associated with P300 generation, the first human studies on the neural origins of this ERP focused on the hippocampal formation using depth electrodes implanted to assess sources of epileptic foci in patients. Other lesion studies have found that the integrity of the temporal-parietal lobe junction is involved with either generation or transmission processes subsequent to hippocampal activity and contributes to ERP measures. These findings imply that hippocampal absence does not eliminate the P300, but that the temporal-parietal junction does affect its production. As mentioned till now, the neuroelectric events that underlie P300 generation stem from the interaction between frontal lobe and hippocampal/temporal-parietal function. ERP and fMRI studies using oddball tasks have obtained patterns consistent with this frontal-to-temporal and parietal lobe activation pattern. Further support comes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of gray matter volumes that suggest individual variation in P3a amplitude from distracter stimuli is correlated with frontal lobe area size, whereas P3b amplitude from target stimuli is correlated with parietal area size. Given distinct neuropsychological correlates for P3a and P3b, different neurotransmitters may be engaged for each constituent subcomponent under specific stimulus/task processing requirements. Available data suggest that dopaminergic/frontal processes for P3a and locus-coeruleus-norepinephrine/parietal activity for P3b are reasonable to propose. This dual-transmitter P300 hypothesis is speculative but appears to account for a variety of findings and provides a useful framework for evaluating drug effects.

NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural correlates of consciousness; task relevance; P300; EEG; visual masking	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL AWARENESS; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; ERP; ACCUMULATION; CORRELATE; TRACKING; SIGNAL; TASK	A common scientific strategy toward understanding consciousness is to study neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) for a particular conscious percept. This can be done by contrasting conditions in which subjects are aware and unaware of a particular visual stimulus. However, recent findings have been contradictory and this approach appears not to reveal only the NCC, but also the prerequisites or consequences of consciousness. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the P300 component often claimed to be a key signature of conscious access might actually rather reflect the consequences of conscious perception. Subjects participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment where most of the stimuli were clearly perceived and only a quarter of trials was associated with not perceiving the target. The visual masking paradigm used no discrimination task, always the same stimulus was presented and an additional task was given together with the target stimulus. Results indicate that trials where subjects reported to have seen the stimulus are associated with a more pronounced P300. Hence, the present data support the theories which claim that P300 is a marker of conscious perception. However, an earlier component, visual awareness negativity also tracks conscious perception reliably so that the P300 need not be the earliest correlate of conscious perception. (C) 2015 IBRO.

Children with ADHD and typically developing children completed an animal Stroop task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The lateralized readiness potential and event-related brain potentials associated with perceptual and conflict processing were analyzed. Children with ADHD were slower to give correct responses irrespective of congruency, and slower to prepare correct responses in the incongruent condition. This delay could result from enhanced effort allocation at earlier processing stages, indicated by differences in P1, N1, and conflict sustained potential. Results suggest multiple deficits in information processing rather than a specific response inhibition impairment.

Besides episodic memory dysfunction they show deficits in accessing contextual knowledge that further specifies a general spatial navigation task or an executive function (EF) virtual action planning. Virtual reality (VR) environments have already been successfully used in cognitive rehabilitation and show increased potential for use in neuropsychological evaluation allowing for greater ecological validity while being more engaging and user friendly. In our study we employed the in-house platform of virtual action planning museum (VAP-M) and a sample of 25 MCI and 25 controls, in order to investigate deficits in spatial navigation, prospective memory, and executive function. In addition, we used the morphology of late components in event-related potential (ERP) responses, as a marker for cognitive dysfunction. The related measurements were fed to a common classification scheme facilitating the direct comparison of both approaches. Our results indicate that both the VAP-M and ERP averages were able to differentiate between healthy elders and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and agree with the findings of the virtual action planning supermarket (VAP-S). The sensitivity (specificity) was 100 % (98 %) for the VAP-M data and 87 %(90 %) for the ERP responses. Considering that ERPs have proven to advance the early detection and diagnosis of "presymptomatic AD," the suggested VAP-M platform appears as an appealing alternative.

Twenty-two highly proficient but non-balanced successive French German bilingual adults and 22 monolingual adults performed a combined Stroop/Negative priming task while event-related potential (ERP) were recorded online. The data revealed that the ERP effects were reduced in bilinguals in comparison to monolinguals but only in the Stroop task and limited to the N400 and the sustained fronto-central negativegoing potential time windows. This result suggests that bilingualism may impact the process of control implementation rather than the process of conflict monitoring (N200). Critically, our study revealed a differential time course of the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in conflict processing. While the ACC showed major activation in the early time windows (N200 and N400) but not in the latest time window (late sustained negative-going potential), the PFC became unilaterally active in the left hemisphere in the N400 and the late sustained negative-going potential time windows. Taken together, the present electroencephalography data lend support to a cascading neurophysiological model of executive control processes, in which ACC and PFC may play a determining role.

Although investigations of cued attention comprise hundreds of behavioral and physiological studies, remarkably few studies of voluntary attention have addressed the challenging question of how spatial attention is initiated and controlled in the absence of external instructions, which we refer to as willed attention. To explore this question, we employed a trial-by-trial spatial attention task using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI results reveal a unique network of brain regions for willed attention that includes the anterior cingulate cortex, left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and the left and right anterior insula (AI). We also observed two event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with willed attention; one with a frontal distribution occurring 250-350 ms postdecision cue onset (EWAC: Early Willed Attention Component), and another occurring between 400 and 800 ms postdecision-cue onset (WAC: Willed Attention Component). In addition, each ERP component uniquely correlated across subjects with different willed attention-specific sites of BOLD activation. The EWAC was correlated with the willed attention-specific left AI and left MFG activations and the later WAC was correlated only with left AI. These results offer a comprehensive and novel view of the electrophysiological and anatomical profile of willed attention and further illustrate the relationship between scalp-recorded ERPs and the BOLD response.

However, little is known about how needle puncture pain is processed by the central nervous system in children. In this study, we describe for the first time the event. related activity in the infant brain during routine inoculation using electroencephalography. Fifteen healthy terrn-born infants aged 1 to 2 months (n = 12) or 12 months (n = 5) were studied in an outpatient clinic. pain behavior was scored using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale. A distinct inoculation event-related vertex potential, consisting of 2 late negative-positive complexes, was observable in single trials after needle contact with the skin. The amplitude of both negative-positive components was significantly greater in the 12-month group. Both inoculation event-related potential amplitude and behavioral pain scores increased with age but the 2 measures were not correlated with each other. These components are the first recordings of brain activity in response to real-life needle pain in infants up to a year old. They provide new evidence of postnatal nociceptive processing and, combined with more traditional behavioral. pain scores, offer a potentially more sensitive measure for testing the efficacy of analgesic protocols in this age group.

EEG correlates of impaired self-other integration during joint-task performance in schizophrenia	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						joint action; P3 ERP; schizophrenia; self-other integration; social Simon effect	SOCIAL COGNITION; TEMPORAL OVERLAP; STATE ASPECTS; ACTION-BLIND; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; COMPATIBILITY; INDIVIDUALS; POTENTIALS; FRAMEWORK	Deficits in a wide variety of social cognitive processes are well established in schizophrenia. However, research focusing on actual interacting individuals is surprisingly scarce. Problems in low-level processes such as self-other integration may importantly underlie often-reported higher-level deficits. The current study aimed at measuring possible disturbances in self-other integration in schizophrenia using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures. Sixteen healthy controls and fifteen schizophrenia patients performed a social Simon task in both a joint and an individual setting. Behaviorally, patients showed general slower reaction times, but comparable self-other integration as reflected in the social Simon effect. The ERP results for the healthy controls revealed increased no-go P3 amplitudes in the joint compared with the individual setting. Crucially, patients did not show this increase in no-go P3 amplitude. In line with previous research, the present ERP findings demonstrate that healthy volunteers needed more effort to inhibit their responses in the joint compared with the individual setting. Patients however, showed altered self-other integration when they had to withhold their responses while their co-actor had to act. These outcomes indicate that schizophrenia patients have deficits in low-level processes required for successful joint action.	[de la Asuncion, J.; Bervoets, C.; Morrens, M.; Sabbe, B.; De Bruijn, E.

Classifying the Auditory P300 using mobile EEG recordings without calibration phase	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS	One of the major drawbacks in mobile EEG Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) is the need for subject specific training data to train a classifier. By removing the need for supervised classification and calibration phase, new users could start immediate interaction with a BCI. We propose a solution to exploit the structural difference by means of canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) for three-class auditory oddball data without the need for subject-specific information. We achieve this by adding average event-related-potential (ERP) templates to the CPD model. This constitutes a novel similarity measure between single-trial pairs and known-templates, which results in a fast and interpretable classifier. These results have similar accuracy to those of the supervised and cross-validated stepwise LDA approach but without the need for having subject-dependent data. Therefore the described CPD method has a significant practical advantage over the traditional and widely used approach.

Successful ICA-based artifact reduction relies on suitable pre-processing. Here we systematically evaluate the effects of high-pass filtering at different frequencies. Offline analyses were based on event-related potential data from 21 participants performing a standard auditory oddball task and an automatic artifactual component classifier method (MARA). As a pre-processing step for ICA, high-pass filtering between 1-2 Hz consistently produced good results in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), single-trial classification accuracy and the percentage of 'near-dipolar' ICA components. Relative to no artifact reduction, ICA-based artifact removal significantly improved SNR and classification accuracy. This was not the case for a regression-based approach to remove EOG artifacts.

Auditory attention in childhood and adolescence: An event-related potential study of spatial selective attention to one of two simultaneous stories	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Adolescent; Children "auditory attention"; "Selective attention"; "dichotic listening"	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; DECISION-MAKING; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS	Auditory selective attention is a critical skill for goal-directed behavior, especially where noisy distractions may impede focusing attention. To better understand the developmental trajectory of auditory spatial selective attention in an acoustically complex environment, in the current study we measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) across five age groups: 3-5 years; 10 years; 13 years; 16 years; and young adults. Using a naturalistic dichotic listening paradigm, we characterized the ERP morphology for nonlinguistic and linguistic auditory probes embedded in attended and unattended stories. We documented robust maturational changes in auditory evoked potentials that were specific to the types of probes. Furthermore, we found a remarkable interplay between age and attention-modulation of auditory evoked potentials in terms of morphology and latency from the early years of childhood through young adulthood. The results are consistent with the view that attention can operate across age groups by modulating the amplitude of maturing auditory early-latency evoked potentials or by invoking later endogenous attention processes. Development of these processes is not uniform for probes with different acoustic properties within our acoustically dense speech-based dichotic listening task. In light of the developmental differences we demonstrate, researchers conducting future attention studies of children and adolescents should be wary of combining analyses across diverse ages.

Furthermore, clinical studies suggest that a subset of EEG biomarkers is associated with symptoms. This review addresses the relationship between EEG and behavior in preclinical models of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor hypofunction, as well as how these models can be used to screen therapies. Data from schizophrenia patients are juxtaposed with data from animal models, and EEG and behavioral data from mice with disruption of NMDA receptors in excitatory and/or inhibitory neurons are then compared to the pattern observed in schizophrenia. Also discussed are results following exposure to potential therapeutic agents, including GABA(B) agonists. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates that elevated resting gamma power is associated with deficits in social interactions. Consistent with elevated baseline noise, excitatory neurons from transgenic mice show increased intrinsic excitability in in vitro-slice patch-clamp studies across model systems. GABAB receptor agonists reduce this excitability, improve gamma-band responses, and reverse behavioral deficits in mice. Data suggest that baseline gamma power is associated with social function and GABAB agonists may be useful for schizophrenia. Translational EEG biomarkers reflect target engagement and can contribute to the design of more efficient drug trials, likely accelerating the development of new therapeutics for central nervous system disorders.

Utility of event-related potentials in predicting antidepressant treatment response: An iSPOT-D report	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Event-Related Potential (ERP); Major Depressive Disorder (MDD); Antidepressants; Treatment prediction	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; COMPLEX TONES; P300; EEG; VALIDATION; MECHANISMS; RATIONALE; ASYMMETRY; TASK	It is essential to improve antidepressant treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and one way this could be achieved is by reducing the number of treatment steps by employing biomarkers that can predict treatment outcome. This study investigated differences between MDD patients and healthy controls in the P3 and N1 component from the event-related potential (ERP) generated in a standard two-tone oddball paradigm. Furthermore, the P3 and N1 are investigated as predictors for treatment outcome to three different antidepressants. In the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) - a multicenter, international, randomized, prospective practical trial- 1008 MDD participants were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine-XR. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response and remission were established after eight weeks using the 17 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. P3 and N1 latencies and amplitudes were analyzed using a peak-picking approach and further replicated by using exact low resolution tomography (eLORETA). A reduced P3 was found in MDD patients compared to controls by a peak-picking analysis. This was validated in a temporal global field power analysis. Source density analysis revealed that the difference in cortical activity originated from the posterior cingulate and parahippocampal gyrus. Male non-responders to venlafaxine-XR had significantly smaller N1 amplitudes than responders. This was demonstrated by both analytical methods. Male non-responders to venlafaxine-XR had less activity originating from the left insular cortex. The observed results are discussed from a neural network viewpoint. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Happy, angry, disgust, fearful, sad, and neutral faces were displayed in pleasant, aversive or no odor control olfactory contexts while EEG was recorded to extract event-related potentials (ERPs). Results indicated that the expressive faces modulated the cerebral responses at occipito-parietal, central and central-parietal electrodes from around 100 ms and until 480 ms after face onset. The response was divided in different successive stages corresponding to different ERP components (P100, N170, P200 and N250 (EPN), and LPP). The olfactory contexts influenced the ERPs in response to facial expressions in two phases. First, regardless of their emotional content, the response to faces was enhanced by both odors compared with no odor approximately 160 ms after face-onset at several central, centro-parietal and left lateral electrodes. The topography of this effect clearly depended on the valence of odors. Then, a second phase occurred, but only in the aversive olfactory context, which modulated differentially the P200 at occipital sites (starting approximately 200 ms post-stimulus) by amplifying the differential response to expressions, especially between emotional neutrality and both happiness and disgust. Overall, the present study suggests that the olfactory context first elicits an undifferentiated effect around 160 ms after face onset, followed by a specific modulation at 200 ms induced by the aversive odor on neutral and affectively congruent/incongruent expressions.

Here we study how Internet users form fast website impression by investigating which evaluative dimension, i.e., usefulness and enjoyment, is automatically activated when people are required to rapidly evaluate website logos. To capture the transient processes in website impression formation, we have applied dense-array (128 and 256 channels) electroencephalography (EEG) to conduct experiments in two cultures (USA and Taiwan). The results of the EEG analysis showed that usefulness and enjoyment evaluations were consistently performed quickly (450-800 ms) in both cultural groups. More importantly, the results showed that enjoyment evaluation could be automatically performed. No clear evidence was found that usefulness evaluation was performed when usefulness evaluation goal was irrelevant. The finding suggests that people can form rapid website impression, and enjoyment is a critical component in the impression formation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The hypothesis was that the woman avoidance will produce a greater activation of primary somatosensory and limbic areas. The attachment styles dimensions avoidant-related will be associated with fronto-limbic brain intensity during the convergence of gaze. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded using a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net in 44 female subjects (age: 24 +/- 2years). Event-related potential (ERP) components and standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) were analyzed. Participants were administered the attachment style questionnaire before EEG task. A lower P350 latency was found in the fronto-central montage in response to woman avoidance. sLORETA analysis showed a greater intensity of limbic and primary somatosensory areas in response to woman avoidance compared to the others gaze interactions. In response to convergence gaze, the confidence attachment dimension was negatively correlated with the intensities of the right temporal and limbic areas, and the relationships as secondary attachment dimension were positively correlated with the intensities of the bilateral frontal areas and of the left parietal area.

According to possible accidents and disasters in the coal mine emergency scenario, researches miners' risk perception and reaction process of emergency decision-making in sudden emergencies. Study shows that the different emergency information warning degree leads to different negative emotions degree. Negative emotions generate decision-making related electrical N2 negative elements, besides the higher warning degree, the greater amplitude. Results show that when the underground coal mine workers expose in emergencies, with the stimulus of the emergency information there is the emergency decision-making reaction which is associated with the conflict of decision level.

Two dimensions of decision making that substantially affect choice are the objective perceptual properties of the stimulus (e.g., salience) and its subjective value. Here we measure EEGs in human subjects to relate their feedback-evoked EEG responses to estimates of prediction error given a neurally derived expected value for each trial. Unlike in traditional reinforcement learning paradigms, in our experiment the reward itself is not probabilistic; rather, it is a fixed value, which, when combined with the variable stimulus salience, yields uncertainty in the choice. We find that feedback-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically those classically termed feedback-related negativity, are modulated by both the reward level and stimulus salience. Using single-trial analysis of the EEG, we show stimulus-locked EEG components reflecting perceived stimulus salience can be combined with the level of reward to create an estimate of expected reward. This expected reward is used to form a prediction error that correlates with the trial-by-trial variability of the feedback ERPs for negative, but not positive, feedback. This suggests that the valence of prediction error is more important than the valence of the actual feedback, since only positive rewards were delivered in the experiment (no penalty or loss). Finally, we show that these subjectively defined prediction errors are informative of the riskiness of the subject's choice on the subsequent trial. In summary, our work shows that neural correlates of stimulus salience interact with value information to yield neural representations of subjective expected reward.

During reward anticipation, N1, P2 and P3 components were modulated by both prospective reward value and incentive type (monetary or social), suggesting distinctive allocation of attentional and motivational resources depending not only on whether rewards or non-rewards were cued, but also on the monetary and social nature of the prospective outcomes. In the delivery phase, P2, FRN and P3 components were also modulated by levels of reward value and incentive type, illustrating how distinctive affective and cognitive processes were attached to the different outcomes. Our findings imply that neural processing of both reward anticipation and delivery can be specific to incentive type, which might have implications for basic as well as translational research. These results are discussed in the light of previous electrophysiological and neuroimaging work using similar tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Combined EEG-fMRI has been shown to help to characterise brain networks involved in epileptic activity, as well as in different sensory, motor and cognitive functions. A good understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal is necessary to interpret fMRI maps, particularly when obtained in combination with EEG. We review the current understanding of electrophysiological-haemodynamic correlates, during different types of brain activity. We start by describing the basic mechanisms underlying EEG and BOLD signals and proceed by reviewing EEG-informed fMRI studies using fMRI to map specific EEG phenomena over the entire brain (EEG-fMRI mapping), or exploring a range of EEG-derived quantities to determine which best explain colocalised BOLD fluctuations (local EEG-fMRI coupling). While reviewing studies of different forms of brain activity (epileptic and nonepileptic spontaneous activity; cognitive, sensory and motor functions), a significant attention is given to epilepsy because the investigation of its haemodynamic correlates is the most common application of EEG-informed fMRI. Our review is focused on EEG-informed fMRI, an asymmetric approach of data integration. We give special attention to the invasiveness of electrophysiological measurements and the simultaneity of multimodal acquisitions because these methodological aspects determine the nature of the conclusions that can be drawn from EEG-informed fMRI studies. We emphasise the advantages of, and need for, simultaneous intracranial EEG-fMRI studies in humans, which recently became available and hold great potential to improve our understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of BOLD fluctuations.

Electrode subset selection methods for an EEG-based P300 brain-computer interface	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; event-related potentials; P300 speller; channel selection		Purpose: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based P300 speller is a type of brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG to allow a user to select characters without physical movement. In general, using fewer electrodes for such a system makes it easier to set up and less expensive. This study addresses the question of electrode selection for EEG-based P300 systems. Methods: Data from 13 subjects collected with a 16-electrode cap was analyzed. The optimal subsets of electrodes of sizes 1-15 were calculated for each subject and for the group as a whole. The methods of exhaustive search, forward selection, and backward elimination were then compared to each other and to these optimal subsets. Results: The results show that, while none of the methods consistently picked the best-performing electrode subsets, all methods were able to find small electrode subsets that provided acceptable accuracy both for individuals and for the whole group. The computationally intensive exhaustive search method provided no statistically significant increase in performance over the much quicker forward and backward selection methods. Conclusions: The forward and backward selection methods are preferred for electrode selection.

Impaired Facilitatory Mechanisms of Auditory Attention After Damage of the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; brain event-related potentials; EEG; frontal; lesion	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOWN SUPPRESSION DEFICIT; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; INHIBITION; LESIONS; HUMANS; INTERFERENCE	There is growing evidence that auditory selective attention operates via distinct facilitatory and inhibitory mechanisms enabling selective enhancement and suppression of sound processing, respectively. The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in the top-down control of selective attention. However, whether the LPFC controls facilitatory, inhibitory, or both attentional mechanisms is unclear. Facilitatory and inhibitory mechanisms were assessed, in patients with LPFC damage, by comparing event-related potentials (ERPs) to attended and ignored sounds with ERPs to these same sounds when attention was equally distributed to all sounds. In control subjects, we observed 2 late frontally distributed ERP components: a transient facilitatory component occurring from 150 to 250 ms after sound onset; and an inhibitory component onsetting at 250 ms. Only the facilitatory component was affected in patients with LPFC damage: this component was absent when attending to sounds delivered in the ear contralateral to the lesion, with the most prominent decreases observed over the damaged brain regions. These findings have 2 important implications: (i) they provide evidence for functionally distinct facilitatory and inhibitory mechanisms supporting late auditory selective attention; (ii) they show that the LPFC is involved in the control of the facilitatory mechanisms of auditory attention.

Nicotinic modulation of auditory evoked potential electroencephalography in a rodent neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Mismatch negativity; Sensory gating; MAM; Nicotine; alpha 7nAChR	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR AGONIST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PROOF-OF-CONCEPT; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SENSORY MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; CLOZAPINE; EVP-6124; ABT-107	Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that has been hypothesized to be linked to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in basic sensory processing including sensory gating deficits in P50 and mismatch negativity (MMN). Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists have been reported to attenuate these deficits. Gestational exposure of rats to methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at embryonic day 17 leads to developmental disruption of the limbic-cortical system. MAM exposed offspring show neuropathological and behavioral changes that have similarities with those seen in schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to assess whether N40 auditory sensory gating (the rodent form of P50 gating) and MMN deficits as measures of auditory evoked potential (AEP) electroencephalography (EEG) are present in MAM rats and whether nAChR agonists could attend the deficit. El 7 male MAM and sham rats were implanted with cortical electrodes at 2 months of age. EEG recordings evaluating N40 gating and MMN paradigms were done comparing effects of vehicle (saline), nicotine and the alpha 7 agonist ABT-107. Deficits were seen for MAM rats compared to sham animals in both N40 auditory sensory gating and MMN AEP recordings. There was a strong trend for N40 deficits to be attenuated by both nicotine (0.16 mg/kg i.p. base) and ABT-107 (1.0 mg/kg i.p. base). MMN deficits were significantly attenuated by ABT-107 but not by nicotine. These data support the MAM model as a useful tool for translating pharmacodynamic effects in clinical medicine studies of novel therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects categorized stimuli including (a) words of a frequent category, (b) words of an infrequent category (14%), and (c) pictures of the frequent category (novels; 14%). The P300 and novelty P3 were uncorrelated with the PDR and differed in their response to experimental manipulation. Therefore, although the three physiological responses often co-occur, they appear to each manifest a distinct function: The PDR may be more closely linked to aspects of behavioral responding than the event-related potentials. Within participants, P300 and PDR latencies accounted for unique portions of the reaction time variance, and amplitudes of all three responses were larger for stimuli recalled on a subsequent test, compared to not recalled. We discuss the possibility that all three responses reflect norepinephric input from the locus coeruleus.

Reaction-time based indirect measures, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), are less susceptible to such biases. Neuroscientific evidence shows that deception can evoke characteristic ERP differences. However, the cerebral processes involved in faking an IAT are still unknown. We randomly assigned 20 university students (15 females, 24.65 +/- 3.50 years of age) to a counterbalanced repeated-measurements design, requesting them to complete a Brief-IAT (BIAT) on attitudes toward doping without deception instruction, and with the instruction to fake positive and negative doping attitudes. Cerebral activity during BIAT completion was assessed using high-density EEG. Event-related potentials during faking revealed enhanced frontal and reduced occipital negativity, starting around 150 ms after stimulus presentation. Further, a decrease in the P300 and LPP components was observed. Source analyses showed enhanced activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus between 150 and 200 ms during faking, thought to reflect the suppression of automatic responses. Further, more activity was found for faking in the bilateral middle occipital gyri and the bilateral temporoparietal junction. Results indicate that faking reaction-time based tests alter brain processes from early stages of processing and reveal the cortical sources of the effects. Analyzing the EEG helps to uncover response patterns in indirect attitude tests and broadens our understanding of the neural processes involved in such faking. This knowledge might be useful for uncovering faking in socially sensitive contexts, where attitudes are likely to be concealed.

Although some progress has been made in our understanding of how humans infer hierarchical identity, the neuroanatomical basis for perceiving key social dimensions of others remains unexplored. Here, we combined event-related potentials and structural MRI to reveal the neuroanatomical substrates of early status recognition. Wedesigned a covertly simulated hierarchical setting in which participants performed a task either with a superior or with an inferior player. Participants showed higher amplitude in the N170 component when presented with a picture of a superior player compared with an inferior player. Crucially, the magnitude of this effect correlated with brain morphology of the posterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and caudate nucleus. We conclude that early recognition of social hierarchies relies on the structural properties of a network involved in the automatic recognition of social identity.

J	Youssofzadeh, V; Prasad, G; Wong-Lin, K				Youssofzadeh, Vahab; Prasad, Girijesh; Wong-Lin, KongFatt			On self-feedback connectivity in neural mass models applied to event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Fully self-feedback model; ERP; DCM; Mismatch negativity; Auditory oddball paradigm; Bayesian inversion	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG; NEURONS; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION; SYSTEMS; MEMORY	Neural mass models (NMMs) applied to neuroimaging data often do not emphasise intrinsic self-feedback within a neural population. However, based on mean-field theory, any population of coupled neurons is intrinsically endowed with effective self-coupling. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of three cortical NMMs with different self-feedbacks using a dynamic causal modelling approach. Specifically, we compare the classic Jansen and Rit (1995) model (no self-feedback), a modified model by Moran et al. (2007) (only inhibitory self-feedback), and our proposed model with inhibitory and excitatory self-feedbacks. Using bifurcation analysis, we show that single-unit Jansen-Rit model is less robust in generating oscillatory behaviour than the other two models. Next, under Bayesian inversion, we simulate single-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) within a mismatch negativity auditory oddball paradigm. We found fully self-feedback model (FSM) to provide the best fit to single-channel data. By analysing the posterior covariances of model parameters, we show that self-feedback connections are less sensitive to the generated evoked responses than the other model parameters, and hence can be treated analogously to "higher-order" parameter corrections of the original Jansen-Rit model. This is further supported in the more realistic multi-area case where FSM can replicate data better than JRM and MoM in the majority of subjects by capturing the finer features of the ERP data more accurately. Our work informs how NMMs with full self-feedback connectivity are not only more consistent with the underlying neurophysiology, but can also account for more complex features in ERP data.

Here, we examined the neural correlates of correct categorization of objects in scenes, using natural scenes which were equalized in color and spectral amplitude, and controlled in terms of spatial coherence. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to track the early stages of visual processing. Participants viewed degraded (phase-scrambled) versions of natural scenes and then categorized them as depicting animals or people. At an intermediate scrambling level, a negative-going occipitotemporal ERP modulation by categorization accuracy was observed, beginning approximately 150 ms after stimulus onset; at more degraded levels, no ERP modulation was observed. These results suggest that this early negative-going ERP modulation reflects processing of perceptual evidence which is predictive of later correct categorization, even when low-level differences in color, spectral amplitude, and spatial coherence are balanced or controlled.

Brain activity was recorded using EEG as participants read a series of stereotype-confirming or stereotype-violating behaviors performed by a target character. Compared to incremental theorists (who believe that intelligence is malleable), entity theorists (who believe that intelligence is fixed) displayed more pronounced N400 responses to stereotype-violating behaviors. In contrast, incremental theorists exhibited more pronounced N400 responses than entity theorists to stereotype-confirming behaviors. These results shed light on basic processes in Person Memory by suggesting that perceivers make a distinction at the neurocognitive level between stereotype violations versus implicit theory violations.

Here, we carry out key analyses of the P300 elicited by transient auditory and visual targets to examine its potential role as a decision variable' signal that accumulates evidence to a decision bound. Consistent with the latter, we find that the P300 reaches a stereotyped amplitude immediately prior to response execution and that its rate of rise scales with target detection difficulty and accounts for trial-to-trial variance in RT. Computational simulations of an accumulation-to-bound decision process faithfully captured P300 dynamics when its parameters were set by model fits to the RT distributions. Thus, where the dominant explanatory accounts have conceived of the P300 as a unitary neural event, our data reveal it to be a dynamically evolving neural signature of decision formation. These findings place the P300 at the heart of a mechanistically principled framework for understanding decision-making in both the typical and atypical human brain.

Each subject's WM capacity was estimated using a modified digit span task prior to participation in an N-back task that varied difficulty from 1- to 4-back. While performing the N-back task, subjects wore scalp electrodes that allowed measurement of both event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD). Those subjects classified as low WM were more affected by the higher cognitive demands (many more errors in the 4-back task and generally slower responses) than those classified as high WM. These behavioral differences between the two groups were also apparent in the neural markers. Specifically, low WM subjects, when compared with high WM subjects, produced smaller P300 amplitudes and theta ERS, as well as greater alpha ER]) at the most difficult level. Importantly, the observed differences in electrophysiological responses between the two groups were also observed at the lowest difficulty level, not just when the task challenged WM capacity. In addition, P300 amplitudes and alpha ERD responses were found to correlate with individual WM capacities independent of the task difficulty. These results suggest that there are qualitative neural differences among individuals with different WM capacities when approaching cognitive operations. Individuals with high WM capacities may make more efficient use of neural resources to keep their attention focused on the task-relevant information when performing cognitive tasks.

It is traditionally believed that both familiarity and recollection can support item recognition, whereas only recollection can support associative recognition. Here, using a standard associative recognition task, we examined whether associative retrieval of unitized associations involved differential patterns of familiarity and recollection processes relative to non-unitized associations. The extent of engagement of familiarity and recollection processes during associative retrieval was estimated by using event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty participants studied compound words and unrelated word pairs during encoding. Subsequently, they were asked to decide whether a presented word pair was intact rearranged, or a new pair while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. ERP results showed that compound words evoked a significant early frontal old/new effect (associated with familiarity) between ERPs to intact and rearranged word pairs, whereas this effect disappeared for the unrelated word pairs. In addition, the left parietal old/new effect (associated with recollection) between ERPs to intact and rearranged word pairs was greater for compounds than for unrelated word pairs. These findings suggest that unitization enhances the contribution of both familiarity and recollection processes to associative recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrophysiological evidence for a specific neural correlate of musical violation expectation in primary-school children	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Musical expectation violation; ERP; Children; Pre-motor; Working memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PROCESSING MUSIC; BRAIN RESPONSES; LANGUAGE; EEG; SYNTAX; ERP; PERCEPTION; EXPERTISE; COMPONENTS	The majority of studies on music processing in children used simple musical stimuli. Here, primary schoolchildren judged the appropriateness of musical closure in expressive polyphone music, while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Stimuli ended either regularly or contained refined in-key harmonic transgressions at closure. The children discriminated the transgressions well above chance. Regular and transgressed endings evoked opposite scalp voltage configurations peaking around 400 ms after stimulus onset with bilateral frontal negativity for regular and centro-posterior negativity (CPN) for transgressed endings. A positive correlation could be established between strength of the CPN response and rater sensitivity (d-prime). We also investigated whether the capacity to discriminate the transgressions was supported by auditory domain specific or general cognitive mechanisms, and found that working memory capacity predicted transgression discrimination. Latency and distribution of the CPN are reminiscent of the N400, typically observed in response to semantic incongruities in language. Therefore our observation is intriguing, as the CPN occurred here within an intra-musical context, without any symbols referring to the external world. Moreover, the harmonic in-key transgressions that we implemented may be considered syntactical as they transgress structural rules. Such structural incongruities in music are typically followed by an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) and an N5, but not so here. Putative contributive sources of the CPN were localized in left pre-motor, mid-posterior cingulate and superior parietal regions of the brain that can be linked to integration processing. These results suggest that, at least in children, processing of syntax and meaning may coincide in complex intra-musical contexts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study investigated central markers of processing body stimuli by means of event-related potentials in BN. EEG was recorded from 20 women with BN and 20 matched healthy controls while watching and evaluating underweight, normal and overweight female body pictures. Bulimics evaluated underweight bodies as less unpleasant and overweight bodies as bigger and more arousing. A higher P2 to overweight stimuli occurred in BN only. In contrast to controls, no N2 increase to underweight bodies was observed in BN. P3 was modulated by stimulus category only in healthy controls; late slow waves to underweight bodies were more pronounced in both groups. P2 amplitudes to overweight stimuli were correlated with drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. We present novel support for altered perceptual and cognitive-affective processing of body images in BN on the subjective and electrophysiological level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG Differences during the Preparation of a Reach-and-Touch Task	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			HAND	The natural control of neuroprostheses is currently a challenge in both rehabilitation engineering and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) research. One of the recurrent problems is to know exactly when to activate such devices. For the execution of the most common activities of daily living, these devices only need to be active when in the presence of a goal. Therefore, we believe that the distinction between the planning of goal-directed and aimless movements, using non-invasive recordings, can be useful for the implementation of a simple and effective activation method for these devices. We investigated whether those differences are detectable during a reach-and-touch task, using electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potentials and oscillatory activity changes were studied. Our results show that there are statistically significant differences between both types of movement. Combining this information with movement decoding would allow a natural control strategy for BCIs, exclusively relying on the cognitive processes behind movement preparation and execution.

J	Jessen, S; Grossmann, T				Jessen, Sarah; Grossmann, Tobias			Neural signatures of conscious and unconscious emotional face processing in human infants	CORTEX			English	Article						Consciousness; EEG; Emotion perception; Human infants; Subliminal processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; FEARFUL FACES; EYE GAZE; 1ST YEAR; AMYGDALA; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION	Human adults can process emotional information both with and without conscious awareness, and it has been suggested that the two processes rely on partly distinct brain mechanisms. However, the developmental origins of these brain processes are unknown. In the present event-related brain potential (ERP) study, we examined the brain responses of 7-month-old infants in response to subliminally (50 and 100 msec) and supraliminally (500 msec) presented happy and fearful facial expressions. Our results revealed that infants' brain responses (Pb and Nc) over central electrodes distinguished between emotions irrespective of stimulus duration, whereas the discrimination between emotions at occipital electrodes (N290 and P400) only occurred when faces were presented supraliminally (above threshold). This suggests that early in development the human brain not only discriminates between happy and fearful facial expressions irrespective of conscious perception, but also that, similar to adults, supraliminal and subliminal emotion processing relies on distinct neural processes. Our data further suggest that the processing of emotional facial expressions differs across infants depending on their behaviorally shown perceptual sensitivity. The current ERP findings suggest that distinct brain processes underpinning conscious and unconscious emotion perception emerge early in ontogeny and can therefore be seen as a key feature of human social functioning.

While this preview benefit is established in behavior, its brain-electric correlates have only recently been investigated. Using fixation-related potentials, an attenuation of the occipitotemporal N1 component for words that were parafoveally visible during preceding fixations has been demonstrated. In contrast, another study, using an RSVP paradigm with parafoveal flanker words, observed no such general preview benefit in ERPs, but instead reported N400 effects triggered by semantically incongruous parafoveal words. To follow up on these discrepant findings and to extend them to a nonalphabetic writing system, we conducted two ERP experiments with Chinese readers using the RSVP-with-flankers paradigm and rigorous fixation control via eye tracking. We replicate robust parafoveal N400 semantic congruency effects in Chinese participants. Additionally, we found that, once a word was directly looked at, words after a valid preview elicited a smaller N1 and a weaker N400 than those after an invalid preview. Results underline the importance of considering parafoveal vision in ERP studies on reading.

However, the neural oscillations underlying occurrence of the interference in different levels have not been understood well. Here, we reveal such a neural oscillation modulation by combining a 4:2 mapping design (two targets are mapped into one response key) with a practice paradigm (pretest, practice, and posttest) when healthy human participants were performing a novel color word flanker task. Response time (RI) results revealed constant stimulus conflict (SC, stimulus incongruent minus congruent, SI-CO) but increased response conflict (RC, response incongruent minus stimulus incongruent, RI-SI) with practice. Event-related potential (ERP) results demonstrated stable P3 amplitude differences for the SI-CO in the centro-parietal region across practice, which may reflect maintenance of the stimulus processing: and significantly larger P3 amplitudes in the same region for the RI relative to SI trial type in posttest, which may reflect inhibition of the distraction response. Further, neural oscillatory results showed that with practice, the lower alpha band in the frontal region and the upper alpha band in the occipital-parietal region distinguished between stimulus- and response-conflicts, respectively, suggesting that practice reduces the alertness (sensitiveness) of the brain to conflict occurrence, and enhances stimulus response associations.

As P3a is reduced at initial stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), our objective was to assess P3a as a possible marker of PD duration and severity. Methods: Fifty-five patients were analyzed, 28 of which were at Hoehn and Yahr severity stage 1; 14 at stage 2; and 13 at stage 3. Seventeen patients were free of antiparkinsonian medication. PD duration was defined as the number of years between the onset of motor symptoms and the date of this study. Twenty-four healthy subjects were included as controls. An involuntary attention paradigm was administered while a digital EEG was obtained. Results: The P3a amplitude was significantly lower in all PD groups compared to the control group (F(3,75) = 5.10, p = 0.003), especially for stages 2 (p = 0.017) and 3 (p = 0.008). A regression analysis showed that the disease duration predicted inversely the P3a (Fz channel amplitude: Coefficient = -0.148, p = 0.006; Frontocentral amplitude: Coefficient = -0.125, p = 0.003) after controlling for demographic and clinical variables, medication, general cognitive state, and depression. Conclusions: This is the first study reporting P3a sensibility to PD duration and severity. Significance: This ERP could represent a reliable biomarker of the disease progression.

The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to characterize the temporal dynamics of this interaction in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task that created an attentional blink (AB), that is, a profound deficit in detecting or identifying the second of two visual targets embedded in an RSVP stream. When a sound preceded the second target, T2, by 250 ms or was played simultaneously with T2, T2 identification accuracy increased to a comparable degree. Sound-related modulations of the visual response to T2 emerged from around 140 ms when the sound preceded T2, and from around 100 ms when the sound was played simultaneously with T2. Timing and topography of this earliest modulation indicated that it is not related to early sensory areas, but suggest an attentional filter mechanism. Subsequent modulations are compatible with an improvement of early visual processing of T2 and of processes related to target selection both when the sound precedes and when it coincides with T2. For the latter condition our results also indicated processes related to a convergence of stimulus-driven and goal-directed attention. We also observed some overlap between neural correlates of sound-related modulations of the visual response and of correct vs. incorrect performance. Thus, external task manipulations and internal factors contributing to performance in the AB may rely on overlapping though not identical mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Studying cognitive attention mechanisms during walking from EEG signals	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2015): BIG DATA ANALYTICS FOR HUMAN-CENTRIC SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 09-12, 2015	City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, K C Wong Fdn	City Univ Hong Kong	Cognitive Mechanisms; Electroencephalography; Brain-Machine Interface; Attention Levels; Obstacle Appearance		On this work several studies related to the analysis of electroencephalographical signals to evaluate the cognitive mechanisms during human gait are compiled. This research is performed in the framework of an European project (BioMot project) oriented to the development of a lower limb exoskeleton controlled by signals from physiological and kinematic sources. The project includes the study of the cognitive mechanisms and volitional intentions of the exoskeleton wearer as well as other physical information provided from other sources. This paper is oriented on those studies related with the users' cognitive mechanisms during gait. The phenomena evaluated are the changes in the brain waves depending on the attention that a user is paying in the gait and the event-related potential evoked when an obstacle suddenly appear during walking. Initial experiments with healthy users provide encouraging results, obtaining an average value of 65,25% in the classification of four levels of attention and a potential related with the alertness state experienced by a user when an obstacle appears is characterized.

Comparisons of grand means, e.g. between conditions, are then often performed by subtraction. These operations, and their statistical evaluation with parametric tests such as anova, tacitly rely on the assumption that the data follow the additive model, have a normal distribution, and have a homogeneous variance. This may be true for single trials, but these conditions are rarely met when ERFs/ERPs are compared between subjects, meaning that the additive model is seldom the correct model for computing grand mean waveforms. Here, we summarize some of our recent work and present new evidence, from auditory-evoked MEG and EEG results, that the non-normal distributions and the heteroscedasticity observed instead result because ERFs/ERPs follow a mixed model with additive and multiplicative components. For peak amplitudes, such as the auditory M100 and N100, the multiplicative component dominates. These findings emphasize that the common practice of simply subtracting arithmetic means of auditory-evoked ERFs or ERPs is problematic without prior adequate transformation of the data. Application of the area sinus hyperbolicus (asinh) transform to data following the mixed model transforms them into the requested additive model with its normal distribution and homogeneous variance. We therefore advise checking the data for compliance with the additive model and using the asinh transform if required.

Enhanced Attention Capture by Emotional Stimuli in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						attention; response inhibition; mTBI; emotion; EEG	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HEAD-INJURY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; MODERATE; COMPETE; ERP	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may be associated with compromised executive functioning and altered emotional reactivity. Despite frequent affective and cognitive symptoms in mTBI, objective evidence for brain dysfunction is often lacking. Previously we have reported compromised performance in symptomatic mTBI patients in an executive reaction time (RT) test, a computer-based RT test engaging several executive functions simultaneously. Here, we investigated the cognitive control processes in mTBI in context of threat-related stimuli. We used behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate attentional capture by task-relevant and task-irrelevant emotional stimuli during a Go-NoGo task requiring cognitive control. We also assessed subjective cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms with questionnaires. Twenty-seven subjects with previous mTBI and 17 controls with previous ankle injury participated in the study over 9 months post-injury. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while patients performed a modified executive RT-test. N2-P3 ERP component was used as a general measure of allocated attentional and executive processing resources. Although at the time of the testing, the mTBI and the control groups did not differ in symptom endorsement, mTBI patients reported having had more emotional symptoms overall since the injury than controls. The overall RT-test performance levels did not differ between groups. However, when threat-related emotional stimuli were used as Go-signals, the mTBI group was faster than the control group. In comparison to neutral stimuli, threat-related stimuli were associated with increased N2-P3 amplitude in all conditions. This threat-related enhancement of the N2-P3 complex was greater in mTBI patients than in controls in response to Go signals and NoGo signals, independent of relevance. We conclude that mTBI may be associated with enhanced attentional and executive resource allocation to threat-related stimuli. Along with behavioral evidence for enhanced attention allocation to threat stimuli, increased brain responses to threat were observed in mTBI. Enhanced attention capture by threat-related emotional stimuli may reflect inefficient top-down control of bottom-up influences of emotion, and might contribute to affective symptoms in mTBI.

Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 +/- 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time direct-directed transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 +/- 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 +/- 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERP-based classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 +/- 0.16) but significantly better for LCMV (0.82 +/- 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from high-density wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces. The pipelines are made freely available in the open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes.

Tic related local field potentials in the thalamus and the effect of deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome: Report of three cases	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; Deep brain stimulation; Thalamus; Local field potentials; Tics	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MOTOR TICS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; PROJECTION; NETWORKS; COMPLEX; SURGERY	Objective: Three patients with intractable Tourette syndrome (TS) underwent thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS). To investigate the role of thalamic electrical activity in tic generation, local field potentials (LFP), EEG and EMG simultaneously were recorded. Methods: Event related potentials and event related spectral perturbations of EEG and LFP, event related cross-coherences between EEG/LFP and LFP/LFP were analyzed. As time locking events, the tic onsets were used. Spontaneous tics were compared to voluntary tic mimicking. The effect of tic suppression and DBS on thalamic LFPs was evaluated. Results: All three patients showed time-locked and prior to onset of spontaneous motor tics thalamic synchronization and thalamo-cortical cross-coherence. Also in three patients, not time-locked to motor tics, increased intra-thalamic coherences in the 1-8 Hz frequency band were found. In one patient it was demonstrated that voluntary mimicked tics were preceded by premotor cortical and thalamic potentials. In this patient unilateral thalamic DBS contralaterally decreased the background thalamic activity. Conclusions: The present study in three cases with TS shows that spontaneous tics in TS are preceded by repetitive coherent thalamo-cortical discharges, indicating that preceding a tic the basal ganglia circuits are "charged up", ultimately leading to a motor tic. Significance: Thalamic LFP recording may lead to more insight in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in TS. (c) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

One such fundamental relationship is that between axon diameter and the axon's conduction velocity (ACV). Measurement of these neuronal properties, however, requires invasive procedures that preclude direct elucidation of this relationship in vivo. Here we demonstrate that diffusion-based MRI is sensitive to the fine microstructural elements of brain wiring and can be used to quantify axon diameter in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate the in vivo correlation between the diameter of an axon and its conduction velocity in the human brain. Using AxCaliber, a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables us to estimate in vivo axon diameter distribution (ADD) and by measuring the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) by electroencephalography, we found significant linear correlation, across a cohort of subjects, between brain microstructure morphology (ADD) and its physiology (ACV) in the tactile and visual sensory domains. The ability to make a quantitative assessment of a fundamental physiological property in the human brain from in vivo measurements of ADD may shed new light on neurological processes occurring in neuroplasticity as well as in neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

In the present study we investigated event-related potentials of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded during observation of both alterations of the action content (obtained by violating the semantic components of an action, e.g. making coffee with cola) and alterations of the action structure (obtained by inverting the order of two temporally adjacent pictures of sequences depicting daily life actions) interfering with the normal flow of the motor acts that compose an action. Action content alterations elicited a bilateral posterior distributed EEG negativity, peaking at around 400 ms after stimulus onset similar to the ERPs evoked by semantic violations in language studies. Alteration of the action structure elicited an early left anterior negativity followed by a late left anterior positivity, which closely resembles the ERP pattern found in language syntax violation studies. Our results suggest a functional dissociation between the processing of action content and structure, reminiscent of a similar dissociation found in the language or music domains. Importantly, this study provides further support to the hypothesis that some basic mechanisms, such as the rule-based structuring of sequential events, are shared between different cognitive domains.

Explicit knowledge in the serial response-time task has precursors in EEG potentials already at task onset	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Explicit knowledge; Sensorimotor learning; SRTT; P300; P3b	EVENT SEQUENCES; IMPLICIT; MEMORY; DISSOCIATION; ERP; RELEVANCE; SLEEP	Whether, and how, explicit knowledge about some regularity arises from implicit sensorimotor learning by practice has been a matter of long-standing debate. Previously, we had found in the number reduction task that participants who will acquire explicit knowledge differ from other participants in their event-related potentials (ERPs) already at task onset. In the present study, we investigated such ERP precursors and correlates both of explicit and of sensorimotor knowledge (response speeding) about the regular sequence in a large sample of participants (n approximate to 100) in the serial response time task. Already when perceiving random sequences at task onset, those participants had largest P3 amplitudes who would later gain explicit knowledge but whose responses were not speeded. Later in the task, sensorimotor knowledge was reflected in increased fronto-central negativity in irregular blocks, overlapping the early part of P3, and participants with later explicit knowledge generally had increased P3 amplitudes. These results support the notion that explicit knowledge about covert regularities is acquired in two ways: on the one hand by a particular subgroup of participants possibly independently of sequence-specific response speeding, and on the other hand by transforming such sensorimotor to explicit knowledge through practice.

METHODS: Specialized software called Brain Activation Sequences was built according to our team member specifications (M.S.). The software utilizes event related potentials recorded during cognitive/emotion processing in participants (healthy controls, neurological patients and psychiatric patients) to calculate the sequence of brain areas using nonlinear and linear algorithms. RESULTS: Results show significant differences in activation patterns between patients and healthy controls as well as significant similarities within the groups of patients and controls in both performed testing experiments.

Interactions between the perception of age and ethnicity in faces: an event-related potential study	COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						face perception; interference; age; ethnicity; Garner	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL IDENTITY; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; CONFIGURAL INFORMATION; UNFAMILIAR FACES; PERCEIVING AGE; ERP EVIDENCE; EXPRESSION; RACE; EMOTION	Face perception models propose that different facial attributes are processed by anatomically distinct neural pathways that partially overlap. Whether these attributes interact functionally is an open question. Our goal was to determine if there are interactions between age and ethnicity processing and, if so, at what temporal epoch these interactions are evident. We monitored event-related potentials on electroencephalography while subjects categorized faces by age or ethnicity in two conditions: a baseline in which the other of these two properties not being categorized was held constant and an interference condition in which it also varied, as modelled after the Garner interference paradigm. We found that, when participants were categorizing faces by age, variations in ethnicity increased the amplitude of the right face-selective N170 component. When subjects were categorizing faces by ethnicity, variations in age did not alter the N170. We concluded that there is an asymmetric pattern of influence between age and ethnicity on early face-specific stages of visual processing, which has parallels with behavioural evidence of asymmetric interactions between identity and expression processing of faces.

In this paper we compare different approaches for classification of single-trials Event-Related Potential (ERP) on two subjects playing a collaborative BCI game. The minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier in a Riemannian framework is extended to use the diversity of the inter-subjects spatio-temporal statistics (MDM-hyper) or to merge multiple classifiers (MDM-multi). We show that both these classifiers outperform significantly the mean performance of the two users and analogous classifiers based on the step-wise linear discriminant analysis. More importantly, the MDM-multi outperforms the performance of the best player within the pair.

Control or non-control state: that is the question! An asynchronous visual P300-based BCI approach	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; BCI; P300; asynchronous; control state	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; P300; CLASSIFICATION; EEG	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related potentials (ERP) were proven to be a reliable synchronous communication method. For everyday life situations, however, this synchronous mode is impractical because the system will deliver a selection even if the user is not paying attention to the stimulation. So far, research into attention-aware visual ERP-BCIs (i.e., asynchronous ERP-BCIs) has led to variable success. In this study, we investigate new approaches for detection of user engagement. Approach. Classifier output and frequency-domain features of electroencephalogram signals as well as the hybridization of them were used to detect the user' s state. We tested their capabilities for state detection in different control scenarios on offline data from 21 healthy volunteers. Main results. The hybridization of classifier output and frequency-domain features outperformed the results of the single methods, and allowed building an asynchronous P300-based BCI with an average correct state detection accuracy of more than 95%. Significance. Our results show that all introduced approaches for state detection in an asynchronous P300-based BCI can effectively avoid involuntary selections, and that the hybrid method is the most effective approach.

EFFECTS OF FACIAL COLOR ON THE SUBLIMINAL PROCESSING OF FEARFUL FACES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; facial expression; facial color; subliminal processing; fearful face	AMYGDALA; ERP; EXPRESSIONS; PERCEPTION; BLOOD; ANGER; N170; FAMILIARITY; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Recent studies have suggested that both configural information, such as face shape, and surface information is important for face perception. In particular, facial color is sufficiently suggestive of emotional states, as in the phrases: "flushed with anger" and "pale with fear." However, few studies have examined the relationship between facial color and emotional expression. On the other hand, event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that emotional expressions, such as fear, are processed unconsciously. In this study, we examined how facial color modulated the supraliminal and subliminal processing of fearful faces. We recorded electroencephalograms while participants performed a facial emotion identification task involving masked target faces exhibiting facial expressions (fearful or neutral) and colors (natural or bluish). The results indicated that there was a significant interaction between facial expression and color for the latency of the N170 component. Subsequent analyses revealed that the bluish-colored faces increased the latency effect of facial expressions compared to the natural-colored faces, indicating that the bluish color modulated the processing of fearful expressions. We conclude that the unconscious processing of fearful faces is affected by facial color. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stimulus-dependent spiking relationships with the EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; local field potential; spiking activity	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; IMPLANTED SOURCES; GAMMA-BAND; NEURONAL CORRELATION; LOCALIZATION ACCURACY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TEMPORAL SCALES; MACAQUE; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION	The development and refinement of noninvasive techniques for imaging neural activity is of paramount importance for human neuroscience. Currently, the most accessible and popular technique is electroencephalography (EEG). However, nearly all of what we know about the neural events that underlie EEG signals is based on inference, because of the dearth of studies that have simultaneously paired EEG recordings with direct recordings of single neurons. From the perspective of electrophysiologists there is growing interest in understanding how spiking activity coordinates with large-scale cortical networks. Evidence from recordings at both scales highlights that sensory neurons operate in very distinct states during spontaneous and visually evoked activity, which appear to form extremes in a continuum of coordination in neural networks. We hypothesized that individual neurons have idiosyncratic relationships to large-scale network activity indexed by EEG signals, owing to the neurons' distinct computational roles within the local circuitry. We tested this by recording neuronal populations in visual area V4 of rhesus macaques while we simultaneously recorded EEG. We found substantial heterogeneity in the timing and strength of spike-EEG relationships and that these relationships became more diverse during visual stimulation compared with the spontaneous state. The visual stimulus apparently shifts V4 neurons from a state in which they are relatively uniformly embedded in large-scale network activity to a state in which their distinct roles within the local population are more prominent, suggesting that the specific way in which individual neurons relate to EEG signals may hold clues regarding their computational roles.

However, it is as yet unknown whether anticipation modulates neural activity in the later recognition of emotional pictures. To address this issue, participants in the present study were asked to view emotional (negative or neutral) pictures. The picture was preceded by a cue which indicated the emotional content of the picture in half of the trials (the anticipated condition) and without any cues in the other half (the unanticipated condition). Subsequently, participants had to perform an unexpected old/new recognition task in which old and novel pictures were presented without any preceding cues. Electroencephalography data was recorded during the recognition phase. Event-related potential results showed that for negative pictures, P2 and P3 amplitudes were larger in the anticipated as compared to the unanticipated condition; whereas this anticipation effect was not shown for neutral pictures. The present findings suggest that anticipation of negative pictures may enhance neural activity in their later recognition.

Reducing Offline BCI Calibration Effort Using Weighted Adaptation Regularization with Source Domain Selection	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2015): BIG DATA ANALYTICS FOR HUMAN-CENTRIC SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 09-12, 2015	City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, K C Wong Fdn	City Univ Hong Kong	Brain-computer interface (BCI); EEG; event-related potentials (ERP); domain adaptation; transfer learning	FRAMEWORK	Single-trial classification of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) is needed in many real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. However, because of individual differences, the classifier needs to be calibrated by using some labeled subject-specific training samples, which may be inconvenient to obtain. In this paper we propose a weighted adaptation regularization (wAR) approach for offline BCI calibration, which uses data from other subjects to reduce the amount of labeled data required in offline single-trial classification of ERPs. Our proposed model explicitly handles class-imbalance problems which are common in many real-world BCI applications. wAR can improve the classification performance, given the same number of labeled subject-specific training samples; or, equivalently, it can reduce the number of labeled subject-specific training samples, given a desired classification accuracy. To reduce the computational cost of wAR, we also propose a source domain selection (SDS) approach. Our experiments show that wARSDS can achieve comparable performance with wAR but is much less computationally intensive. We expect wARSDS to find broad applications in offline BCI calibration.

One of the mental states that are currently under focus is mental workload. The level of workload can be estimated from electroencephalographic activity (EEG) and markers derived from this signal. In active BCI applications, a well-known neurophysiological marker, the event-related potential (ERP), is commonly enhanced using a spatial filtering step. In this study, we evaluated how a spatial filtering method such as the xDAWN algorithm could improve mental workload classification performance. Twenty participants performed a Sternberg memory task for 18 minutes with pseudorandomized trials of low vs. high workload (2/6 digits to memorize). Three signal processing chains were compared on their performance to estimate mental workload from the single-trial ERPs of the test item (i.e. present/absent in the memorized list). All 3 included an FLDA classifier with a shrinkage covariance estimation and a 10-fold cross-validation. One chain used the ERPs of a relevant electrode for workload estimation (Cz) and the 2 others used the ERPs of the 32 electrodes and an xDAWN spatial filtering step with either 1 or 2 virtual electrodes kept for classification. Statistical analyses revealed that spatial filtering significantly improved mental workload estimation, with up to 98% of correct classification using the xDAWN algorithm and 2 virtual electrodes.

Brain Network activation as a Novel Biomarker for the Return-to-play pathway Following sport-Related Brain Injury	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						brain network activation; EEG; concussion; hockey; return to play	CONCUSSION; MATURATION; DIAGNOSIS; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; CHILDREN	Children and adolescent athletes are at a higher risk for concussion than adults, and also experience longer recovery times and increased associated symptoms. It has also recently been demonstrated that multiple, seemingly mild concussions may result in exacerbated and prolonged neurological deficits. Objective assessments and return-to-play criteria are needed to reduce risk and morbidity associated with concussive events in these populations. Recent research has pushed to study the use of electroencephalography as an objective measure of brain injury. In the present case study, we present a novel approach that examines event-related potentials via a brain network activation (BNA) analysis as a biomarker of concussion and recovery. Specifically, changes in BNA scores, as indexed through this approach, offer a potential indicator of neurological health as the BNA assessment qualitatively and quantitatively indexes the network dynamics associated with brain injury. Objective tools, such as these support accurate and efficient assessment of brain injury and may offer a useful step in categorizing the temporal and spatial changes in brain activity following concussive blows, as well as the functional connectivity of brain networks, associated with concussion.

Early and late effects of objecthood and spatial frequency on event-related potentials and gamma band activity	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Oscillations; Gamma band; Object recognition	TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; TIME-COURSE; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG; RESPONSES; FACE; OSCILLATIONS; FEATURES	Background: The visual system may process spatial frequency information in a low-to-high, coarse-to-fine sequence. In particular, low and high spatial frequency information may be processed via different pathways during object recognition, with LSF information projected rapidly to frontal areas and HSF processed later in visual ventral areas. In an electroencephalographic study, we examined the time course of information processing for images filtered to contain different ranges of spatial frequencies. Participants viewed either high spatial frequency (HSF), low spatial frequency (LSF), or unfiltered, broadband (BB) images of objects or non-object textures, classifying them as showing either man-made or natural objects, or non-objects. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and evoked and total gamma band activity (eGBA and tGBA) recorded using the electroencephalogram were compared for object and non-object images across the different spatial frequency ranges. Results: The visual P1 showed independent modulations by object and spatial frequency, while for the N1 these factors interacted. The P1 showed more positive amplitudes for objects than non-objects, and more positive amplitudes for BB than for HSF images, which in turn evoked more positive amplitudes than LSF images. The peak-to-peak N1 showed that the N1 was much reduced for BB non-objects relative to all other images, while HSF and LSF non-objects still elicited as negative an N1 as objects. In contrast, eGBA was influenced by spatial frequency and not objecthood, while tGBA showed a stronger response to objects than non-objects. Conclusions: Different pathways are involved in the processing of low and high spatial frequencies during object recognition, as reflected in interactions between objecthood and spatial frequency in the visual N1 component. Total gamma band seems to be related to a late, probably high-level representational process.

Delay Differential Analysis of Electroencephalographic Data	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							BISPECTRUM ESTIMATION; EEG; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS	We propose a time-domain approach to detect frequencies, frequency couplings, and phases using nonlinear correlation functions. For frequency analysis, this approach is a multivariate extension of discrete Fourier transform, and for higher-order spectra, it is a linear and multivariate alternative to multidimensional fast Fourier transform of multidimensional correlations. This method can be applied to short and sparse time series and can be extended to cross-trial and cross-channel spectra (CTS) for electroencephalography data where multiple short data segments from multiple trials of the same experiment are available. There are two versions of CTS. The first one assumes some phase coherency across the trials, while the second one is independent of phase coherency. We demonstrate that the phase-dependent version is more consistent with event-related spectral perturbation analysis and traditional Morlet wavelet analysis. We show that CTS can be applied to short data windows and yields higher temporal resolution than traditional Morlet wavelet analysis. Furthermore, the CTS can be used to reconstruct the event-related potential using all linear components of the CTS.

Electrocortical evidence of increased post-reappraisal neural reactivity and its link to depressive symptoms	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reappraisal; EEG/ERP; LPP; alpha, depression	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; EMOTION REGULATION; COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES; ALPHA; MEMORY; SELF; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; STRATEGIES; COSTS	Few studies have examined whether effortful emotion regulation has a protracted impact on subsequent affective appraisal, and even fewer have investigated this effect on a trial-by-trial basis. In this study, we hypothesized that engaging cognitive resources via reappraisal during a trial would result in a subsequent period of increased reactivity on the next trial, as quantified using event-related potentials and oscillations. Forty-eight healthy individuals passively viewed unpleasant and neutral pictures followed by an auditory instruction to either continue viewing normally or reappraise emotional response to pictures. Viewing unpleasant pictures yielded increased late positive potential (LPP) and decreased posterior alpha (8-13 Hz) compared with neutral pictures. A similar pattern was observed on trials that immediately 'followed' emotion regulation instructions. Moreover, individuals with increased self-reported depressive symptoms showed greater LPP and alpha modulation following emotion regulation, suggesting that these responses may relate to compromised emotion regulation ability. This study demonstrates that cognitive reappraisal induces subsequent heightened reactivity that may reflect transient resource depletion, and these effects are more pronounced among those with increased depressive symptoms. Interventions that focus on emotion regulation might use these electrocortical markers to track changes in regulatory efficacy.

This hypothesis posits simply that neural activities code and compute Bayesian probabilities. Here, we introduce an urn-ball paradigmto relate event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P300 wave to Bayesian inference. Bayesian model comparison is conducted to compare various models in terms of their ability to explain trial-by-trial variation in ERP responses at different points in time and over different regions of the scalp. Specifically, we are interested in dissociating specific ERP responses in terms of Bayesian updating and predictive surprise. Bayesian updating refers to changes in probability distributions given new observations, while predictive surprise equals the surprise about observations under current probability distributions. Components of the late positive complex (P3a, P3b, Slow Wave) provide dissociable measures of Bayesian updating and predictive surprise. Specifically, the updating of beliefs about hidden states yields the best fit for the anteriorly distributed P3a, whereas the updating of predictions of observations accounts best for the posteriorly distributed Slow Wave. In addition, parietally distributed P3b responses are best fit by predictive surprise. These results indicate that the three components of the late positive complex reflect distinct neural computations. As such they are consistent with the Bayesian brain hypothesis, but these neural computations seem to be subject to nonlinear probability weighting. We integrate these findings with the free-energy principle that instantiates the Bayesian brain hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

THE EFFECTS OF FACIAL COLOR AND INVERSION ON THE N170 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL (ERP) COMPONENT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						face processing; facial color; face inversion; electroencephalogram; N170; SVM	FACE INVERSION; CONTRAST REVERSAL; INVERTED FACES; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; SHAPE; SENSITIVITY; IDENTITY; STIMULI; NEURONS	Faces are important for social interaction because much can be perceived from facial details, including a person's race, age, and mood. Recent studies have shown that both configural (e.g. face shape and inversion) and surface information (e.g. surface color and reflectance properties) are important for face perception. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of facial color and inverted face properties on event-related potential (ERP) responses, particularly the N170 component. Stimuli consisted of natural and bluish-colored faces. Faces were presented in both upright and upside down orientations. An ANOVA was used to analyze N170 amplitudes and verify the effects of the main independent variables. Analysis of N170 amplitude revealed the significant interactions between stimulus orientation and color. Subsequent analysis indicated that N170 was larger for bluish-colored faces than natural-colored faces, and N170 to natural-colored faces was larger in response to inverted stimulus as compared to upright stimulus. Additionally, a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) investigated face-processing dynamics without any prior assumptions. Results distinguished, above chance, both facial color and orientation from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Decoding performance for color classification of inverted faces was significantly diminished as compared to an upright orientation. This suggests that processing orientation is predominant over facial color. Taken together, the present findings elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of orientation and color processing during face processing. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thirty-three children participated in the study and were randomly assigned to two groups at primary school entry, matched for age, gender and IQ. All children went through the same curriculum except that the abacus group received a 2-h/per week AMC training, while the control group did traditional numerical practice for a similar amount of time. After a 2-year training, they were tested with a numerical Stroop task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and event related potential (ERP) recording techniques were used to monitor the temporal dynamics during the task. Children were required to determine the numerical magnitude (NC) (NC task) or the physical size (PC task) of two numbers presented simultaneously. In the NC task, the AMC group showed faster response times but similar accuracy compared to the control group. In the PC task, the two groups exhibited the same speed and accuracy. The saliency of numerical information relative to physical information was greater in AMC group. With regards to ERP results, the AMC group displayed congruity effects both in the earlier (N1) and later (N2 and LPC (late positive component) time domain, while the control group only displayed congruity effects for LPC. In the left parietal region, LPC amplitudes were larger for the AMC than the control group. Individual differences for LPC amplitudes over left parietal area showed a positive correlation with RTs in the NC task in both congruent and neutral conditions. After controlling for the N2 amplitude, this correlation also became significant in the incongruent condition. Our results suggest that AMC training can strengthen the relationship between symbolic representation and numerical magnitude so that numerical information processing becomes quicker and automatic in AMC children.

Mice with subtle reduction of NMDA NR1 receptor subunit expression have a selective decrease in mismatch negativity: Implications for schizophrenia prodromal population	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; NMDA; EEG; Mismatch negativity; Mouse	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; WEANING SOCIAL-ISOLATION; PREPULSE INHIBITION; WORKING-MEMORY; GENETIC MODEL; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; PROCESSING DEFICITS; HYPOFUNCTION MODEL; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS	Reductions in glutamate function are regarded as an important contributory factor in schizophrenia. However, there is a paucity of animal models characterized by developmental and sustained reductions in glutamate function. Pharmacological models using NMDA antagonists have been widely used but these typically produce only transient changes in behavior and brain function. Likewise, mice with homozygous constitutive reductions in glutamate receptor expression show stable brain and behavioral changes, but many of these phenotypes are more severe than the human disease. The current study examines a variety of schizophrenia-related EEG measures in mice with a heterozygous alteration of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit gene (NR1) that is known to result in reduced NR1 receptor expression in the homozygous mouse (NR1-/-). (NR1+/-) mice showed a 30% reduction in NR1 receptor expression and were reared after weaning in either group or isolated conditions. Outcome measures include the response to paired white noise stimuli, escalating inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) and deviance-related mismatch negativity (MMN). In contrast to what has been reported in (NR1-/-) mice and mice treated with NMDA antagonists, (NR1+/-) mice showed no change on obligatory Event Related Potential (ERP) measures including the murine P50 and N100 equivalents (P20 and N40), or measures of baseline or evoked gamma power. Alternatively, (NR1+/-) mice showed a marked reduction in response to a deviant auditory tone during MMN task. Data suggest that EEG response to deviant, rather than static, stimuli may be more sensitive for detecting subtle changes in glutamate function. Deficits in these heterozygous NR1 knockdown mice are consistent with data demonstrating MMN deficits among family members of schizophrenia patients and among prodromal patients. Therefore, the current study suggests that (NR1+/-) mice may be among the most sensitive models for increased vulnerability to schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In order to achieve high acceptance of the BCI by this user group and their supporters, the BCI system has to be integrated into their support infrastructure. Critical disadvantages of a BCI are the time consuming preparation of the user for the electroencephalography (EEG) measurements and the low information transfer rate of EEG based BCI. These disadvantages become apparent if a BCI is used to control complex devices. In this paper, a hybrid BCI is described that enables research for a Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is optimally adapted to requirements of the user and the tasks to be carried out. The solution is based on the integration of a Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-BCI, an Event-related (de)-synchronization (ERD/ERS)-BCI, an eye tracker, an environmental observation camera, and a new EEG head cap for wearing comfort and easy preparation. The design of the new fast multimodal BCI (called sBCI) system is described and first test results, obtained in experiments with six healthy subjects, are presented. The sBCI concept may also become useful for healthy people in cases where a "hands-free" handling of devices is necessary.

The aim of this study was to investigate neural responses related to anticipation and processing of painful stimuli occurring with different levels of uncertainty. Experimental design: Twenty-five participants (13 females) took part in an electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment at separate times. A visual cue announced the occurrence of an electrical painful or nonpainful stimulus, delivered with certainty or uncertainty (50% chance), at some point during the following 15 s. Principal observations: During the first 2 s of the anticipation phase, a strong effect of uncertainty was reflected in a pronounced frontal stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and increased fMRI activation in higher visual processing areas. In the last 2 s before stimulus delivery, we observed stimulus-specific preparatory processes indicated by a centroparietal SPN and posterior insula activation that was most pronounced for the certain pain condition. Uncertain anticipation was associated with attentional control processes. During stimulation, the results revealed that unexpected painful stimuli produced the strongest activation in the affective pain processing network and a more pronounced offset-P2. Conclusions: Our results reflect that during early anticipation uncertainty is strongly associated with affective mechanisms and seems to be a more salient event compared to certain anticipation. During the last 2 s before stimulation, attentional control mechanisms are initiated related to the increased salience of uncertainty. Furthermore, stimulus-specific preparatory mechanisms during certain anticipation also shaped the response to stimulation, underlining the adaptive value of stimulus-targeted preparatory activity which is less likely when facing an uncertain event.

A Behavioural and EEG Survey	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SENSORY CONSONANCE; MOVEMENT TIME; MUSICIANS; NONMUSICIANS; POTENTIALS; CONTEXT; ERP	For listeners familiar with Western twelve-tone equal-tempered (12-TET) music, a novel microtonal tuning system is expected to present additional processing challenges. We aimed to determine whether this was the case, focusing on the extent to which our perceptions can be considered bottom-up (psychoacoustic and primarily perceptual) and top-down (dependent on familiarity and cognitive processing). We elicited both overt response ratings, and covert event-related potentials (ERPs), so as to compare subjective impressions of sounds with the neurophysiological processing of the acoustic signal. We hypothesised that microtonal intervals are perceived differently from 12-TET intervals, and that the responses of musicians (n = 10) and non-musicians (n = 10) are distinct. Two-note chords were presented comprising 12-TET intervals (consonant and dissonant) or microtonal (quarter tone) intervals, and ERP, subjective roughness ratings, and liking ratings were recorded successively. Musical experience mediated the perception of differences between dissonant and microtone intervals, with non-musicians giving similar ratings for each, and musicians preferring dissonant over the less commonly used microtonal intervals, rating them as less rough. ERP response amplitude was greater for consonant intervals than other intervals. Musical experience interacted with interval type, suggesting that musical expertise facilitates the sensory and perceptual discrimination of microtonal intervals from 12-TET intervals, and an increased ability to categorize such intervals. Non-musicians appear to have perceived microtonal intervals as instances of neighbouring 12-TET intervals.

However, simultaneous recordings are susceptible to various types of artifacts, many of which scale with magnetic field strength and can seriously compromise both EEG and fMRI data quality in recordings above 3 T. The aim of the present study was to implement and characterize an optimized setup for simultaneous EEG-fMRI in humans at 7 T. The effects of EEG cable length and geometry for signal transmission between the cap and amplifiers were assessed in a phantom model, with specific attention to noise contributions from the MR scanner coldheads. Cable shortening (down to 12 cm from cap to amplifiers) and bundling effectively reduced environment noise by up to 84% in average power and 91% in inter-channel power variability. Subject safety was assessed and confirmed via numerical simulations of RF power distribution and temperature measurements on a phantom model, building on the limited existing literature at ultra-high field. MRI data degradation effects due to the EEG system were characterized via B-0 and B-1(+) field mapping on a human volunteer, demonstrating important, although not prohibitive, B1 disruption effects. With the optimized setup, simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions were performed on 5 healthy volunteers undergoing two visual paradigms: an eyes-open/eyes-closed task, and a visual evoked potential (VEP) paradigm using reversing-checkerboard stimulation. EEG data exhibited clear occipital alpha modulation and average VEPs, respectively, with concomitant BOLD signal changes. On a single-trial level, alpha power variations could be observed with relative confidence on all trials; VEP detection was more limited, although statistically significant responses could be detected in more than 50% of trials for every subject. Overall, we conclude that the proposed setup is well suited for simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 7 T. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Elevated synchrony in Parkinson disease detected with electroencephalography	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL DISCHARGE; GENERIC METHOD; MOVEMENT	ObjectiveParkinson disease (PD) can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Development of a biomarker for PD would reduce these challenges by providing an objective measure of disease. Emerging theories suggest PD is characterized by excessive synchronization in the beta frequency band (approximate to 20Hz) throughout basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops. Recently we showed with invasive electrocorticography that one robust measure of this synchronization is the coupling of beta phase to broadband gamma amplitude (ie, phase-amplitude coupling [PAC]). Other recent work suggests that high-frequency activity is detectable at the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). Motivated by these findings, we tested whether beta-gamma PAC over sensorimotor cortex, recorded noninvasively with EEG, differs between PD patients off and on medications, and healthy control subjects. MethodsResting EEG was compared from 15 PD patients and 16 healthy control subjects. PD patients were tested on and off medications on different days, in a counterbalanced order. For each data set we calculated PAC and compared results across groups. ResultsPAC was elevated in the patients off medications compared to on medications (p = 0.008) and for patients off medications compared to controls (p = 0.009). InterpretationElevated PAC is detectable using scalp EEG in PD patients off medications compared to on medications, and compared to healthy controls. This suggests that EEG PAC may provide a noninvasive biomarker of the parkinsonian state. This biomarker could be used as a control signal for closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation devices, for adjustment of dopaminergic treatment, and also has the potential to aid in diagnosis.

Monitoring and correcting the insurgence of abnormal dynamic balance opens new scenarios in the cure of these diseases and fall prevention. In this work, we present a study based on EEG time-frequency analysis to identify the correlation between synchronized EEG and EMG signals for gait analysis. Several tools for gait analysis are developed and experimented i.e. EMG trigger generation with dynamic threshold, EMG co-contraction, EEG movement related potentials (MRPs) and EEG event related desynchronizations (ERDs). This work particularly focus on gait analysis indexes implementation and experimentally obtained results based on a large dataset, including different type of gait i.e. normal gait, perturbed gait and gait during a second cognitive task (DT). A weighted average on the calculated indexes are exploited to quantify the falling risk.

After treatment, all four participants showed clinically significant improvements on a range of cognitive and emotional performance measures. Moreover, these improvements were accompanied by theoretically significant neurophysiological changes between pre- and post-treatment electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Specifically, the P3a component of participants' event related potentials (ERP) in response to novelty stimuli, characteristically abnormal in this clinical population, shifted significantly toward database norms. So, participants' initially slow alpha peak frequency (APF), theorized to underlie impaired cognitive processing abilities, also increased in both frequency and amplitude as a result of treatment. On the basis of these promising results, more extensive controlled studies are warranted.

Typically, emotion recognition systems are personalized, i.e. the discrimination models are subject-dependent. Building subject-independent models is a harder problem due to the high EEG variability between individuals. In this paper we propose a unified system for efficient discrimination of positive and negative emotions in a group of 26 users. The users were exposed to high arousal affective images and the recorded brain signals differentiated according to their positive and negative valence. Major challenge in building subject independent affective models is to identify the most discriminative features between subjects. The focus of the present study is to find a relevant feature selection approach that extracts features suitable for neurophysiological interpretation and validation. Spatial (channels) and temporal (brain waves peaks and their respective latencies) features are extracted from the EEG signals. The feature selection strategies explored (Independent spatial and temporal feature selection, Sequential Feature Selection, Feature Elimination based on data descriptive statistics) are consistent in selecting parietal and occipital channels and late waves (P200, P300) as better encoder of the emotion valence state and less variable across subjects. These results are in line with neurophysiological hypothesis of visually elicited human emotions - brain activity correlation. The relevance of the selected features was validated by five standard and one majority vote classifiers.

These tasks rely heavily on human judgment, making fully automated systems infeasible in many cases. Researchers have investigated methods for combining human judgment with computational processing to increase the speed at which humans can triage large image sets. One such method is rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), in which images are presented in rapid succession to a human viewer. While viewing the images and looking for targets of interest, the participant's brain activity is recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG signals can be time-locked to the presentation of each image, producing event-related potentials (ERPs) that provide information about the brain's response to those stimuli. The participants' judgments about whether or not each set of images contained a target and the ERPs elicited by target and non-target images are used to identify subsets of images that merit close expert scrutiny [ 1]. Although the RSVP/EEG paradigm holds promise for helping professional visual searchers to triage imagery rapidly, it may be limited by the nature of the target items. Targets that do not vary a great deal in appearance are likely to elicit useable ERPs, but more variable targets may not. In the present study, we sought to extend the RSVP/EEG paradigm to the domain of aviation security screening, and in doing so to explore the limitations of the technique for different types of targets. Professional Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) viewed bag X-rays that were presented using an RSVP paradigm. The TSOs viewed bursts of images containing 50 segments of bag X-rays that were presented for 100 ms each. Following each burst of images, the TSOs indicated whether or not they thought there was a threat item in any of the images in that set. EEG was recorded during each burst of images and ERPs were calculated by time-locking the EEG signal to the presentation of images containing threats and matched images that were identical except for the presence of the threat item. Half of the threat items had a prototypical appearance and half did not. We found that the bag images containing threat items with a prototypical appearance reliably elicited a P300 ERP component, while those without a prototypical appearance did not. These findings have implications for the application of the RSVP/EEG technique to real-world visual search domains.

Accent 1 yielded an increased brain response ('preactivation negativity') that has previously been interpreted as reflecting preactivation of suffixes. Preactivation is greater for accent 1 due to its association with a limited set of suffixes, whereas accent 2 is default for compound words. The tonal realization of the word accent opposition in South Swedish is practically the mirror image of that in Central Swedish, where a similar preactivation negativity has been found. Therefore, the brain response is unlikely to result from a difference in acoustic features between the word accents. Invalidly cued suffixes yielded brain response pattern showing increased processing load of the unexpected suffix (negative electric potential) followed by its reprocessing (positivity 'P600').

We attempted two replications of Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, and Petersson [Hagoort, P., Hald, L., Bastiaansen, M., & Petersson, K. M. Integration of word meaning and world knowledge in language comprehension. Science, 304, 438-441, 2004] to determine whether this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain responses. Hagoort et al. reported an N400 effect and synchronization in the theta and gamma range following world knowledge violations. Our first experiment (n = 32) used RSVP and replicated both the N400 effect in the ERPs and the power increase in the theta range in the time-frequency domain. In the second experiment (n = 49), participants read the same materials freely while their eye movements and their EEG were monitored. First fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates were increased, and the ERP showed an N400 effect. An analysis of time-frequency representations showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. The results suggest that oscillatory EEG changes elicited by world knowledge violations are different in natural reading and RSVP. This may reflect differences in how representations are constructed and retrieved from memory in the two presentation modes.

Cerebral responses were expected to differ for stimulation in two different dermatomes (CP2 different from ST36 and CP1), or stimulation at the acupuncture point vs. the control points. For EEG, mu rhythm power increased for ST36 compared to CP1 or CP2, but not when comparing the two control points. The fMRI analysis found more pronounced insula and S2 (secondary somatosensory cortex) activation, as well as precuneus deactivation during ST36 stimulation. The S2 seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed increased connectivity to right precuneus for both comparisons, ST36 vs. CP1 and ST36 vs. CP2, however in different regions. Our results suggest that stimulation at acupuncture points may modulate somatosensory and saliency processing regions more readily than stimulation at non-acupuncture point locations. Also, our findings suggest potential modulation of pain perception due to acupuncture stimulation.

In this study we assessed energy and task related phase locking of event-related oscillation (EROs), behavioral responses, measures of IQ and personality, and expected responses to alcohol in a large sample of individuals with LVEEG compared to those with higher voltage variants. Participants (n = 762) were recruited from a Native American community and completed a diagnostic interview, the Quick Test, the Subjective High Assessment Scale Expectation Version (SHAS-E) and the Maudsley Personality Inventory. Clinical and spectral analyzed EEGs were collected for determination of the presence of a LVEEG variant. EROs were generated using a facial expression recognition task. Participants with LVEEG (n = 451) were significantly more likely to be older, married and have higher degrees of Native American heritage but did not differ in gender, income or education. Individuals with LVEEG were also found to have decreased energy in their alpha EROs, increased phase locking between stimulus trials, and increased phase-locking between cortical brain areas. No significant differences in the cognitive tests, personality variables or alcohol dependence or anxiety diagnoses were found, however, individuals with LVEEG did report a larger number of drinks ever consumed in a 24-h period and a less intense expected response to alcohol. These data suggest that alpha power in the resting EEG is highly associated with energy and cortical connectivity measures generated by event-related stimuli, as well as potentially increased risk for alcohol use.

Thirty undergraduate students (15 females) watched a video in both 2D and 3D for an hour. Because visual fatigue is related to cognitive load, the HEP was used as an indicator of communication between the heart and the brain and therefore of cognitive function; responses were compared after 2D and 3D viewing. At the standard EEG sites F3 and F4, the alpha activity of the first and second HEP components was significantly increased after 3D video viewing relative to 2D. This increase likely indicates that sensory input from 3D video requires heavy computation by the brain, stimulating heart activity. The conclusion is that the first and second HEP components are significant parameters that can quantitatively evaluate 3D visual fatigue. Further work is needed to uncover the cause of 3D visual fatigue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrophysiological Indices in Sportsmen: Correlations with the Contents of Iron and Copper in the Organism	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; evoked potentials (EPs); event-related potentials (ERPs); cardiointervalography; cardiovascular system (CVS); microelements; iron; copper		Using the roentgen-fluorescent analysis, we found mostly below-norm contents of iron and copper in stable tissue samples (hairs) of 18- to 20-year-old sportsmen (university students). Correlations of the results of such analysis with sets of indices characterizing the state of the CNS (parameters of background EEG and of evoked/event-related EEG potentials), that of the cardiovascular system (CVS, data of electrocardiography and rheography), and of the mechanisms providing autonomic regulation of the latter system (indices of cardiointervalography) were calculated. According to the number of significant correlations (0.44 < r < 0.56) and their intensity, we found that the content of copper is more significant for the indices characterizing functioning of the CNS, especially for those of EEG phenomena related to mental processes. At the same time, the content of iron exerts more significant influences on the functional state of the CVS. It should be taken into account that the pattern of correlations found in our study is typical of a relatively specific sampling of the subjects (with a clearly pronounced deficiency of the above-mentioned elements in the organism) and can be dissimilar in the case of normal (and, especially, increased) contents of these metals.

The experiment is carried out to explore the relationship between impression evaluation and psychophysiological indices obtained from biological signals. We analyze the latency and amplitude of EEG event-related potential P300 and N170 when we show the three different illustrations which are the cat having realistic eyes, the cat having simplified eyes and the cat having eyes of intermediate expression. In addition, we also analyze them when we show other three different illustrations which are the cat having a clear outline, the cat having no outline and the cat having an ambiguous outline. In both experiment, we use not only cat illustrations but also tiger illustrations. As a result, it suggests there is a correlation between part of impression evaluation and the latency and amplitude of EEG event-related potential. The expression to create a positive impression is different depending on whether cats or tigers. This study shows that differences in expression might lead a positive impression and we should need to select the expression of illustrations depending on the subject of the illustration.

One type of aided display is called a Visual Scene Display (VSD). VSDs consist of integrated scenes (such as photographs) in which language concepts are embedded. Often, the representations of concepts on VSDs are perceptually similar to their referents. Given this physical resemblance, one may ask how well VSDs support development of symbolic functioning. We used brain imaging techniques to examine whether matches and mismatches between the content of spoken messages and photographic images of scenes evoke neural activity similar to activity that occurs to spoken or written words. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 15 college students who were shown photographs paired with spoken phrases that were either matched or mismatched to the concepts embedded within each photograph. Of interest was the N400 component, a negative defl ecting wave 400 ms post-stimulus that is considered to be an index of semantic functioning. An N400 response in the mismatched condition (but not the matched) would replicate brain responses to traditional linguistic symbols. An N400 was found, exclusively in the mismatched condition, suggesting that mismatches between spoken messages and VSD-type representations set the stage for the N400 in ways similar to traditional linguistic symbols.

Existing methods are largely based on Fourier transform and wavelet transform, and there is a lack of methods capable of (1) measuring the synchronization strength of multivariate data by adapting to non-stationary, non-linear dynamics, and (2) meeting the needs of sophisticated scientific or engineering applications. This study proposes an approach that measures the synchronization strength of bivariate non-stationary nonlinear data against phase differences. The approach (briefed as AD-PDSA) relies on adaptive algorithms for data decomposition. A parallelized approach was also developed with general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), which largely improved the scalability of data processing, namely, GAD-PDSA. We developed a model on the basis of GAD-PDSA to verify its effectiveness in analyzing multi-channel, event-related potential (ERP) recordings against Daubechies (DB) wavelet with reference to the Morlet wavelet transform (MWT). GADPDSA was applied to an EEG dataset obtained from epilepsy patients, and the synchronization analysis manifested an effective indicator of epileptic focus localization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on topics that are helpful for a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and its efficient implementation, which is especially important for EEG researchers unfamiliar with the technique. The popular methods of finite difference and splines are reviewed in detail. The former has the advantage of simplicity and low computational cost, but its estimates are prone to a variety of errors due to discretization. The latter eliminates all issues related to discretization and incorporates a regularization mechanism to reduce spatial noise, but at the cost of increasing mathematical and computational complexity. These and several other issues deserving further development are highlighted, some of which we address to the extent possible. Here we develop a set of discrete approximations for Laplacian estimates at peripheral electrodes. We also provide the mathematical details of finite difference approximations that are missing in the literature, and discuss the problem of computational performance, which is particularly important in the context of EEG splines where data sets can be very large. Along this line, the matrix representation of the surface Laplacian operator is carefully discussed and some figures are given illustrating the advantages of this approach. In the final remarks, we briefly sketch a possible way to incorporate finite-size electrodes into Laplacian estimates that could guide further developments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, real-time EEG signal is acquired for deliberate eye blink action in MATLAB and Independent Component Analysis decomposition is done and corresponding epochs are extracted. The deliberate action shows significant rise in the event related potential from 0 mu V to 175.1 mu V at frontal channel AF3. Scalp maps also show that frontal regions are activated at 3 Hz and 10 Hz thus, representing the activation of delta band power (0-4 Hz) and alpha band power (8-13 Hz). The component activation is used to generate an 'active high' output during deliberate eye blinking to play an audio file. This reflects the use of EEG as a trigger in developing more intuitive brain-computer interfaces in real-time scenario.

Methods: Two age-matched groups of young adults were presented with brief pitch shifts of auditory feedback during vocalization. Compensatory behavioral and corresponding bioelectrical brain responses were elicited by the pitch-shifted voice feedback. Results: The analysis of bioelectrical responses showed that the ADHD group had shorter peak latency and onset time of motor-related bioelectrical brain responses as compared to the controls. Conclusions: These results were interpreted to suggest differences in executive functions between ADHD and control participants. Significance: We hypothesize that more rapid motor-related bioelectrical responses found in the present study may be a manifestation of impulsiveness in adults with ADHD at the involuntary level of voice control.

A scalp current density view	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Current Source Density; Time resolution	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; SURFACE LAPLACIAN ESTIMATION; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; ERROR NEGATIVITY; GENERIC METHOD; WAVE-FORMS; ENHANCEMENT; POTENTIALS; ADVANTAGES	Among the different brain imaging techniques, electroencephalography (EEG) is classically considered as having an excellent temporal resolution, but a poor spatial one. Here, we argue that the actual temporal resolution of conventional (scalp potentials) EEG is overestimated, and that volume conduction, the main cause of the poor spatial resolution of EEG, also distorts the recovered time course of the underlying sources at scalp level, and hence degrades the actual temporal resolution of EEG. While Current Source Density (CSD) estimates, through the Surface Laplacian (SL) computation, are well known to dramatically reduce volume conduction effects and hence improve EEG spatial resolution, its positive impact on EEG temporal resolution is much less recognized. In two simulation studies, we first show how volume conduction and reference electrodes distort the scalp potential time course, and how SL transform provides a much better spatio-temporal description. We then exemplify similar effects on two empirical datasets. We show how the time courses of the scalp potentials mis-estimate the latencies of the relevant brain events and that CSD provides a much richer, and much more accurate, view of the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity.

Semantic Relations between Visual Objects Can Be Unconsciously Processed but Not Reported under Change Blindness	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENDED OBJECTS; DETECT CHANGES; MEMORY; N400; WORD; LOCALIZATION; LANGUAGE; COMPONENT	Change blindnessthe failure to detect changes in visual sceneshas often been interpreted as a result of impoverished visual information encoding or as a failure to compare the prechange and postchange scene. In the present electroencephalography study, we investigated whether semantic features of prechange and postchange information are processed unconsciously, even when observers are unaware that a change has occurred. We presented scenes composed of natural objects in which one object changed from one presentation to the next. Object changes were either semantically related (e.g., rail car changed to rail) or unrelated (e.g., rail car changed to sausage). Observers were first asked to detect whether any change had occurred and then to judge the semantic relation of the two objects involved in the change. We found a semantic mismatch ERP effect, that is, a more negative-going ERP for semantically unrelated compared to related changes, originating from a cortical network including the left middle temporal gyrus and occipital cortex and resembling the N400 effect, albeit at longer latencies. Importantly, this semantic mismatch effect persisted even when observers were unaware of the change and the semantic relationship of prechange and postchange object. This finding implies that change blindness does not preclude the encoding of the prechange and postchange objects' identities and possibly even the comparison of their semantic content. Thus, change blindness cannot be interpreted as resulting from impoverished or volatile visual representations or as a failure to process the prechange and postchange object. Instead, change detection appears to be limited at a later, postperceptual stage.

Event-related brain potentials reveal correlates of the transformation of stimulus functions through derived relations in healthy humans	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						ERP; Relational learning; Reaction time; Human	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RESPONSE LATENCIES; EQUIVALENCE CLASSES; BEHAVIOR; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; INFERENCE; COGNITION	This research aimed to explore the neural correlates of relational learning by recording high-density EEG during a behavioural task involving derivation levels of varying complexity. A total of 15 participants (5 male; age range 18-23 years; mean age = 20.0 years) completed contextual cue training, relational learning, function training and a derivation task while 128-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from the scalp (Background). Differences in response latencies were observed between the two derived (symmetry and equivalence) and directly trained relations, with longest latencies found for equivalence and shortest for the directly trained relations. This pattern failed to reach statistical significance. Importantly, ERPs revealed an early P3a positivity (from 230 to 350 ms) over right posterior scalp sites. Significantly larger mean amplitudes were found at three channels (P6, E115 and E121) for the equivalence relations compared to the two other types (Results). We believe this may constitute a first demonstration of differences in brain electrophysiology in the transformation of stimulus functions through derived relations of hierarchical levels of complexity (Conclusions).

Cluster-based computational methods for mass univariate analyses of event-related brain potentials/fields: A simulation study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						ERP; Family-wise error rate; Multiple comparison correction; Cluster-based statistics; Threshold free cluster enhancement; Monte-Carlo simulations	EEG; ENHANCEMENT; TESTS	Background: In recent years, analyses of event related potentials/fields have moved from the selection of a few components and peaks to a mass-univariate approach in which the whole data space is analyzed. Such extensive testing increases the number of false positives and correction for multiple comparisons is needed. Method: Here we review all cluster-based correction for multiple comparison methods (cluster-height, cluster-size, cluster-mass, and threshold free cluster enhancement - TFCE), in conjunction with two computational approaches (permutation and bootstrap). Results: Data driven Monte-Carlo simulations comparing two conditions within subjects (two sample Student's t-test) showed that, on average, all cluster-based methods using permutation or bootstrap alike control well the family-wise error rate (FWER), with a few caveats. Conclusions: (i) A minimum of 800 iterations are necessary to obtain stable results; (ii) below 50 trials, bootstrap methods are too conservative; (iii) for low critical family-wise error rates (e.g. p = 1%), permutations can be too liberal; (iv) TFCE controls best the type 1 error rate with an attenuated extent parameter (i.e. power < 1).

Frontal midline. power as an index of listening effort	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; audiological rehabilitation; auditory; event-related spectral perturbation; independent components analysis	EEG DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; SPEECH	Attempts to identify physiological correlates of listening effort have mainly focused on peripheral measures (e.g. pupillometry) and auditory-evoked/event-related potentials. Although nonauditory studies have suggested that sustained time-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) features in the.-band (4-7 Hz) are correlated with domain-general mental effort, little work has characterized such features during effortful listening. Here, high-density EEG data was collected while listeners performed a sentence-recognition task in noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of which varied across blocks. Frontal midline theta (Fm theta), largely driven by sources localized in or near the medial frontal cortex, showed greater power with decreasing SNR and was positively correlated with self-reports of effort. Increased Fm theta was present before speech onset and during speech presentation. Fm theta power also differed across SNRs when including only trials in which all words were recognized, suggesting that the effects were unrelated to performance differences. Results suggest that frontal cortical networks play a larger role in listening as acoustic signals are increasingly masked. Further, sustained time-frequency EEG features may usefully supplement previously used peripheral and event-related potential measures in psychophysiological investigations of effortful listening.

We examined this processing by recording EEG locked to S during RL. Incentive value of outcomes and predictive value of S were manipulated, allowing us to discriminate between outcome-related and response-related activity. S predicting the correct response differed from nonpredictive S in the P2. S paired with high-value outcomes differed from those paired with low-value outcomes in a frontocentral positivity and in the P3b. A slow negativity then distinguished between predictive and nonpredictive S. These results suggest that, first, attention prioritizes detection of informative S. Activation of mental representations of these informative S then retrieves representations of outcomes, which in turn retrieve representations of responses that previously produced those outcomes.

Using language comprehension as a test case, the present study aimed to dissociate age-related changes in prediction generation versus internal model adaptation following a prediction error. Event related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured in a group of older adults (60-81 years; n = 40) as they read sentences of the form "The opposite of black is white/yellow/nice." Replicating previous work in young adults, results showed a target related P300 for the expected antonym ("white"; an effect assumed to reflect a prediction match), and a graded N400 effect for the two incongruous conditions (i.e. a larger N400 amplitude for the incongruous continuation not related to the expected antonym, "nice," versus the incongruous associated condition, "yellow"). These effects were followed by a late positivity, again with a larger amplitude in the incongruous non-associated versus incongruous associated condition. Analyses using linear mixed-effects models showed that the target-related P300 effect and the N400 effect for the incongruous non-associated condition were both modulated by age, thus suggesting that age related changes affect both prediction generation and model adaptation. However, effects of age were outweighed by the interindividual variability of ERP responses, as reflected in the high proportion of variance captured by the inclusion of by condition random slopes for participants and items. We thus argue that at both a neurophysiological and a functional level the notion of general differences between language processing in young and older adults may only be of limited use, and that future research should seek to better understand the causes of interindividual variability in the ERP responses of older adults and its relation to cognitive performance.

In contrast, gaze aversions in line-drawn faces do not produce these N170 differences (Rossi et al., 2014), suggesting that physical stimulus properties or experimental context may drive these effects. Here we investigated the role of stimulus-induced context on neurophysiological responses to dynamic gaze. Sixteen healthy adults viewed line-drawn and real faces, with dynamic eye aversion and direct gaze transitions, and control stimuli (scrambled arrays and checkerboards) while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. EEG data from 2 temporo-occipital clusters of 9 electrodes in each hemisphere where N170 activity is known to be maximal were selected for analysis. N170 peak amplitude and latency, and temporal dynamics from Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) were measured in 16 healthy subjects. Real faces generated larger N170s for averted vs. direct gaze motion, however, N170s to real and direct gaze were as large as those to respective controls. N170 amplitude did not differ across line drawn gaze changes. Overall, bilateral mean gamma power changes for faces relative to control stimuli occurred between 150-350 ms, potentially reflecting signal detection of facial motion. Our data indicate that experimental context does not drive N170 differences to viewed gaze changes. Low-level stimulus properties, such as the high sclera/iris contrast change in real eyes likely drive the N170 changes to viewed aversive movements.

Participants passively listened to vocalizations or pseudo-utterances conveying anger, sadness, or happiness as the EEG was recorded. Simultaneous effects of vocal expression type and emotion were analyzed for three ERP components (N100, P200, late positive component). Emotional vocalizations and speech were differentiated very early (N100) and vocalizations elicited stronger, earlier, and more differentiated P200 responses than speech. At later stages (450-700 ms), anger vocalizations evoked a stronger late positivity (LPC) than other vocal expressions, which was similar but delayed for angry speech. Individuals with high trait anxiety exhibited early, heightened sensitivity to vocal emotions (particularly vocalizations). These data provide new neurophysiological evidence that vocalizations, as evolutionarily primitive signals, are accorded precedence over speech-embedded emotions in the human voice.

The present study tested whether source estimation of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) can be used to investigate task-dependent AC activations. Subjects were presented with frequency-varying two-part tones during pitch discrimination, pitch n-back memory, and visual tasks identical to our previous fMRI study (Rinne et al., J Neurosci 29:13338-13343, 2009). ERPs and their minimum-norm source estimates in AC were strongly modulated by task at 200-700 ms from tone onset. As in the fMRI study, the pitch discrimination and pitch memory tasks were associated with distinct AC activation patterns. In the pitch discrimination task, increased activity in the anterior AC was detected relatively late at 300-700 ms from tone onset. Therefore, this activity was probably not associated with enhanced pitch processing but rather with the actual discrimination process (comparison between the two parts of tone). Increased activity in more posterior areas associated with the pitch memory task, in turn, occurred at 200-700 ms suggesting that this activity was related to operations on pitch categories after pitch analysis was completed. Finally, decreased activity associated with the pitch memory task occurred at 150-300 ms consistent with the notion that, in the demanding pitch memory task, spectrotemporal analysis is actively halted as soon as category information has been obtained. These results demonstrate that ERP source analysis can be used to complement fMRI to investigate task-dependent activations of human AC.

However, subjects may make mistakes in counting the target stimulus or be affected by the non-target stimulus. The target trials may not contain expected ERPs and the non-target trials may contain unexpected ERPs, which was called error samples. This paper intends to survey whether the classification accuracy could be improved after removing these error samples from offline training data. The result showed that the online performance of BCI system could be improved after selecting the offline samples for training the classification mode.

We investigated the neurocognitive processes through which trait social anxiety relates to task performance, proposing a model of the joint contributions of reactive control, theoretically associated with conflict monitoring and activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and proactive control, theoretically associated with top-down regulation and activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Participants varying in their degree of trait social anxiety completed the Eriksen flanker task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Task-related left dlPFC activity was indexed by relative left prefrontal EEG (inverse alpha), and conflict-related dACC activity was indexed by the N2r component of the event-related potential. Stronger activity in both regions predicted better response control, and greater social anxiety was associated with worse response control. Furthermore, for all participants, greater left prefrontal EEG activity predicted better behavioral control, but for high social anxiety participants only, greater N2r responses also predicted behavioral control. This pattern suggests that low social anxiety individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by dlPFC activity, whereas high social anxiety individuals relied additionally on a reactive control process, driven by conflict-related dACC activity. These findings support a model of control that involves different patterns of interplay between proactive and reactive strategies and may help to explain self-regulatory impairments in social anxiety.

In the auditory modality, the detection of regularity involves segregating incoming sounds into distinct perceptual objects (stream segregation). The detection of change from this within-stream regularity is associated with the mismatch negativity, a component of auditory event-related brain potentials (ERPs). A central unanswered question is how the detection of regularity and the detection of change are interrelated, and whether attention affects the former, the latter, or both. Here we show that the detection of regularity and the detection of change can be empirically dissociated, and that attention modulates the detection of change without precluding the detection of regularity, and the perceptual organization of the auditory background into distinct streams. By applying frequency spectra analysis on the EEG of subjects engaged in a selective listening task, we found distinct peaks of ERP synchronization, corresponding to the rhythm of the frequency streams, independently of whether the stream was attended or ignored.

As the AN may have an influence on widespread neocortical networks, we hypothesized that the AN, in addition to its participation in memory processing, may also participate in cognitive activities linked with the frontal neocortical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the AN might participate in complex motor-cognitive activities. Three pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients implanted with AN-DBS electrodes performed two tasks involving the writing of single letters: (1) copying letters from a monitor; and (2) writing of any letter other than that appearing on the monitor. The cognitive load of the second task was increased. The task-related oscillatory changes and evoked potentials were assessed. Local event-related alpha and beta desynchronization were more expressed during the second task while the lower gamma synchronization decreased. The local field event-related potentials were elicited by the two tasks without any specific differences. The AN participates in cognitive networks processing complex motor-cognitive tasks. Attention should be paid to executive functions in subjects undergoing AN-DBS.

Two types of conditions were considered: rhyming and nonrhyming pairs that were orthographically dissimilar (e.g. white-fight, child-cough) and those that were orthographically similar (e.g. right-fight, dough-cough). Both native and non-native English speakers were faster and more accurate in responding to nonrhyming than rhyming targets under orthographically dissimilar conditions, although the response times of Chinese-English bilinguals differed from those of the other groups. All groups were slower and less accurate in responding to nonrhyming targets under orthographically similar conditions, with the response times and accuracy rates of Spanish-English bilinguals differing from those of the other groups. All participant groups showed more negative N450 mean amplitudes to nonrhyming compared with rhyming targets, regardless of orthographic similarity, and this rhyming effect did not differ across groups under the orthographically similar conditions. However, under orthographically dissimilar conditions, the rhyming effect was less robust in non-native speakers, being modulated by English proficiency.

In order to investigate this topic we focused our analysis on the perception of affordances during a game, the Leap Motion Controller (LM). The sample was composed of 10 university students matched by age and sex. The subjects performed in Thinking training and in Immersive Affordance Condition (a virtual training with LM and a Real training). After each training the subject had to perform a recognition task. During the task ERP components were measured through EEG. The results highlighted that, during the LM training, attentional components changed. In the occipital lobes, which is entrusted to visual sensory, we got increased latencies; on the contrary, in frontal lobe, where the brain mainly activates for attention and action planning, we got decreased latencies.

The communication is provided by detecting the presence of P300 Event Related Potentials (ERPs) in the electroencophelogram (EEG) signals, recorded from scalp. The major problem associated with P300 spellers is the stratification of EEGs recorded out of visual stimulation given to a subject. In this paper, we present a method to analyze the EEG data for P300 speller system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification technique. Using the proposed method, we are able to find a correct and faster solution for the "target character detection" associated with the P300 speller system. The method requires minimal preprocessing and provides a high transfer rate, which makes it suitable for online analysis also.

This work recorded the scalp cortical auditory EP (CAEP) in unanesthetized monkeys by using methods that are essentially identical to those applied to humans. Young adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatto, 5-7 years old) were seated in a monkey chair, and their head movements were partially restricted by polystyrene blocks and tension poles placed around their head. Individual electrodes were fixated on their scalp using collodion according to the 10-20 system. Pure tone stimuli were presented while electroencephalograms were recorded from up to nineteen channels, including an electrooculogram channel. In all monkeys (n = 3), the recorded CAEP comprised a series of positive and negative deflections, labeled here as macaque P1 (mP1), macaque N1 (mN1), macaque P2 (mP2), and macaque N2 (mN2), and these transient responses to sound onset were followed by a sustained potential that continued for the duration of the sound, labeled the macaque sustained potential (mSP). mPl, mN2 and mSP were the prominent responses, and they had maximal amplitudes over frontal/central midline electrode sites, consistent with generators in auditory cortices. The study represents the first noninvasive scalp recording of CAEP in alert rhesus monkeys, to our knowledge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Especially, spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC is used to disclose blockwise causal flow among different brain areas in variant frequencies. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) BGC in time domain may not disclose true causality at all. (ii) Due to the use of the transfer function or its inverse matrix and partial information of the multivariate linear regression model, both of spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC have shortcomings and/or limitations which may inevitably lead to misinterpretation results. We then in time and frequency domains develop two new multivariate causality methods for the multivariate linear regression model, called blockwise new causality (BNC) and spectral BNC respectively. By several examples we confirm that BNC measures are more reasonable and understandable than BGC or conditional BGC. Finally, for EEG data from an epilepsy patient we analyze event-related potential (ERP) causality and demonstrate that both of BGC and BNC methods show significant causality flow in frequency domain, but the spectral BNC method yields satisfactory and convincing result which is consistent with event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral BGC method is shown to generate misleading results.

The impact of cognitive load on reward evaluation	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Reward processing; Executive control; Cognitive load; EEG; ERP; FRN	SITUATION AWARENESS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; TIME; CONVERSATION; POSITIVITY; DECISIONS; FEEDBACK; PHONE	The neural systems that afford our ability to evaluate rewards and punishments are impacted by a variety of external factors. Here, we demonstrate that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a reward processing system within the human medial-frontal cortex. In our paradigm, two groups of participants used performance feedback to estimate the exact duration of one second while electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded. Prior to performing the time estimation task, both groups were instructed to keep their eyes still and avoid blinking in line with well established EEG protocol. However, during performance of the time-estimation task, one of the two groups was provided with trial-to-trial-feedback about their performance on the time-estimation task and their eye movements to induce a higher level of cognitive load relative to participants in the other group who were solely provided with feedback about the accuracy of their temporal estimates. In line with previous work, we found that the higher level of cognitive load reduced the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity, a component of the human event-related brain potential associated with reward evaluation within the medial-frontal cortex. Importantly, our results provide further support that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a neural system associated with reward processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Brain asymmetry could be used for enhanced electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotional recognition as a prominent feature. Prefrontal hemispheric asymmetries have been proposed in twenty years ago. It is measured by the power of EEG signal in alpha band (8-13Hz), which is related to electrical power response to different emotional stimuli. In this paper, we designed an auditory evoked emotional experiment in order to explore EEG frontal alpha asymmetry by comparing event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) maps of left and right frontal regions. Thirty healthy male students are employed to stimulate emotion by affective sound clips. All of auditory evoked stimuli come from the standard International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) dataset. ERSP maps exhibited that there are the strongest responses of positive sounds overspread the frontal lobe. To be specific, the right prefrontal and whole medial frontal EEG activation are elicited the stronger responses by emotional sounds of high pleasure-arousal, whereas the left prefrontal and whole medial frontal EEG activation are elicited the stronger responses by emotional sounds of middle pleasure-low arousal. Additionally, the stronger responses of high-arousal level sound clips have been found out over the whole right frontal region, while the low-arousal level sound clips can elicit greater relative electrical power over the whole left frontal region.

The theoretical mechanisms by which tDCS generates these changes are predicated upon a rather large neurophysiological literature. However, a robust systematic review of this neurophysiological data has not yet been undertaken. Methods: tDCS data in healthy adults (18-50) from every neurophysiological outcome measure reported by at least two different research groups in the literature was collected. When possible, data was pooled and quantitatively analyzed to assess significance. When pooling was not possible, data was qualitatively compared to assess reliability. Results: Of the 30 neurophysiological outcome measures reported by at least two different research groups, tDCS was found to have a reliable effect on only one: MEP amplitude. Interestingly, the magnitude of this effect has been significantly decreasing over the last 14 years. Conclusion: Our systematic review does not support the idea that tDCS has a reliable neurophysiological effect beyond MEP amplitude modulation - though important limitations of this review (and conclusion) are discussed. This work raises questions concerning the mechanistic foundations and general efficacy of this device - the implications of which extend to the steadily increasing tDCS psychological literature.

However, support for this idea mostly comes from paradigms that are open to alternative explanations. In the present study we manipulated novelty in a word-learning task through task-irrelevant background images. These background images were either standard (presented repeatedly), or novel (presented only once). Two types of background images were used: Landscape pictures and fractals. EEG was also recorded during encoding. Contrary to the idea that novelty aids memory formation, memory performance was not affected by the novelty of the background. In the evoked response potentials, we found evidence of distracting effects of novelty: both the N1 and P3b components were smaller to words studied with novel backgrounds, and the amplitude of the N2b component correlated negatively with subsequent retrieval. We conclude that although evidence from other studies does suggest benefits on a longer time scale, novelty has no instantaneous benefits for learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, by measuring cortical activity time-locked to reactive control events arising from naturally occurring instability while standing still, we detected cortical involvement in the form of an evoked N1 potential prior to the onset of balance reactions. Peak amplitude and spectral power of this event-related activity increased as postural challenges and demand for reactive control increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, various patterns/features of EEG data need to be extracted and associated with specific events like cue-paced motor imagery. However, this is a challenging task since EEG data are usually non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio. New method: In this study, we propose a novel method, called structure constrained semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SCS-NMF), to extract the key patterns of EEG data in time domain by imposing the mean envelopes of event-related potentials (ERPs) as constraints on the semi-NMF procedure. The proposed method is applicable to general EEG time series, and the extracted temporal features by SCS-NMF can also be combined with other features in frequency domain to improve the performance of motor imagery classification. Results: Real data experiments have been performed using the SCS-NMF approach for motor imagery classification, and the results clearly suggest the superiority of the proposed method. Comparison with existing methods: Comparison experiments have also been conducted. The compared methods include ICA, PCA, Semi-NMF, Wavelets, EMD and CSP, which further verified the effectivity of SCS-NMF. Conclusions: The SCS-NMF method could obtain better or competitive performance over the state of the art methods, which provides a novel solution for brain pattern analysis from the perspective of structure constraint.

Methods Fourteen healthy male participants performed a visual Go/NoGo task, and electroencephalogram recordings were conducted at five time points: (1) baseline, (2) after 12 h of TSD, (3) after 24 h of TSD, (4) after 36 h of TSD, and (5) following 8 h of RS. The dynamic changes in response inhibition during TSD and after 8 h of RS were investigated by examining the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 event-related potential components. Results Compared with baseline, NoGo-P3 amplitudes were decreased, while the NoGo-N2 latency increased along with the awake time prolonged. NoGo anteriorization, which was minimized after 24 h of TSD, progressively decreased with increasing TSD. After 8 h of RS, recoveries of both the NoGo-P3 amplitude and NoGo-N2 latency in the prefrontal cortex were observed compared with the values after 36 h of TSD. Conclusion TSD induced a dose-dependent functional decline in the response inhibition of NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 on prefrontal cortex activation, and 8 h of RS resulted in recovery or maintenance of the response inhibition. However, it was not restored to baseline levels. Limitations Participants were chosen male college students only, thus the findings cannot be generalized to older people and women. Additionally, the sample size was small, and, thus, speculations on the meaning of the results of this study should be cautious. The EEG continuous recording should be employed to monitor the decline of alertness following TSD.

Short-term exposure limits (STELs) vary from 50 ppm up to 300 ppm across countries but their acute effects remain elusive in humans. Several in vitro and in vivo studies elucidated that toluene acutely acts by perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems. More specifically visual evoked potentials (VEPs) of rats are decreased after acute toluene exposure, leading to the assumption that particularly visual attention processes might be a target of toluene in humans. Therefore a visual change detection task was applied to measure both neurobehavioral and neurophysiological effects by using electroencephalography (EEG) after a single peak exposure to 200 ppm toluene. Performance and event-related components of the EEG were examined before and after exposure in a toluene-exposed and a control group. Thirty-three young healthy volunteers participated in this study. The behavioral results of the experiment indicate that toluene impairs the rate of correct responses especially in task conditions in which an irrelevant distractor is given, while the response times did not differ between both groups. The neurophysiological findings hint toward a less efficient visual processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli and an increased distractibility by irrelevant distractors. Thus the present results are a promising starting point for further research specifically targeting visual attention after toluene exposure and the reconsideration of the presently very heterogeneous STELs.

However no studies have explicitly investigated the time when single decisions are taken based on such an accumulation process. NEW METHOD: Here, we outline a novel electroencephalography (EEG) decoding technique which is based on accumulating the probability of appearance of prototypical voltage topographies and can be used for predicting subjects' decisions. We use this approach for studying the time-course of single decisions, during a task where subjects were asked to compare reward vs. loss points for accepting or rejecting offers. RESULTS: We show that based on this new method, we can accurately decode decisions for the majority of the subjects. The typical time-period for accurate decoding was modulated by task difficulty on a trial-by-trial basis. Typical latencies of when decisions are made were detected at similar to 500 ms for 'easy' vs. similar to 700 ms for 'hard' decisions, well before subjects' response (similar to 340 ms). Importantly, this decision time correlated with the drift rates of a diffusion model, evaluated independently at the behavioral level. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We compare the performance of our algorithm with logistic regression and support vector machine and show that we obtain significant results for a higher number of subjects than with these two approaches. We also carry out analyses at the average event-related potential level, for comparison with previous studies on decision-making. Conclusions: We present a novel approach for studying the timing of value-based decision-making, by accumulating patterns of topographic EEG activity at single-trial level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little is known about the electrophysiological processing of motor imagery in first episode SCZ. In the current study, we used a visual hand mental rotation (MR) paradigm to manipulate the processing of motor imagery while event related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 42 SCZ participants and 40 healthy controls (HC). The 400-600 ins window was measured and analyzed for peak latencies and amplitudes. Participants with SCZ had slower reaction time (RT) and made more errors than did HC participants. Moreover, SCZ participants had lower amplitudes in the 400-600 ms window and the typical MR function for amplitudes of MR was lacking. Interestingly, the scalp activity maps for MR in SCZ exhibited an absence of activation in the left parietal site as shown in HC. Furthermore, deficits of amplitude for MR were positively correlated with positive symptom scores in SCZ. These results provide novel evidence for relationships beLvveen the electrophysiological processing of motor imagery and positive symptoms iii SCZ. They further suggest that the impaired information processing of motor imagery indexed by amplitudes and specific topographic characteristics of the EEG during MR tasks may be a potentially useful and early defining biomarker for SCZ.

Here, we examined age-related differences in spatial attention by comparing healthy older and younger adults. Our key finding is that cue-induced alpha power lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults, even though both groups exhibited classic event-related potential signatures of spatial orienting. Specifically, both younger and older adults showed significant early directing-attention negativity (EDAN), anterior directing-attention negativity (ADAN), late directing-attention positivity (LDAP) and contingent negative variation (CNV). Furthermore, target-evoked sensory components were enhanced for attended relative to unattended targets in both younger and older groups. This pattern of results suggests that although older adults can successfully allocate spatial attention, they do so without the lateralization of alpha power that is commonly observed in younger adults. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that younger and older adults might engage different neural mechanisms for attentional orienting, and that alpha power lateralization during visual spatial attention is a phenomenon that diminishes during normal aging.

Conditioned and extinguished fear modulate functional corticocardiac coupling in humans	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Conditioning; Emotion; Learning; Normal volunteers; Cardiovascular; EEG	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; UNPLEASANT PICTURES; CENTRAL NUCLEUS; BRAIN; EXTINCTION; ANXIETY	Although the conditioned cardiac fear response is an important index of psychophysiological fear processing, underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. N=22 participants underwent differential fear conditioning and extinction with face pictures as conditioned stimuli (CS) and loud noise bursts as aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) on Day 1 and a recall test 1 day later. We assessed ERPs, evoked heart period (HP), and time-lagged within-subject correlations of single-trial EEG amplitude and HP as index for corticocardiac coupling in response to the CS. Fear-conditioned stimuli (CS+) triggered cardiac deceleration during fear acquisition and recall. Meanwhile, only during Day 1 acquisition, CS+ evoked larger late positivities in the ERP than CS-. Most importantly, during Day 2 recall, stimulus-evoked single-trial EEG responses in the time window between 250 and 500 ms predicted the magnitude of cardiac fear responses 2 to 5 s later. This marker of corticocardiac coupling selectively emerged in response to not previously extinguished CS+ but was absent in response to CS- or previously extinguished CS+. The present results provide first evidence that fear conditioning and extinction modulate functional corticocardiac coupling in humans. Underlying mechanisms may involve subcortical structures enhancing corticocardiac transmission to facilitate processing of consolidated conditioned fear.

Dissociation Between Attention and Consciousness During a Novel Task: An ERP Study	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						top-down attention; consciousness; ERP; psychophysical task; image stimuli	TOP-DOWN ATTENTION; VISUAL CONSCIOUSNESS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AWARENESS; PERCEPTION; DISTINCT; SCOPE	While consciousness and attention seem to be tightly connected, recent evidence has suggested that one of these processes can be present in the absence of the other. Recent researches showed that observers can pay attention to an invisible (unconscious) stimulus, and that a stimulus can be clearly perceived (seen) in the absence of attention. We have proposed a novel psychophysical task to explore neural correlates of top-down attention and consciousness. The task is meant to confirm that these two processes can occur independently of each other. EEG was recorded during realizations of the task, and target-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) for masked and unmasked conditions were constructed. Time features corresponding to the P100, N150, and P300 components were extracted for each channel separately. Utilizing these features, we employed some common classifiers for classification of the fourfold state. Our task could separate attention and consciousness successfully through their neural correlates. The results indicate that some of the mentioned components changed when attention or consciousness occurs. By comparing difference waves in each condition separately, our results introduce new ERP correlates of attention and consciousness. We also revealed that parieto-occipital areas are the most relevant areas for dissociation between attention and consciousness. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these correlates are introduced in a separable mode, and the classification accuracies are reported for this purpose.	[Davoodi, R.; Moradi, M.

Subnormal sensory attenuation to self-generated speech in schizotypy: Electrophysiological evidence for a 'continuum of psychosis'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Sensory suppression; Schizophrenia; Schizotypy; Continuum of psychosis; Self-monitoring; Event-related potential (ERP)	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; TALKING; HUMANS	Background: A 'continuum of psychosis' refers to the concept that psychotic-like experiences occur to certain extents in the healthy population and to more severe extents in individuals with psychotic disorders. If this concept is valid, neurophysiological abnormalities exhibited by patients with schizophrenia should also be present, to some degree, in non-clinical individuals who score highly on the personality dimension of schizotypy. Patients with schizophrenia have consistently been shown to exhibit electrophysiological suppression abnormalities to self-generated speech. The present study aimed to investigate whether these electrophysiological suppression abnormalities were also present in non-clinical individuals who scored highly on schizotypy. Methods: Thirty-seven non-clinical individuals scoring High (above median) and 37 individuals scoring Low (below median) on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ; a commonly used schizotypy scale) underwent electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. The amplitude of the N1 component of the auditory-evoked potential was measured while participants (a) vocalized simple syllables (Talk condition), (b) passively listened to a recording of these vocalizations (Listen condition) and (c) listened to a recording of the vocalizations while simultaneously watching a video depicting the sound-wave of the forthcoming vocalizations, allowing them to be temporally predicted (Cued Listen condition). Results: The Low Schizotypy group exhibited significantly reduced N1-amplitude in the Talk condition relative to both the Listen and Cued Listen conditions; that is, they exhibited significant N1-suppression. The High Schizotypy group exhibited significantly lower levels of N1-suppression compared to the Low Schizotypy group. Furthermore, while the Cued Listen condition induced significantly lower N1-amplitudes compared to the Listen condition in the Low Schizotypy group, this was not the case for the High Schizotypy group. Conclusions: The results suggest that non-clinical, highly schizotypal individuals exhibit subnormal levels of N1-suppression to self-generated speech, similar to the N1-suppression abnormalities which have previously been reported in patients with schizophrenia. This finding provides empirical support for the existence of a neurophysiological 'continuum of psychosis'. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Oestreich, Lena K.

Previous findings from neuroscientific research indicate an enhanced motivational attention toward cues related to computer games, similar to findings in substance-related addictions. On the other hand in clinical observational studies tolerance effects are reported by patients with Internet Gaming disorder. In the present study we investigated whether an enhanced motivational attention or tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder. Methods: A clinical sample from the Outpatient Clinic for Behavioral Addictions in Mainz, Germany was recruited, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder. In a semi-natural EEG design participants played a computer game during the recording of event-related potentials to assess reward processing. Results: The results indicated an attenuated P300 for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder in response to rewards in comparison to healthy controls, while the latency of N100 was prolonged and the amplitude of N100 was increased. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, when actively playing computer games. In addition, the initial orienting toward the gaming reward is suggested to consume more capacity for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, which has been similarly reported by other studies with other methodological background in disorders of substance-related addictions.

Event related potentials (ERPs) in Go/NoGo tasks have been widely used in studying executive processes. In this study, ERPs were obtained from EEG recorded during performance of a cued Go/NoGo task. The Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) and P3NoGo waves were decomposed into four independent components (ICs), by applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to a collection of ERPs from 193 healthy individuals. The components were named IC CNVearly, IC CNVlate, IC P3NoGo(early) and IC P3NoGo(late) according to the conditions and time interval in which they occurred. A sub-group of 28 individuals was also assessed with neuropsychological tests. The test parameters were selected on the basis of studies demonstrating their sensitivity to executive processes as defined in the ROtman-Baycrest Battery for Investigating Attention (ROBBIA) model. The test scores were categorized into the domain scores of energization, monitoring and task setting and correlated with the amplitudes of the individual ICs from the sub-group of 28 individuals. The energization domain correlated with the IC CNVlate and IC P3NoGo(early). The monitoring domain correlated with the IC P3NoGo(late), while the task setting domain correlated with the IC CNVlate. The IC CNVearly was not correlated with any of the neuropsychological domain scores. The correlations between the domains and ICs remained largely unchanged when controlling for full-scale IQ. This is the first study to demonstrate that executive processes, as indexed by neuropsychological test parameters, are associated with particular event-related potentials in a cued Go/NoGo paradigm.

We demonstrate that the event-related potential component P400 encodes the congruency of power grasps at the age of 6 months (Experiment 1) and in 5-month-old infants that have developed the ability to use power grasps (Experiment 2). This effect does not extend to precision grasps, which infants cannot perform (Experiment 3). Our findings suggest that infants' encoding of the relationship between an object and a grasping hand (the action-perception link) is highly specialized to actions and manual configurations of actions that infants are able to perform.

J	Schubert, AL; Hagemann, D; Voss, A; Schankin, A; Bergmann, K				Schubert, Anna-Lena; Hagemann, Dirk; Voss, Andreas; Schankin, Andrea; Bergmann, Katharina			Decomposing the relationship between mental speed and mental abilities	INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Intelligence; Individual differences; Processing speed; Event-related potentials; Elementary cognitive tasks	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REACTION-TIME; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; DIFFUSION-MODEL; INSPECTION TIME; INTELLIGENCE; INFORMATION; UNITARY	It is unclear whether different elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) are associated with intelligence because these tasks tap the same basic cognitive process (suggesting a single mental speed factor) or different ones (suggesting several mental speed factors), as it is not known which specific cognitive processes are measured in ECTs and because the factor structure of these processes is unknown. To address these questions, 40 participants (50% males) between 18 and 75 years drawn from a community sample completed the Hick paradigm, the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm, and the Posner letter matching paradigm while an EEG was recorded. We applied a diffusion model approach to the response-time data, which allows the mathematical decomposition of different cognitive parameters involved in speeded binary decisions. Behavioral and electrophysiological results indicated that ECT conditions varied in different neuro-cognitive components of information processing. Further analyses revealed that all speed and latency variables had substantial loadings on a second-order general factor marked by general intelligence, and that the association between ERP latencies and general intelligence was mediated by reaction times. These results suggest that there is a general neuro-cognitive speed factor across different tasks and different levels of measurement that is associated with general intelligence.

By using Neuroscan40 lead event related brain potentials instrument, EEG signal was recorded. AR model and the coherent averaging method were used to remove baseline drift and the spontaneous EEG interference. The Bicoherence Spectrum was used to analyze the phase-coupling of different EEG rhythms. The result shows that under the audio-visual emotional stimuli, compared with the quiet state, phase-coupling of delta, theta, and alpha rhythms were reduced, but phase-coupling between theta rhythm and gamma rhythm was increased. Emotion cognition activity is not only related to phase-coupling between theta-gamma rhythms but also related to gamma rhythm. Phase-coupling of beta rhythm was increased only when the stimulus was the positive emotion. This research can be applied to the emotion recognition and brain cognitive science.

The meditation practice of Zazen, like many other meditation practices, aims at disregarding intrusive thoughts while controlling body posture. It is an open monitoring meditation characterized by detached moment-to-moment awareness and reduced conceptual thinking and self-reference. Which brain areas differ in electric activity during Zazen compared to task-free resting? Since scalp electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms are reference-dependent, conclusions about the localization of active brain areas are ambiguous. Computing intracerebral source models from the scalp EEG data solves this problem. In the present study, we applied source modeling using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to 58-channel scalp EEG data recorded from 15 experienced Zen meditators during Zazen and no-task resting. Zazen compared to no-task resting showed increased alpha-1 and alpha-2 frequency activity in an exclusively right-lateralized cluster extending from prefrontal areas including the insula to parts of the somatosensory and motor cortices and temporal areas. Zazen also showed decreased alpha and beta-2 activity in the left angular gyrus and decreased beta-1 and beta-2 activity in a large bilateral posterior cluster comprising the visual cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the parietal cortex. The results include parts of the default mode network and suggest enhanced automatic memory and emotion processing, reduced conceptual thinking and self-reference on a less judgmental, i.e., more detached moment-to-moment basis during Zazen compared to no-task resting.

Visuo-tactile interactions in the congenitally deaf: a behavioral and event-related potential study	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deafness; cross-modal plasticity; multisensory processing; race model; redundant signals effect	CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; EVOKED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; ENHANCEMENT; HEARING; BLIND; TOUCH; CORTEX; HUMANS	Auditory deprivation is known to be accompanied by alterations in visual processing. Yet not much is known about tactile processing and the interplay of the intact sensory modalities in the deaf. We presented visual, tactile, and visuo-tactile stimuli to congenitally deaf and hearing individuals in a speeded detection task. Analyses of multisensory responses showed a redundant signals effect that was attributable to a coactivation mechanism in both groups, although the redundancy gain was less in the deaf. In line with these behavioral results, on a neural level, there were multisensory interactions in both groups that were again weaker in the deaf. In hearing but not deaf participants, somatosensory event-related potential N200 latencies were modulated by simultaneous visual stimulation. A comparison of unisensory responses between groups revealed larger N200 amplitudes for visual and shorter N200 latencies for tactile stimuli in the deaf. Furthermore, P300 amplitudes were also larger in the deaf. This group difference was significant for tactile and approached significance for visual targets. The differences in visual and tactile processing between deaf and hearing participants, however, were not reflected in behavior. Both the behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) results suggest more pronounced multisensory interaction in hearing than in deaf individuals. Visuo-tactile enhancements could not be explained by perceptual deficiency, but could be partly attributable to inverse effectiveness.

Methods: This prospective longitudinal study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the temporal dynamics of changes in the auditory cortex contralateral and ipsilateral to the CI. Postlingually deafened CI recipients (N = 11; mean: 59 years) performed an auditory frequency discrimination task after <1 week, 8 weeks, 15 weeks, and 59 weeks of CI use. Results: The CI users revealed a remarkable improvement in auditory discrimination ability which was most pronounced over the first eight weeks of CI experience. At the same time, CI users developed N1 auditory event-related potentials (AEP) with significantly enhanced amplitude and decreased latency, both in the auditory cortex contralateral and ipsilateral to the CI. A relationship was found between the duration of deafness and the ipsilateral AEP latency. Conclusions: Postlingually deafened adult CI users show rapid adaptation of the bilateral auditory cortex. Cortical plasticity is limited after long duration of auditory deprivation. Significance: The finding of rapid and limited cortical changes in adult CI recipients may be of clinical relevance and can help estimate the role of plasticity for therapeutic gain.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether these impairments can be identified early in life using electrophysiological auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) and mismatch negativity (MMN). Brain responses to speech and non-speech stimuli were assessed in prematurely born children to identify early electrophysiological markers of language and cognitive impairments. Participants were 74 children (41 full-term, 33 preterm) aged 3, 12, and 36 months. Pre-attentional auditory responses (MMN and AERPs) were assessed using an oddball paradigm, with speech and non-speech stimuli presented in counterbalanced order between participants. Language and cognitive development were assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Results show that preterms as young as 3 months old had delayed MMN response to speech stimuli compared to full-terms. A significant negative correlation was also found between MMN latency to speech sounds and the BSID-III expressive language subscale. However, no significant differences between full-terms and preterms were found for the MMN to non-speech stimuli, suggesting preserved pre-attentional auditory discrimination abilities in these children. Identification of early electrophysiological markers for delayed language development could facilitate timely interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heightened performance monitoring is also associated with psychopathology such as internalizing disorders. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential link between the functional opioid peptide prodynorphin (PDYN) 68 bp VNTR genetic polymorphism and neuronal correlates of performance monitoring. To this end, 47 healthy participants genotyped for this polymorphism, related to high-, intermediate-, and low-expression levels of PDYN, performed a choice-reaction task while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. On the behavioural level, no differences between the three PDYN groups could be observed. EEG data, however, showed significant differences. High PDYN expression individuals showed heightened neural error processing indicated by higher ERN amplitudes, compared to intermediate and low expression individuals. Later stages of error processing, indexed by late Pe amplitudes, and stimulus-driven conflict processing, indexed by N2 amplitudes, were not affected by PDYN genotype. The current results corroborate the notion of an indirect effect of endogenous opioids on performance monitoring, probably mediated by the mesencephalic dopamine system. Overall, enhanced ERN amplitudes suggest a hyper-active performance monitoring system in high PDYN expression individuals, and this might also be an indicator of a higher risk for internalizing disorders.

Significance of multiple neurophysiological measures in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Disorders of consciousness; Evoked potentials; EEG; Relative power; Sleep score; Cluster analysis	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; WAKEFULNESS SYNDROME; POSTTRAUMATIC COMA; CRS-R; EEG; SLEEP; RECOVERY	Objective: The aim of this study was to verify the value of multiple neurophysiological tests in classifying disorders of consciousness (DOCs) in patients in a chronic vegetative or minimal consciousness state categorised on the basis of the Coma Recovery Scale (CRS). Methods: The study included 142 patients, all of whom underwent long (18 h) EEG-polygraphic recordings including one night. The EEG was scored using the Synek scale and sleep patterns using an arbitrary scale. Absolute total power and relative EEG power were evaluated in different frequency bands. Multimodal evoked potentials (EPs), including auditory event-related potentials, were also evaluated and scored. Results: The most information came from the combined multimodal EPs and sleep EEG scores. A two-step cluster analysis based on the collected information allowed a satisfactory evaluation of DOC severity. Spectral EEG properties seemed to be significantly related to DOC classes and CRS scores, but did not seem to make any significant additional contribution to DOC classification. Conclusions: Multiple electrophysiological evaluations based on EEG, sleep polygraphic recordings and multimodal EPs are helpful in assessing DOC severity and residual functioning in patients with chronic DOCs.

We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate that tactile WM representations are stored in modality-specific cortical regions, that the goal-directed modulation of these representations is mediated through hemispheric-specific activation of somatosensory areas, and that the rehearsal of somatotopic coordinates in memory is accomplished by modality-specific spatial attention mechanisms. Participants encoded two tactile sample stimuli presented simultaneously to the left and right hands, before visual retro-cues indicated which of these stimuli had to be retained to be matched with a subsequent test stimulus on the same hand. Retro-cues triggered a sustained tactile contralateral delay activity component with a scalp topography over somatosensory cortex contralateral to the cued hand. Early somatosensory ERP components to task-irrelevant probe stimuli (that were presented after the retro-cues) and to subsequent test stimuli were enhanced when these stimuli appeared at the currently memorized location relative to other locations on the cued hand, demonstrating that a precise focus of spatial attention was established during the selective maintenance of tactile events in WM. These effects were observed regardless of whether participants performed the matching task with uncrossed or crossed hands, indicating that WM representations in this task were based on somatotopic rather than allocentric spatial coordinates. In conclusion, spatial rehearsal in tactile WM operates within somatotopically organized sensory brain areas that have been recruited for information storage.

Attentional bias to affective faces and complex IAPS images in early visual cortex follows emotional cue extraction	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Human EEG; Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs); Attention-emotion interaction; Temporal dynamics of competition for processing resources; N170; EPN	SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TIME-COURSE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; FEARFUL FACES; ABRUPT ONSETS; HUMAN BRAIN; PROCESSING RESOURCES; DIRECTED ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ERP EVIDENCE	Emotionally arousing stimuli are known to rapidly draw the brain's processing resources, even when they are task-irrelevant. The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) response, a neural response to a flickering stimulus which effectively allows measurement of the processing resources devoted to that stimulus, has been used to examine this process of attentional shifting. Previous studies have used a task in which participants detected periods of coherent motion in flickering random dot kinematograms (RDKs) which generate an SSVEP, and found that task-irrelevant emotional stimuli withdraw more attentional resources from the task-relevant RDKs than task-irrelevant neutral stimuli. However, it is not clear whether the emotion-related differences in the SSVEP response are conditional on higher-level extraction of emotional cues as indexed by well-known event-related potential (ERPs) components (N170, early posterior negativity, EPN), or if affective bias in competition for visual attention resources is a consequence of a time-invariant shifting process. In the present study, we used two different types of emotional distractors - IAPS pictures and facial expressions - for which emotional cue extraction occurs at different speeds, being typically earlier for faces (at similar to 170 ms, as indexed by the N170) than for IAPS images (similar to 220-280 ms, EPN). We found that emotional modulation of attentional resources as measured by the SSVEP occurred earlier for faces (around 180 ms) than for IAPS pictures (around 550 ms), after the extraction of emotional cues as indexed by visual ERP components. This is consistent with emotion related re-allocation of attentional resources occurring after emotional cue extraction rather than being linked to a time-fixed shifting process.

The approach utilizes the high temporal resolution nature of EEG to compute a current density mapping of the cortical activity, informed by the high spatial resolution fMRI in a time-variant, spatially selective manner. This method was implemented in the analysis of an EEG/fMRI study on motor activation in responses to a visual stimulus that evoked an emotional response. The processed windowed EEG signals were analyzed to select the temporally relevant partial fMRI mapping, which in turn was used to inform EEG source localization calculation. The results were compared against traditional fMRI-informed EEG approaches to demonstrate the spatiotemporal variant fMRI constraints feature as well as the performance of the developed method.

Yet little research has examined their joint relations with such processing impairment. The current study examines the relation between symptoms of depression, binge drinking, and the magnitude of early (early posterior negativity, EPN) and later (P3 and late positive potential, LPP) visual processing components of affectively negative, positive, and neutral visual stimuli. Participants included 42 undergraduate students recruited on the basis of depressive symptoms. Results of repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs; Depression X Binge X Emotion X Laterality) showed that binge drinkers exhibited lower LPP amplitudes for negative images, compared with nonbinge drinkers, regardless of depression, consistent with motivational models of alcohol abuse. Otherwise, differences across depressed and nondepressed groups were largest among binge drinkers, including a pattern of stronger early attentional engagement (EPN) to negative and neutral images, but decreased later processing (P3 and LPP) across all emotional categories, consistent with a vigilance-avoidance response pattern.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the spectral content of brainwaves and connectivity at resting state have been associated with early-stage AD. Recently, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have entered into the picture as an easy to perform screening test. Motivated by the recent findings about the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in cognition, we introduce a relevant methodological approach for detecting MCI based on cognitive responses from a standard auditory oddball paradigm. By using the single trial signals recorded at Pz sensor and comparing the responses to target and non-target stimuli, we first demonstrate that increased CFC is associated with the cognitive task. Then, considering the dynamic character of CFC, we identify instances during which the coupling between particular pairs of brainwave frequencies carries sufficient information for discriminating between normal subjects and patients with MCI. In this way, we form a multiparametric signature of impaired cognition. The new composite biomarker was tested using data from a cohort that consists of 25 amnestic MCI patients and 15 age-matched controls. Standard machine-learning algorithms were employed so as to implement the binary classification task. Based on leave-one-out cross validation, the measured classification rate was found reaching very high levels (95%). Our approach compares favorably with the traditional alternative of using the morphology of averaged ERP response to make the diagnosis and the usage of features from spectro-temporal analysis of single-trial responses. This further indicates that task related CFC measurements can provide invaluable analytics in AD diagnosis and prognosis.

It is unclear, however, whether these abnormalities are related to severity of illness or are a marker for risk. This study investigated total and evoked theta and delta activity in schizophrenia patients, unaffected siblings, and healthy controls (HCs). EEG data were recorded whilst 24 individuals with schizophrenia, 26 unaffected siblings of individuals with schizophrenia and 26 healthy control participants completed a Go/No-Go task. Event-related total activity and evoked theta and delta activity were calculated for correct hits (CH), failed inhibitions (FI) and correct inhibitions (CI) trials. Patients displayed significantly less total delta, evoked delta, total theta and evoked theta activity when compared with healthy controls. Unaffected siblings displayed abnormalities of evoked delta, but other measures were similar to those in control participants. The findings of this study add to evidence that abnormal low-frequency EEG oscillations contribute to impairments in information processing seen in schizophrenia. These findings also suggest abnormal evoked delta oscillations are associated with an increased familial risk of developing the disorder. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Most of them demonstrate deficits in schizophrenia, show at least moderate stability over time and do not depend on clinical status, which means that they fulfil the criteria as valid endophenotypes for genetic studies. Deficits in cortical inhibition and plasticity measured using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques seem promising markers of outcome and prognosis. However the utility of these markers as biomarkers for predicting conversion to psychosis, response to treatments, or for tracking disease progression needs to be further studied.

Although clinically highly relevant, the neural mechanisms underlying placebo anxiolysis are poorly understood. In two studies in humans, we tested whether the administration of an inactive treatment along with verbal suggestions of anxiolysis can attenuate experimentally induced states of phasic fear and/or sustained anxiety. Phasic fear is the response to a well defined threat and includes attentional focusing on the source of threat and concomitant phasic increases of autonomic arousal, whereas in sustained states of anxiety potential and unclear danger requires vigilant scanning of the environment and elevated tonic arousal levels. Our placebo manipulation consistently reduced vigilance measured in terms of undifferentiated reactivity to salient cues (indexed by subjective ratings, skin conductance responses and EEG event-related potentials) and tonic arousal [indexed by cue-unrelated skin conductance levels and enhanced EEG alpha (8 - 12 Hz) activity], indicating a downregulation of sustained anxiety rather than phasic fear. We also observed a placebo-dependent sustained increase of frontal midline EEG theta (4 - 7 Hz) power and frontoposterior theta coupling, suggesting the recruitment of frontally based cognitive control functions. Our results thus support the crucial role of treatment expectations in placebo anxiolysis and provide insight into the underlying neural mechanisms.	[Meyer, Benjamin; Yuen, Kenneth S.

How these plastic changes affect the ability to integrate combined auditory (A) and visual (V) information is not yet well understood. In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine whether age, temporary deafness and altered sensory experience with a CI can affect audio visual (AV) interactions in post-lingually deafened CI users. Young and elderly Cl users and age-matched NH listeners performed a speeded response task on basic auditory, visual and audio visual stimuli. Regarding the behavioral results, a redundant signals effect, that is, faster response times to cross-modal (AV) than to both of the two modality-specific stimuli (A, V), was revealed for all groups of participants. Moreover, in all four groups, we found evidence for audio visual integration. Regarding event-related responses (ERPs), we observed a more pronounced visual modulation of the cortical auditory response at N1 latency (approximately 100 ms after stimulus onset) in the elderly Cl users when compared with young CI users and elderly NH listeners. Thus, elderly CI users showed enhanced audio visual binding which may be a consequence of compensatory strategies developed due to temporary deafness and/or degraded sensory input after implantation. These results indicate that the combination of aging, sensory deprivation and Cl facilitates the coupling between the auditory and the visual modality. We suggest that this enhancement in multisensory interactions could be used to optimize auditory rehabilitation, especially in elderly CI users, by the application of strong audio-visually based rehabilitation strategies after implant switch-on.

The triangle model implicates a direct orthography-to-semantics pathway and a phonologically mediated orthography-to-semantics pathway, which interact with each other. The temporal evolution of processing in these routes is not well understood, although theoretical evidence predicts early phonological processing followed by interactive phonological and semantic processing. Method: This study used electroencephalography-event-related potential (ERP) analysis and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localisation to identify temporal markers and the corresponding neural generators of these processes in early (similar to 200 ms) and late (similar to 400 ms) neurophysiological responses to visual words, pseudowords and consonant strings. Results: ERP showed an effect of phonology but not semantics in both time windows, although at 400 ms there was an effect of stimulus familiarity. Phonological processing at 200 ms was localised to the left occipitotemporal cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus. At 400 ms, there was continued phonological processing in the inferior frontal gyrus and additional semantic processing in the anterior temporal cortex. There was also an area in the left temporoparietal junction which was implicated in both phonological and semantic processing. In ERP, the semantic response at 400 ms appeared to be masked by concurrent processes relating to familiarity, while MEG successfully differentiated these processes. Discussion: The results support the prediction of early phonological processing followed by an interaction of phonological and semantic processing during word recognition. Neuroanatonnical loci of these processes are consistent with previous neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The results also have implications for the classical interpretation of N400-like responses as markers for semantic processing. (C) 2015 S.

Anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder are associated with abnormalities in processing visual information	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Dorsal/ventral visual streams; electroencephalography; event-related potential; face processing; house processing; joint ICA	CENTRAL COHERENCE; RATING-SCALE; EATING-DISORDERS; RECOGNITION; RELIABILITY; INTERVIEW; PATTERNS; DEFICITS; AUTISM; ADULTS	Background. Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by distorted body image and are frequently co-morbid with each other, although their relationship remains little studied. While there is evidence of abnormalities in visual and visuospatial processing in both disorders, no study has directly compared the two. We used two complementary modalities - event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - to test for abnormal activity associated with early visual signaling. Method. We acquired fMRI and ERP data in separate sessions from 15 unmedicated individuals in each of three groups (weight-restored AN, BDD, and healthy controls) while they viewed images of faces and houses of different spatial frequencies. We used joint independent component analyses to compare activity in visual systems. Results. AN and BDD groups demonstrated similar hypoactivity in early secondary visual processing regions and the dorsal visual stream when viewing low spatial frequency faces, linked to the N170 component, as well as in early secondary visual processing regions when viewing low spatial frequency houses, linked to the P100 component. Additionally, the BDD group exhibited hyperactivity in fusiform cortex when viewing high spatial frequency houses, linked to the N170 component. Greater activity in this component was associated with lower attractiveness ratings of faces. Conclusions. Results provide preliminary evidence of similar abnormal spatiotemporal activation in AN and BDD for configural/holistic information for appearance-and non-appearance-related stimuli. This suggests a common phenotype of abnormal early visual system functioning, which may contribute to perceptual distortions.

This activity reflects both the brain's background electrical activity and when the brain is being challenged by a task. Despite strong theoretical and methodological arguments for the use of EEG in understanding the neural correlates of autism, the practice of collecting, processing and evaluating EEG data is complex. Scientists should take into consideration both the nature of development in autism given the life-long, pervasive course of the disorder and the disability of altered or atypical social, communicative, and motor behaviors, all of which require accommodations to traditional EEG environments and paradigms. This paper presents guidelines for the recording, analyzing, and interpreting of EEG data with participants with autism.

Recent theory has proposed broad principles by which belief updating might operate, but more precise details of its implementation in the human brain remain unclear. In order to address this question, we studied how two components of the human event-related potential encoded different aspects of belief updating. Participants completed a novel perceptual learning task while electroencephalography was recorded. Participants learned the mapping between the contrast of a dynamic visual stimulus and a monetary reward and updated their beliefs about a target contrast on each trial. A Bayesian computational model was formulated to estimate belief states at each trial and was used to quantify the following two variables: belief update size and belief uncertainty. Robust single-trial regression was used to assess how these model-derived variables were related to the amplitudes of the P3 and the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), respectively. Results showed a positive relationship between belief update size and P3 amplitude at one fronto-central electrode, and a negative relationship between SPN amplitude and belief uncertainty at a left central and a right parietal electrode. These results provide evidence that belief update size and belief uncertainty have distinct neural signatures that can be tracked in single trials in specific ERP components. This, in turn, provides evidence that the cognitive mechanisms underlying belief updating in humans can be described well within a Bayesian framework.

Studies in which T2 consisted of a pop-out search array provided evidence suggesting that visual search is postponed during the AB. In the present work, we used behavioral and electrophysiological measures to test this postponement hypothesis. The behavioral measure was reaction time (RT) to T2; the electrophysiological measure was the onset latency of an ERP index of attentional selection, known as the N2pc. Consistent with the postponement hypothesis, both measures were delayed during the AB. The delay in N2pc was substantially shorter than that in RT, pointing to multiple sources of delay in the chain of processing events, as distinct from the single source postulated in current theories of the AB. Finally, the finding that the N2pc was delayed during the AB strongly suggests that attention is involved in the processing of pop-out search arrays.	[Lagroix, Hayley E.

This article proposes a feature extraction method for P300 detection. This method combines discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with Fisher criterion. This method, firstly transforms the EEG signal into wavelet domain by DWT. Then, the feature space where best distinguish two kinds of EEG signals will be found by means of Fisher criterion. Finally, a feature extraction matrix will be constructed to extract feature vector from EEG signals. The method was tested on EEG data that obtained by P300 Speller paradigm. The result shows that, the proposed method is better than the existing method used in BCI2000, in terms of averaged accuracy over 238 runs.

Emotion and goal-directed behavior: ERP evidence on cognitive and emotional conflict	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion; cognitive control; conflict processing; cognitive conflict; emotional conflict	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; CONTROL MECHANISMS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; RESOLVE CONFLICT	Cognitive control supports goal-directed behavior by resolving conflict among opposing action tendencies. Emotion can trigger cognitive control processes, thus speeding up conflict processing when the target dimension of stimuli is emotional. However, it is unclear what role emotionality of the target dimension plays in the processing of emotional conflict (e.g. in irony). In two EEG experiments, we compared the influence of emotional valence of the target (emotional, neutral) in cognitive and emotional conflict processing. To maximally approximate real-life communication, we used audiovisual stimuli. Participants either categorized spoken vowels (cognitive conflict) or their emotional valence (emotional conflict), while visual information was congruent or incongruent. Emotional target dimension facilitated both cognitive and emotional conflict processing, as shown in a reduced reaction time conflict effect. In contrast, the N100 in the event-related potentials showed a conflict-specific reversal: the conflict effect was larger for emotional compared with neutral trials in cognitive conflict and smaller in emotional conflict. Additionally, domain-general conflict effects were observed in the P200 and N200 responses. The current findings confirm that emotions have a strong influence on cognitive and emotional conflict processing. They also highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of the interaction of emotion with different types of conflict.

However, this is rarely taken into account in neuroscience studies. Here, we investigate how the implied source of single word statements alters their cortical processing. Participants' brain event-related potentials were recorded in response to identical word streams consisting of positive, negative, and neutral trait adjectives stated to either represent personal trait feedback from a human or to be randomly generated by a computer. Results showed a strong impact of perceived sender. Regardless of content, the notion of receiving feedback from a human enhanced all components, starting with the P2 and encompassing early posterior negativity (EPN), P3, and the late positive potential (LPP). Moreover, negative feedback by the "human sender" elicited a larger EPN, whereas positive feedback generally induced a larger LPP. Source estimations revealed differences between "senders" in visual areas, particularly the bilateral fusiform gyri. Likewise, emotional content enhanced activity in these areas. These results specify how even implied sender identity changes the processing of single words in seemingly realistic communicative settings, amplifying their processing in the visual brain. This suggests that the concept of motivated attention extends from stimulus significance to simultaneous appraisal of contextual relevance. Finally, consistent with distinct stages of emotional processing, at least in contexts perceived as social, humans are initially alerted to negative content, but later process what is perceived as positive feedback more intensely.

The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of yoga exercise on women with PMS and to evaluate the immediate change of attention performance after yoga classes. Methods: This study examined the attention task results of women with PMS. Eleven women with PMS and 9 women without PMS were recruited. The PMS group took the tests before and immediately after the yoga class both in the luteal and follicular phase of one menstrual cycle, while the control group took the tests only twice: once in the luteal phase and once in the follicular phase. Both groups were required to finish resting electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive task of the 2-back task with EEG recording. Results: The alpha brain wave percentage was higher immediately after yoga exercise in the PMS group. This suggests that the participants felt more relaxed or were in a more peaceful mental condition after yoga exercise. In the 2-back task, the PMS group needed a longer reaction time to respond to the target stimulus in the luteal phase and performed better with higher accuracy and shorter reaction time after yoga exercise. The event-related potentials of the EEG recording displayed a significant variability at the P3 amplitude throughout the menstrual cycle in the PMS group, but the P3 amplitude was unchanged throughout the menstrual cycle in the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that women with PMS could attend short-term yoga exercise in the luteal phase to make themselves feel better and maintain a better attention level.

J	Pegna, AJ; Gehring, E; Meyer, G; Del Zotto, M				Pegna, Alan John; Gehring, Elise; Meyer, Georg; Del Zotto, Marzia			Direction of Biological Motion Affects Early Brain Activation: A Link with Social Cognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POINT-LIGHT; BODY PERCEPTION; ERP; RECOGNITION; MOVEMENT; DISPLAYS; GENDER; EXPRESSIONS; PATTERNS	A number of EEG studies have investigated the time course of brain activation for biological movement over this last decade, however the temporal dynamics of processing are still debated. Moreover, the role of direction of movement has not received much attention even though it is an essential component allowing us to determine the intentions of the moving agent, and thus permitting the anticipation of potential social interactions. In this study, we examined event-related responses (ERPs) in 15 healthy human participants to light point walkers and their scrambled counterparts, whose movements occurred either in the radial or in the lateral plane. Compared to scrambled motion (SM), biological motion (BM) showed an enhanced negativity between 210 and 360ms. A source localization algorithm (sLORETA) revealed that this was due to an increase in superior and middle temporal lobe activity. Regarding direction, we found that radial BM produced an enhanced P1 compared to lateral BM, lateral SM and radial SM. This heightened P1 was due to an increase in activity in extrastriate regions, as well as in superior temporal, medial parietal and medial prefrontal areas. This network is known to be involved in decoding the underlying intentionality of the movement and in the attribution of mental states. The social meaning signaled by the direction of biological motion therefore appears to trigger an early response in brain activity.

Improvement in Visual Search with Practice: Mapping Learning-Related Changes in Neurocognitive Stages of Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; EEG; learning; LRP; N2pc; visual search	WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTION; BRAIN	Practice can improve performance on visual search tasks; the neural mechanisms underlying such improvements, however, are not clear. Response time typically shortens with practice, but which components of the stimulus-response processing chain facilitate this behavioral change? Improved search performance could result from enhancements in various cognitive processing stages, including (1) sensory processing, (2) attentional allocation, (3) target discrimination, (4) motor-response preparation, and/or (5) response execution. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) as human participants completed a five-day visual-search protocol in which they reported the orientation of a color popout target within an array of ellipses. We assessed changes in behavioral performance and in ERP components associated with various stages of processing. After practice, response time decreased in all participants (while accuracy remained consistent), and electrophysiological measures revealed modulation of several ERP components. First, amplitudes of the early sensory-evoked N1 component at 150 ms increased bilaterally, indicating enhanced visual sensory processing of the array. Second, the negative-polarity posterior-contralateral component (N2pc, 170-250 ms) was earlier and larger, demonstrating enhanced attentional orienting. Third, the amplitude of the sustained posterior contralateral negativity component (SPCN, 300-400 ms) decreased, indicating facilitated target discrimination. Finally, faster motor-response preparation and execution were observed after practice, as indicated by latency changes in both the stimulus-locked and response-locked lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs). These electrophysiological results delineate the functional plasticity in key mechanisms underlying visual search with high temporal resolution and illustrate how practice influences various cognitive and neural processing stages leading to enhanced behavioral performance.

Intriguingly, very little research has examined the relationship between neural processes involved in reward-anticipation and reward-outcome. To investigate this, one needs to consider the heterogeneity of reward-processing within each stage. To identify different stages of reward processing, we adapted a reward time-estimation task. While EEG data were recorded, participants were instructed to button-press 3.5 s after the onset of an Anticipation-Cue and received monetary reward for good time-estimation on the Reward trials, but not on No-Reward trials. We first separated reward-anticipation into event related potentials (ERPs) occurring at three sub-stages: reward/no-reward cue-evaluation, motor-preparation and feedback-anticipation. During reward/no-reward cue-evaluation, the Reward-Anticipation Cue led to a smaller N2 and larger P3. During motor-preparation, we report, for the first time, that the Reward-Anticipation Cue enhanced the Readiness Potential (RP), starting approximately 1 s before movement. At the subsequent feedback-anticipation stage, the Reward-Anticipation Cue elevated the Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN). We also separated reward-outcome ERPs into different components occurring at different time-windows: the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), Feedback-P3 (FB-P3) and Late-Positive Potentials (LPP). Lastly, we examined the relationship between reward-anticipation and reward-outcome ERPs. We report that individual-differences in specific reward-anticipation ERPs uniquely predicted specific reward-outcome ERPs. In particular, the reward-anticipation Early-RP (1-.8 s before movement) predicted early reward-outcome ERPs (FRN and FB-P3), whereas, the reward-anticipation SPN most strongly predicted a later reward-outcome ERP (LPP). Results have important implications for understanding the nature of the relationship between reward-anticipation and reward-outcome neural-processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the study, subjects viewed 1-sec-long video clips with a stone approaching straightforward and were required to perceive whether they were able to catch the outline of stone. Peak amplitude of each part was extracted from PO3 electrode located at the occipital region corresponding visual processing and cognition. Three components were conspicuously observed in the periods: 650-800 ms, 800-900 ms and 1150-1250 ms, which were called N310, N480 and N810 in this paper. N310 related to the perception to the initial stage of movement. Movement indepth could be immediately perceived when initial speed was not less than 3 m/s. N480 related to the perception to acceleration/deceleration. N810 related to the perception to the point a movement was about to vanish. Subjects couldn't perceive the outline with the final speed more than 3 m/s. For 3 m/s, subjects were in a dilemma to judge with the detecting rate 54%. Together, component analysis combined with behavioral results, it was supposed that 3 m/s to be the threshold to completely perceive the outline.

Traumatic brain injury detection using electrophysiological methods	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						event-related potentials; EEG; traumatic brain injury; gEEG; non-linear dynamical analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; MULTISCALE ENTROPY ANALYSIS; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; EEG POWER SPECTRA; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DISTURBED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	Measuring neuronal activity with electrophysiological methods may be useful in detecting neurological dysfunctions, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This approach may be particularly valuable for rapid detection in at-risk populations including military service members and athletes. Electrophysiological methods, such as quantitative electroencephalography (gEEG) and recording event-related potentials (ERPs) may be promising; however, the field is nascent and significant controversy exists on the efficacy and accuracy of the approaches as diagnostic tools. For example, the specific measures derived from an electroencephalogram (EEG) that are most suitable as markers of dysfunction have not been clearly established. A study was conducted to summarize and evaluate the statistical rigor of evidence on the overall utility of gEEG as an mTBI detection tool. The analysis evaluated gEEG measures/parameters that may be most suitable as fieldable diagnostic tools, identified other types of EEG measures and analysis methods of promise, recommended specific measures and analysis methods for further development as mTBI detection tools, identified research gaps in the field, and recommended future research and development thrust areas. The gEEG study group formed the following conclusions: (1) Individual gEEG measures provide limited diagnostic utility for mTBI. However, many measures can be important features of gEEG discriminant functions, which do show significant promise as mTBI detection tools. (2) ERPs offer utility in mTBI detection. In fact, evidence indicates that ERPs can identify abnormalities in cases where EEGs alone are non-disclosing. (3)The standard mathematical procedures used in the characterization of mTBI EEGs should be expanded to incorporate newer methods of analysis including non-linear dynamical analysis, complexity measures, analysis of causal interactions, graph theory, and information dynamics. (4) Reports of high specificity in gEEG evaluations of TBI must be interpreted with care. High specificities have been reported in carefully constructed clinical studies in which healthy controls were compared against a carefully selected TBI population. The published literature indicates, however, that similar abnormalities in gEEG measures are observed in other neuropsychiatric disorders. While it may be possible to distinguish a clinical patient from a healthy control participant with this technology, these measures are unlikely to discriminate between, for example, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or TBI. The specificities observed in these clinical studies may well be lost in real world clinical practice. (5)The absence of specificity does not preclude clinical utility. The possibility of use as a longitudinal measure of treatment response remains. However, efficacy as a longitudinal clinical measure does require acceptable test-retest reliability. To date, very few test retest reliability studies have been published with gEEG data obtained from TBI patients or from healthy controls. This is a particular concern because high variability is a known characteristic of the injured central nervous system.

Variants Near CCK Receptors are Associated With Electrophysiological Responses to Pre-pulse Startle Stimuli in a Mexican American Cohort	TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Mexican Americans; startle response; EEG; ERP; alcohol dependence	SENSORIMOTOR GATING DEFICITS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ANXIETY DISORDERS; GENE POLYMORPHISM; SELECT POPULATION; DRUG-ABUSE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Neurophysiological measurements of the response to pre-pulse and startle stimuli have been suggested to represent an important endophenotype for both substance dependence and other select psychiatric disorders. We have previously shown, in young adult Mexican Americans (MA), that presentation of a short delay acoustic pre-pulse, prior to the startle stimuli can elicit a late negative component at about 400 msec (N4S), in the event-related potential (ERP), recorded from frontal cortical areas. In the present study, we investigated whether genetic factors associated with this endophenotype could be identified. The study included 420 (age 18-30 years) MA men (n = 170), and women (n = 250). DNA was genotyped using an Affymetrix Axiom Exome1A chip. An association analysis revealed that the CCKAR and CCKBR (cholecystokinin A and B receptor) genes each had a nearby variant that showed suggestive significance with the amplitude of the N4S component to pre-pulse stimuli. The neurotransmitter cholecystokinin (CCK), along with its receptors, CCKAR and CCKBR, have been previously associated with psychiatric disorders, suggesting that variants near these genes may play a role in the pre-pulse/startle response in this cohort.

Objective measurement of visual resolution using the P300 to self-facial images	DOCUMENTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA			English	Article						Visual acuity; P300; Attention; ERP; Face; Malingering; Spatial frequency; Objective testing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ACUITY ASSESSMENT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; PROBABILITY; CONTRAST; COMPONENTS	Objective To assess visual acuity objectively "beyond V1", the P300 event-related potential is a promising candidate and closely associated with conscious perception. However, the P300 can be willfully modulated, a disadvantage for objective visual acuity estimation. Faces are very salient stimuli and difficult to ignore. Here, we present a P300-type paradigm to assess visual acuity with faces. Methods Gray-scale portraits of the respective subject served as oddball stimuli (probability 1/7), scrambled versions of these as the standard stimuli (probability 6/7). Furthermore, stimuli were spatially high-pass filtered (at 0, 2.2, 4.2 and 8.3 cpd), making them recognizable only with sufficient acuity. Acuity was systematically reduced by dioptric blur, chosen individually to render faces unrecognizable when high-passed at a parts per thousand yen 4.2 cpd. EEG was recorded from 11 subjects at 32 scalp positions and re-referenced to the average of TP9 and TP10. One of the rare face variants was designated as target, for which a button had to be pressed. Results The event-related potential was dominated by the P300 at 300-800 ms. All subjects had a significant (P < 0.05) P300 for 0- to 8.3-cpd filtering. When vision was blurred, the fraction of significant P300 responses to 8.3-cpd filtered faces dropped to 18 %, but stayed at 100 % for 4.2 cpd. Another component, the vertex positive potential (VPP) at 170 ms, was undetectable in most participants with blur and all levels of filtering, even when the images were recognizable. Conclusions The study demonstrates the feasibility of a face-based P300 approach to objectively assess visual acuity. The sensitivity to stimulus degradation was comparable to that of a grating-based approach as previously reported. An unexpected finding was the differing behavior of the P300 and the VPP. The VPP was quite sensitive to high-pass filtering, while the P300 sustained stronger filtering, although for its generation, the faces must also be discriminated from scrambled faces.

Use of genetic algorithm for the selection of EEG features	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL MODELING IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES (IC-MSQUARE2015)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Mathematical Modeling in Physical Sciences (IC-MSquare)	JUN 05-08, 2015	Mykonos, GREECE					Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a popular optimization technique that can detect the global optimum of a multivariable function containing several local optima. GA has been widely used in the field of biomedical informatics, especially in the context of designing decision support systems that classify biomedical signals or images into classes of interest. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology, based on GA, for the selection of the optimal subset of features that can be used for the efficient classification of Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are recorded during the observation of correct or incorrect actions. In our experiment, ERP recordings were acquired from sixteen (16) healthy volunteers who observed correct or incorrect actions of other subjects. The brain electrical activity was recorded at 47 locations on the scalp. The GA was formulated as a combinatorial optimizer for the selection of the combination of electrodes that maximizes the performance of the Fuzzy C Means (FCM) classification algorithm. In particular, during the evolution of the GA, for each candidate combination of electrodes, the well-known (Sigma, Phi, Omega) features were calculated and were evaluated by means of the FCM method. The proposed methodology provided a combination of 8 electrodes, with classification accuracy 93.8%. Thus, GA can be the basis for the selection of features that discriminate ERP recordings of observations of correct or incorrect actions.

Nicolas			Electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of proactive and reactive control in a rewarded stop-signal task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Response inhibition; Reward; Proactive control; Reactive control; Event-related potentials	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVATION; N2/P3 COMPLEX; PROBABILITY; CHILDREN	Reward availability is known to facilitate various cognitive operations, which is usually studied in cue-based paradigms that allow for enhanced preparation in reward-related trials. However, recent research using tasks that signal reward availability via task-relevant stimuli suggests that reward can also rapidly promote performance independent of global strategic preparation. Notably, this effect was also observed in a reward-related stop-signal task, in which behavioral measures of inhibition speed were found to be shorter in trials signaling reward. Corresponding fMRI results implied that this effect relies on boosted reactive control as indicated by increased activity in the 'inhibition-related network' in the reward-related condition. Here, we used EEG to better characterize transient modulations of attentional processes likely preceding this ultimate implementation of response inhibition. Importantly, such modulations would probably reflect enhanced proactive control in the form of more top-down attention to reward-related features. Counter to the notion that behavioral benefits would rely purely on reactive control, we found increased stop-evoked attentional processing (larger N1 component) on reward-related trials. This effect was accompanied by enhanced frontal P3 amplitudes reflecting successful stopping, and earlier and larger ERP differences between successful and failed stop trials in the reward-related condition. Finally, more global proactive control processes in the form of a reward context modulation of reward-unrelated trials did not have an effect on stopping performance but did influence attentional processing of go stimuli. Together, these results suggest that proactive and reactive processes can interact to bring about stimulus-specific reward benefits when the task precludes differential global preparation.

J	Groom, MJ; Cragg, L				Groom, Madeleine J.; Cragg, Lucy			Differential modulation of the N2 and P3 event-related potentials by response conflict and inhibition	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Event-related potentials; N2; P3; Response inhibition; Response conflict; Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE FUNCTION; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; GO/NO-GO TASK; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EFFECTS SUPPORT; ERP COMPONENTS; FLANKER TASK; CHILDREN	Background: Developing reliable and specific neural markers of cognitive processes is essential to improve understanding of healthy and atypical brain function. Despite extensive research there remains uncertainty as to whether two electrophysiological markers of cognitive control, the N2 and P3, are better conceptualised as markers of response inhibition or response conflict. The present study aimed to directly compare the effects of response inhibition and response conflict on the N2 and P3 event-related potentials, within-subjects. Method: A novel hybrid go/no-go flanker task was performed by 19 healthy adults aged 18-25 years while EEG data were collected. The response congruence of a central target stimulus and 4 flanking stimuli was manipulated between trials to vary the degree of response conflict. Response inhibition was required on a proportion of trials. N2 amplitude was measured at two frontal electrode sites; P3 amplitude was measured at 4 midline electrode sites. Results: N2 amplitude was greater on incongruent than congruent trials but was not enhanced by response inhibition when the stimulus array was congruent. P3 amplitude was greater on trials requiring response inhibition; this effect was more pronounced at frontal electrodes. P3 amplitude was also enhanced on incongruent compared with congruent trials. Discussion: The findings support a role for N2 amplitude as a marker of response conflict and for the frontal shift of the P3 as a marker of response inhibition. This paradigm could be applied to clinical groups to help clarify the precise nature of impaired action control in disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD).

We use modern techniques of high-resolution electroencephalography applied to slow potentials, power spectra, and potencies related to the events. To obtain encephalographic records, we use an assembly of 128 channels in 31 subjects (17 Soto Zen Buddhist meditators). The motivation of this study was to determine whether the induced beta power would present an increase in meditators as well as a decrease in induced theta/beta ratio in absolute and relative values. However, opposite to what we expected, no significant change was found in the beta frequency. In contrast, the main findings of the study were correlations between the frequency of weekly meditation practice and the increased theta induced relative power, increase of induced power ratio (ratio theta/beta), and increase of the ratio of induced relative powers (theta/beta ratio) during our task that featured an "adapted meditation," suggesting that the meditative state of "mindfulness" is much more related to the permittivity of "distractions" by the meditators, with a deliberate reduction of attention.

Given recent evidence that political ideology is associated with neural responses to cognitive conflict in adults, we tested the exploratory hypothesis that children's neurocognitive responses to conflict may also differ depending on their parents' ideology. We assessed relations between parental political ideology and children's neurocognitive responses to conflict, as measured by the N2 component of the event-related potential. Children aged 5-7 completed an age-appropriate flanker task while electroencephalography was recorded, and the N2 was scored to incongruent versus congruent flankers to index conflict processing. Because previous research documents heightened liberal-conservative differences in threat-relevant contexts, each trial of the task was preceded by an angry face (threat-relevant) or comparison face (happy or neutral). An effect of parental ideology on the conflict-related N2 emerged in the threat condition, such that the N2 was larger among children of liberals compared with children of moderates and conservatives. These findings suggest that individual differences in neurocognitive responses to conflict, heightened in the context of threat, may reflect a more general pattern of individual differences that, in adults, relates to political ideology.

Objectives: An efficient way to investigate the neural basis of nociceptive responses is the analysis of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The main objective of this work was to study how adaptation and fatigue affect the ERPs to stimuli of different modalities, by characterizing the responses to infrequent and frequent stimulation in different recording periods. Methods: In this work, series of averaged EEG epochs recorded after thermal, electrical and auditory stimulation were analyzed with time-frequency representation and non-linear measures as spectral entropy and automutual information function. The study was performed by considering the traditional EEG frequency bands. Results: The defined measures presented a statistical significance p-value < 0.01 and accuracy higher than 60% by differentiating windows of response to infrequent (I) and frequent (F) stimuli between the start and end of the EEG recording.

The neuromarkers in Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event-related potentials (ERPs) were utilized in the construction of the protocol and the evaluation of the effectiveness of neurofeedback. Case study: A 54-year-old patient, experienced a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of the left brain hemisphere. He had been treated previously for more than 30 years for schizophrenia. After the episode of TIA, he suffered mild anomia, intensification in the severity of headaches, muscular tension, difficulties with sleeping as well as an inability to continue work in his given profession. Neuropsychological tests showed the presence of anxiety. Conclusions: The QEEG/ERP assessment of the patient did not find any ERPs neuromarkers of schizophrenia but instead there we found a neuromarker of anxiety. It is expressed by excessive central high beta rhythmicity. A suppression beta protocol of neurofeedback was suggested. After 20 sessions of neurofeedback found in the QEEG/ERP assessment a decrease of the central high beta activity without any significant changes in ERPs. Finally, the patient returned to work. The QEEG/ERP assessment provides a powerful tool for diagnosing the leading brain dysfunction and for constructing an individually tailored neurofeedback protocol. Presented above case study confirms the need for administering new neurotechnologies in the diagnosis of mental disorders with particular emphasis put on the schizophrenia spectrum. For a patients with cognitive problems the differential diagnosis should include carotid artery stenosis in which the Doppler Ultrasound (DUS) examination is gold standard.

The aim of our study was to assess the attentional capture by red-colored images, and to explore the modulatory role of the emotional valence in this process, as postulated by Elliot and Maier (2012) color-in-context theory. Participants completed a dot probe task with each cue comprising two images of equal valence and arousal, one containing a prominent red object and the other an object of different coloration. Reaction times were measured, as well as the event related lateralizations of the EEG. Modulation of the lateralized components revealed that the color red captured and later held the attention in both positive and negative conditions, but not in a neutral condition. An overt motor response to the target stimulus was affected mainly by attention lingering over the visual field where the red cue had been flashed. However, a weak influence of the valence could still be detected in reaction times. Therefore, red seems to guide attention, specifically in emotionally-valenced circumstances, indicating that an emotional context can alter color's impact both on attention and motor behavior.

The M170, an event related field component of MEG recording, like its EEG counterpart N170, was repeatedly shown to be associated with structural encoding of faces. However, the scope of information encoded during the M170 time window is still being debated. We investigated the neuronal origin of facial processing of integrated social rank cues (SRCs) and emotional facial expressions (EFEs) during the M170 time interval. Participants viewed integrated facial displays of emotion (happy, angry, neutral) and SRCs (indicated by upward, downward, or straight head tilts). We found that the activity during the M170 time window is sensitive to both EFEs and SRCs. Specifically, highly prominent activation was observed in response to SRC connoting dominance as compared to submissive or egalitarian head cues. Interestingly, the processing of EFEs and SRCs appeared to rely on different circuitry. Our findings suggest that vertical head tilts are processed not only for their sheer structural variance, but as social information. Exploring the temporal unfolding and brain localization of non-verbal cues processing may assist in understanding the functioning of the social rank biobehavioral system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates consumer brain responses underpinning passive viewing of luxury (high emotional value) versus basic (low emotional value) branded products when participants are alone or with another person. Conforming to social facilitation theory and using electroencephalogram methods, the authors recorded event-related potentials while female participants passively viewed pictures of luxury and basic branded products. They examined event-related-potential amplitudes in three time windows, corresponding to the P2 and P3 components and the late positive potential (LPP). Dissimilar brain responses occurred in the Together but not the Alone condition for the P2 and P3 components over visual cortex sites. The LPP amplitude was higher for luxury than for basic branded products, but only in the Together condition, suggesting that the presence of another person magnifies the emotional effect of brand type. Taken together, the results suggest that LPP amplitude during passive viewing of relevant marketing images reflects increased attention allocation and motivational significance, both enhanced by the presence of another person, to stimuli with higher emotional value.

In particular, we consider brain-based error perception while the operator passively observes the robot performing an action. Our approach consists of monitoring EEG signals and detecting a brain potential called error related negativity (ERN) that spontaneously occurs when the operator perceives an error made by the robot or when an unexpected event occurs. We detect ERN by pre-training two linear classifiers using data collected from a preliminary experiment based on a visual reaction task. We derive the probability of failure in demand (PFD), commonly used to assess functional safety for a two-channel verification system based on the combination of linear classifiers. Functional safety analysis was then performed on a BMI-based robotic framework in which a signal was sent to the robot to active its safety measures in when an ERN was detected. Using brain-based signals, we demonstrate that it is possible to send an emergency stop action during mobile navigation task when unexpected events occur with an accuracy of 75%.

A conflicting view, however, posits that attention is necessary for face-specific processing and that early-to-mid latency neural responses (similar to 100-300 ms) correspond more closely with perceptual awareness. The current study capitalized on a recently developed method for manipulating attention and conscious perception during EEG recording (modified inattentional blindness paradigm) and used face stimuli that elicit a well known marker of early face processing, the N170 event-related potential (ERP). In Phase 1 of the experiment, subjects performed a demanding distracter task while line drawings of faces and matched control stimuli were presented in the center of their view. When queried, half of the subjects reported no awareness of the faces and were deemed inattentionally blind. In Phase 2, subjects performed the same distracter task, but now consciously perceived the face stimuli due to the intervening questioning. In Phase 3, subjects performed a discrimination task on the faces. Two primary contrasts were made: aware versus unaware (equally task irrelevant) and task-relevant versus task-irrelevant (equally aware). The N170 and a subsequent ERP component, the visual awareness negativity (similar to 260-300 ms), were absent during inattentional blindness and present in the aware conditions. The P3b (>300 ms) was absent for task-irrelevant faces, even when consciously perceived, and present only when the faces were task relevant. These results inform contemporary theories of conscious face perception in particular and visual attention and perceptual awareness in general.

Especially food aromas can act as potent signals to modulate our eating behavior with strong dependency on the reward produced by food. In this investigation we aimed to study the electrophysiological response to food-and non-food-related odors in healthy volunteers. Analyses revealed specific scalp potential maps for the two conditions; in particular the source of the map in the "food" condition seemed to be associated with the processing of rewards; the specific map in the "non-food" condition reflects odor characteristics excluding the reward.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role for the noradrenergic system in the generation of the P3. However, pharmacological studies of the P3 using noradrenergic manipulations have so far been limited to agents that affect alpha 2-receptor signaling. The present study investigated whether beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the generation of the P3 and the error positivity (Pe), a component of the event-related potential that is elicited by errors and that bears many similarities to the P3. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in which we examined in human participants (N = 16) the effect of a single dose of propranolol (80 mg) on the amplitudes of the P3 observed in visual and auditory oddball tasks and the Pe observed in a flanker task. We found that P3s to auditory stimuli were increased in amplitude following treatment with propranolol. Propranolol also modulated the P3 to visual stimuli, but in a direction dependent on participants' level of trait anxiety: In participants with lower trait anxiety, propranolol resulted in a (non-significant) decrease in P3 amplitudes; in participants with higher trait anxiety, propranolol significantly enhanced P3 amplitude. Propranolol did not modulate the amplitude of the Pe or behavioral measures of conflict/error-related performance adjustments. These results provide the first evidence for involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in P3 generation. We speculate that propranolol affected the P3 through actions at beta 2-receptors in the locus coeruleus.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Refreshing: Event-related Potentials Associated with Directing Reflective Attention to Face, Scene, or Word Representations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							JUST-ACTIVATED INFORMATION; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; HUMAN FUSIFORM GYRUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; TERM-MEMORY; FMRI; THOUGHT; MECHANISMS	Refreshing is the component cognitive process of directing reflective attention to one of several active mental representations. Previous studies using fMRI suggested that refresh tasks involve a component process of initiating refreshing as well as the top-down modulation of representational regions central to refreshing. However, those studies were limited by fMRI's low temporal resolution. In this study, we used EEG to examine the time course of refreshing on the scale of milliseconds rather than seconds. ERP analyses showed that a typical refresh task does have a distinct electrophysiological response as compared to a control condition and includes at least two main temporal components: an earlier (similar to 400 msec) positive peak reminiscent of a P3 response and a later (similar to 800-1400 msec) sustained positivity over several sites reminiscent of the late directing attention positivity. Overall, the evoked potentials for refreshing representations from three different visual categories (faces, scenes, words) were similar, but multivariate pattern analysis showed that some category information was nonetheless present in the EEG signal. When related to previous fMRI studies, these results are consistent with a two-phase model, with the first phase dominated by frontal control signals involved in initiating refreshing and the second by the top-down modulation of posterior perceptual cortical areas that constitutes refreshing a representation. This study also lays the foundation for future studies of the neural correlates of reflective attention at a finer temporal resolution than is possible using fMRI.

It is unclear whether these signals reflect parallel processing of a common synchronous input to both regions, for example from mesocortical dopamine, or separate and consecutive stages in reward processing. These two perspectives make distinct predictions about the relative timing of feedback-related activity in each of these regions, a question we address here. To reconstruct the unique temporal contribution of dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to simultaneously measured EEG activity in human subjects, we developed a novel trialwise fMRI-informed EEG analysis that allows dissociating correlated and overlapping sources. We show that vmPFC uniquely contributes a sustained activation profile shortly after outcome presentation, whereas dmPFC contributes a later and more peaked activation pattern. This temporal dissociation is expressed mainly in the alpha band for a vmPFC signal, which contrasts with a theta based dmPFC signal. Thus, our data show reward-related vmPFC and dmPFC responses have distinct time courses and unique spectral profiles, findings that support distinct functional roles in a reward-processing network.

Thus, coherent auditory perception depends on "hearing" back in time: retrospectively attending that which was lost externally but preserved in short-term memory (STM). Current theories of auditory attention assume that sound features are integrated into a perceptual object, that multiple objects can coexist in STM, and that attention can be deployed to an object in STM. Recording electroencephalography from humans, we tested these assumptions, elucidating feature-general and feature-specific neural correlates of auditory attention to STM. Alpha/beta oscillations and frontal and posterior event-related potentials indexed feature-general top-down attentional control to one of several coexisting auditory representations in STM. Particularly, task performance during attentional orienting was correlated with alpha/low-beta desynchronization (i.e., power suppression). However, attention to one feature could occur without simultaneous processing of the second feature of the representation. Therefore, auditory attention to memory relies on both feature-specific and feature-general neural dynamics.

Yet, conflicting behavioral priming results illustrate that the level at which asymmetries take effect is difficult to pinpoint. In the present divided visual field experiment, we tried to address this issue by analyzing ERPs in addition to behavioral measures. Participants made a natural/artificial decision on lateralized visual objects that were either new, identical repetitions, or different exemplars of studied items. Hemispheric asymmetries did not emerge in either behavioral or late positive complex (LPC) priming effects, but did affect the process of implicit memory retrieval proper as indexed by an early frontal negativity (N350/(F) N400). Whereas exemplar-specific N350/(F) N400 priming effects emerged irrespective of presentation side, abstract implicit memory retrieval of different exemplars was contingent on right visual field presentation and the ensuing initial stimulus processing by the LH.

Finding the missing-stimulus mismatch negativity (MMN) in early psychosis: Altered MMN to violations of an auditory gestalt	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						MMN; Mismatch negativity; Schizophrenia; Auditory hallucinations; Auditory event-related potentials; Early psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA; 1ST-EPISODE; HALLUCINATIONS; GENERATION; DEFICITS; INDEXES; ONSET	The mismatch negativity (MMN) is an EEG-derived event-related potential (ERP) elicited by any violation of a predicted auditory 'rule', regardless of whether one is attending to the stimuli, and is thought to reflect updating of the stimulus context Chronic schizophrenia patients exhibit robust MMN deficits, while MMN reduction in first-episode and early phase psychosis is significantly less consistent. Traditional two-tone "oddball" MMN measures of sensory information processing may be considered too simple for use in early phase psychosis in which pathology has not progressed fully, and a paradigm that probes higher order processes may be more appropriate for elucidating auditory change detection deficits. This study investigated whether MMN deficits could be detected in early phase psychosis (EP) patients using an abstract 'missing stimulus' pattern paradigm (Salisbury, 2012). The stimuli were 400 groups of six tones (1000 Hz, 50 ms duration, 330 ms stimulus onset asynchrony), which was presented with an inter-trial interval of 750 ms. Occasionally a group contained a deviant, meaning that it was missing either the 4th or 6th tone (50 trials each). EEG recordings of 13 EP patients year duration of illness) and 15 healthy controls (HC) were collected. Patients and controls did not significantly differ on age or years of education. Analyses of MMN amplitudes elicited by missing stimuli revealed amplitude reductions in EP patients, suggesting that these deficits are present very early in the progression of the illness. While there were no correlations between MMN measures and measures such as duration of illness, medication dosage or age, MMN amplitude reductions were correlated with positive symptomatology (i.e. auditory hallucinations). These findings suggest that MMNs elicited by the 'missing stimulus' paradigm are impaired in psychosis patients early in the progression of illness and that previously reported MMN-indexed deficits related to auditory hallucinations in chronic patients may also be present in EP patients. As such, this paradigm may have promise in identifying early processing deficits in this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rudolph, Erica D.; Ells, Emma M.

The role of auditory cortices in the retrieval of single-trial auditory-visual object memories	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference Auditory Cortex	SEP 13-17, 2014	Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Magdeburg, GERMANY	Deutsch Forsch Gemeinschaft, Off Naval Res Global, Magdeburg Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Leibniz Inst Neurobiol	Leibniz Inst Neurobiol	auditory cortex; cross-modal; event-related potential; human memory; multisensory	MULTISENSORY MEMORIES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN; EEG; DISCRIMINATION; INTEGRATION; TUTORIAL; CORTEX; ERP	Single-trial encounters with multisensory stimuli affect both memory performance and early-latency brain responses to visual stimuli. Whether and how auditory cortices support memory processes based on single-trial multisensory learning is unknown and may differ qualitatively and quantitatively from comparable processes within visual cortices due to purported differences in memory capacities across the senses. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) as healthy adults (n=18) performed a continuous recognition task in the auditory modality, discriminating initial (new) from repeated (old) sounds of environmental objects. Initial presentations were either unisensory or multisensory; the latter entailed synchronous presentation of a semantically congruent or a meaningless image. Repeated presentations were exclusively auditory, thus differing only according to the context in which the sound was initially encountered. Discrimination abilities (indexed by d') were increased for repeated sounds that were initially encountered with a semantically congruent image versus sounds initially encountered with either a meaningless or no image. Analyses of ERPs within an electrical neuroimaging framework revealed that early stages of auditory processing of repeated sounds were affected by prior single-trial multisensory contexts. These effects followed from significantly reduced activity within a distributed network, including the right superior temporal cortex, suggesting an inverse relationship between brain activity and behavioural outcome on this task. The present findings demonstrate how auditory cortices contribute to long-term effects of multisensory experiences on auditory object discrimination. We propose a new framework for the efficacy of multisensory processes to impact both current multisensory stimulus processing and unisensory discrimination abilities later in time.

To this end, an auditory 3-stimulus oddball paradigm was used to identify P3a and P3b components, elicited by rare-distractor and rare-target tones, respectively. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded from 31 Sz patients and 38 healthy controls. The P3a and P3b brain-source generators were identified by time-averaging of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) current density images. In contrast with the commonly used fixed window of interest (WOI), we proposed to apply an adaptive WOI, which takes into account subjects' P300 latency variability. Our results showed different P3a and P3b source activation patterns in both groups. P3b sources included frontal, parietal and limbic lobes, whereas P3a response generators were localized over bilateral frontal and superior temporal regions. These areas have been related to the discrimination of auditory stimulus and to the inhibition (P3a) or the initiation (P3b) of motor response in a cognitive task. In addition, differences in source localization between Sz and control groups were observed. Sz patients showed lower P3b source activity in bilateral frontal structures and the cingulate. P3a generators were less widespread for Sz patients than for controls in right superior, medial and middle frontal gyrus. Our findings suggest that target and distractor processing involves distinct attentional subsystems, both being altered in Sz. Hence, the study of neuroelectric brain information can provide further insights to understand cognitive processes and underlying mechanisms in Sz. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet, they could provide useful information to assess speech ABR generators and better characterize populations of interest (e.g., musicians, dyslexics). We present here a novel methodology of topographic speech ABR recording, using a 32-channel low sampling rate (5kHz) EEG system. Quality of speech ABRs obtained with this conventional multichannel EEG system were compared to that of signals simultaneously recorded with a high sampling rate (13.3kHz) EEG system. Correlations between speech ABRs recorded with the two systems revealed highly similar signals, without any significant difference between their signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Moreover, an advanced denoising method for multichannel data (denoising source separation) significantly improved SNR and allowed topography of speech ABR to be recovered.

In many of these situations, there is a rapid assessment by the shooter that recognizes a threat and responds to it with return fire. But the neural processes underlying these rapid decisions are largely unknown, especially amongst those with extensive weapons experience and expertise. In this paper, we investigate differences in weapons experts and non-experts during an incoming gunfire detection task. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalography (EEG) of eleven expert marksmen/soldiers and eleven non-experts while they listened to an audio scene consisting of a sequence of incoming and non-incoming gunfire events. Subjects were tasked with identifying each event as quickly as possible and committing their choice via a motor response. Contrary to our hypothesis, experts did not have significantly better behavioral performance or faster response time than novices. Rather, novices indicated trends of better behavioral performance than experts. These group differences were more dramatic in the EEG correlates of incoming gunfire detection. Using machine learning, we found condition-discriminating EEG activity among novices showing greater magnitude and covering longer periods than those found in experts. We also compared group-level source reconstruction on the maximum discriminating neural correlates and found that each group uses different neural structures to perform the task. From condition-discriminating EEG and source localization, we found that experts perceive more categorical overlap between incoming and non-incoming gunfire. Consequently, the experts did not perform as well behaviorally as the novices. We explain these unexpected group differences as a consequence of experience with gunfire not being equivalent to expertise in recognizing incoming gunfire.

Detecting single-trial EEG evoked potential using a wavelet domain linear mixed model: application to error potentials classification	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; error potentials; linear mixed model; spatial filter; discrete wavelet transform; linear and quadratic discriminant analysis; classification for unbalanced data	ERP COMPONENTS; VARIABLES; LATENCY	Objective. The main goal of this work is to develop a model for multisensor signals, such as magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography (EEG) signals that account for inter-trial variability, suitable for corresponding binary classification problems. An important constraint is that the model be simple enough to handle small size and unbalanced datasets, as often encountered in BCI-type experiments. Approach. The method involves the linear mixed effects statistical model, wavelet transform, and spatial filtering, and aims at the characterization of localized discriminant features in multisensor signals. After discrete wavelet transform and spatial filtering, a projection onto the relevant wavelet and spatial channels subspaces is used for dimension reduction. The projected signals are then decomposed as the sum of a signal of interest (i.e., discriminant) and background noise, using a very simple Gaussian linear mixed model. Main results. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, the corresponding parameter estimation problem is simplified. Robust estimates of class-covariance matrices are obtained from small sample sizes and an effective Bayes plug-in classifier is derived. The approach is applied to the detection of error potentials in multichannel EEG data in a very unbalanced situation (detection of rare events). Classification results prove the relevance of the proposed approach in such a context. Significance. The combination of the linear mixed model, wavelet transform and spatial filtering for EEG classification is, to the best of our knowledge, an original approach, which is proven to be effective. This paper improves upon earlier results on similar problems, and the three main ingredients all play an important role.

Although selective attention allows us to filter out task-irrelevant information, there is a substantial number of unattended, yet relevant, events that must be evaluated in a flexible manner so that appropriate behaviors can succeed. Here we inspected the extent to which unattended conflicting visual information, which cannot be consciously identified, influences behavior and activates medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mechanisms of action-monitoring and regulation, traditionally associated with conscious control processes. To that end, we performed two experiments using a novel variant of the Eriksen flanker task in which spatial attention was manipulated, preventing the conscious identification of unattended visual events. The first behavioral experiment was conducted to validate the efficacy of the novel paradigm. In the second experiment, we evaluated electrophysiological correlates of mPFC activity (a frontocentral negative ERP component and medial-frontal theta oscillations) in response to attended and unattended conflicting events. The results of both experiments demonstrated that attended and unattended conflicting stimuli altered subjects' behavior in a similar fashion, i.e. slowing down their reaction times and increasing their error rates. Importantly, the results of the EEG experiment showed that unattended conflicting stimuli, similarly to attended conflicting stimuli, led to an increase in theta-related frontocentral ERP activity and medial-frontal theta power, irrespective of the degree of conscious representation of the sources of conflict. This study provides evidence that medial-frontal theta oscillations represent a neural mechanism through which the mPFC may suppress and regulate potentially inappropriate actions that are automatically triggered by conflicting environmental stimuli to which we are oblivious.

A Cross-Sectional Pain Rating ERP Study Reanalyzed with the ERFIA Multilevel Method	MEDICINE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; HEALTH SURVEY; SENSITIZATION; THRESHOLDS; RESPONSES; SF-36; MODEL	The objective of the present study was to investigate cortical differences between chronic low back pain (CLBP) subjects and pain-free controls with respect to habituation and processing of stimulus intensity. The use of a novel event-related fixed-interval areas (ERFIA) multilevel technique enables the analysis of event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) of the whole post stimulus range at a single trial level. This technique makes it possible to disentangle the cortical processes of habituation and stimulus intensity. In a cross-sectional study, 78 individuals with CLBP and 85 pain-free controls underwent a rating paradigm of 150 nonpainful and painful somatosensory electrical stimuli. For each trial, the entire epoch was partitioned into 20-ms ERFIAs, which acted as dependent variables in a multilevel analysis. The variability of each consecutive ERFIA period was modeled with a set of predictor variables, including 3 forms of habituation and stimulus intensity. Seventy-six pain-free controls and 65 CLBP subjects were eligible for analysis. CLBP subjects showed a significantly decreased linear habituation at 340 to 460 ms in the midline electrodes and C3 (Ps<.05) and had a significantly more pronounced dishabituation for the regions of 400 to 460 ms and 800 to 820 ms for all electrodes, except for T3 and T4 (Ps<. 05). No significant group differences for stimulus intensity processing were observed. In this study, group differences with respect to linear habituation and dishabituation were demonstrated. By means of the ERFIA multilevel technique, habituation effects were found in a broad post stimulus range and were not solely limited to peaks. This study suggests that habituation may be a key mechanism involved in the transition process to chronic pain. Future studies with a longitudinal design are required to solve this issue.

J	Stojanoski, BB; Niemeier, M				Stojanoski, Bobby Boge; Niemeier, Matthias			Colour expectations during object perception are associated with early and late modulations of electrophysiological activity	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG/ERP; Object perception; Visual expectation; Figure/ground; Attention	FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; TASK SET; MECHANISMS; CAPTURE; VISION; MOTION; FEEDFORWARD; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS	It is well known that visual expectation and attention modulate object perception. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these top-down influences are not completely understood. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicate late contributions of expectations to object processing around the P2 or N2. This is true independent of whether people expect objects (vs. no objects) or specific shapes, hence when expectations pertain to complex visual features. However, object perception can also benefit from expecting colour information, which can facilitate figure/ground segregation. Studies on attention to colour show attention-sensitive modulations of the P1, but are limited to simple transient detection paradigms. The aim of the current study was to examine whether expecting simple features (colour information) during challenging object perception tasks produce early or late ERP modulations. We told participants to expect an object defined by predominantly black or white lines that were embedded in random arrays of distractor lines and then asked them to report the object's shape. Performance was better when colour expectations were met. ERPs revealed early and late phases of modulation. An early modulation at the P1/N1 transition arguably reflected earlier stages of object processing. Later modulations, at the P3, could be consistent with decisional processes. These results provide novel insights into feature-specific contributions of visual expectations to object perception.

In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used single-trial classification to perform a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of categorical representation of objects in human visual cortex. Brain responses were recorded while participants viewed a set of 72 photographs of objects with a planned category structure. The Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) used for RSA was derived from confusions of a linear classifier operating on single EEG trials. In contrast to past studies, which used pairwise correlation or classification to derive the RDM, we used confusion matrices from multi-class classifications, which provided novel self-similarity measures that were used to derive the overall size of the representational space. We additionally performed classifications on subsets of the brain response in order to identify spatial and temporal EEG components that best discriminated object categories and exemplars. Results from category-level classifications revealed that brain responses to images of human faces formed the most distinct category, while responses to images from the two inanimate categories formed a single category cluster. Exemplar-level classifications produced a broadly similar category structure, as well as sub-clusters corresponding to natural language categories. Spatiotemporal components of the brain response that differentiated exemplars within a category were found to differ from those implicated in differentiating between categories. Our results show that a classification approach can be successfully applied to single- trial scalp-recorded EEG to recover fine-grained object category structure, as well as to identify interpretable spatiotemporal components underlying object processing. Finally, object category can be decoded from purely temporal information recorded at single electrodes.

A visual-attention task, consisting of bottom-up (visual pop-out) and top-down (visual search) conditions during stimuli of four triangles, i.e., a target and three distractors, was engaged. In pop-out condition, both color and orientation of the distractors differed from target, while in search condition they differed only in orientation. During the task, high-density EEG (256 channels) data were recorded and analyzed by means of behavioral, event-related potentials, i.e., the P300 component and brain source localization analysis using 3D-Vector Field Tomography (3D-VFT). Twenty subjects (half female; 32 +/- 4.7 years old) participated in the experiments, performing 60 trials for each condition. Behavioral analysis revealed that both female and male outperformed in the pop-out condition compared to the search one, with respect to accuracy and reaction time, whereas no gender-related statistical significant differences were found. Nevertheless, in the search condition, higher P300 amplitudes were detected for females compared to males (p < 7 . 10 (3)). Moreover, the findings suggested that the maximum activation in females was located mainly in the left inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, whereas in males it was found in the right inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri. Overall, the experimental results show that visual attention depends on contributions from different brain lateralization linked to gender, posing important implications in studying developmental disorders, characterized by gender differences.

The current study examined the effect of examination-induced academic stress on anticipation in information processing. Anticipation was indexed using the contingent negative variation (CNV). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were collected from 42 participants using the classic S1-S2 paradigm. These participants were preparing for the Chinese National Postgraduate Entrance Exam (NPEE). EEGs were also collected from 21 age-matched, non-exam comparison participants. The levels of perceived stress and state anxiety were higher and both the initial CNV (iCNV) and the late CNV (ICNV) were more negative in the exam group than in the non-exam group. These results suggest that participants under academic stress experienced greater anticipation of upcoming events. More important, for the non-exam group, state anxiety was positively related to both the iCNV and ICNV amplitude, and this correlation existed when trait anxiety was controlled; however, there was no such relationship in the exam group. These results suggested that the cortical anticipatory activity in the high-stressed exam group reached the maximum ceiling, leaving little room for transient increases in state anxiety.

The emotion classification system based on BCI can be useful in many areas like as entertainment, education, and health care. This chapter presents a new method for human emotion classification using multiwavelet transform of EEG signals. The EEG signal contains useful information related to the different emotional states, which helps us to understand the psychology and neurology of the human brain. The features namely, ratio of the norms based measure, Shannon entropy measure, and normalized Renyi entropy measure are computed from the sub-signals generated by multiwavelet decomposition of EEG signals. These features have been used as an input to multiclass least squares support vector machine (MC-LS-SVM) together with the radial basis function (RBF), Mexican hat wavelet, and Morlet wavelet kernel functions for classification of human emotions from EEG signals. The classification performance of the proposed method for classification of emotions using EEG signals determined by computing the classification accuracy, ten-fold cross-validation, and confusion matrix. The proposed method has provided classification accuracy of 84.79 % for classification of human emotions namely happy, neutral, sadness, and fear from EEG signals with Morlet wavelet kernel function of MC-LS-SVM. The audio-video stimulus has been used for inducing the emotions in EEG signals. The experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of human emotions from EEG signals.

The mismatch negativity (MMN), an electrophysiological marker of this mechanism, has been studied prominently in the auditory domain, with cortical generators identified in temporal and frontal regions. Here, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess whether the underlying frontal regions associated with auditory change detection also play a role in visual change detection. Twenty healthy young adults completed a visual MMN task in separate EEG and fMRI sessions. Region of interest analyses were conducted on left and right middle frontal (MFG) and inferior frontal (IFG) gyri, i.e., the frontal areas identified as potential auditory MMN generators. A significant increase in activation was observed in the left IFG and MFG in response to blocks containing deviant stimuli. These findings suggest that a frontal mechanism is involved in the detection of change in the visual MMN. Our results support the notion that frontal mechanisms underlie attention switching, as measured via MMN, across multiple modalities. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	MacGregor, LJ; Bouwsema, J; Klepousniotou, E				MacGregor, Lucy J.; Bouwsema, Jennifer; Klepousniotou, Ekaterini			Sustained meaning activation for polysemous but not homonymous words: Evidence from EEG	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERP; N400; Lexical ambiguity; Semantic priming; Homonymy; Polysemy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; SEMANTIC AMBIGUITY; RECOGNITION; COMPONENT; REPRESENTATION; CONTEXT; SENSE	Theoretical linguistic accounts of lexical ambiguity distinguish between homonymy, where words that share a lexical form have unrelated meanings, and polysemy, where the meanings are related. The present study explored the psychological reality of this theoretical assumption by asking whether there is evidence that homonyms and polysemes are represented and processed differently in the brain. We investigated the time-course of meaning activation of different types of ambiguous words using EEG. Homonyms and polysemes were each further subdivided into two: unbalanced homonyms (e.g., "coach") and balanced hombnyms (e.g., "match"); metaphorical polysemes (e.g., "mouth") and metonymic polysemes (e.g., "rabbit"). These four types of ambiguous words were presented as primes in a visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task employing a long ISI (750 ms). Targets were related to one of the meanings of the primes, or were unrelated. ERPs formed relative to the target onset indicated that the theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy was reflected in the N400 brain response. For targets following homonymous primes (both unbalanced and balanced), no effects survived at this long ISI indicating that both meanings of the prime had already decayed. On the other hand, for polysemous primes (both metaphorical and metonymic), activation was observed for both dominant and subordinate senses. The observed processing differences between homonymy and polysemy provide evidence in support of differential neuro-cognitive representations for the two types of ambiguity.

However, there is little consensus on what constitutes nonpredicted stimuli. Conceptually, whereas mispredicted stimuli may induce both prediction error generated by prediction that is not perceived and prediction error generated by sensory input that is not anticipated, unpredicted stimuli involves no top-down, only bottom-up, propagation of information in the system. Here, we examined the possibility that the processing of mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are dissociable at the neurophysiological level using human electroencephalography. We presented participants with sets of five tones in which the frequency of the fifth tones was predicted, mispredicted, or unpredicted. Participants were required to press a key when they detected a softer fifth tone to maintain their attention. We found that mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are associated with different amount of cortical activity, probably reflecting differences in prediction error. Moreover, relative to predicted stimuli, the mispredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal enhancement and the unpredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal attenuation on the N1 event-related potential component. These results highlight the importance of differentiating between the two nonpredicted stimuli in theoretical work on predictive coding.

The corticomuscular matching between brain (EEG) and muscles (EMG) activity allows the assessment of the intentionality of the performed movement. Basing on this knowledge, a real-time algorithm for falling risk prediction based on EMG/EEG coupled analysis is presented. The system architecture involves 8 EMG (limbs) and 8 EEG (motor-cortex) channels wirelessly collected by a FPGA (gateway) that contextually performs the real-time processing based on an event triggered time-frequency approach. The digital architecture is validated on the FPGA to determine resources utilization, related timing constraints and performance figures of a dedicated real-time ASIC implementation for wearable applications. The system resource utilization is 85.95% ALMs, 43283 ALUTs, 73.0% registers, 9.9% block memory of an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. The processing latency is lower than 1ms and the output are available in 56ms, respecting the time limit of 300ms. Outputs enables decision-taking for feedback delivering.	[Annese, V.

In previous research on brain responses to images of infant faces, the faces were unknown to participants. This study investigated EEG in primiparous mothers of 3- to 6-month-old infants viewing their own infant's face compared to an unfamiliar but appearance-matched infant's face. Spectral power was calculated and compared, and power at three EEG bands (delta, theta, and gamma) was found to differ between faces. Brain responses among primiparous mothers distinguish images of their own versus unfamiliar infants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Patients with FMS exhibit increased sensitivity to experimental pain and pain-related cues, as well as deficits in emotional regulation. The present study investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activations for observed pain in 19 patients with FMS and 18 age-matched, healthy control individuals using event-related potential analysis. Patients with FMS attributed greater pain and unpleasantness to pain pictures, relative to healthy control participants. An augmented late positive potential (LPP) component (>500 milliseconds) was found in patients viewing both pain and nonpain pictures, and this amplitude difference in the LPP covaried with perceived unpleasantness of pictures. Mid-latency potentials (250-450 milliseconds) demonstrated similar amplitude increases of positive potentials in the FMS patient group. By contrast, the short-latency positive potential (140 milliseconds) was reduced in patients with FMS relative to healthy control participants. Results suggest amplitude increases to mid- to long-latency cortical activations in patients with FMS, which are known to reflect emotional control and motivational salience of stimuli. Perspective: Patients with FMS demonstrate increased activations associated with pain and nonpain pictures. The findings suggest that even innocuous, everyday visual stimuli with somatic connotations may challenge the emotional state of patients with FMS. Our study points toward the importance of cognitive-emotional therapeutic approaches for the treatment of FMS.

While most of the current techniques are limited to research clinics and require excessive set-up, new consumer EEG devices connected to standard, off-the-shelf mobile devices allow us to lift these limitations. This allows neuropsychological assessment and research in mobile settings, possibly even in remote areas with limited accessibility and infrastructure, thus bringing the equipment to the patient, instead of bringing the patient to the equipment. We are developing an Android based mobile framework to perform EEG studies. By connecting a mobile consumer EEG headset directly to an unmodified mobile device, presenting auditory and visual stimuli, as well as user interaction, we create a self-contained experimental platform. We complement this platform by a toolkit for immediate evaluation of the recorded data directly on the device, even without Internet connectivity. Initial results from the replication of two Event Related Potentials studies indicate the feasibility of the approach.

Theoretical perspectives oscillate between rich and lean interpretations of the same expressed preferences. Although some argue that infants and toddlers possess a "moral sense" based on core knowledge of the social world, others suggest that social evaluations are hierarchical in nature and the product of an integration of rudimentary general processes such as attention allocation and approach and avoidance. Moreover, these biologically prepared minds interact in social environments that include significant variation, which are likely to impact early social evaluations and behavior. The present study examined the neural underpinnings of and precursors to moral sensitivity in infants and toddlers (n = 73, ages 12-24 mo) through a series of interwoven measures, combining multiple levels of analysis including electrophysiological, eye-tracking, behavioral, and socio-environmental. Continuous EEG and time-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) and gaze fixation were recorded while children watched characters engaging in prosocial and antisocial actions in two different tasks. All children demonstrated a neural differentiation in both spectral EEG power density modulations and time-locked ERPs when perceiving prosocial or antisocial agents. Time-locked neural differences predicted children's preference for prosocial characters and were influenced by parental values regarding justice and fairness. Overall, this investigation casts light on the fundamental nature of moral cognition, including its underpinnings in general processes such as attention and approach-withdrawal, providing plausible mechanisms of early change and a foundation for forward movement in the field of developmental social neuroscience.

It represents a prediction error (PE) response, reflecting the difference between the sensory input and predictions. While deficits in auditory MMN are well known in schizophrenia, only few studies investigated impairments in predictive visual processing in schizophrenia. These studies used complex stimuli such as motion direction and emotional facial expressions. Here we studied whether automatic predictive processing of elementary features such as orientation is also impaired in schizophrenia. Methods: Altogether 28 patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy controls matched in age, gender, and education participated in the study. EEG was recorded using 128 channels in the two experimental blocks. Using an oddball paradigm, horizontal stripes of Gabor patches were presented as frequent standards and vertical stripes as rare deviants in one block. Stimulus probabilities were swapped in the other block. Mismatch responses were obtained by subtracting responses to standard from those to deviant stimuli. Results: We found significant mismatch responses in healthy controls but not in patients in the prefrontal and occipital-parietal regions in the 90-200 ms interval. Furthermore patients showed significantly decreased deviant minus standard difference waveforms relative to controls in the same regions with moderate to large effect sizes. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that predictive processing of unattended low-level visual features such as orientation is impaired in schizophrenia. Our results complement reports of sensory deficits found in tasks requiring attentive processing and suggest that deficits are present in automaticvisual sensory processes putatively mediated by glutamatergic functioning.

Despite extensive research, existing assessment tools for fall risk have been insufficient for predicting falls since the phenomenology is complex and there is no equipment on the market that allows everyday life monitoring. In this paper we present a novel approach for fall-risk on-line assessment based on: i) clinical condition of the subject, ii) environmental conditions, iii) electromyographic (EMG) co-contraction analysis and iv) electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis based on Movement Related Potentials (MRPs) and-rhythm event related desynchronizations (mu-ERDs) occurrence. This fall-risk assessment approach is implemented by a complete cyber-physical system made up by EEG and EMG wearable recording systems interfaced to an FPGA on-line performing the needed real-time processing for indexes extraction. The results present a fall-risk assessment case study on healthy subjects walking showing detectable fall-risk increasing (+1.5%) when obstacles are overcome.	[Annese, V.

Alpha oscillatory correlates of motor inhibition in the aged brain	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; electroencephalography; inhibition; motor control; alpha rhythm; neuroplasticity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TERM-MEMORY TASK; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; AGING BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; EXCITABILITY	Exerting inhibitory control is a cognitive ability mediated by functions known to decline with age. The goal of this study is to add to the mechanistic understanding of cortical inhibition during motor control in aged brains. Based on behavioral findings of impaired inhibitory control with age we hypothesized that elderly will show a reduced or a lack of EEG alpha power increase during tasks that require motor inhibition. Since inhibitory control over movements has been shown to rely on prior motor memory formation, we investigated cortical inhibitory processes at two points in time early after learning and after an overnight consolidation phase and hypothesized an overnight increase of inhibitory capacities. Young and elderly participants acquired a complex finger movement sequence and in each experimental session brain activity during execution and inhibition of the sequence was recorded with multi-channel EEG. We assessed cortical processes of sustained inhibition by means of task-induced changes of alpha oscillatory power. During inhibition of the learned movement, young participants showed a significant alpha power increase at the sensorimotor cortices whereas elderly did not. Interestingly, for both groups, the overnight consolidation phase improved up-regulation of alpha power during sustained inhibition. This points to deficits in the generation and enhancement of local inhibitory mechanisms at the sensorimotor cortices in aged brains. However, the alpha power increase in both groups implies neuroplastic changes that strengthen the network of alpha power generation over time in young as well as elderly brains.

Implicit attention to negative social, in contrast to nonsocial, words in the Stroop task differs between individuals high and low in loneliness: Evidence from event-related brain microstates	CORTEX			English	Article						Chicago Electrical NeuroImaging; Analytics (CENA); Evolutionary model of loneliness; Social threat; Social Stroop; Loneliness; High density EEG/ERP	EEG; RELIABILITY; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; CORTISOL; THREAT; SAMPLE; EYE	Being on the social perimeter is not only sad, it is dangerous. Our evolutionary model of the effects of perceived social isolation (loneliness) on the brain as well as a growing body of behavioral research suggests that loneliness promotes short-term self-preservation, including an increased implicit vigilance for social, in contrast to nonsocial, threats. However, this hypothesis has not been tested previously in a neuroimaging study. We therefore used high density EEG and a social Stroop interference task to test the hypothesis that implicit attention to negative social, in contrast to nonsocial, Words in the Stroop task differs between individuals high versus low in loneliness and to investigate the brain dynamics of implicit processing for negative social (vs nonsocial) stimuli in lonely individuals, compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 70). The present study provides the first evidence that negative social stimuli are differentiated from negative nonsocial stimuli more quickly in the lonely than nonlonely brains. Given the timing of this differentiation in the brain and the fact that participants were performing a Stroop task, these results also suggest that these differences reflect implicit rather than explicit attentional differences between lonely and nonlonely individuals. Source estimates were performed for purposes of hypothesis generation regarding underlying neural mechanisms, and the results implicated the neural circuits reminiscent of orienting and executive control aspects of attention as contributing to these differences. Together, the results are in accord with the evolutionary model of loneliness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acquiring event-related brain potential data from the sensorimotor cortices, the system comprises artifact and background noise removal, feature extraction, feature selection, and feature classification. First, the artifacts and background noise are removed automatically by means of independent component analysis and surface Laplacian filter, respectively. Several potential features, such as band power, autoregressive model, and coherence and phase-locking value, are then extracted for subsequent classification. Next, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used to select features from the aforementioned feature combination. Finally, selected subfeatures are classified by support vector machine. Comparing with and without artifact removal and feature selection, using a genetic algorithm on single-trial EEG data for 6 subjects, the results indicate that the proposed system is promising and suitable for brain-computer interface applications.

The current study aims to examine information processing during sleep in non-insomniac individuals with high vulnerability (HV) to stress-related sleep disturbances. MethodsTwenty-seven non-insomniac individuals were recruited, 14 with low vulnerability and 13 with HV. After passing a screening interview and polysomnographic recording, subjects came to the sleep laboratory for 2 nights (a baseline night and a stress-inducing night) for event-related potentials recordings. ResultsThe HV group demonstrated shorter P2 latency during the first 5min of stage 2 sleep and higher P900 amplitudes under the stress condition during slow-wave sleep, which indicates an increased level of inhibitory processes. In addition, they had shorter N1 latencies during slow-wave sleep that could indicate an elevated level of attention processing during deep sleep. ConclusionsUnlike patients with chronic insomnia, individuals with high sleep vulnerability to stress show a compensatory process that may prevent external stimulation from interfering with their sleep. This may be one of the factors preventing their acute sleep disturbances from becoming chronic problems.

These oscillatory activities, whose functional significances differ greatly according to their temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics, are commonly detected when single-trial signals are transformed into time-frequency distributions (TFDs). Parameters characterizing oscillatory activities are normally measured from multi-channel TFDs within a time-frequency region-of-interest (TF-ROI), pre-defined using a hypothesis-driven or data-driven approach. However, both approaches could ignore the possibility that the pre-defined TF-ROI contains several spatially/functionally distinct oscillatory activities. New method: We proposed a novel approach based on topographic segmentation analysis to optimally and automatically identify detailed time-frequency features. This approach, which could effectively exploit the spatial information of oscillatory activities, has been validated in both simulation and real electrocortical studies. Results: Simulation study showed that the proposed approach could successfully identify noise-contaminated time-frequency features if their signal-to-noise ratio was relatively high. Real electrocortical study demonstrated that several time-frequency features with distinct scalp distributions and evident neurophysiological functions were identified when the same analysis was applied on stimulus-elicited TFDs. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach could provide an optimal identification of detailed time-frequency features by making use of their distinct spatial distributions. Conclusions: Our findings illustrated the validity and usefulness of the presented approach in isolating detailed time-frequency features, thus having wide applications in cognitive neuroscience to provide a precise assessment of the functional significance of oscillatory activities.

Recent Bayesian models of perception have demonstrated that prediction and attention operate synergistically to optimize stimulus processing. However, the relation between prediction and unconscious attention remains unclear given the relative neglect of unconscious attention in scholarly literatures. To investigate this issue, twenty participants (12 women) performed an orientation identification task in which a circular grating appeared either in the left or in the right visual field in a single 30-40 min session, during which 64-channel EEG data were acquired. Behavioral results showed an unconscious-attended effect and a facilitated effect. Importantly, prediction-related P1 and N1 silencing effects were observed in the unconscious-attended condition, probably reflecting that unconscious attention improves the precision of top-down predictions at an early stage of processing, thereby increasing the synaptic gain of predictor neurons. Moreover, unlike the early ERP components, P3 revealed a reversed pattern of results, which displayed a silencing effect of prediction only in the unattended condition, suggesting that the influence of unconscious attention on the silencing effect may change over time.

ISV has been assumed to represent an attentional deficit, either reflecting lapses in attention or increased neural noise. Here, we use an innovative single-trial event-related potential approach to assess whether the increased ISV associated with ADHD is indeed attributable to attention, or whether it is related to response-related processing. MethodsWe measured electroencephalographic responses to working memory oddball tasks in patients with ADHD (N=20, aged 11.31.1) and healthy controls (N=25, aged 11.71.1), and analysed these data with a recently developed method of single-trial event-related potential analysis. Estimates of component latency variability were computed for the stimulus-locked and response-locked forms of the P3b and the lateralised readiness potential (LRP). ResultsADHD patients showed significantly increased ISV in behavioural ISV. This increased ISV was paralleled by an increase in variability in response-locked event-related potential latencies, while variability in stimulus-locked latencies was equivalent between groups. This result held across the P3b and LRP. Latency of all components predicted RTs on a single-trial basis, confirming that all were relevant for speed of processing. ConclusionsThese data suggest that the increased ISV found in ADHD could be associated with response-end, rather than stimulus-end processes, in contrast to prevailing conceptions about the endophenotype. This mental chronometric approach may also be useful for exploring whether the existing lack of specificity of ISV to particular psychiatric conditions can be improved upon.	[Saville, Christopher W.

Olfaction Modulates Early Neural Responses to Matching Visual Objects	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PERCEPTION; VISION; ODORS; COLOR; DISCRIMINATION	Sensory information is initially registered within anatomically and functionally segregated brain networks but is also integrated across modalities in higher cortical areas. Although considerable research has focused on uncovering the neural correlates of multisensory integration for the modalities of vision, audition, and touch, much less attention has been devoted to understanding interactions between vision and olfaction in humans. In this study, we asked how odors affect neural activity evoked by images of familiar visual objects associated with characteristic smells. We employed scalp-recorded EEG to measure visual ERPs evoked by briefly presented pictures of familiar objects, such as an orange, mint leaves, or a rose. During presentation of each visual stimulus, participants inhaled either a matching odor, a nonmatching odor, or plain air. The N1 component of the visual ERP was significantly enhanced for matching odors in women, but not in men. This is consistent with evidence that women are superior in detecting, discriminating, and identifying odors and that they have a higher gray matter concentration in olfactory areas of the OFC. We conclude that early visual processing is influenced by olfactory cues because of associations between odors and the objects that emit them, and that these associations are stronger in women than in men.

EEG signals are located in low frequency range and relatively small. The amplitude of these signals are approximately 50 mu V with the maximum amplitude is about 100 mu V. Therefore, there are number of sources such as power line, EOG or ECG can extremely interfere EEG signals. Detection and elimination of artifacts plays an important role to acquire clean EEG signals to analyze and detect brain activities. Besides, the extraction of important components in recorded EEG required fast and reliable algorithm to process mix of data set. In this paper, we will demonstrate EEG acquisition from EEG Exea Ultra system of Bitmed, analyze and compare signals from volunteers in relaxation mode and contaminated EEG signals with eye blinks. We then design filters to remove powerlines and baseline noise from acquired signals. With the aim to assess the feasibility of Wavelet transform technique to identify feature in recorded EEG signals, we carried out Wavelet transform and applied threshold method to detect and remove artifacts in EEG signals with eye blinks. We achieved PSNR of original signals and wavelet filtered signal that approximately 17,7810 dB. Our preliminary results show that wavelet can be utilized as automatically detection tools for artifacts and event-related potentials and in applications require real-time processing of EEG signals.

Rapid cortical dynamics associated with auditory spatial attention gradients	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; spatial hearing; EEG; laterality; independent component analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TIME-COURSE; TASK; AUDITION; NETWORKS; NEGLECT	Behavioral and EEG studies suggest spatial attention is allocated as a gradient in which processing benefits decrease away from an attended location. Yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical processes that contribute to attentional gradients are unclear. We measured EEG while participants (n = 35) performed an auditory spatial attention task that required a button press to sounds at one target location on either the left or right. Distractor sounds were randomly presented at four non-target locations evenly spaced up to 180 from the target location. Attentional gradients were quantified by regressing ERP amplitudes elicited by distractors against their spatial location relative to the target. Independent component analysis was applied to each subject's scalp channel data, allowing isolation of distinct cortical sources. Results from scalp ERPs showed a tri-phasic response with gradient slope peaks at 300 ms (frontal, positive), 430 ms (posterior, negative), and a plateau starting at 550 ms (frontal, positive). Corresponding to the first slope peak, a positive gradient was found within a central component when attending to both target locations and for two lateral frontal components when contralateral to the target location. Similarly, a central posterior component had a negative gradient that corresponded to the second slope peak regardless of target location. A right posterior component had both an ipsilateral followed by a contralateral gradient. Lateral posterior clusters also had decreases in et and oscillatory power with a negative slope and contralateral tuning. Only the left posterior component (120-200 ms) corresponded to absolute sound location. The findings indicate a rapid, temporally-organized sequence of gradients thought to reflect interplay between frontal and parietal regions. We conclude these gradients support a target-based saliency map exhibiting aspects of both right-hemisphere dominance and opponent process models.

DIFFERENTIAL RECRUITMENT OF BRAIN NETWORKS DURING VISUOSPATIAL AND COLOR PROCESSING: EVIDENCE FROM ERP MICROSTATES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						microstate analysis; visuospatial judgment; EEG; ERP; parietal cortex; frontal cortex	RIGHT-HEMISPHERE DOMINANCE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; MINDS IMAGE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FMRI; IMPAIRMENTS; POTENTIALS; ASYMMETRY; SPACE	Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently revealed contributions of fronto-parietal and related networks to the execution of a visuospatial judgment task, the so-called "Clock Task". However, due to the low temporal resolution of fMRI, the exact cortical dynamics and timing of processing during task performance could not be resolved until now. In order to clarify the detailed cortical activity and temporal dynamics, 14 healthy subjects performed an established version of the "Clock Task", which comprises a visuospatial task (angle discrimination) and a control task (color discrimination) with the same stimulus material, in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment. Based on the time-resolved analysis of network activations (microstate analysis), differences in timing between the angle compared to the color discrimination task were found after sensory processing in a time window starting around 200 ms. Significant differences between the two tasks were observed in an analysis window from 192 ms to 776 ms. We divided this window in two parts: an early phase - from 192 ms to similar to 440 ms, and a late phase - from similar to 440 ms to 776 ms. For both tasks, the order of network activations and the types of networks were the same, but, in each phase, activations for the two conditions were dominated by differing network states with divergent temporal dynamics. Our results provide an important basis for the assessment of deviations in processing dynamics during visuospatial tasks in clinical populations. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity of frontal beta oscillations to reward valence but not probability	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Beta oscillations; Reward prediction error; Reinforcement learning	FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE; SIGNALS	Reward feedback elicits a brief increase in power in the high-beta frequency range of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) over frontal areas of the scalp, but the functional role of this oscillatory activity remains unclear. An observed sensitivity to reward expectation (HajiHosseini, Rodriguez-Fomells, and Marco-Pallares, 2012; [2]) suggests that reward-related beta may index a reward prediction error (RPE) signal for reinforcement learning. To investigate this possibility we reanalyzed EEG data from two prior experiments that revealed RPEs in the human event-related brain potential (Holroyd and Krigolson, 2007 [12]; Holroydet al., 2008 [13]). We found that feedback stimuli that indicated reward, when compared to feedback stimuli that indicated no-reward, elicited relatively more beta power (20-30 Hz) over a frontal area of the scalp. However, beta power was not sensitive to feedback probability. These results indicate that reward-related beta does not index an RPE but rather relates to a different reward processing function.

Multi-dimensional modulations of alpha and gamma cortical dynamics following mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in Major Depressive Disorder	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Major Depressive Disorder (MDD); Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT); ERD/ERS; Oscillatory EEG; alpha-Band coherence; gamma-Band; EEG power	FRONTAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ASYMMETRY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EEG COHERENCE; RESTING EEG; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; PANIC DISORDER; MEDITATION; BAND	To illuminate candidate neural working mechanisms of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in the treatment of recurrent depressive disorder, parallel to the potential interplays between modulations in electro-cortical dynamics and depressive symptom severity and self-compassionate experience. Linear and nonlinear alpha and gamma EEG oscillatory dynamics were examined concomitant to an affective Go/NoGo paradigm, pre-to-post MBCT or natural wait-list, in 51 recurrent depressive patients. Specific EEG variables investigated were; (1) induced event-related (de-) synchronisation (ERD/ERS), (2) evoked power, and (3) inter-/intra-hemispheric coherence. Secondary clinical measures included depressive severity and experiences of self-compassion. MBCT significantly downregulated alpha and gamma power, reflecting increased cortical excitability. Enhanced alpha-desynchronisation/ERD was observed for negative material opposed to attenuated alpha-ERD towards positively valenced stimuli, suggesting activation of neural networks usually hypoactive in depression, related to positive emotion regulation. MBCT-related increase in left-intra-hemispheric alpha-coherence of the fronto-parietal circuit aligned with these synchronisation dynamics. Ameliorated depressive severity and increased self-compassionate experience pre-to-post MBCT correlated with alpha-ERD change. The multi-dimensional neural mechanisms of MBCT pertain to task-specific linear and non-linear neural synchronisation and connectivity network dynamics. We propose MBCT-related modulations in differing cortical oscillatory bands have discrete excitatory (enacting positive emotionality) and inhibitory (disengaging from negative material) effects, where mediation in the alpha and gamma bands relates to the former.

However, this issue and its corresponding age effects have not been examined directly. For this purpose, EEG was recorded when young and elderly participants were required to make animacy decision during an incidental word repetition paradigm with words repeated after one, six, or nine intervening words. The results revealed that with one intervening word lag LPC decreased for nonliving words which supposed to be related to higher semantic activation levels reflected by larger N400, unchanged for living words associated with lower semantic incongruity activation levels, and increased in relatively longer lags (with six or nine intervening words) in the young group. Whereas, enhanced LPC was observed in the elderly in all conditions. Furthermore, significant age-related LPC repetition differences were revealed only with one intervening word lag for nonliving words. The results suggested that (1) how LPC changes after repetition is influenced by the initial incongruity activation levels of items and their thereafter maintenance in short-term memory; (2) the age-related differences result from the declining of short-term memory maintenance rather than from initial lower incongruity activations among elderly adults.

There is conflicting evidence whether these P3s are moderated by participants' preceding guesses. In the present study, participants made one prediction frequently and the other rarely because one stimulus was presented frequently and the other rarely. Thereby, effects on stimulus-evoked P3s of both guess frequency and stimulus frequency could be tested. Indeed, P3s were not only larger with rare than frequent stimuli but also larger after rare than frequent guesses. This result pattern may have additionally been affected by expectancies for payoff. In any case, the modification of outcome-evoked P3 by what had been guessed may reflect that each of the four guess-stimulus combinations is encoded as a separate event category. In terms of the stimulus-response link hypothesis of P3b, it is suggested that P3s are evoked by these events because internal responses (right or wrong) are associated to each of these event categories and need to be reactivated with rare guess-stimulus combinations.

In this work, the evaluation of human motion intention (HMI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are analyzed for a knee exoskeleton control as a preliminary study for gait neurorehabilitation with a hybrid robotic system. This system consists of the knee exoskeleton H2 and the UFES's Smart Walker, which are used to restore the neuromotor control function of subjects with neural injuries. An experimental protocol was developed to identify patterns to control the exoskeleton in accordance with the HMI-based on EEG/sEMG. The EEG and sEMGsignalsare recorded during thefollowing activities: stand-up/sit-down and knee flexion/extension. HMI is analyzed through both event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and slow cortical potential, as well as the myoelectric patternclassification related to lower limb. The feature extraction from sEMG signals is based on vector combinations in time and frequency domain which are used for a pattern classification stage trough an artificial neural network with LevenbergMarquadt training algorithm and support vector machine.

The Right Angular Gyrus Combines Perceptual and Response-related Expectancies in Visual Search: TMS-EEG Evidence	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						TMS; EEG; Visual search; Attention; N1; Dimensional weighting	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DIMENSION CHANGES; FEATURE TARGETS; POP-OUT; ATTENTION; SELECTION; NEUROSCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; JUDGMENTS; MOTION	Background: Visual search performance is sensitive to changes in the environment. Attention is sensitive to trial history, in terms of both perception and response. Although the bases of these sensorimotor interactions remain unclear, both behaviorally and neurally, converging evidence from a variety of methods indicates that the right angular gyrus (rANG) may be important. Objective/hypothesis: The present study tests whether the rANG plays a causal role in generating these inter-trial effects. Methods: Participants performed a compound task for feature singleton targets. We applied rTMS over the rANG (or a control site, or no TMS) during the inter-trial interval and measured effects both on behavior and on neural activity using psychophysics and event-related potential (ERP) recording. Results: rANG TMS during the inter-trial interval improved performance to the upcoming stimuli only when the target-defining dimension and the response-defining feature both repeated across successive trials. rANG TMS also increased the amplitude of the visual N1 component evoked by the upcoming stimuli. These effects did not occur after control TMS. Conclusion: rANG plays a causal role in the formation of combined expectancies binding together stimulus-and response-characteristics of the previous trial to optimize visual search performance. This supports a visuomotor theory of parietal cortex and the dimension weighting account of attention. We suggest current models of inter-trial effects in visual search need to be expanded to include an interactive component representing both perceptual and motoric inter-trial expectancies, affecting the early analysis of stimulus features in the upcoming trial.

For instance, English place assimilation causes green boat to be typically pronounced as groom boat; English listeners, however, perceptually compensate for this rule and retrieve the intended sound (n). Previous research using EEG has focused on rules with clear phonetic underpinnings, showing that perceptual compensation occurs at an early stage of speech perception. We tested whether this early mechanism also accounts for the compensation for more complex rules. We examined compensation for French voicing assimilation, a rule with abstract phonological restrictions on the contexts in which it applies. Our results reveal that perceptual compensation for this rule by French listeners modulates an early ERP component. This is evidence that early stages of speech sound categorization are sensitive to complex phonological rules of the native language. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One standard laboratory technique for measuring cognitive inhibition is the Go/NoGo procedure. The procedure moves the average, or centroid, of electroencephalography signals toward the frontal, or anterior, part of the brain. This process, called anteriorization, produces a shift in the emotional and cognitive signals from the anterior cingulate cortex. This has implications for both the scientific understanding and clinical use of hypnosis.

Studies of visual short-term memory suggest that access to the representation of an item from a previously seen display is associated with a negative evoked potential at posterior electrodes contralateral to the spatial location of that item in the display. In this paper we demonstrate that resolving the reference of a noun phrase in a recently seen visual display is associated with an event-related potential that is analogous to this effect. Our design was adapted from the visual world paradigm: in each trial, participants saw a display containing three simple objects, followed by a question about the objects, such as Was the pink fish next to a boat?, presented word by word. Questions differed in whether the color adjective allowed the reader to identify the referent of the noun phrase or not (i.e., whether one or more objects of the named color were present). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that reference resolution by the adjective was associated with a negative evoked potential at posterior electrodes contralateral to spatial location of the referent, starting approximately 333 ms after the onset of the adjective. The fact that the laterality of the effect depended upon the location of the referent within the display suggests that reference resolution in visual domains involves, at some level, a modality-specific representation. In addition, the effect gives us an estimate of the time course of processing from perception of the written word to the point at which its meaning is brought into correspondence with the referential domain.

A neutral/positive/negative face recognition task was administered the evening before (learning and immediate recognition) and the morning after (delayed recognition) sleep. The number of rapid eye movements (REMs), beta and theta EEG activity over the visual areas were measured during REM sleep. Compared to neurotypical children, children with ASD showed more theta activity and longer reaction time (RT) for correct responses in delayed recognition of neutral faces. Both groups showed a positive correlation between sleep and performance but different patterns emerged: in neurotypical children, accuracy for recalling neutral faces and overall RT improvement overnight was correlated with EEG activity and REMs; in children with ASD, overnight RT improvement for positive and negative faces correlated with theta and beta activity, respectively. These results suggest that neurotypical and children with ASD use different sleep-related brain networks to process faces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we focus on EEG artifacts created by head motion in the static B-0 field. A novel approach for motion artifact detection is proposed, based on a simple modification of a commercial EEG cap, in which four electrodes are non-permanently adapted to record only magnetic induction effects. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were acquired with this setup, at 7 T, from healthy volunteers undergoing a reversing-checkerboard visual stimulation paradigm. Data analysis assisted by the motion sensors revealed that, after gradient artifact correction, EEG signal variance was largely dominated by pulse artifacts (81-93%), but contributions from spontaneous motion (4-13%) were still comparable to or even larger than those of actual neuronal activity (3-9%). Multiple approaches were tested to determine the most effective procedure for denoising EEG data incorporating motion sensor information. Optimal results were obtained by applying an initial pulse artifact correction step (AAS-based), followed by motion artifact correction (based on the motion sensors) and ICA denoising. On average, motion artifact correction (after AAS) yielded a 61% reduction in signal power and a 62% increase in VEP trial-by-trial consistency. Combined with ICA, these improvements rose to a 74% power reduction and an 86% increase in trial consistency. Overall, the improvements achieved were well appreciable at single-subject and single-trial levels, and set an encouraging quality mark for simultaneous EEG-fMRI at ultra-high field.

LFP rhythms were mainly characterized by means od power spectral analysis, thus loosing information related to rhythm phase synchronization and to event related phase modulations. Because the application of higher-order spectral analysis methodology can overcome such limitation, here we review the present applications of bispectral and cross-bispectral analysis to LFP recordings. The results obtained up to now showed that higher-order spectral analysis was able to clarify detect different rhythm synchronizations and interactions characterizing different pathologies and patient's states.

J	Chmielewski, WX; Roessner, V; Beste, C				Chmielewski, Witold X.; Roessner, Veit; Beste, Christian			Predictability and context determine differences in conflict monitoring between adolescence and adulthood	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Conflict monitoring; Contextual effects; Development; EEG; Source localization	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; AGE	The ability to link contextual information to actions is an important aspect of conflict monitoring and response selection. These mechanisms depend on medial prefrontal networks. Although these areas undergo a protracted development from adolescence to adulthood, it has remained elusive how the influence of contextual information on conflict monitoring is modulated between adolescence and adulthood. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization techniques we show that the ability to link contextual information to actions is altered and that the predictability of upcoming events is an important factor to consider in this context. In adolescents, conflict monitoring functions are not as much modulated by predictability factors as in adults. It seems that adults exhibit a stronger anticipation of upcoming events than adolescents. This results in disadvantages for adults when the upcoming context is not predictable. In adolescents, problems to predict upcoming events therefore turn out to be beneficial. Two cognitive-neurophysiological factors are important for this: The first factor is related to altered conflict monitoring functions associated with modulations of neural activity in the medial frontal cortex. The second factor is related to altered perceptual processing of target stimuli associated with modulations of neural activity in parieto-occipital areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The exact origins of this slowing, however, have not been established. Potential candidates are early sensory processes mediating the deployment of focal attention, stimulus response translation processes deciding upon the appropriate motor response, and motor processes generating the response. METHODS: We combined mental chronometry (RT) measures of adult ADHD (n = 15) and healthy control (n = 15) participants with their lateralized event-related potentials during the performance of a visual search task to differentiate potential sources of slowing at separable levels of processing: the posterior contralateral negativity (PCN) was used to index focal-attentional selection times, while the lateralized readiness potentials synchronized to stimulus and response events were used to index the times taken for response selection and production, respectively. To assess the clinical relevance of event-related potentials, a correlation analysis between neural measures and subjective current and retrospective ADHD symptom ratings was performed. RESULTS: ADHD patients exhibited slower RTs than control participants, which were accompanied by prolonged PCN and lateralized readiness potentials synchronized to stimulus, but not lateralized readiness potentials synchronized to response events, latencies. Moreover, the PCN timing was positively correlated with ADHD symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral RT slowing of adult ADHD patients was based on a summation of internal processing delays arising at perceptual and response selection stages; motor response production, by contrast, was not impaired. The correlation between PCN times and ADHD symptom ratings suggests that this brain signal may serve as a potential candidate for a neurocognitive endophenotype of ADHD.

J	Kotz, SA; Schmidt-Kassow, M				Kotz, Sonja A.; Schmidt-Kassow, Maven			Basal ganglia contribution to rule expectancy and temporal predictability in speech	CORTEX			English	Article						Temporal predictability; Beat; Meter; Syntax; Speech; Basal ganglia; Cerebellum	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BEAT PERCEPTION; WORD SEGMENTATION; TIME PERCEPTION; NEURAL BASIS; LANGUAGE; RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS	The current work set out to answer three questions: (1) Are reported syntactic deficits in patients with structural damage to the basal ganglia (BG) in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical systems (CSTCS) the result of a syntax specific computational deficit or are they potentially a consequence of a generalized timing deficit? (2) Do BG patients suffer from a simple beat perception deficit in speech comparable to the one reported in music? (3) Can regular speech meter (i.e., a pattern of beats induced by the regular alteration of stressed and unstressed syllable accents) ameliorate the computation of syntactically marked information by making speech events temporally predictable and salient? The latter 'remediation' hypothesis would predict that when speech events (i.e., those that are syntactically marked) are metrically aligned to the syllabic accent structure, the computation of syntactic information is facilitated or in the case of patients ameliorated. During continuous EEG measurement nineteen patients with focal BG lesions and matched healthy controls listened to metrically regular and syntactically well-formed sentences and metrically well-formed sentences that either violated syntactic expectancy, metrical expectancy, or both. While healthy controls showed an expected P600 response in the event-related brain potential (ERP) to all expectancy violations, BG patients showed overall comparable P600 responses to all, but the metrical expectancy violation. These results confirm that (1) BG patients suffer from a simple beat perception deficit in speech and (2) regular speech meter ameliorates the computation of syntactically marked information in the speech signal. We propose that a domain general sensorimotor cerebello-thalamo-cortical system (CTCS), involved in event-based temporal processing, engages in the remediation of dysfunctional cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical timing that affects the timely computation of linguistic (i.e., syntax) information in the speech signal.

Probing the developmental and neural origins of our social capacities is a way of addressing this question. In the last 10 years the field of social-cognitive development has witnessed a surge in studies using neuroscience methods to elucidate the development of social information processing during infancy. While the use of electroencephalography (EEG)/event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has revealed a great deal about the timing and localization of the cortical processes involved in early social cognition, the principles underpinning the early development of social brain functioning remain largely unexplored. Here I provide a framework that delineates the essential processes implicated in the early development of the social brain. In particular, I argue that the development of social brain functions in infancy is characterized by the following key principles: (a) self-relevance, (b) joint engagement, (c) predictability, (d) categorization, (e) discrimination, and (f) integration. For all of the proposed principles, I provide empirical examples to illustrate when in infancy they emerge. Moreover, I discuss to what extent they are in fact specifically social in nature or share properties with more domain-general developmental principles. Taken together, this article provides a conceptual integration of the existing EEG/ERPs and fNIRS work on infant social brain function and thereby offers the basis for a principle-based approach to studying the neural correlates of early social cognition.

Human anterior thalamic nuclei are involved in emotion-attention interaction	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; Anterior thalamic nuclei; EEG; Emotion; Attention; Epilepsy	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CINGULATE CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; STIMULI COMPETE; EPILEPSY; FEAR	Patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) provide an opportunity to study affective processes in humans with "lesion on demand" at key nodes in the limbic circuitries, such as at the anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT). ANT has been suggested to play a role in emotional control with its connection to the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. However, direct evidence for its role in emotional function in human subjects is lacking. Reported side effects of ANT-DBS in the treatment of refractory epilepsy include depression related symptoms. In line with these mood-related clinical side effects, we have previously reported that stimulating the anterior thalamus increased emotional interference in a visual attention task as indicated by prolonged reaction times due to threat-related emotional distractors. We used event-related potentials to investigate potential attentional mechanism behind this behavioural observation. We hypothesized that ANT-DBS leads to greater attention capture by threat-related distractors. We tested this hypothesis using centro-parietal N2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitude as a measure of allocated attentional resources. Six epileptic patients treated with deep brain stimulation at ANT participated in the study. Electroencephalography was recorded while the patients performed a computer based Executive-Reaction Time test with threat-related emotional distractors. During the task, either ANT or a thalamic control location was stimulated, or the stimulation was turned off. Stimulation of ANT was associated with increased centro-parietal N2-P3 amplitude and increased reaction time in the context of threat-related emotional distractors. We conclude that high frequency electric stimulation of ANT leads to greater attentional capture by emotional stimuli. This is the first study to provide direct evidence from human subjects with on-line electric manipulation of ANT for its role in emotion-attention interaction. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In a spatial-cueing paradigm, infants were presented with a peripheral target followed by a hand pointing toward (congruent condition) or away (incongruent condition) from the previously cued location. EEG responses to the presentation of the hand were measured. Thirteen-month-olds demonstrated larger amplitudes of ERP component P400 to incongruent compared to congruent pointing gestures over posterior temporal areas; 6-month-olds did not show any differential activation. This result suggests that the neural correlates of pointing perception undergo substantial development between 6 and 13 months of age.	[Melinder, Annika M.

J	Sburlea, AI; Montesano, L; Minguez, J				Ioana Sburlea, Andreea; Montesano, Luis; Minguez, Javier			Continuous detection of the self-initiated walking pre-movement state from EEG correlates without session-to-session recalibration	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI; motor intention; rehabilitation; session-to-session transfer; MRCP; ERD	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOTOR-IMAGERY; CHRONIC STROKE; GAIT; REHABILITATION; CLASSIFICATION; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION; INTERFACE; RHYTHMS	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as a rehabilitation tool have been used to restore functions in patients with motor impairments by actively involving the central nervous system and triggering prosthetic devices according to the detected pre-movement state. However, since EEG signals are highly variable between subjects and recording sessions, typically a BCI is calibrated at the beginning of each session. This process is inconvenient especially for patients suffering locomotor disabilities in maintaining a bipedal position for a longer time. This paper presents a continuous EEG decoder of a pre-movement state in self-initiated walking and the usage of this decoder from session to session without recalibrating. Approach. Ten healthy subjects performed a self-initiated walking task during three sessions, with an intersession interval of one week. The implementation of our continuous decoder is based on the combination of movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features with sparse classification models. Main results. During intrasession our technique detects the pre-movement state with 70% accuracy. Moreover this decoder can be applied from session to session without recalibration, with a decrease in performance of about 4% on a one- or two-week intersession interval. Significance. Our detection model operates in a continuous manner, which makes it a straightforward asset for rehabilitation scenarios. By using both temporal and spectral information we attained higher detection rates than the ones obtained with the MRCP and ERD detection models, both during the intrasession and intersession conditions.

Receiving positive evaluations from others mayelicit affiliative emotions whereas negative evaluations are likely to trigger withdrawal and defensive social behavior. Evolution has equipped humans with efficient systems to detect, appraise, and regulate responses to such evaluative communications and to express complementary responses. The current study investigates neural, facial-muscular, and experiential responses to short videos delivering neutral, positive, and negative audiovisual messages as well as their relation to individual differences in social anxiety. Fifty-eight participants (32 female) watched 90 videos with male and female actors displaying positive, negative, and neutral statements. Experientially, ratings of valence and arousal showed the expected category differences. Neurally, larger centro-parietal late positive event related potentials were found for emotional (positive and negative) videos compared to neutral videos. Facial electromyography revealed reduced corrugator muscle and increased zygomaticus major muscle activity for positive videos compared to neutral and negative videos. Cognitive components of social anxiety were related to a more unpleasant experience of negative videos and a less pleasant experience of positive videos.

Whole-scalp EEG mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials in macaque monkeys	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Craniotomy; Electrical neuroimaging; High-density EEG; LORETA inverse solution; Non-human primate; Sensorimotor cortex	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; UNILATERAL LESION; BREACH RHYTHM; SKULL DEFECTS; BRAIN-INJURY; IN-VIVO; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS	High-density scalp EEG recordings are widely used to study whole-brain neuronal networks in humans non-invasively. Here, we validate EEG mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) for the long-term investigation of large-scale neuronal networks and their reorganisation after lesions requiring a craniotomy. SSEPs were acquired from 33 scalp electrodes in five adult anaesthetized animals after electrical median or tibial nerve stimulation. SSEP scalp potential maps were identified by cluster analysis and identified in individual recordings. A distributed, linear inverse solution was used to estimate the intracortical sources of the scalp potentials. SSEPs were characterised by a sequence of components with unique scalp topographies. Source analysis confirmed that median nerve SSEP component maps were in accordance with the somatotopic organisation of the sensorimotor cortex. Most importantly, SSEP recordings were stable both intra- and interindividually. We aim to apply this method to the study of recovery and reorganisation of large-scale neuronal networks following a focal cortical lesion requiring a craniotomy. As a prerequisite, the present study demonstrated that a 300-mm(2) unilateral craniotomy over the sensorimotor cortex necessary to induce a cortical lesion, followed by bone flap repositioning, suture and gap plugging with calcium phosphate cement, did not induce major distortions of the SSEPs. In conclusion, SSEPs can be successfully and reproducibly recorded from high-density EEG caps in macaque monkeys before and after a craniotomy, opening new possibilities for the long-term follow-up of the cortical reorganisation of large-scale networks in macaque monkeys after a cortical lesion.

We can create new words combining existing ones in meaningful ways to form new linguistic expressions. The present study investigated the morphological processing of novel compound words in overt speech production. Native speakers of Dutch learned a series of new compounds (e.g. appelgezicht, 'apple-face') that were later used as primes in a morphological priming task. In this protocol, primes were compound words morphologically related to a target's picture name (e.g. appelgezicht was used for a picture of an apple, Dutch appel). The novel primes were compared with corresponding familiar compounds sharing a free morpheme (e.g. appelmoes, 'applesauce') and with unrelated compounds. Participants were required to read aloud words and to name pictures in a long-lag design. Behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) data were collected in two sessions, separated by 48 h. Clear facilitation of picture naming latencies was obtained when pictures were paired with morphological related words. Notably, our results show that novel compounds have a stronger priming effect than familiar compounds in both sessions, which is expressed in a marked reduction in target naming latencies and a decrease in the N400 amplitude. These results suggest that participants focused more on the separate constituents when reading novel primes than in the case of existing compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, thus far, only low-level sensory stimuli have been used as targets. The current human electroencephalography (EEG) study examined the influence of neural oscillatory phase on a lexical-decision task performed for stimuli embedded in noise. Neural phase angles were compared for correct versus incorrect lexical decisions using a phase bifurcation index (BI), which quantifies differences in mean phase angles and phase concentrations between correct and incorrect trials. Neural phase angles in the alpha frequency range (8 - 12 Hz) over right anterior sensors were approximately antiphase in a prestimulus time window, and thus successfully distinguished between correct and incorrect lexical decisions. Moreover, alpha-band oscillations were again approximately antiphase across participants for correct versus incorrect trials during a later peristimulus time window (similar to 500 ms) at left-central electrodes. Strikingly, lexical decision accuracy was not predicted by either event-related potentials (ERPs) or oscillatory power measures. We suggest that correct lexical decisions depend both on successful sensory processing, which is made possible by the alignment of stimulus onset with an optimal alpha phase, as well as integration and weighting of decisional information, which is coupled to alpha phase immediately following the critical manipulation that differentiated words from pseudowords. The current study constitutes a first step toward characterizing the role of dynamic oscillatory brain states for higher cognitive functions, such as spoken word recognition.

TIME COURSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF MUSICAL EXPERTISE ON THE PROCESSING OF VOCAL AND MUSICAL SOUNDS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						music; voice; vocalizations; speech prosody; ERPs; expertise	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL COMPLEXITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MUSICIANS; SPEECH; ERP; RESPONSES; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION	Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested that different cerebral regions preferentially process human voice and music. Yet, little is known on the temporal course of the brain processes that decode the category of sounds and how the expertise in one sound category can impact these processes. To address this question, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 15 musicians and 18 non-musicians while they were listening to short musical excerpts (piano and violin) and vocal stimuli (speech and non-linguistic vocalizations). The task of the participants was to detect noise targets embedded within the stream of sounds. Event-related potentials revealed an early differentiation of sound category, within the first 100 ms after the onset of the sound, with mostly increased responses to musical sounds. Importantly, this effect was modulated by the musical background of participants, as musicians were more responsive to music sounds than non-musicians, consistent with the notion that musical training increases sensitivity to music. In late temporal windows, brain responses were enhanced in response to vocal stimuli, but musicians were still more responsive to music. These results shed new light on the temporal course of neural dynamics of auditory processing and reveal how it is impacted by the stimulus category and the expertise of participants. (C) 2015 IBRO.

The current study recorded electroencephalography to examine the trajectory of development across adolescence, with a focus on how social context impacts cognition and behaviour. To that end, younger (10-12 years) and older (14-16 years) adolescents played a modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm against two virtual opponents: a low-provoker and a high-provoker. During the task's decision phase (where participants select punishment for their opponent), we examined two event-related potentials: the N2 and the late positive potential (LPP). During the outcome phase (where participants experience win or loss feedback), we measured the feedback related negativity (FRN). Although N2 amplitudes did not vary with provocation, LPP amplitudes were enhanced under high provocation for the younger group, suggesting that emotional reactivity during the decision phase was heightened for early adolescents. During the outcome phase, the FRN was reduced following win outcomes under high provocation for both groups, suggesting that a highly provocative social opponent may influence the reward response. Collectively, the data argue that social context is an important factor modulating neural responses in adolescent behavioural and brain development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we manipulated whether repetitions were massed (consecutive) or distributed (intermixed) and measured event-related potentials and oscillatory activity, investigating the question of whether there is evidence of spontaneous episodic retrieval for distributed, but not massed, repetition. Results showed that distributed repetition uniquely prompted a significant centroparietal old-new effect as well as enhanced theta, compared to either novel presentations or massed repetitions, consistent with a hypothesis of spontaneous retrieval. Massed repetition, on the other hand, prompted repetition suppression and reduction of the N2/P2. Taken together, the data suggest that distributed repetition may facilitate later memory performance because it spontaneously retrieves prior representations.

The late positive potential indexes a role for emotion during learning of trust from eye-gaze cues	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Emotion; Faces; Gaze; Trustworthiness; N250	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; UNIQUE MORPHOLOGY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SOCIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; NEGATIVITY BIAS; JOINT ATTENTION	Gaze direction perception triggers rapid visuospatial orienting to the location observed by others. When this is congruent with the location of a target, reaction times are faster than when incongruent. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that the non-joint attention induced by incongruent cues are experienced as more emotionally negative and this could relate to less favorable trust judgments of the faces when gaze-cues are contingent with identity. Here, we provide further support for these findings using time-resolved event-related potentials. In addition to replicating the effects of identity-contingent gaze-cues on reaction times and trust judgments, we discovered that the emotion-related late positive potential increased across blocks to incongruent compared to congruent faces before, during and after the gaze-cue, suggesting both learning and retrieval of emotion states associated with the face. We also discovered that the face-recognition-related N250 component appeared to localize to sources in anterior temporal areas. Our findings provide unique electrophysiological evidence for the role of emotion in learning trust from gaze-cues, suggesting that the retrieval of face evaluations during interaction may take around 1000 ms and that the N250 originates from anterior temporal face patches.

Recent evidence from speakers of Western languages such as English and Dutch suggests non-discrete transmission, but it is not clear whether this view can be generalized to other languages such as Mandarin, given potential differences in phonological encoding across languages. The present study used Mandarin speakers and combined a behavioral picture-word interference task with event-related potentials. The design factorially crossed semantic and phonological relatedness. Results showed semantic and phonological effects both in behavioral and electrophysiological measurements, with statistical additivity in latencies, and discrete time signatures (250-450 ms and 450-600 ms after picture onset for the semantic and phonological condition, respectively). Overall, results suggest that in Mandarin spoken production, information is transmitted from semantic to phonological levels in a sequential fashion. Hence, temporal signatures associated with spoken word production might differ depending on target language. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The need to belong to a social group may result in distinct neural responses to diverse social comparison outcomes. To extend previous studies by examining how social comparison with hierarchical characteristics is temporally processed, electroencephalography responses were recorded in the current study. Participants played a lottery game with two pseudo-players simultaneously and received both their own and the other two players' outcomes. Results of three event-related potential components, including the P2, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), and the late positive component (LPC), indicate that social comparison manifests in three stages. First, outcomes indicating a different performance from others elicited a larger P2 than evenness. Second, the FRN showed hierarchical sensitivity to social comparison outcomes. This effect manifested asymmetrically. Finally, large difference between the participant's outcome and the other two players' evoked a larger LPC than the medium difference and the even condition. We suggest that during social comparison, people detect if there is any difference between self and others, and then evaluate the information of this difference hierarchically, and finally interpret the situations in which oneself deviates from the group as most motivationally salient.

Emotionally anesthetized: media violence induces neural changes during emotional face processing	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						media violence; ERPs; emotion processing; inhibition; desensitization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VIDEO GAMES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION; AGGRESSION; DESENSITIZATION; THREAT; INHIBITION	Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others. Alterations in emotional face processing following exposure to media violence may result in desensitization to others' emotional states. This study used scalp electroencephalography methods to examine the link between exposure to violence and neural changes associated with emotional face processing. Twenty-five participants were shown a violent or nonviolent film clip and then completed a gender discrimination stop-signal task using emotional faces. Media violence did not affect the early visual P100 component; however, decreased amplitude was observed in the N170 and P200 event-related potentials following the violent film, indicating that exposure to film violence leads to suppression of holistic face processing and implicit emotional processing. Participants who had just seen a violent film showed increased frontal N200/P300 amplitude. These results suggest that media violence exposure may desensitize people to emotional stimuli and thereby require fewer cognitive resources to inhibit behavior.

Previous studies show that this mood-congruent attentional bias could mediated by dysfunctions in anterior limbic regions. The Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which originates in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), has been used to research this negativity bias in depressed patients, and could also help to better understand the underlying mechanisms causing the negativity bias in bipolar patients. In this study we investigated error processing in patients with bipolar disorder. Acute depressive bipolar patients (n = 20) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 20) underwent a modified Eriksen Flanker Task to assess test performance and two error-related event-related potentials (ERPs), i.e., the ERN and Error Positivity (Pe) were measured by EEG. Half of the patients were measured again in a euthymic state. We found similar ERN amplitudes in bipolar patients as compared to healthy controls, but significantly reduced Pe amplitudes. Moreover, acutely depressed bipolar patients displayed an ERN and Pe even if they responded accurately or too slow, which indicates that correct responses are processed in a way similar to wrong responses. This can be interpreted as a psychophysiological correlate of typical cognitive distortions in depression, i.e., an erroneous perception of personal failures. This biased error perception partially remained when patients were in a euthymic state. Together, our data indicate that aberrant error processing of bipolar patients may be regarded a trait marker possibly reflecting a risk factor for depressive relapses in bipolar disorder.

Cortical Representations Sensitive to the Number of Perceived Auditory Objects Emerge between 2 and 4 Months of Age: Electrophysiological Evidence	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION; MISMATCH RESPONSES; STREAM SEGREGATION; PITCH; HEARING; EEG; MATURATION; PLASTICITY; EXPERIENCE; INFANTS	Sound waves emitted by two or more simultaneous sources reach the ear as one complex waveform. Auditory scene analysis involves parsing a complex waveform into separate perceptual representations of the sound sources [Bregman, A. S. Auditory scene analysis: The perceptual organization of sounds. London: MIT Press, 1990]. Harmonicity provides an important cue for auditory scene analysis. Normally, harmonics at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency are perceived as one sound with a pitch corresponding to the fundamental frequency. However, when one harmonic in such a complex, pitch-evoking sound is sufficiently mistuned, that harmonic emerges from the complex tone and is perceived as a separate auditory object. Previous work has shown that the percept of two objects is indexed in both children and adults by the object-related negativity component of the ERP derived from EEG recordings [Alain, C., Arnott, S. T., & Picton, T. W. Bottom-up and top-down influences on auditory scene analysis: Evidence from event-related brain potentials. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27, 1072-1089, 2001]. Here we examine the emergence of object-related responses to an 8% harmonic mistuning in infants between 2 and 12 months of age. Two-month-old infants showed no significant object-related response. However, in 4- to 12-month-old infants, a significant frontally positive component was present, and by 8-12 months, a significant frontocentral object-related negativity was present, similar to that seen in older children and adults. This is in accordance with previous research demonstrating that infants younger than 4 months of age do not integrate harmonic information to perceive pitch when the fundamental is missing [He, C., Hotson, L., & Trainor, L. J. Maturation of cortical mismatch mismatch responses to occasional pitch change in early infancy: Effects of presentation rate and magnitude of change. Neuropsychologia, 47, 218-229, 2009]. The results indicate that the ability to use harmonic information to segregate simultaneous sounds emerges at the cortical level between 2 and 4 months of age.

J	Rollins, L; Riggins, T				Rollins, Leslie; Riggins, Tracy			Processing and Rejection of Novel Items in Childhood: Event-Related Potential Study of Similar Lures and Novel Foils	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						lures; episodic memory; recognition memory; attention; event-related potentials; Nc component	RECALL-TO-REJECT; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL; CHILDREN; RECOLLECTION; ATTENTION; ITEM	The ability to correctly identify novel items improves during childhood. Failures to correctly identify novel items are most likely to occur when novel items are similar to previously encountered items (i.e., similar lures) than when they are distinct (i.e., novel foils). Age-related improvements in the correct rejection of novel items are important for children's learning and in applied settings, such as participation in legal proceedings (e.g., lineup identification). However, research has not assessed what processes support children's ability to reliably reject similar lures. The current study examined the rejection of similar lures and novel foils in thirty-eight 5- and 6-year-old children using behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Following a week delay, children were less proficient at rejecting similar lures than novel foils and elicited a larger amplitude Nc response (i.e., 350-500ms) to similar lures. This finding, taken in conjunction with previous studies demonstrating the role of the Nc in attentional processes [see de Haan, M. (2007). Visual attention and recognition memory in infancy. In M. de Haan (Ed.), Infant EEG and event-related potentials (pp. 101-144). New York, NY: Psychology Press], suggests that children allocate greater attention toward similar lures, compared to novel foils, when accurately rejecting them. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the case of mentally practised movements, electroencephalogram (EEG) can be utilized to provide feedback about an otherwise covert act. The main target group for such an intervention are elderly patients, though research so far is largely focused on young populations (<30 years). The present study therefore aimed to examine the influence of age on the neural correlates of covert movements (CMs) in a real-time EEG neurofeedback framework. CM-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) was studied in young (mean age: 23.6 years) and elderly (mean age: 62.7 years) healthy adults. Participants performed covert and overt hand movements. CMs were based on kinesthetic motor imagery (MI) or quasi-movements (QM). Based on previous studies investigating QM in the mu frequency range (8-13 Hz) QM were expected to result in more lateralized ERD% patterns and accordingly higher classification accuracies. Independent of CM strategy the elderly were characterized by a significantly reduced lateralization of ERD%, due to stronger ipsilateral ERD%, and in consequence, reduced classification accuracies. QM were generally perceived as more vivid, but no differences were evident between MI and QM in ERD% or classification accuracies. EEG feedback enhanced task-related activity independently of strategy and age. ERD% measures of overt and covert movements were strongly related in young adults, whereas in the elderly ERD% lateralization is dissociated. In summary, we did not find evidence in support of more pronounced ERD% lateralization patterns in QM. Our finding of a less lateralized activation pattern in the elderly is in accordance to previous research and with the idea that compensatory processes help to overcome neurodegenerative changes related to normal ageing. Importantly, it indicates that EEG neurofeedback studies should place more emphasis on the age of the potential end-users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial of this toolbox along with a detailed description of analytical plans (aka the Chicago Electrical Neuroimaging Analytics, CENA) for the statistical analysis of brain microstate configuration and global field power in within and between-subject designs. Available CENA functions include: (1) a difference wave function; (2) a high-performance microsegmentation suite (HPMS), which consists of three specific analytic tools: (i) a root mean square error (RMSE) metric for identifying stable states and transition states across discrete event-related brain microstates; (ii) a similarity metric based on cosine distance in n dimensional sensor space to determine whether template maps for successive brain microstates differ in configuration of brain activity, and (iii) global field power (GFP) metrics for identifying changes in the overall level of activation of the brain; (3) a bootstrapping function for assessing the extent to which the solutions identified in the HPMS are robust (reliable, generalizable) and for empirically deriving additional experimental hypotheses; and (4) step-by-step procedures for performing a priori contrasts for data analysis.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Multiple comparisons problem; Autocorrelation; Statistics; Successive univariate tests	LATENCY DIFFERENCES; MEG; EEG	When making statistical comparisons, the temporal dimension of the EEG signal introduces problems. Guthrie and Buchwald (1991) proposed a formally correct statistical approach that deals with these problems: comparing waveforms by counting the number of successive significant univariate tests and then contrasting this number to a well-chosen critical value. However, in the literature, this method is often used inappropriately. Using real EEG data and Monte Carlo simulations, we examined the problems associated with the incorrect use of this approach under circumstances often encountered in the literature. Our results show inflated false-positive or false-negative rates depending on parameters of the data, including filtering. Our findings suggest that most applications of this method result in an inappropriate familywise error rate control. Solutions and alternative methods are discussed.

Fifteen participants had to control an aircraft in order to target one of three differently-colored aircrafts displayed on a computer screen. The name of the color (written in black ink) corresponding to the aircraft to target was displayed in the center of the screen. Simultaneously with the onset of the written name of the color, a spoken color name distractor that participants had to ignore was played. This auditory distractor was either congruent (10%, spoken color name matched the written color) or incongruent (10%, spoken color name did not match the written color). The task difficulty varied in terms of working memory load with an n-back-like sub-task. In the low load condition, participants had to target the aircraft corresponding to the currently presented written instruction (n = 0). In the high load condition, participants had to target the aircraft corresponding to the instruction presented two trials before (n = 2). Behavioral analysis showed that increased mental workload provoked a decrease in piloting performance, i.e. participants tended to forget the correct instruction. On the physiological level, EEG/ERP measurements related to instructions showed that increased mental workload was accompanied by lower P3b amplitude. We assume that the lower P3b amplitude reflects the depletion of the cognitive resources allocated to the processing of the instructions. These results suggest that P3b can be a relevant indicator of the openness of the system to sudden and unexpected critical stimuli such as auditory alerts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

So far, there are very few peer-reviewed studies on effects of Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), which is a digital radio communication standard used by security authorities and organizations in several European countries, on the central nervous system. Objectives: To analyze the impact of simulated TETRA handset signals at 385 MHz on slow cortical potentials (SCPs). Methods: 30 young healthy males (25.2 +/- 2.7 years) were exposed in a double-blind, counterbalanced, cross-over design to one of three exposure levels (TETRA with 10 g averaged peak spatial SAR: 1.5 W/kg, 6.0 W/kg and sham). Exposure was conducted with a body worn antenna (especially designed for this study), positioned at the left side of the head. Subjects had 9 test sessions (three per exposure condition) in which three SCPs were assessed: SCP related to a clock monitoring task (CMT), Contingent negative variation (CNV) and Bereitschaftspotential (BP). Results: Neither behavioral measures nor the electrophysiological activity was significantly affected by exposure in the three investigated SCP paradigms. Independent of exposure, significant amplitude differences between scalp regions could be observed for the CMT-related SCP and for the CNV. Conclusions: The present results reveal no evidence of RF-EMF exposure-dependent brain activity modifications investigated at the behavioral and the physiological level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Initially, the processing of faces seems to be supported by early extrastriate occipital cortices and revealed by modulations of the occipital P1. This early response is thought to reflect the detection of certain primary structural aspects indicating the presence grosso modo of a face within the visual field. The posterior-temporal N170 is more sensitive to the detection of faces as complex-structured stimuli and, therefore, to the presence of its distinctive organizational characteristics prior to within-category identification. In turn, the relatively late and probably more rostrally generated N250r and N400-like responses might respectively indicate processes of access and retrieval of face-related information, which is stored in long-term memory (LTM). New methods of analysis of electrophysiological and neuroanatomical data, namely, dynamic causal modeling, single-trial and time-frequency analyses, are highly recommended to advance in the knowledge of those brain mechanisms concerning face processing.

Action prediction based on anticipatory brain potentials during simulated driving	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						driving simulator; movement intention detection; slow cortical potential (SCP); contingent negative variation (CNV); brain-computer interface (BCI); anticipation; electroencephalogram (EEG)	EEG; TIME	Objective. The ability of an automobile to infer the driver's upcoming actions directly from neural signals could enrich the interaction of the car with its driver. Intelligent vehicles fitted with an on-board brain-computer interface able to decode the driver's intentions can use this information to improve the driving experience. In this study we investigate the neural signatures of anticipation of specific actions, namely braking and accelerating. Approach. We investigated anticipatory slow cortical potentials in electroencephalogram recorded from 18 healthy participants in a driving simulator using a variant of the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions: count-down numbers followed by 'Start'/'Stop' cue. We report decoding performance before the action onset using a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier based on temporal features. Main results. (i) Despite the visual and driving related cognitive distractions, we show the presence of anticipatory event related potentials locked to the stimuli onset similar to the widely reported CNV signal (with an average peak value of -8 mu V at electrode Cz). (ii) We demonstrate the discrimination between cases requiring to perform an action upon imperative subsequent stimulus (Go condition, e.g. a 'Red' traffic light) versus events that do not require such action (No-go condition; e.g. a 'Yellow' light); with an average single trial classification performance of 0.83 +/- 0.13 for braking and 0.79 +/- 0.12 for accelerating (area under the curve). (iii) We show that the centro-medial anticipatory potentials are observed as early as 320 +/- 200 ms before the action with a detection rate of 0.77 +/- 0.12 in offline analysis. Significance. We show for the first time the feasibility of predicting the driver's intention through decoding anticipatory related potentials during simulated car driving with high recognition rates.

Infant Auditory Processing and Event-related Brain Oscillations	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 101; Infant; Infant Brain; Human Development; Auditory Development; Oscillations; Brain Oscillations; Theta; Electroencephalogram; Child Development; Event-related Potentials; Source Localization; Auditory Cortex	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; DISCRIMINATION; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; SYSTEMS	Rapid auditory processing and acoustic change detection abilities play a critical role in allowing human infants to efficiently process the fine spectral and temporal changes that are characteristic of human language. These abilities lay the foundation for effective language acquisition; allowing infants to hone in on the sounds of their native language. Invasive procedures in animals and scalp-recorded potentials from human adults suggest that simultaneous, rhythmic activity (oscillations) between and within brain regions are fundamental to sensory development; determining the resolution with which incoming stimuli are parsed. At this time, little is known about oscillatory dynamics in human infant development. However, animal neurophysiology and adult EEG data provide the basis for a strong hypothesis that rapid auditory processing in infants is mediated by oscillatory synchrony in discrete frequency bands. In order to investigate this, 128-channel, high-density EEG responses of 4-month old infants to frequency change in tone pairs, presented in two rate conditions (Rapid: 70 msec ISI and Control: 300 msec ISI) were examined. To determine the frequency band and magnitude of activity, auditory evoked response averages were first co-registered with ageappropriate brain templates. Next, the principal components of the response were identified and localized using a two-dipole model of brain activity. Single-trial analysis of oscillatory power showed a robust index of frequency change processing in bursts of Theta band (3 - 8 Hz) activity in both right and left auditory cortices, with left activation more prominent in the Rapid condition. These methods have produced data that are not only some of the first reported evoked oscillations analyses in infants, but are also, importantly, the product of a well-established method of recording and analyzing clean, meticulously collected, infant EEG and ERPs. In this article, we describe our method for infant EEG net application, recording, dynamic brain response analysis, and representative results.

These include heritability, test-retest reliability, and trait-like stability. Recent evidence suggests that P300 may also serve as a predictive biomarker for transition to psychosis during the schizophrenia prodrome. Historically, the utility of the P300 has been limited by its clinical nonspecificity, cross-site measurement variability, and required EEG expertise. The Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS-2) study provided an opportunity to examine the consistency of the measure across multiple sites with varying degrees of EEG experience, and to identify important modulating factors that contribute to measurement variability. Auditory P300 was acquired from 649 controls and 587 patients at 5 sites. An overall patient deficit was observed with effect size 0.62. Each site independently observed a significant patient deficit, but site differences also existed. In patients, site differences reflected clinical differences in positive symptomatology and functional capacity. In controls, site differences reflected differences in racial stratification, smoking and substance use history. These factors differentially suppressed the P300 response, but only in control subjects. This led to an attenuated patient-control difference among smokers and among African Americans with history of substance use. These findings indicate that the P300 can be adequately assessed quantitatively, across sites, without substantial EEG expertise. Measurements are suitable for both genetic endophenotype analyses and studies of psychosis risk and conversion. However, careful attention must be given to selection of appropriate comparison samples to avoid misleading false negative results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While it is widely accepted that the MMN reflects more than basic change detection, a comprehensive description of mental processes modulating this response is still lacking. Within the framework of predictive coding, deviance processing is part of an inference process where prediction errors (the mismatch between incoming sensations and predictions established through experience) are minimized. In this view, the MMN is a measure of prediction error, which yields specific expectations regarding its modulations by various experimental factors. In particular, it predicts that the MMN should decrease as the occurrence of a deviance becomes more predictable. We conducted a passive oddball EEG study and manipulated the predictability of sound sequences by means of different temporal structures. Importantly, our design allows comparing mismatch responses elicited by predictable and unpredictable violations of a simple repetition rule and therefore departs from previous studies that investigate violations of different time-scale regularities. We observed a decrease of the MMN with predictability and interestingly, a similar effect at earlier latencies, within 70 ms after deviance onset. Following these pre-attentive responses, a reduced P3a was measured in the case of predictable deviants. We conclude that early and late deviance responses reflect prediction errors, triggering belief updating within the auditory hierarchy. Beside, in this passive study, such perceptual inference appears to be modulated by higher-level implicit learning of sequence statistical structures. Our findings argue for a hierarchical model of auditory processing where predictive coding enables implicit extraction of environmental regularities.

J	Kamp, SM; Potts, GF; Donchin, E				Kamp, Siri-Maria; Potts, Geoffrey F.; Donchin, Emanuel			On the roles of distinctiveness and semantic expectancies in episodic encoding of emotional words	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; Episodic memory; ERPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-GRABBING POWER; AUTOMATIC VIGILANCE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; SOCIAL INFORMATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP; RESPONSES; ENHANCEMENT; RELATEDNESS	We examined the factors that contribute to enhanced recall for emotionally arousing words by analyzing behavioral performance, the P300 as an index of distinctiveness, and the N400 as an index of semantic expectancy violation in a modified Von Restorff paradigm. While their EEG was recorded, participants studied three list types (1) neutral words including one emotionally arousing isolate (either positive or negative), (2) arousing, negative words including one neutral isolate, or (3) arousing, positive words including one neutral isolate. Immediately after each list, free recall was tested. Negative, but not positive, words exhibited enhanced recall when presented as isolates in lists of neutral words and elicited a larger P300 for subsequently recalled than not-recalled words. This suggests that arousing, negative words stand out and that their distinctiveness contributes to their superior recall. Positive valence had an enhancing effect on recall only when the list contained mostly other positive words. Neutral isolates placed in either positive or negative lists elicited an N400, suggesting that semantic expectations developed in emotional word lists regardless of valence. However, semantic relatedness appeared to more strongly contribute to recall for positive than negative words. Our results suggest that distinctiveness and semantic relatedness contribute to episodic encoding of arousing words, but the impact of each factor depends on both a word's valence and its context.

In this task, responses were determined by the combinations of S1 and S2 rather than by S1 only. We had attributed this reduction of the oddball effect to increased task difficulty. The present study investigated possible reasons for this reduction of S1-evoked P3b in more detail, by making the combination task easier in several respects: allowing for forming associations from S1 to responses (Experiment 1), reducing the complexity of stimulus-response (S-R) mappings (Experiment 2), and decreasing S2 relevance in defining responses (Experiment 3). The results showed that only S2 relevance affected the oddball effect on S1 evoked P3b. Namely, when S2 attained some relevance by inducing a go/no-go decision for S1-defined responses, the oddball effect on S1-evoked P3b was intermediate between the large effect in the simple oddball task and the small effect in the combination task. The results may be explained in terms of the S-R link hypothesis of P3b which interprets P3b as reflecting reactivation of well-established S-R links. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have indicated the existence of neural correlates of residual music skills in postlingually deaf adults and children. However, little is known about the behavioral and neural correlates of music perception in the new generation of prelingually deaf adolescents who grew up with CIs. With electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded the mismatch negativity (MMN) of the auditory event-related potential to changes in musical features in adolescent CI users and in normal-hearing (NH) age mates. EEG recordings and behavioral testing were carried out before (T1) and after (T2) a 2-week music training program for the CI users and in two sessions equally separated in time for NH controls. We found significant MMNs in adolescent CI users for deviations in timbre, intensity, and rhythm, indicating residual neural prerequisites for musical feature processing. By contrast, only one of the two pitch deviants elicited an MMN in CI users. This pitch discrimination deficit was supported by behavioral measures, in which CI users scored significantly below the NH level. Overall, MMN amplitudes were significantly smaller in CI users than in NH controls, suggesting poorer music discrimination ability. Despite compliance from the CI participants, we found no effect of the music training, likely resulting from the brevity of the program. This is the first study showing significant brain responses to musical feature changes in prelingually deaf adolescent CI users and their associations with behavioral measures, implying neural predispositions for at least some aspects of music processing. Future studies should test any beneficial effects of a longer lasting music intervention in adolescent CI users.

Computational models consider the GP to be part of a basal ganglia network involved in cognitive processes related to the control of actions. We examined behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) correlates of action control (i.e., error monitoring) and evaluated the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS). We did this using a standard flanker paradigm and evaluated error-related ERPs. Patients were recruited from a prospective pilot trial for pallidal DBS in HD (trial number NCT00902889). From the initial four patients with Huntington's chorea, two patients with chronic external dorsal pallidum stimulation were available for follow-up and able to perform the task. The results suggest that the external GP constitutes an important basal ganglia element not only for error processing and behavioural adaptation but for general response monitoring processes as well. Response monitoring functions were fully controllable by switching pallidal DBS stimulation on and off. When stimulation was switched off, no neurophysiological and behavioural signs of error and general performance monitoring, as reflected by the error-related negativity and post-error slowing in reaction times were evident. The modulation of response monitoring processes by GP-DBS reflects a side effect of efforts to alleviate motor symptoms in HD. From a clinical neurological perspective, the results suggest that DBS in the external GP segment can be regarded as a potentially beneficial treatment with respect to cognitive functions.

The relationship between these two signatures is not entirely clear: on the one hand they occur after the same type of event and with similar latency, but on the other hand, the time-domain ERP component contains only phase-locked activity whereas the time-frequency response additionally contains non-phase-locked dynamics. Here we examined the ERN and error-related delta/theta activity in relation to each other, focusing on within-subject analyses that utilize single-trial data. Using logistic regression, we constructed three statistical models in which the accuracy of each trial was predicted from the ERN, delta/theta power, or both. We found that both the ERN and delta/theta power worked roughly equally well as predictors of single-trial accuracy (similar to 70% accurate prediction). Furthermore, a model including both measures provided a stronger overall prediction compared to either model alone. Based on these findings two conclusions are drawn: first, the phase-locked part of the EEG signal appears to be roughly as predictive of single-trial response accuracy as the non-phase-locked part; second, the single-trial ERP and delta/theta power contain both overlapping, and independent information.

Automated identification of neural correlates of continuous variables	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Feature selection; Eigen-decomposition; Neural correlates; Electroencephalogram (EEG)	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FRONTAL EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Background: The electroencephalogram (EEG) may be described by a large number of different feature types and automated feature selection methods are needed in order to reliably identify features which correlate with continuous independent variables. New method: A method is presented for the automated identification of features that differentiate two or more groups in neurological datasets based upon a spectral decomposition of the feature set. Furthermore, the method is able to identify features that relate to continuous independent variables. Results: The proposed method is first evaluated on synthetic EEG datasets and observed to reliably identify the correct features. The method is then applied to EEG recorded during a music listening task and is observed to automatically identify neural correlates of music tempo changes similar to neural correlates identified in a previous study. Finally, the method is applied to identify neural correlates of music-induced affective states. The identified neural correlates reside primarily over the frontal cortex and are consistent with widely reported neural correlates of emotions. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods of canonical correlation analysis and common spatial patterns, in order to identify features differentiating synthetic event-related potentials of different amplitudes and is observed to exhibit greater performance as the number of unique groups in the dataset increases. Conclusions: The proposed method is able to identify neural correlates of continuous variables in EEG datasets and is shown to outperform canonical correlation analysis and common spatial patterns.

The discovery of processing stages: Analyzing EEG data with hidden semi-Markov models	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Associative recognition; Processing stages; EEG; Hidden semi-Markov models	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; FORWARD-BACKWARD ALGORITHM; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; TIME-COURSE; ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; WORD-FREQUENCY; RETRIEVAL	In this paper we propose a new method for identifying processing stages in human information processing. Since the 1860s scientists have used different methods to identify processing stages, usually based on reaction time (RT) differences between conditions. To overcome the limitations of RT-based methods we used hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) to analyze EEG data. This HSMM-EEG methodology can identify stages of processing and how they vary with experimental condition. By combining this information with the brain signatures of the identified stages one can infer their function, and deduce underlying cognitive processes. To demonstrate the method we applied it to an associative recognition task. The stage-discovery method indicated that three major processes play a role in associative recognition: a familiarity process, an associative retrieval process, and a decision process. We conclude that the new stage-discovery method can provide valuable insight into human information processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We examined such links in a group of 104 infants with and without a family history for autism in the first year of life. Our findings suggest robust associations between event related potential responses to eye gaze and observed parent-infant interaction measures. In both groups, infants with more positive affect exhibit stronger differentiation to gaze stimuli. This association was observed with the earlier P100 waveform component in the control group but with the later P400 component in infants at-risk. These exploratory findings are critical in paving the way for a better understanding of how infant laboratory measures may relate to overt behavior and how both can be combined in the context of predicting risk or clinical diagnosis in toddlerhood.

To date, the contributions of icEEG have been limited to the individual-level analyses or cohorts whose data are not integrated in any way. Here we discuss how grouped approaches to icEEG overcome challenges related to sparse-sampling, correct for individual variations in response and provide statistically valid models of brain activity in a population. By the generation of whole-brain activity maps, grouped icEEG enables the study of intra and interregional dynamics between distributed cortical substrates exhibiting task-dependent activity. In this fashion, grouped icEEG analyses can provide significant advances in understanding the mechanisms by which cortical networks give rise to cognitive functions.

Effects of Presentation Rate and Attention on Auditory Discrimination: A Comparison of Long-Latency Auditory Evoked Potentials in School-Aged Children and Adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; LANGUAGE-LEARNING IMPAIRMENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SPEECH STIMULI; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDEXES; FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION; READING DISABILITIES; SENSORY MEMORY	Decoding human speech requires both perception and integration of brief, successive auditory stimuli that enter the central nervous system as well as the allocation of attention to language-relevant signals. This study assesses the role of attention on processing rapid transient stimuli in adults and children. Cortical responses (EEG/ERPs), specifically mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, to paired tones (standard 100-100Hz; deviant 100-300Hz) separated by a 300, 70 or 10ms silent gap (ISI) were recorded under Ignore and Attend conditions in 21 adults and 23 children (6-11 years old). In adults, an attention-related enhancement was found for all rate conditions and laterality effects (L>R) were observed. In children, 2 auditory discrimination-related peaks were identified from the difference wave (deviant-standard): an early peak (eMMN) at about 100-300ms indexing sensory processing, and a later peak (LDN), at about 400-600ms, thought to reflect reorientation to the deviant stimuli or "second-look" processing. Results revealed differing patterns of activation and attention modulation for the eMMN in children as compared to the MMN in adults: The eMMN had a more frontal topography as compared to adults and attention played a significantly greater role in childrens' rate processing. The pattern of findings for the LDN was consistent with hypothesized mechanisms related to further processing of complex stimuli. The differences between eMMN and LDN observed here support the premise that separate cognitive processes and mechanisms underlie these ERP peaks. These findings are the first to show that the eMMN and LDN differ under different temporal and attentional conditions, and that a more complete understanding of children's responses to rapid successive auditory stimulation requires an examination of both peaks.

J	Zalar, B; Martin, T; Kavcic, V				Zalar, Bojan; Martin, Tim; Kavcic, Voyko			Cortical configuration by stimulus onset visual evoked potentials (SO-VEPs) predicts performance on a motion direction discrimination task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Stimulus onset VEPs; P1; N1; P2; Configuration; Diffusion model	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AGE; BRAIN; MECHANISMS; NETWORK; ERP; SPECIFICITY; NOVELTY	The slowing of information processing, a hallmark of cognitive aging, has several origins. Previously we reported that in a motion direction discrimination task, older as compared to younger participants showed prolonged non-decision time, an index of an early perceptual stage, while in motion onset visual evoked potentials (MO-VEPs) the P1 component was enhanced and N2 was diminished. We did not find any significant correlations between behavioral and MO-VEP measures. Here, we investigated the role of age in encoding and perceptual processing of stimulus onset visually evoked potentials (SO-VEPs). Twelve healthy adults (age <55 years) and 19 elderly (age > 55 years) performed a motion direction discrimination task during EEG recording. Prior to motion, the stimulus consisted of a static cloud of white dots on a black background. As expected, SO-VEPs evoked well defined P1, N1, and P2 components. Elderly participants as compared to young participants showed increased P1 amplitude while their P2 amplitude was reduced. In addition elderly participants showed increased latencies for P1 and N1 components. Contrary to the findings with MO-VEPs, SO-VEP parameters were significant predictors of average response times and diffusion model parameters. Our electrophysiological results support the notion that slowing of information processing in older adults starts at the very beginning of encoding in visual cortical processing, most likely in striate and extrastriate visual cortices. More importantly, the earliest SO-VEP components, possibly reflecting configuration of visual cortices and encoding processes, predict subsequent prolonging and tardiness of perceptual and higher-level cognitive processes.

Recent results with experimental protocols inducing long-term potentiation in healthy subjects suggest that cortical plasticity phenomena might be reflected by changes of beta power recorded with EEG during rest. Here, we determined whether motor practice produces changes in beta power at rest and during movements in both healthy subjects and patients with PD. We hypothesized that such changes would be reduced in PD. Methods: We thus recorded EEG in patients with PD and age-matched controls before, during and after a 40-minute reaching task. We determined posttask changes of beta power at rest and assessed the progressive changes of beta ERD and ERS during the task over frontal and sensorimotor regions. Results: We found that beta ERS and ERD changed significantly with practice in controls but not in PD. In PD compared to controls, beta power at rest was greater over frontal sensors but posttask changes, like those during movements, were far less evident. In both groups, kinematic characteristics improved with practice; however, there was no correlation between such improvements and the changes in beta power. Conclusions: We conclude that prolonged practice in a motor task produces use-dependent modifications that are reflected in changes of beta power at rest and during movement.

SYSTEM EQUIVALENCE OF BRAIN POTENTIALS P300 AND P600 IN SENSORY-MOTOR SELECTION TASKS AND WORDS CATEGORIZATION	PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL			Russian	Article						system processes; afferent synthesis; differentiated actions movements; sensomotor choic; categorization of words; event-related potentials; P300; P600	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULUS	Actual for psychophysiology problem of revealing identical by content brain electrical potentials has been solved in the present research by means of comparison of potentials with system processes (according to P.K. Anohin), that are invariant for different actions. Components of event-related potentials corresponding to the processes of afferent synthesis were examined. It was hypothesized that the component of evoked potentials that has stable association with the number of simultaneously active systems corresponds to the process of afferent synthesis. Two empirical studies with EEG registration are described. In the first study (50 participants, aged 18-37, 22 females and 28 males), sensory-motor selection task was set: two equiprobable alternative visual signals were presented and the participants predicted their occurrence with different probability. In the second study (50 persons aged 18-25, 24 females and 26 males) the sample categorized target words that designated specific object or living object with previous semantic priming. Two prime-words used for priming ("organisms" and "objects") were presented in random order. In sensory-motor selection task, it was revealed that the amplitude of the frontal slope of P300 related to the answer on subjectively less probable signal, was significantly less than the amplitude of the frontal slope of P300 related to the performance on more probable signal. In categorization task, it was revealed that the amplitude of the frontal slope of P600 related to target-words' categorization when the prime word was different, was less than the amplitude of the frontal slope of P600 related to target-words' categorization when prime word corresponded to the latter. The arguments for conception that the decrease of the amplitude of the frontal slope of P300 and P600 components characterizes the increase of the number of simultaneously active systems in the individual experience of participants of the study are adduced. Based on the results, the conclusion about system equivalence of P300 and P600 potentials was drawn.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Normal volunteers; EEG	S-R COMPATIBILITY; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; TASK; CUES	Inhibition of return (IOR) means delayed responses for targets at a cued compared to targets at an uncued location. It is assumed to reflect delayed reallocation of attention toward a previously attended location. Besides an attentional mechanism, IOR could also be due to a cue-evoked inhibition to respond toward a cued target. In the present study, IOR with simple, compatible, and incompatible choice responses was compared and tracked by means of event-related EEG activity. IOR was amplified with simple responses but did not differ between compatible and incompatible responses. Attention-related ERP correlates were constant across cue target onset asynchronies as were, in part, behavioral effects. Early, rather sensory ERP components varied with time, reflecting sensory or attentional interaction of cue and target processing. None of these effects varied with response requirements, indicating that response selection does not contribute to IOR in manual choice response tasks.

On day 1, subjects implicitly learned the location of 39 objects by exploring a room and popping bubbles that hid the objects. On day 2, they again popped bubbles in the same environment. In most cases, the objects hidden underneath the bubbles were in the same place as on day 1. However, a varying third of them were misplaced in each block. Subjects indicated their certainty that the object was in the same location as the day before. Compared with bubble pops revealing correctly placed objects, bubble pops revealing misplaced objects evoked a decreased negativity starting at 145 ms, with scalp topography consistent with generation in medial parietal cortex. There was also an increased negativity starting at 515 ms to misplaced objects, with scalp topography consistent with generation in inferior temporal cortex. Additionally, misplaced objects elicited an increase in frontal midline theta power. These findings suggest that the successive neurocognitive stages of processing allocentric space may include an initial template matching, integration of the object within its spatial cognitive map, and memory recall, analogous to the processing negativity N400 and theta that support verbal cognitive maps in humans.

Their combined recording enables the study of brain function while taking advantage of the high temporal resolution of EEG and high spatial resolution of fMRI. However EEG data recorded inside the MR scanner is significantly contaminated by two main sources of artifacts: MR gradient artifacts and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts. Most existing removal approaches for these artifacts fall into-two main categories: average artifact subtraction (AAS) and optimal basis selection (OBS). While these techniques can improve the data quality significantly, highly effective removal of artifacts - particularly the BCG artifact - from the data is still lacking. Here, we compared two of the most commonly used algorithms for BCG artifact removal (OBS and AAS) based on the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of auditory and visual evoked responses recorded during fMRI acquisition. We also further compared optimization of OBS for groups, and at the individual subject and run level. The results suggest that performance of the OBS algorithm can be significantly improved by choosing the optimum number of principal components. Furthermore, optimizing the number of principal components at the individual participant and run level results in significant improvements in the SNR of evoked responses compared to group optimization.

In acute stroke, neurophysiological measures, such as motor evoked potentials (MEPs), have been proposed, although with discordant results. The aim of this study was to identify a reliable neurophysiological measure of recovery in acute post-stroke individuals by combining MEPs and the N100 component of transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials (TEPs). Nine acute post-stroke subjects were included. Clinical evaluation performed in the first week after the event included administration of the European Stroke Scale and Barthel Index and recording of MEPs and TEPs; administration of the clinical scales was repeated after one and three months. The presence/absence of MEPs and TEPs showed correlations with motor outcome. Individuals with a poorer outcome showed absence of both MEPs and TEPs; absence of MEPs alone was related to a partial recovery. Given the results of this exploratory study, further investigation is needed to define the accuracy of combined use of MEPs and TEPs as an approach for predicting motor recovery after acute stroke.

Several recent studies have highlighted the role of posterior parietal areas for this remapping process, yet its temporal dynamics are poorly understood. The present study combined cross-modal stimulation with electrophysiological recordings in humans to trace the time course of tactile spatial remapping during visual-tactile interactions. Adopting an uncrossed or crossed hand posture, participants made speeded elevation judgments about rare vibrotactile stimuli within a stream of frequent, task-irrelevant vibrotactile events presented to the left or right hand. Simultaneous but spatially independent visual stimuli had to be ignored. An analysis of the recorded event-related potentials to the task-irrelevant vibrotactile stimuli revealed a somatotopic coding of tactile stimuli within the first 100ms. Between 180 and 250ms, neither an external nor a somatotopic representation dominated, suggesting that both coordinates were active in parallel. After 250ms, tactile stimuli were coded in a somatotopic frame of reference. Our results indicate that cross-modal interactions start before the termination of tactile spatial remapping, that is within the first 100ms. Thereafter, tactile stimuli are represented simultaneously in both somatotopic and external spatial coordinates, which are dynamically (re-)weighted as a function of processing stage.

HUNT and brother. BROTH, but not for brothel. BROTH. Few studies have investigated whether this pattern extends to novel complex words, and the results to date (all from novel suffixed words) are mixed. In the current study, we examine whether novel compounds (drugrack. RACK) yield morphological priming which is dissociable from that in novel pseudoembedded words (slegrack. RACK). Using masked priming, we find significant and comparable priming in reaction times for word-final elements of both novel compounds and novel pseudoembedded words. Using overt priming, however, we find greater priming effects (in both reaction times and N400 amplitudes) for novel compounds compared to novel pseudoembedded words. These results are consistent with models assuming across-the-board activation of putative constituents, while also suggesting that morpheme activation may persevere despite the lack of an exhaustive morpheme-based parse when an exhaustive monomorphemic analysis is also unavailable. These findings highlight the critical role of the lexical status of the pseudoembedded prime in dissociating morphological and orthographic priming.

High density EEG was recorded for 2 min while children, ages 2-6, watched a video of bubbles. Segments of data were categorized as blinks, saccades, EMG or artifact-free, and both absolute and relative power in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (35-45 Hz) bands were calculated in 9 regions for each category. Using a linear mixed model approach with artifact type, region and their interaction as predictors, we compared mean band power between clean data and each type of artifact. We found significant differences in mean relative and absolute power between artifacts and artifact-free segments in all frequency bands. The magnitude and direction of the differences varied based on power type, region, and frequency band. The most significant differences in mean band power were found in the gamma band for EMG artifact and the theta band for ocular artifacts. Artifact detection strategies need to be sensitive to the oscillations of interest for a given analysis, with the most conservative approach being the removal of all EMG and ocular artifact from EEG data. Quantitative EEG holds considerable promise as a clinical biomarker of both typical and atypical development. However, there needs to be transparency in the choice of power type, regions of interest, and frequency band, as each of these variables are differentially vulnerable to noise, and therefore, their interpretation depends on the methods used to identify and remove artifacts.

Using event-related brain potentials, it has recently been shown that the ability to discriminate between emotional body expressions develops between 4 and 8 months of age. However, it is not clear whether the perception of emotional body expressions in others evokes sensitive brain responses linked to motivational processes in infants. We therefore examined frontal EEG alpha asymmetry in response to dynamic happy and fearful body expressions presented to 4- and 8-month-old infants in 2 orientations (upright and inverted). Our results revealed that only 8-month-olds but not 4-month-olds showed significant differences in their frontal asymmetry responses between emotional expressions when presented in an upright orientation. Specifically, 8-month-old infants showed a greater lateralization to the left hemisphere in response to happy expression, indexing a greater tendency to approach, whereas they showed a greater lateralization to the right hemisphere in response to fearful expressions, indexing a greater tendency to withdraw. These findings provide further support for the notion that infants' perception of emotion undergoes a developmental tuning during this period in development. Critically, the results suggest that the infant brain becomes sensitive to the motivational significance conveyed by the emotional body expressions.

J	Jezek, P; Moucek, R				Jezek, Petr; Moucek, Roman			Semantic framework for mapping object-oriented model to semantic web languages	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG/ERP portal; electrophysiology; object-oriented code; ontology; semantic framework; semantic web		The article deals with and discusses two main approaches in building semantic structures for electrophysiological metadata. It is the use of conventional data structures, repositories, and programming languages on one hand and the use of formal representations of ontologies, known from knowledge representation, such as description logics or semantic web languages on the other hand. Although knowledge engineering offers languages supporting richer semantic means of expression and technological advanced approaches, conventional data structures and repositories are still popular among developers, administrators and users because of their simplicity, overall intelligibility, and lower demands on technical equipment. The choice of conventional data resources and repositories, however, raises the question of how and where to add semantics that cannot be naturally expressed using them. As one of the possible solutions, this semantics can be added into the structures of the programming language that accesses and processes the underlying data. To support this idea we introduced a software prototype that enables its users to add semantically richer expressions into a Java object-oriented code. This approach does not burden users with additional demands on programming environment since reflective Java annotations were used as an entry for these expressions. Moreover, additional semantics need not to be written by the programmer directly to the code, but it can be collected from non-programmers using a graphic user interface. The mapping that allows the transformation of the semantically enriched Java code into the Semantic Web language OWL was proposed and implemented in a library named the Semantic Framework. This approach was validated by the integration of the Semantic Framework in the EEG/ERP Portal and by the subsequent registration of the EEG/ERP Portal in the Neuroscience Information Framework.

Longitudinal study of perception of structured optic flow and random visual motion in infants using high-density EEG	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; ARTIFACT CORRECTION; TIMING STRATEGIES; YOUNG INFANTS; EYE ARTIFACTS; MST NEURONS; BAND POWER	Electroencephalogram (EEG) was used in infants at 3-4months and 11-12months to longitudinally study brain electrical activity as the infants were exposed to structured forwards and reversed optic flow, and non-structured random visual motion. Analyses of visual evoked potential (VEP) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were performed on EEG data recorded with a 128-channel sensor array. VEP results showed infants to significantly differentiate between the radial motion conditions, but only at 11-12months where they showed shortest latency for forwards optic flow and longest latency for random visual motion. When the TSE results of the motion conditions were compared with those of a static non-flow dot pattern, infants at 3-4 and 11-12months both showed significant differences in induced activity. A decrease in amplitudes at 5-7Hz was observed as desynchronized theta-band activity at both 3-4 and 11-12months, while an increase in amplitudes at 9-13Hz was observed as synchronized alpha-band activity only at 11-12months. It was concluded that brain electrical activities related to visual motion perception change during the first year of life, and these changes can be observed both in the VEP and induced activities of EEG. With adequate neurobiological development and locomotor experience infants around 1year of age rely, more so than when they were younger, on structured optic flow and show a more adult-like specialization for motion where faster oscillating cell assemblies have fewer but more specialized neurons, resulting in improved visual motion perception.

During the last few decades, mapping of CSD has been successfully applied to characterize several neuropsychiatric conditions such as alcoholism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, childhood/developmental disorders, and neurological conditions (i.e., epilepsy and brain lesions) using electrophysiological data from resting state and during cognitive performance. The use of CSD and Laplacian measures has proven effective in elucidating topographic and activation differences between groups: i) patients with a specific diagnosis vs. healthy controls, ii) subjects at high risk for a specific diagnosis vs. low risk or normal controls, and iii) patients with specific symptom(s) vs. patients without these symptom(s). The present review outlines and summarizes the studies that have employed CSD measures in investigating several neuropsychiatric conditions. The advantages and potential of CSD-based methods in clinical and research applications along with some of the limitations inherent in the CSD-based methods are discussed in the review, as well as future directions to expand the implementation of CSD to other potential clinical applications. As CSD methods have proved to be more advantageous than using scalp potential data to understand topographic and source activations, its clinical applications offer promising potential, not only for a better understanding of a range of psychiatric conditions, but also for a variety of focal neurological disorders, including epilepsy and other conditions involving brain lesions and surgical interventions.

SENSORIMOTOR EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION REPRESENTS THE EXCITABILITY OF HUMAN SPINAL MOTONEURONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; cortical oscillations; spinal excitability; F-wave; motor imagery	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; F-WAVE; IMAGERY; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; MU; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION	Amplitudes of mu and beta (7-26 Hz) oscillations measured by electroencephalography over the sensorimotor areas are suppressed during motor imagery as well as during voluntary movements. This phenomenon is referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD) and is known to reflect motor cortical excitability. The increased motor cortical excitability associated with ERD during hand motor imagery would induce a descending cortical volley to spinal motoneurons, resulting in facilitation of spinal motoneuronal excitability. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the association of ERD during motor imagery with the excitability of spinal motoneurons in 15 healthy participants. Spinal excitability was tested using the F-wave recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The F-wave results from antidromic activation of spinal motoneurons and is induced by peripheral nerve stimulation. Participants performed 5 s of motor imagery of right thumb abduction following 7 s of rest. The right median nerve was stimulated at wrist level when the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand sensorimotor area exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. The results showed ERD magnitude during hand motor imagery was associated with an increase in F-wave persistence, but not with the response average of F-wave amplitude or F-wave latency. These findings suggest that the ERD magnitude may be a biomarker representing increases in the excitability of both cortical and spinal levels. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Addante, RJ				Addante, Richard James			A critical role of the human hippocampus in an electrophysiological measure of implicit memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; AMNESIC PATIENT HM; RECOGNITION MEMORY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY	The hippocampus has traditionally been thought to be critical for conscious explicit memory but not necessary for unconscious implicit memory processing. In a recent study of a group of mild amnesia patients with evidence of MTL damage limited to the hippocampus, subjects were tested on a direct test of item recognition confidence while electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired, and revealed intact measures of explicit memory from 400 to 600 ms (mid-frontal old-new effect, FN400). The current investigation re-analyzed this data to study eventrelated potentials (ERPs) of implicit memory, using a recently developed procedure that eliminated declarative memory differences. Prior ERP findings from this technique were first replicated in two independent matched control groups, which exhibited reliable implicit memory effects in posterior scalp regions from 400 to 600 ms, which were topographically dissociated from the explicit memory effects of familiarity. However, patients were found to be dramatically impaired in implicit memory effects relative to control subjects, as quantified by a reliable condition x group interaction. Several control analyses were conducted to consider alternative factors that could account for the results, including outliers, sample size, age, or contamination by explicit memory, and each of these factors was systematically ruled out. Results suggest that the hippocampus plays a fundamental role in aspects of memory processing that are beyond conscious awareness. The current findings therefore indicate that both memory systems of implicit and explicit memory may rely upon the same neural structures -but function in different physiological ways.

Studies on the aging effect in neural activation report controversial results. In this paper, pictures of two classes of facial affect, i.e., anger and fear, were presented to young and elderly participants. High-density 256-channel EEG data were recorded and an innovative methodology was used to map the activated brain state at the N170 event-related potential component. The methodology, namely 3D Vector Field Tomography, reconstructs the electrostatic field within the head volume and requires no prior modeling of the individual's brain. Results showed that the elderly exhibited greater N170 amplitudes, while age-based differences were also observed in the topographic distribution of the EEG recordings at the N170 component. The brain activation analysis was performed by adopting a set of regions of interest. Results on the maximum activation area appeared to be emotion-specific; the anger emotional conditions induced the maximum activation in the inferior frontal gyrus, while fear activated more the superior temporal gyrus. The approach used here shows the potential of the proposed computational model to reveal the age effect on the brain activation upon emotion arousing images, which could be further transferred to the design of assistive clinical applications.

A systematic review of the neurophysiology of mindfulness on EEG oscillations	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Mindfulness; Meditation; Neurophysiology; EEG; Systematic review	ORIENTED RECOVERY ENHANCEMENT; COGNITIVE THERAPY; BETA-ACTIVITY; CHRONIC PAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALPHA-ASYMMETRY; THETA ACTIVITY; MEDITATION; ATTENTION; BRAIN	Mindfulness meditation has been purported to be a beneficial practice for wellbeing. It would therefore be expected that the neurophysiology of mindfulness would reflect this impact on wellbeing. However, investigations of the effects of mindfulness have generated mixed reports of increases, decreases, as well as no differences in EEG oscillations in comparison with a resting state and a variety of tasks. We have performed a systematic review of EEG studies of mindfulness meditation in order to determine any common effects and to identify factors which may impact on the effects. Databases were reviewed from 1966 to August 2015. Eligibility criteria included empirical quantitative analyses of mindfulness meditation practice and EEG measurements acquired in relation to practice. A total of 56 papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, consisting of a total 1715 subjects: 1358 healthy individuals and 357 individuals with psychiatric diagnoses. Studies were principally examined for power outcomes in each bandwidth, in particular the power differentials between mindfulness and a control state, as well as outcomes relating to hemispheric asymmetry and event-related potentials. The systematic review revealed that mindfulness was most commonly associated with enhanced alpha and theta power as compared to an eyes closed resting state, although such outcomes were not uniformly reported. No consistent patterns were observed with respect to beta, delta and gamma bandwidths. In summary, mindfulness is associated with increased alpha and theta power in both healthy individuals and in patient groups. This co-presence of elevated alpha and theta may signify a state of relaxed alertness which is conducive to mental health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Uriguen, JA; Garcia-Zapirain, B				Antonio Urigueen, Jose; Garcia-Zapirain, Begona			EEG artifact removal-state-of-the-art and guidelines	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						EEG; artifact; ICA; PCA; regression; EMD; WT	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; ELECTROMYOGENIC ARTIFACTS; AUTOMATED REMOVAL; CONSTRAINED ICA; EOG ARTIFACTS; EYE-MOVEMENT	This paper presents an extensive review on the artifact removal algorithms used to remove the main sources of interference encountered in the electroencephalogram (EEG), specifically ocular, muscular and cardiac artifacts. We first introduce background knowledge on the characteristics of EEG activity, of the artifacts and of the EEG measurement model. Then, we present algorithms commonly employed in the literature and describe their key features. Lastly, principally on the basis of the results provided by various researchers, but also supported by our own experience, we compare the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reported performance, and provide guidelines on how to choose a suitable artifact removal algorithm for a given scenario. With this review we have concluded that, without prior knowledge of the recorded EEG signal or the contaminants, the safest approach is to correct the measured EEG using independent component analysis-to be precise, an algorithm based on second-order statistics such as second-order blind identification (SOBI). Other effective alternatives include extended information maximization (InfoMax) and an adaptive mixture of independent component analyzers (AMICA), based on higher order statistics. All of these algorithms have proved particularly effective with simulations and, more importantly, with data collected in controlled recording conditions. Moreover, whenever prior knowledge is available, then a constrained form of the chosen method should be used in order to incorporate such additional information. Finally, since which algorithm is the best performing is highly dependent on the type of the EEG signal, the artifacts and the signal to contaminant ratio, we believe that the optimal method for removing artifacts from the EEG consists in combining more than one algorithm to correct the signal using multiple processing stages, even though this is an option largely unexplored by researchers in the area.

J	Lochy, A; Van Belle, G; Rossion, B				Lochy, Aliette; Van Belle, Goedele; Rossion, Bruno			A robust index of lexical representation in the left occipito-temporal cortex as evidenced by EEG responses to fast periodic visual stimulation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Word perception; Reading; Pseudowords; Frequency-tagging; Periodicity; Steady-state visual evoked potentials; Fast periodic visual stimulation; Lexical access	WORD FORM AREA; INDIVIDUAL FACE DISCRIMINATION; TIME-COURSE; ORTHOGRAPHIC TYPICALITY; RECOGNITION; ERP; FREQUENCY; DECISION; SENSITIVITY; ATTENTION	Despite decades of research on reading, including the relatively recent contributions of neuroimaging and electrophysiology, identifying selective representations of whole visual words (in contrast to pseudowords) in the human brain remains challenging, in particular without an explicit linguistic task. Here we measured discrimination responses to written words by means of electroencephalography (EEG) during fast periodic visual stimulation. Sequences of pseudofonts, nonwords, or pseudowords were presented through sinusoidal contrast modulation at a periodic 10 Hz frequency rate (F), in which words were interspersed at regular intervals of every fifth item (i.e., F/5, 2 Hz). Participants monitored a central cross color change and had no linguistic task to perform. Within only 3 min of stimulation, a robust discrimination response for words at 2 Hz (and its harmonics, i.e., 4 and 6 Hz) was observed in all conditions, located predominantly over the left occipito-temporal cortex. The magnitude of the response was largest for words embedded in pseudofonts, and larger in nonwords than in pseudowords, showing that list context effects classically reported in behavioral lexical decision tasks are due to visual discrimination rather than decisional processes. Remarkably, the oddball response was significant even for the critical words/pseudowords discrimination condition in every individual participant. A second experiment replicated this words/pseudowords discrimination, and showed that this effect is not accounted for by a higher bigram frequency of words than pseudowords. Without any explicit task, our results highlight the potential of an EEG fast periodic visual stimulation approach for understanding the representation of written language. Its development in the scientific community might be valuable to rapidly and objectively measure sensitivity to word processing in different human populations, including neuropsychological patients with dyslexia and other reading difficulties.

The present study examines the effects of MA on ERP amplitude during performance of simple arithmetic calculations and working memory tasks. Data were obtained from 32 university students as they solved four types of arithmetic problems (one- and two-digit addition and multiplication) and a working memory task comprised of three levels of difficulty (1, 2, and 3-back task). Compared to the Low-MA group, High-MA individuals demonstrated reduced ERR amplitude at frontocentral (between 180-320 ms) and centroparietal locations (between 380-420 ms). These effects were independent of task difficulty/complexity, individual performance, and general state/trait anxiety levels. Results support the hypothesis that higher levels of self-reported MA are associated with lower cortical activation during the early stages of the processing of numeric stimuli in the context of cognitive tasks.

Intonation processing deficits of emotional words among Mandarin Chinese speakers with congenital amusia: an ERP study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						congenital amusia; intonation processing; pitch perception; conflict processing; ERP	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPEECH INTONATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; ERROR-DETECTION; N1 WAVE; CONFLICT; PITCH; COMPONENT; PERCEPTION; MODULATION	Background: Congenital amusia is a disorder that is known to affect the processing of musical pitch. Although individuals with amusia rarely show language deficits in daily life, a number of findings point to possible impairments in speech prosody that amusic individuals may compensate for by drawing on linguistic information. Using EEG, we investigated (1) whether the processing of speech prosody is impaired in amusia and (2) whether emotional linguistic information can compensate for this impairment. Method: Twenty Chinese amusics and 22 matched controls were presented pairs of emotional words spoken with either statement or question intonation while their EEG was recorded. Their task was to judge whether the intonations were the same. Results: Amusics exhibited impaired performance on the intonation-matching task for emotional linguistic information, as their performance was significantly worse than that of controls. EEG results showed a reduced N2 response to incongruent intonation pairs in amusics compared with controls, which likely reflects impaired conflict processing in amusia. However, our EEG results also indicated that amusics were intact in early sensory auditory processing, as revealed by a comparable N1 modulation in both groups. Conclusion: We propose that the impairment in discriminating speech intonation observed among amusic individuals may arise from an inability to access information extracted at early processing stages. This, in turn, could reflect a disconnection between low-level and high-level processing.

Methods: We investigate the ability of a BCI to detect the intention to walk in stroke patients from pre-movement EEG correlates. Moreover, we also investigated how the motivation of the patients to execute a task related to the rehabilitation therapy affects the BCI accuracy. Nine chronic stroke patients performed a self-initiated walking task during three sessions, with an intersession interval of one week. Results: Using a decoder that combines temporal and spectral sparse classifiers we detected pre-movement state with an accuracy of 64 % in a range between 18 % and 85.2 %, with the chance level at 4 %. Furthermore, we found a significantly strong positive correlation (r = 0.561, p = 0.048) between the motivation of the patients to perform the rehabilitation related task and the accuracy of the BCI detector of their intention to walk. Conclusions: We show that a detector based on temporal and spectral features can be used to classify pre-movement state in stroke patients. Additionally, we found that patients' motivation to perform the task showed a strong correlation to the attained detection rate of their walking intention.

Classification of unconscious like/dislike decisions: First results towards a novel application for BCI technology	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			AGENDA	More and more applications for BCI technology emerge that are not restricted to communication or control, like gaming, rehabilitation, Neuro-IS research, neuro-economics or security. In this context a so called passive BCI, a system that derives its outputs from arbitrary brain activity for enriching a human-machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user state will be used. Concretely EEG-based BCI technology enables the use of signals related to attention, intentions and mental state, without relying on indirect measures based on overt behavior or other physiological signals which is an important point e.g. in Neuromarketing research. The scope of this pilot EEG-study was to detect like/dislike decisions on car stimuli just by means of ERP analysis. Concretely to define user preferences concerning different car designs by implementing an offline BCI based on shrinkage LDA classification. Although classification failed in the majority of participants the elicited early (sub) conscious ERP components reflect user preferences for cars. In a broader sense this study should pave the way towards a "product design BCI" suitable for neuromarketing research.	[Wriessnegger, S. C.; Hackhofer, D.; Mueller-Putz, G.

The objective of this study is to determine time and location where the evoked potentials obtained in a familiar/unfamiliar face recognition experiments, are most distant. EEG signals have been acquired from 10 subjects in different sessions and the time and position where ERP signals obtained in response to familiar and unfamiliar face stimuli have been analyzed using statistical methods. This study can be considered as a first step for an EEG signal classification problem of an familiar and unfamiliar face recognition experiment. Such a classification both can help to the experts in the diagnosis of some diseases in the visual memory areas of the brain and can contribute to the identification of suspects in criminal inspections.

Electrophysiological evidence for strategically orienting retrieval toward the specific age of a memory	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Episodic memory; Remote memory; Retrieval orientation; EEG; ERPs	DIVIDED ATTENTION; DEPTH; DISSOCIATION; NEUROSCIENCE; RECOGNITION; ORIENTATION; MODULATION; STRENGTH; INDEXES; TIME	For over a century, memory researchers have extensively studied the differences between retrieving memories that were encoded in the remote past as opposed to recently. Although this work has largely focused on the changes that these memory traces undergo over time, an unexplored issue is whether retrieval attempts and other strategic processes might be differentially oriented in order to effectively access memories of different ages. The current study addressed this issue by instructing participants to retrieve words that were encoded either one week (remote) or about 30 minutes earlier (recent). To maximize the possibility that participants adopted distinct retrieval orientations, separate blocks of the memory test employed exclusion task procedures in which the words from only one encoding period were targeted at a given time, in the face of distractors from the other period. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by correctly-rejected new items were contrasted to minimize confounding effects of retrieval success. The new-item ERPs revealed differences according to the targeted week, such that the ERPs over posterior scalp were more positive-going for the recent compared to remote blocks. Furthermore, using multiple methods, these ERP effects were dissociated from differences in difficulty across the two conditions. The findings provide novel evidence that knowledge about when a memory was initially encoded leads to differences in the adoption of retrieval processing strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Hypervigilance to rejecting stimuli in rejection sensitive individuals: Behavioral and neurocognitive evidence	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						Rejection sensitivity; ERP; Face processing	MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; THREAT; BIAS	Individuals who are high in rejection sensitivity are vigilant toward social cues that signal rejection, and they exhibit attention biases towards information that confirms expectations of rejection. Little is known, however, about the neural correlates of rejection sensitivity. The present study examined whether rejection sensitivity is associated with individuals' neural responses to rejection-relevant information. Female participants, classified as high or average in rejection sensitivity, completed a modified dot-probe task in which a neutral face was paired with either another neutral face or a gaze-averted ("rejecting") face while EEG was collected and ERP components were computed. Behavioral results indicated that average rejection sensitive participants showed an attention bias away from rejecting faces, while high rejection sensitive participants were equally vigilant to neutral and rejecting faces. High rejection sensitivity was associated with ERP components signaling elevated attention and arousal to faces. These findings suggest that rejection sensitivity shapes behavioral and neurocognitive responses to faces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several studies have reported strictly additive effects of these 2 variables. Predictability also reliably influences the amplitude of the N400 component in event-related potential studies, However, previous research suggests that while :frequency affects the N400 in single-word tasks, it may have little or no effect on the N400 when a word is presented with a preceding sentence context. The present study assessed this apparent dissociation between the results from the 2 methods using a coregistration paradigm in which the frequency and predictability of a target word were manipulated while readers' eye movements and electroencephalograms were simultaneously recorded. We replicated the pattern of significant, and additive; effects of the 2 manipulations on eye fixation durations. We also replicated the predictability effect on the N400, time-locked to the onset of the reader's :first fixation on the target word. However there was no indication of a frequency effect in the electroencephalogram record. We suggest that this pattern has implications both for the interpretation of the N400 and for the interpretation of frequency and predictability effects in language comprehension.

Despite substantial progress, few (if any) laboratory tests have graduated to clinics to inform diagnoses, guide treatments, and monitor treatment response. Providers must rely on careful behavioral observation and interview techniques to make inferences about patients' inner experiences and then secondary deductions about impacted neural systems. Development of more effective treatments has also been hindered by a lack of translational quantitative biomarkers that can span the brain-behavior treatment knowledge gap. Here, we describe an example of a simple, low-cost, and translatable electroencephalography (EEG) measure that offers promise for improving our understanding and treatment of psychotic illnesses: mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN is sensitive to and/or predicts response to some pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions and accounts for substantial portions of variance in clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia (SZ). This measure has recently been validated for use in large-scale multisite clinical studies of SZ. Finally, MMN greatly improves our ability to forecast which individuals at high clinical risk actually develop a psychotic illness. These attributes suggest that MMN can contribute to personalized biomarker-guided treatment strategies aimed at ameliorating or even preventing the onset of psychosis.

Insights from ERPs in classifier processing in Japanese	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Classifier; Count/mass distinction; ERP; Japanese	UNIVERSAL ONTOLOGY; COMPREHENSION; RESPONSES; NOUNS	It has long been assumed that classifier languages lack syntactic distinctions of objects and substances (i.e., count/mass distinction; Allan, 1977; Chierchia, 1998; Krifka, 1995; Lucy, 1992; Quine, 1969). Several linguists, however, claimed that classifier languages also make the syntactic count/mass distinction through the selective use of count classifiers (i.e., sortal classifiers) and mass classifiers (e.g., Cheng & Sybesma, 1998, 1999). The present study examined whether Japanese speakers make a syntactic count/mass distinction using the classifier system. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while Japanese speakers read word pairs (Experiment 1) or sentences (Experiment 2) in which noun-classifier agreement relations were manipulated. We examined event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the within-count/mass-category violation (e.g., an object name accompanied by a classifier for other objects) and the across-count/mass-category violation (e.g., an object name accompanied by a classifier for substances). In both experiments, the violation of the noun-classifier agreements elicited the N400, regardless of whether the noun-classifier disagreement was made within or across the ontological object/substance boundary. The across-count/mass-category violation did not recruit a syntactic process in the brain, suggesting that the Japanese classifier system does not highlight the distinction between objects and substances. The results also indicated that the processing of Japanese numeral classifiers is primarily semantic-based. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

According to direct access theories, the first steps of visual information processing offer us an informed direct grasp of the situation, especially when social and interpersonal components are implicated. Biological system detection may be the gateway of such smart processes and then may influence initial stages of perception fostering adaptive social behaviour. To investigate early neural correlates of human agency detection in ecological situations with more high or low social impact, we compared scenes showing a human versus artificial agent interacting with a human agent. Twenty volunteers participated in the study. They were asked to observe dynamic visual stimuli showing realistic interactions. ERP (event-related potentials) were recorded. Each stimulus depicted an arm executing a gesture addressed to a human agent. Visual features of the arm were manipulated: in half of trials, it was real; in other trials, it was deprived of some details and transformed in a statue-like arm. EEG morphological analysis revealed an early negative deflection peaking at about 155 ms. Peak amplitude data have been statistically analysed by repeated- measures ANOVAs. It was found that the peak was ampler in the left inferior posterior region when the gesturing arm was human. The early negative deflection, N150, which we found to be different between the human and artificial conditions, is presumably associated with human agency detection in high interpersonal context.

It remains unclear, however, to what extent this is also the case for classroom-based foreign language learning, particularly in children. To this end, we presented a mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment during EEG recordings as part of a longitudinal developmental study: 38 monolingual (Swiss-) German speaking children (7.5 years) were tested shortly before they started to learn English at school and followed up one year later. Moreover, 22 (Swiss-) German adults were recorded. Instead of the originally found positive mismatch response in children, an MMN emerged when applying a high-pass filter of 3 Hz. The overlap of a slow-wave positivity with the MMN indicates that two concurrent mismatch processes were elicited in children. The children's MMN in response to the non-native speech contrast was smaller compared to the native speech contrast irrespective of foreign language learning, suggesting that no additional neural resources were committed to processing the foreign language speech sound after one year of classroom-based learning.

J	Angulo-Sherman, IN; Gutierrez, D				Nayeli Angulo-Sherman, Irma; Gutierrez, David			A Link between the Increase in Electroencephalographic Coherence and Performance Improvement in Operating a Brain-Computer Interface	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EEG; FEEDBACK; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; PARIETAL	We study the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence and accuracy in operating a brain-computer interface (BCI). In our case, the BCI is controlled through motor imagery. Hence, a number of volunteers were trained using different training paradigms: classical visual feedback, auditory stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation (FES). After each training session, the volunteers' accuracy in operating the BCI was assessed, and the event-related coherence (ErCoh) was calculated for all possible combinations of pairs of EEG sensors. After at least four training sessions, we searched for significant differences in accuracy and ErCoh using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. Our results show that there exists a high correlation between an increase in ErCoh and performance improvement, and this effect is mainly localized in the centrofrontal and centroparietal brain regions for the case of our motor imagery task. This result has a direct implication with the development of new techniques to evaluate BCI performance and the process of selecting a feedback modality that better enhances the volunteer's capacity to operate a BCI system.

Previous electrophysiological studies have confirmed impaired reward processing in patients with BPD. However, it is not clear which aspects of reward processing are affected and which brain regions are involved. The present study investigated both evoked and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) to feedback events (thought to represent different aspects of feedback processing), and used source localization (sLORETA) to assess activity in two areas known to contribute to reward processing, the dorsomedial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/ACC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Methods. Eighteen patients with BPD and 22 healthy controls performed a gambling task, while 64-channel electroencephalographic activity was recorded. Evoked and induced theta and high-beta band EROs as well as activity in the two regions of interest were investigated depending on the valence and magnitude of feedback events. Results. Theta-band responses to negative feedback were reduced in BPD, an effect that involved only evoked responses and the dmPFC/ ACC region, and was associated with trait impulsivity in patients. sLORETA analyses revealed disturbed evoked responses depending on feedback magnitude in the theta (OFC) and high-beta (dmPFC/ACC and OFC) frequency range. Conclusions. The results indicate multiple dysfunctions of feedback processing in patients with BPD, implicating several distinct subsets of reward-processing mechanisms.

Despite the constant improvements in this field, there still exist diverse factors to overcome before achieving a natural control. In particular, the high variability of the brain signals often leads to the incorrect decoding of the subject intentions, producing unreliable behaviors in the controlled device. A possible solution to this problem would be that of correcting this erroneous decoding using a feedback signal from the user. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of decoding neural signals associated to performance monitoring (EEG-recorded error-related potentials) during a reaching task. Compared to previous works where these error potentials were recorded under scenarios with discrete movements performed by the cursor, under real conditions the cursor is moving continuously and thus the system is required to asynchronously detect any possible error. To this end, we simulated two different erroneous events during the monitoring of a reaching task: errors at the beginning of the movement, and errors happening in the middle of the trajectory being executed. Through the analysis of the recorded EEG of three subjects, we demonstrate the existence of neural correlates for the two types of elicited error potentials, and we are able to asynchronously detect them with high accuracies.

The present study investigates processing of emotionally salient regions during free viewing of emotional scenes that were categorized according to the two-dimensional model comprising of valence (unpleasant, pleasant) and arousal (high, low). Recent studies have reported interactions between these dimensions, indicative of stimulus-evoked approach or withdrawal tendencies. We addressed the valence and arousal effects when emotional items were embedded in complex real-world scenes by analyzing both eye movement behavior and eye-fixation-related potentials (EFRPs) time-locked to the critical event of fixating the emotionally salient items for the first time. Both data sets showed an interaction between the valence and arousal dimensions. First, the fixation rates and gaze durations on emotionally salient regions were enhanced for unpleasant versus pleasant images in the high arousal condition. In the low arousal condition, both measures were enhanced for pleasant versus unpleasant images. Second, the EFRP results at 140-170ms [P2] over the central site showed stronger responses for high versus low arousing images in the unpleasant condition. In addition, the parietal LPP responses at 400-500 ms post-fixation were enhanced for stimuli reflecting congruent stimulus dimensions, that is, stronger responses for high versus low arousing images in the unpleasant condition and stronger responses for low versus high arousing images in the pleasant condition. The present findings support the interactive two-dimensional approach, according to which the integration of valence and arousal recruits brain regions associated with action tendencies of approach or withdrawal.

We hypothesized speech preparation would modulate auditory processing, via motor efference copy, differently in men who stutter (MWS) vs. fluent adults. Participants (n = 12/group) had EEG recorded during a cue-target paradigm with two conditions: speech which allowed for speech preparation, while a control condition did not. Acoustic stimuli probed auditory responsiveness between the cue and target. MWS had longer vocal reaction times (p < 0.01) when the cue-target differed (10% of trials), suggesting a difficulty of rapidly updating their speech plans. Acoustic probes elicited a negative slow wave indexing motor efference copy that was smaller in MWS vs. fluent adults (p < 0.03). Current density responses in MWS showed smaller left prefrontal responses and auditory responses that were delayed and correlated to stuttering rate. Taken together, the results provide insight into the cortical mechanisms underlying atypical speech planning and dysfluencies in MWS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Method: We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in 40 subjects, arranged a posteriori in 2 groups on the basis of their ICV values. By this method, we formed the consistent (low ICV; n = 20) and inconsistent (high ICV; n = 20) group: the age, speed, and accuracy performance of the 2 groups were matched. Results: The prestimulus anticipatory PFC activity, as reflected by the prefrontal negativity (pN) wave, and the poststimulus P3 component were larger in the consistent than in the inconsistent group. In contrast, no differences were observed between groups in the brain activities associated to motor preparation and early sensory processing. Conclusions: Data are interpreted as an enhanced top-down control in consistent performers, likely characterized by a greater sustained attention on the task.

Inconsistencies between recent nonhuman animal recordings and computational modeling suggest dynamic influences on stimulus-specific adaptation. The present human electroencephalography (EEG) study investigates the potential role of statistical context in dynamically modulating stimulus-specific adaptation by examining the auditory cortex-generated N1 and P2 components. As in previous studies of stimulus-specific adaptation, listeners were presented with oddball sequences in which the presentation of a repeated tone was infrequently interrupted by rare spectral changes taking on three different magnitudes. Critically, the statistical context varied with respect to the probability of small versus large spectral changes within oddball sequences (half of the time a small change was most probable; in the other half a large change was most probable). We observed larger N1 and P2 amplitudes (i.e., release from adaptation) for all spectral changes in the small-change compared with the large-change statistical context. The increase in response magnitude also held for responses to tones presented with high probability, indicating that statistical adaptation can overrule stimulus probability per se in its influence on neural responses. Computational modeling showed that the degree of coadaptation in auditory cortex changed depending on the statistical context, which in turn affected stimulus-specific adaptation. Thus the present data demonstrate that stimulus-specific adaptation in human auditory cortex critically depends on statistical context. Finally, the present results challenge the implicit assumption of stationarity of neural response magnitudes that governs the practice of isolating established deviant-detection responses such as the mismatch negativity.

EEG signals are collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content. This problem is important because such classifiers constitute "virtual sensors" of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications. The feature selection has a major role. Recently we have proposed a sequential feature selection (SFS) procedure that reduced the inherent data variability among subjects and led to a high inter-subject emotion recognition accuracy (98 %). However the SFS is a computationally intensive approach that is difficult to apply to any classification model. In this paper we extend that line of research and propose a computationally less involved feature selection technique based on descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the neural signatures across subjects. This approach reveals to be a good compromise between prediction accuracy and numerical complexity.

Previous evidence indicates that higher levels of SMR activity reduce sensorimotor interference and thereby promote cognitive processing. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, one experimental (N = 10) group receiving SMR neurofeedback training, in which they learned to voluntarily increase SMR, and one control group (N = 10) receiving sham feedback. Multiple cognitive functions and electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processing were assessed before and after 10 neurofeedback training sessions. Results: The experimental group but not the control group showed linear increases in SMR power over training runs, which was associated with behavioural improvements in memory and attentional performance. Additionally, increasing SMR led to a more salient stimulus processing as indicated by increased N1 and P3 event-related potential amplitudes after the training as compared to the pre-test. Finally, functional brain connectivity between motor areas and visual processing areas was reduced after SMR training indicating reduced sensorimotor interference. Conclusions: These results indicate that SMR neurofeedback improves stimulus processing capabilities and consequently leads to improvements in cognitive performance. Significance: The present findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying SMR neurofeedback training and cognitive processing and implicate that SMR neurofeedback might be an effective cognitive training tool.

Laser-Evoked Vertex Potentials Predict Defensive Motor Actions	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						agency; defense; event-related potentials; saliency; sensorimotor integration; threat detection	NOXIOUS THERMAL STIMULI; INPUT-OUTPUT RELATIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG RESPONSES; REACTION-TIME; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PAIN; MONKEYS; LESIONS	The vertex potential is the largest response that can be recorded in the electroencephalogram of an awake, healthy human. It is elicited by sudden and intense stimuli, and is composed by a negative-positive deflection. The stimulus properties that determine the vertex potential amplitude have been well characterized. Nonetheless, its functional significance remains elusive. The dominant interpretation is that it reflects neural activities related to the detection of salient stimuli. However, given that threatening stimuli elicit both vertex potentials and defensive movements, we hypothesized that the vertex potential is related to the execution of defensive actions. Here, we directly compared the salience and motoric interpretations by investigating the relationship between the amplitude of laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) and the response time of movements with different defensive values. First, we show that a larger LEP negative wave (N2 wave) predicts faster motor response times. Second, this prediction is significantly stronger when the motor response is defensive in nature. Third, the relation between the N2 wave and motor response time depends not only on the kinematic form of the movement, but also on whether that kinematic form serves as a functional defense of the body. Therefore, the N2 wave of the LEP encodes key defensive reactions to threats.	[Moayedi, M.; Liang, M.; Sim, A. L.; Hu, L.; Iannetti, G.

However, despite the abundance of EEG studies characterizing schizophrenia patients in general, only a handful of studies have focused on the electrophysiological correlates of negative symptoms. The current study examined whether the impairments in event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) commonly reported in heterogeneous groups of patients with mixed positive and negative symptoms also occur in patients with predominantly negative symptoms, and investigated their correlation to clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits. Twenty schizophrenia patients suffering from predominant negative symptoms and 25 healthy subjects underwent neuropsychological and electromagnetic assessments. ERB were recorded during a three-stimuli novelty oddball and a sensory gating paradigm, and M50. P300m and Novelty-P3m components were investigated. Patients displayed impaired M50 ratios, reduced left P300m and frontal Novelty-P3m amplitudes. These electromagnetic measures correlated significantly with the severity of negative symptoms (SANS scale). The electrophysiological abnormalities which have been proposed as candidate biomarkers for schizophrenia are also manifested in patients with predominantly negative symptoms.

A temporo-spatial analysis of the neural correlates of extrinsic perceptual grouping in vision	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Perceptual grouping; Extrinsic grouping; Common region; ERP; LORETA	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; TIME-COURSE; GESTALT PRINCIPLES; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SINGLE-TRIAL; SIMILARITY	Principles of perceptual grouping can be divided into intrinsic grouping cues, which are based on built-in properties of the grouped elements (e.g., their shape, position, colour, etc.) like most of the classical Gestalt laws, and extrinsic grouping principles, based on relations between the discrete elements and other external stimuli that induce them to group (e.g., common region, connectedness). Several studies have explored the neural correlates of intrinsic grouping factors but, to our knowledge, no previous study has studied the neural correlates of extrinsic principles. The present study aimed to shed light on this issue by exploiting the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) and recent advances in source localization. Specifically, grouping by common region was compared with two comparison conditions, an intrinsic grouping (luminance similarity) and a uniform stimulus condition, in a perceptual discrimination task. We reported three main neural effects associated with grouping by common region. First, a posterior N210 component with a neural origin in the left extrastriate cortex was related to perceptual analysis of extrinsic elements inducing grouping and the formation of a visual group. Second, an enhanced posterior P280, which presumably reflects higher confidence decisions during response selection. Finally, a P550 originated in the right superior parietal cortex that seems to be associated with top-down suppression activity connected with the termination of the processing of the current trial. Overall, our results suggest that common region cues belong to the category of long latency grouping principles that mainly involve activity in extrastriate cortices. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we aimed to classify single-trial 12 categories of recorded EEG signals. Ten subjects participated in this study. The task was to select target images among 12 basic object categories including animals, flowers, fruits, transportation devices, body organs, clothing, food, stationery, buildings, electronic devices, dolls and jewelry. In order to decode object categories, we have considered several units namely artifact removing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Data were divided into training, validation, and test sets following the artifact removal process. Features were extracted using three different wavelets namely Daubechies4, Haar, and Symlet2. Features were selected among training data and were reduced afterward via scalar feature selection using three criteria including T test, entropy, and Bhattacharyya distance. Selected features were classified by the one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. The parameters of SVM were optimized based on training and validation sets. The classification performance (measured by means of accuracy) was obtained approximately 80 % for animal and stationery categories. Moreover, Symlet2 and T test were selected as better wavelet and selection criteria, respectively.

However, their influence on perceptual processes is less well explored, especially during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Using electroencephalography, we examined whether learning to actively or passively avoid harm can modulate early visual responses in adolescents and adults. The task included two avoidance conditions, active and passive, where two different warning stimuli predicted the imminent, but avoidable, presentation of an aversive tone. To avoid the aversive outcome, participants had to learn to emit an action (active avoidance) for one of the warning stimuli and omit an action for the other (passive avoidance). Both adults and adolescents performed the task with a high degree of accuracy. For both adolescents and adults, increased N170 event-related potential amplitudes were found for both the active and the passive warning stimuli compared with control conditions. Moreover, the potentiation of the N170 to the warning stimuli was stable and long lasting. Developmental differences were also observed; adolescents showed greater potentiation of the N170 component to danger signals. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that learned danger signals in an instrumental avoidance task can influence early visual sensory processes in both adults and adolescents.

This study examined large-scale oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) during language-driven mental imagery using dense-array EEG. Three experiments demonstrated relative increases in alpha amplitude: (1) during imagery prompted by words compared to fixation without imagery instruction, (2) during imagery of word content compared to imagery of geometric shapes, and (3) during imagery of emotionally evocative words compared to imagery of less emotionally arousing content. Alpha increases for semantically loaded imagery were observed in parieto-occipital regions, sustained throughout the imagery period. Findings imply that alpha oscillations index active memory and internal cognitive processing, reflecting neural communication in cortical networks representing motor, semantic, and perceptual aspects of the imagined scene.

POTENTIATED PROCESSING OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IN DEPRESSION IS ATTENUATED BY ANHEDONIA	DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Article						feedback-related negativity (FRN); action monitoring; theta; error-related negativity; depression; LORETA	ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; DISORDER; DOPAMINE; REWARD; PERFORMANCE; ANXIETY; CHILDHOOD	BackgroundAlthough cognitive theories of depression have postulated enhanced processing of negatively valenced information, previous EEG studies have shown both increased and reduced sensitivity for negative performance feedback in MDD. To reconcile these paradoxical findings, it has been speculated that sensitivity for negative feedback is potentiated in moderate MDD, but reduced in highly anhedonic subjects. The goal of this study was to test this hypothesis by analyzing the feedback-related negativity (FRN), frontomedial theta power (FMT), and source-localized anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) activity after negative feedback. MethodsFourteen unmedicated participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 15 control participants performed a reinforcement learning task while 128-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. FRN, FMT, and LORETA source-localized aMCC activity after negative and positive feedback were compared between groups. ResultsThe MDD group showed higher FRN amplitudes and aMCC activation to negative feedback than controls. Moreover, aMCC activation to negative feedback was inversely related to self-reported anhedonia. In contrast, self-reported anxiety correlated with feedback-evoked frontomedial theta (FMT) within the depression group. ConclusionsThe present findings suggest that, among depressed and anxious individuals, enhanced processing of negative feedback occurs relatively early in the information processing stream. These results extend prior work and indicate that although moderate depression is associated with elevated sensitivity for negative feedback, high levels of anhedonia may attenuate this effect.

Orienting attention during the maintenance period of STM by a retrospective cue (retro-cue) strengthens the representation of the cued item and improves the subsequent STM performance. In a recent article, Backer et al. (Backer KC, Binns MA, Alain C. J Neurosci 35: 1307-1318, 2015) extended these findings from the visual to the auditory domain and combined electroencephalography to dissociate neural mechanisms underlying feature-based and object-based attention orientation. Both event-related potentials and neural oscillations explained the behavioral benefits of retro-cues and favored the theory that feature-based and object-based attention orientation were independent.

J	Katus, T; Eimer, M				Katus, Tobias; Eimer, Martin			Lateralized Delay Period Activity Marks the Focus of Spatial Attention in Working Memory: Evidence from Somatosensory Event-Related Brain Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; selective attention; somatosensation; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; INFORMATION; STORAGE; MIND	The short-term retention of sensory information in working memory (WM) is known to be associated with a sustained enhancement of neural activity. What remains controversial is whether this neural trace indicates the sustained storage of information or the allocation of attention. To evaluate the storage and attention accounts, we examined sustained tactile contralateral delay activity (tCDA component) of the event-related potential. The tCDA manifests over somatosensory cortex contralateral to task-relevant tactile information during stimulus retention. Two tactile sample sets (S1, S2) were presented sequentially, separated by 1.5 s. Each set comprised two stimuli, one per hand. Human participants memorized the location of one task-relevant stimulus per sample set and judged whether one of these locations was stimulated again at memory test. The two relevant pulses were unpredictably located on the same hand (stay trials) or on different hands (shift trials). Initially, tCDA components emerged contralateral to the relevant S1 pulse. Sequential loading of WM enhanced the tCDA after S2 was presented on stay trials. On shift trials, the tCDA's polarity reversed after S2 presentation, resulting in delay activity that was now contralateral to the task-relevant S2 pulse. The disappearance of a lateralized neural trace for the relevant S1 pulse did not impair memory accuracy for this stimulus on shift trials. These results contradict the storage account and suggest that delay period activity indicates the sustained engagement of an attention-based rehearsal mechanism. In conclusion, somatosensory delay period activity marks the current focus of attention in tactile WM.

Event-related potentials to tones show differences between children with multiple risk factors for dyslexia and control children before the onset of formal reading instruction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing; Children; Dyslexia; EEG; Event-related potentials; Mismatch negativity; N250; Preschool	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-SYSTEM ACTIVITY; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; LITERACY SKILLS; FAMILIAL RISK; MATURATION; SOUND; FREQUENCY; DISCRIMINATION	Multiple risk factors can affect the development of specific reading problems or dyslexia. In addition to the most prevalent and studied risk factor, phonological processing, auditory discrimination problems have also been found in children and adults with reading difficulties. The present study examined 37 children between the ages of 5 and 6, 11 of which had multiple risk factors for developing reading problems. The children participated in a passive oddball EEG experiment with sinusoidal sounds with changes in sound frequency, duration, or intensity. The responses to the standard stimuli showed a negative voltage shift in children at risk for reading problems compared to control children at 107-215 ms in frontocentral areas corresponding to P1 offset and N250 onset. Source analyses showed that the difference originated from the left and right auditory cortices. Additionally, the children at risk for reading problems had a larger late discriminative negativity (LDN) response in amplitude for sound frequency change than the control children. The amplitudes at the P1-N250 time window showed correlations to letter knowledge and phonological identification whereas the amplitudes at the LDN time window correlated with verbal short-term memory and rapid naming. These results support the view that problems in basic auditory processing abilities precede the onset of reading instruction and can act as one of the risk factors for dyslexia.

The Fraser spiral Illusion consists of twisted cords superimposed on a patchwork background arranged in concentric circles, which is typically perceived as a spiral. We tested four displays: the Fraser spiral illusion and three variants derived from it by orthogonally combining featural properties. In our stimuli, the shape of the cords comprised either concentric circles or a single spiral. The cords themselves consisted of black and white lines in parallel to the contour of the cords (i.e., parallel cords), or oblique line elements (i.e., twisted cords). The displays with twisted cords successfully induced illusory percepts, i.e., circles looked like spirals (the Fraser spiral illusion) and spirals looked like circles (i.e., a "reverse Fraser illusion"). We compared the event-related potentials in a Stimulus (Circle, Spiral) x Percept (Circle, Spiral) design. A significant main effect of Stimulus was found at the posterior scalp in an early component (P220-280) and a significant main effect of Percept was found over the anterior scalp in a later component (P350-450). Although the EEG data suggest stimulus-based processing in the posterior area in an early time window and percept-based processing in the later time window, an overall clear-cut stimulus-percept segregation was not found due to additional interaction effects. Instead, the data, especially in the later time window in the anterior area, point at differential processing for the condition comprising circle shapes but spiral percepts (i.e., the Fraser illusion).

Interests shape how adolescents pay attention: the interaction of motivation and top-down attentional processes in biasing sensory activations to anticipated events	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adolescence; alpha; event-related potential; late directing attentional positivity; motivation; spatial attention	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; BILATERAL STIMULUS ARRAYS; INDEX FOCUSED ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; CIRCUMSCRIBED INTERESTS; DIVIDED ATTENTION; AUTISM; SUPPRESSION; POTENTIALS; MODULATION	The voluntary allocation of attention to environmental inputs is a crucial mechanism of healthy cognitive functioning, and is probably influenced by an observer's level of interest in a stimulus. For example, an individual who is passionate about soccer but bored by botany will obviously be more attentive at a soccer match than an orchid show. The influence of monetary rewards on attention has been examined, but the impact of more common motivating factors (i.e. the level of interest in the materials under observation) remains unclear, especially during development. Here, stimulus sets were designed based on survey measures of the level of interest of adolescent participants in several item classes. High-density electroencephalography was recorded during a cued spatial attention task in which stimuli of high or low interest were presented in separate blocks. The motivational impact on performance of a spatial attention task was assessed, along with event-related potential measures of anticipatory top-down attention. As predicted, performance was improved for the spatial target detection of high interest items. Further, the impact of motivation was observed in parieto-occipital processes associated with anticipatory top-down spatial attention. The anticipatory activity over these regions was also increased for high vs. low interest stimuli, irrespective of the direction of spatial attention. The results also showed stronger anticipatory attentional and motivational modulations over the right vs. left parieto-occipital cortex. These data suggest that motivation enhances top-down attentional processes, and can independently shape activations in sensory regions in anticipation of events. They also suggest that attentional functions across hemispheres may not fully mature until late adolescence.

Ten participants wore two cEEGrid systems for at least seven hours. Using a smartphone for stimulus delivery and signal acquisition, resting EEG and auditory oddball data were collected in the morning and in the afternoon six to seven hours apart. Analysis of resting EEG data confirmed well-known spectral differences between eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The ERP results confirmed the predicted condition effects with significantly larger P300 amplitudes for target compared to standard tones, and a high test-retest reliability of the P300 amplitude (r>=.74). Moreover, a linear classifier trained on data from the morning session revealed similar performance in classification accuracy for the morning and the afternoon sessions (both > 70%). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of concealed and comfortable brain activity acquisition over many hours.

Differences in ERP component P400 over posterior temporal areas were found during 6-month-olds' observation of helping and hindering agents (Experiment 1), but not during observation of identically moving agents that did not help or hinder (Experiment 2). The results demonstrate that the P400 component indexes activation of infants' memories of previously perceived interactions between social agents. This leads to suggest that similar processes might be involved in infants' processing of pro-and antisocial agents and other social perception processes (encoding gaze direction, goal directed grasping and pointing).

We aimed to develop a system for complex assessment of cognitive load in older employees with parallel registration of behavioural, neuronal and cardiovascular activity. We present the test battery that can provide reliable data on age-related cognitive deficits. Using this test battery, EEG and cardiovascular indexes were found which are stable over time, sensitive to ageing and cognitive load. The test battery and physiological indexes are suitable for the development of a computational model describing heart-brain interactions during work performance. The model may be further implemented into mobile devices using for the online assessment of cognitive load.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of neurofeedback in the reduction of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a patient following high-voltage electric shock with the use of ERPs	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						electric burns; dyssomnia; Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; executive functions	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS	Background. The aim of our research was an evaluation of the effectiveness of neurofeedback in reducing the symptoms of Post-trauma stress disorder (PTSD), which had developed as a result of a high-voltage electric burn to the head. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event related potentials (ERPs) were utilised in the evaluation. Case study. A 21-year-old patient, experienced 4th degree burns to his head as a result of a high-voltage electric burn. The patient was repeatedly operated on and despite the severity of the injuries was to recover. However the patient complained of flashbacks, difficulties with sleeping as well as an inability to continue work in his given profession. Specialist tests were to show the presence within him of PTSD. As a result of which the patient was provided with neurofeedback therapy. The effectiveness of this therapy in the reduction (eradication) of the symptoms of PTSD were evaluated through the utilisation of qantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event related potentials (ERPs). Results. It was found that in the first examination that ERPs display the most significant deviations from the reference in the two components: (1) the one component is generated within the cingulate cortex. The pattern of its deviation from the norms is similar to that found in a group of OCD patients. In contrast to healthy subjects the component repeats itself twice; (2) the second component is generated in the medial prefrontal cortex. Its pattern (neuromarker) is similar to that found in PTSD patients. There is a delay in the late part of the component, which probably reflects the flashbacks. In the second examination, after neurofeedback training, the ERPs were similar to the norm. The patient returned to work. Conclusions. Chronic PTSD developed within the patient as a result of a high-voltage electric burn. The application of a method of therapy (neurofeedback) resulted in the withdrawal of the syndrome symptoms. ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used to plan neurofeedback and in the assessment of functional brain changes induced by neurotherapeutic programmes.

This research intends to study results of two EEG source analysis methods applied to scalp recordings taken in paralysis and in normal conditions during the performance of a cognitive task. The aim is to determinate which types of analysis are appropriate for dealing with EEG data containing myogenic components. The data used are the scalp recordings of six subjects in normal conditions and during paralysis while performing different cognitive tasks including the oddball task which is the object of this research. The data were pre-processed by filtering it and correcting artefact, then, epochs of one second long for targets and distractors were extracted. Distributed source analysis was performed in BESA Research 6.0, using its results and information from the literature, 9 ideal locations for source dipoles were identified. The nine dipoles were used to perform discrete source analysis, fitting them to the averaged epochs for obtaining source waveforms. The results were statistically analysed comparing the outcomes before and after the subjects were paralysed. Finally, frequency analysis was performed for better explain the results. The findings were that distributed source analysis could produce confounded results for EEG contaminated with myogenic signals, conversely, statistical analysis of the results from discrete source analysis showed that this method could help for dealing with EEG data contaminated with muscle electrical signal	[Carabali, Carmen A.] Amer Univ, Fac Engn, EC-170125 Quito, Ecuador; [Carabali, Carmen A.] Escuela Politec Nacl, Fac Elect Engn, EC-170125 Quito, Ecuador; [Grummett, Tyler; Lewis, Trent; Pope, Kenneth J.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Informat & Engn, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Willoughby, John O.; DeLosAngeles, Dylan] Flinders Univ S Australia, Brain Signals Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Willoughby, John O.; DeLosAngeles, Dylan] Med Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Fitzgibbon, Sean P.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford Ctr Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain F, Dept Clin Neurol, Oxford OX3 9DU, England		Carabali, CA (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Fac Engn, EC-170125 Quito, Ecuador.

Previous research has shown that IA in the elderly is more influenced by increased attentional demands than young adults (YAs), but the effect of attentional mode on IA in middle-aged adults (MAs) has not been established. Auditory event-related potentials (AERPs), such as the N400, allow the evaluation of subtle differences in linguistic and cognitive processing between YAs and MAs that are imperceptible by behavioral means. Purpose: To determine the effect of dichotic attentional mode on IA in the N400 in YA and MA listeners. Research Design: Participants listened to groups of words that consisted of a reference word followed by dichotic probe words. Participants judged whether probe words were semantically related or unrelated to the reference word. This semantic judgment task was elicited in both divided-attention (DIV) and directed-attention (DIR) modes. Study Sample: Twenty-three YA (19-25 yr) and twenty-three MA (47-59 yr) females participated in the study. Data Collection and Analysis: Individual, as well as grand-averaged, AERP waveforms, scalp topographies, and event-related potential-image plots were analyzed. A mixed design analysis of variance was used to compare the N400 amplitude and latency response between ears in both attentional modes. Independent component analysis was used to isolate temporally overlapping neural sources that contributed to the negativity in the latency range of the N400 component. Results: N400 amplitude was significantly more negative in the DIV mode than DIR in both age groups. IA differences between age groups were evident only in DIV, as indicated by an age-related shift in the direction of IA in the N400 from greater asymmetry on the right in YAs to greater asymmetry on the left in MAs. ICA revealed that the age-related difference in IA in the AERP waveform reflected differences between YAs and MAs primarily in an electroencephalographic source process consistent with attentional processing. Conclusions: IA differences between YAs and MAs were revealed in the N400 only in DIV, which was the result of an increased information-processing load. ICA successfully separated temporally overlapping EEG sources that contributed to the N400 component, allowing a refined interpretation of differences in the AERP waveform among groups.

Fast electro-encephalographic (EEG) oscillations, which typically originate from frontal regions, have been reported to be markedly reduced in schizophrenia. Methods: Here we employed TMS/EEG to assess the natural frequency of the premotor area in a sample of 48 age-matched participants (12 each in major depression disorder (MDD)), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and healthy controls. Event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were obtained for each study participant using wavelet decomposition. Results: TMS resulted in a significant activation of the beta/gamma band response (21-50 Hz) to frontal cortical perturbation in healthy control subjects. By contrast, the main frequencies of frontal EEG responses to TMS were significantly reduced in patients with BPD, MDD and SCZ (11-27 Hz) relative to healthy subjects. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia showed a significantly lower natural frequency of frontal cortico-thalamocortical circuits compared to healthy controls. These results suggest a common neurobiological mechanism of corticothalamic impairment. The most likely candidates include dysfunction of GABAergic circuits. Limitations: Further studies are needed to consider other biological markers, gene variants and their interaction with clinical variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We performed electroencephalography in 15 healthy adults who observed either human- or robot-hand pictures in painful or non-painful situations such as a finger cut by a knife. We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal. These results suggest that we empathize with humanoid robots in late top-down processing similarly to human others. However, the beginning of the top-down process of empathy is weaker for robots than for humans.

However, comparable less research reported the mismatch negativity elicited by somatosensory stimuli. More importantly, little is known on the functional features of mismatch deviant and standard responses across different sensory modalities. To directly compare different sensory modalities, we adopted a crossmodal roving paradigm and collected event-related potentials elicited by auditory, non-nociceptive somatosensory, and nociceptive trains of stimuli, during Active and Passive attentional conditions. We applied a topographical segmentation analysis to cluster successive scalp topographies with quasi-stable landscape of significant differences to extract crossmodal mismatch responses. We obtained three main findings. First, across different sensory modalities and attentional conditions, the formation of a standard sensory trace became robust mainly after the second stimulus repetition. Second, the neural representation of a modality deviant stimulus was influenced by the preceding sensory modality. Third, the mismatch negativity significantly covaried between Active and Passive attentional conditions within the same sensory modality, but not between different sensory modalities.

Episodic retrieval involves early and sustained effects of reactivating information from encoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Recognition; EEG; Reinstatement; Reactivation; Confidence	COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MRC PSYCHOLINGUISTIC DATABASE; MULTIVOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NETWORK MODEL	Several fMRI studies have shown a correspondence between the brain regions activated during encoding and retrieval, consistent with the view that memory retrieval involves hippocampally-mediated reinstatement of cortical activity. With the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, the precise timing of such reactivation is unclear, calling into question the functional significance of these effects. Whereas reactivation influencing retrieval should emerge with neural correlates of retrieval success, that signifying post-retrieval monitoring would trail retrieval. The present study employed EEG to provide a temporal landmark of retrieval success from which we could investigate the sub-trial time course of reactivation. Pattern-classification analyses revealed that early-onsetting reactivation differentiated the outcome of recognition-memory judgments and was associated with individual differences in behavioral accuracy, while reactivation was also evident in a sustained form later in the trial. The EEG findings suggest that, whereas prior fMRI findings could be interpreted as reflecting the contribution of reinstatement to retrieval success, they could also indicate the maintenance of episodic information in service of post-retrieval evaluation.

However, the errors made may or may not be in line with the neural processing. In particular in experiments with time pressure or studies where the threshold of perception is measured, the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the structure in the underlying experimental set-up. When we base our analysis on the behavioral labels as usually done, then we ignore this problem of systematic and structured (non-uniform) label noise and are likely to arrive at wrong conclusions in our data analysis. This paper contributes a remedy to this important scenario: we present a novel approach for a) measuring label noise and b) removing structured label noise. We demonstrate its usefulness for EEG data analysis using a standard d2 test for visual attention (N = 20 participants). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neurophysiological evidence of an association between cognitive control and defensive reactivity processes in young children	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Defensive reactivity; Young children; Error-related negativity; Startle; Parietal asymmetry	REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; CHILDHOOD TEMPERAMENT; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; EEG ASYMMETRY; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; EMOTION; POTENTIALS; BEHAVIOR; ERRORS	Interactions between cognitive control and affective processes, such as defensive reactivity, are intimately involved in healthy and unhealthy human development. However, cognitive control and defensive reactivity processes are often studied in isolation and rarely examined in early childhood. To address these gaps, we examined the relationships between multiple neurophysiological measures of cognitive control and defensive reactivity in young children. Specifically, we assessed two event-related potentials thought to index cognitive control processes - the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) - measured across two tasks, and two markers of defensive reactivity processes - startle reflex and resting parietal asymmetry - in a sample of 3- to 7-year old children. Results revealed that measures of cognitive control and defensive reactivity were related such that evidence of poor cognitive control (smaller ERN) was associated with high defensive reactivity (larger startle and greater right relative to left parietal activity). The strength of associations between the ERN and measures of defensive reactivity did not vary by age, providing evidence that poor cognitive control relates to greater defensive reactivity across early childhood years.

Source localization algorithms to find attention and memory circuits in the brain	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						P300 event-related potential; EEG source localization		Brain is a complex organ and many attempts have been done to know its functions. Studying attention and memory circuits can help to achieve much information about the brain. P300 is related to attention and memory operations, so its investigation will lead to better understanding of these mechanisms. In this study, EEG signals of thirty healthy subjects are analyzed. Each subject participates in three-segment experiment including start, penalty and last segments. Each segment contains the same number of visual and auditory tests including warning, attention, response and feedback phases. Data analysis is done by using conventional averaging techniques and P300 source localization is carried out with two localization algorithms including low-resolution and high-resolution algorithms. Using realistic head model to improve the accuracy of localization, our results demonstrate that the P300 component arises from a wide cerebral cortex network and localizing a definite generating cortical zone is impossible. This study shows that a combination of high-resolution and low-resolution algorithms can be a useful tool for physiologists to find the neural sources of primary circuits in the brain.

One particularly difficult confound to remove is task performance capacity, i.e. the difference in performance between the conditions of interest. While ideally task performance capacity should bematched across different conditions, this is difficult to achieve experimentally. However, differences in performance could theoretically be corrected for mathematically. One such proposal is found in a recent paper by Lamy, Salti and Bar-Haim [Lamy D, Salti M, Bar-HaimY. Neural correlates of subjective awareness and unconscious processing: an ERP study. J Cognitive Neurosci 2009,21: 1435-46], who put forward a correctivemethod for an electroencephalography experiment. We argue that their analysis is essentially grounded in a version of High Threshold Theory, which has been shown to be inferior in general to Signal Detection Theory. We show through a series of computer simulations that their correction method only partially removes the influence of performance capacity, which can yield misleading results. We present a mathematical correction method based on Signal Detection Theory that is theoretically capable of removing performance capacity confounds. We discuss the limitations of mathematically correcting for performance capacity confounds in imaging studies and its impact for theories about consciousness.

The principle advantage of tvPDC lies in the combination of directionality, time variance and frequency selectivity simultaneously, offering a more differentiated view into complex brain networks. Yet the advantages specific to tvPDC also cause a large number of results, leading to serious problems in interpretability. To counter this issue, we propose the decomposition of multi-dimensional tvPDC results into a sum of rank-1 outer products. This leads to a data condensation which enables an advanced interpretation of results. Furthermore it is thereby possible to uncover inherent interaction patterns of induced neuronal subsystems by limiting the decomposition to several relevant channels, while retaining the global influence determined by the preceding multivariate AR estimation and tvPDC calculation of the entire scalp. Finally a comparison between several subjects is considerably easier, as individual tvPDC results are summarized within a comprehensive model equipped with subject-specific loading coefficients. A proof-of-principle of the approach is provided by means of simulated data; EEG data of an experiment concerning visual evoked potentials are used to demonstrate the applicability to real data.

The present study investigates the impact of orthographic depth on reading route by analyzing evoked potentials to words in a deep (French) and shallow (German) language presented to highly proficient bilinguals. ERP analyses to German and French words revealed significant topographic modulations 240-280 ms post-stimulus onset, indicative of distinct brain networks engaged in reading over this time window. Source estimations revealed that these effects stemmed from modulations of left insular, inferior frontal and dorsolateral regions (German > French) previously associated to phonological processing. Our results show that reading in a shallow language was associated to a stronger engagement of phonological pathways than reading in a deep language. Thus, the lexical pathways favored in word reading are reinforced by phonological networks more strongly in the shallow than deep orthography. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We examined event-related EEG during a general process of controlling attention by using a novel paradigm to elicit a medial frontal negativity (MFN) to stimuli that indicate potential changes in future response demands. Independent components analysis revealed that the latent factors that accounted for MFN activity to such changes also accounted for activity associated with the error-related negativity and the NoGo inhibitory N2. Given that the medial frontal activation to these changes varied reliably across subjects simply as a function of potential need to alter responses in the absence of error commission and response inhibition, we propose that the underlying basis for medial frontal activation in situations demanding ongoing monitoring of performance involves an increase in attention control, a factor common to all MFN paradigms.

Making the case for mobile cognition: EEG and sports performance	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						EEG; Sports performance; Expertise; Neural efficiency; Alpha; Readiness potentials; P300; Neurofeedback; Mobile cognition	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; UPPER ALPHA POWER; INHIBITORY CONTROL; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; ERP COMPONENTS; SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE; EXPERT PERFORMANCE; SKILLED MARKSMEN; FRONTAL THETA	In the high stakes world of International sport even the smallest change in performance can make the difference between success and failure, leading sports professionals to become increasingly interested in the potential benefits of neuroimaging. Here we describe evidence from EEG studies that either identify neural signals associated with expertise in sport, or employ neurofeedback to improve performance. Evidence for the validity of neurofeedback as a technique for enhancing sports performance remains limited. By contrast, progress in characterizing the neural correlates of sporting behavior is clear: frequency domain studies link expert performance to changes in alpha rhythms, whilst time-domain studies link expertise in response evaluation and motor output with modulations of P300 effects and readiness potentials. Despite early promise, however, findings have had relatively little impact for sports professionals, at least in part because there has been a mismatch between lab tasks and real sporting activity. After selectively reviewing existing findings and outlining limitations, we highlight developments in mobile EEG technology that offer new opportunities for sports neuroscience. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, the relationships, especially the functional correlations, between resting-state brain activity and the P3 have not been well established. In this study, we investigated the relationships between P3 properties (i.e., amplitude and latency) and resting-state brain networks. The results indicated that P3 amplitude was significantly correlated with resting-state network topology, and in general, larger P3 amplitudes could be evoked when the resting-state brain network was more efficient. However, no significant relationships were found for the corresponding P3 latency. Additionally, the long-range connections between the prefrontal/frontal and parietal/occipital brain regions, which represent the synchronous activity of these areas, were functionally related to the P3 parameters, especially P3 amplitude. The findings of the current study may help us better understand inter-subject variation in the P3, which may be instructive for clinical diagnosis, cognitive neuroscience studies, and potential subject selection for brain-computer interface applications.

Flicker-Induced Time Dilation Does Not Modulate EEG Correlates of Temporal Encoding	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; INTERNAL CLOCK; DECISION-PROCESSES; SPEEDING-UP; DURATION; MODEL; DISCRIMINATION; REPRESENTATION; ACCUMULATION	In this study, we used EEG to investigate how visual stimulus dynamics (i.e. flicker) affect the mechanisms of duration perception. Previous studies have demonstrated that flickering visual stimuli are judged longer than equally long non-flickering stimuli. We tested whether this effect of flicker on duration judgments is mediated by changes in temporal encoding during the time interval. Here, temporal encoding refers to the perception of the unfolding of time throughout the temporal interval, also termed the "clock stage" in information processing models of interval timing. We hypothesized that if flicker mediates duration perception by affecting temporal encoding, then the dilation-effect should be reflected by neural correlates of temporal encoding. We presented flickering and steady stimuli in a duration bisection task and found that flicker dilated perceived duration. The EEG analysis allowed us to isolate a putative neural correlate of temporal encoding: a modulation of the amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) by stimuli classified as "long" compared to physically identical stimuli classified as "short". However, flicker did not affect the CNV amplitude, suggesting that flicker does not dilate perceived duration by affecting temporal encoding. Possibly, flicker might affect only later stages of temporal processing such as interval comparison or decision making.

Effects of Subcallosal Cingulate Deep Brain Stimulation on Negative Self-bias in Patients With Treatment-resistant Depression	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Electrical stimulation; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Brodmann area 25; Subgenual cingulate; Mood disorders	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE MODEL; PROJECTIONS; EMOTION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; TARGETS; SEARCH	Background: The cognitive neuropsychological model states that antidepressant treatment alters emotional biases early in treatment, and after this initial change in emotional processing, environmental and social interactions allow for long-term/sustained changes in mood and behavior. Objective: Changes in negative self-bias after chronic subcallosal cingulate (SCC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) were investigated with the hypothesis that treatment would lead to changes in emotional biases followed by changes in symptom severity. Methods: Patients (N = 7) with treatment-resistant depression were assessed at three time points: pretreatment; after one month stimulation; and after six months stimulation. The P1, P2, P3, and LPP (late positive potential) components of the event-related potential elicited by positive and negative trait adjectives were recorded in both a self-referential task and a general emotion recognition task. Results: Results indicate that DBS reduced automatic attentional bias toward negative words early in treatment, as indexed by the P1 component, and controlled processing of negative words later in treatment, as indexed by the P3 component. Reduction in negative words endorsed as self-descriptive after six months DBS was associated with reduced depression severity after six months DBS. Change in emotional processing may be restricted to the self-referential task. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that the cognitive neuropsychological model, developed to explain the time-course of monoamine antidepressant treatment, may also be used as a framework to interpret the antidepressant effects of SCC DBS.

Here, we explored whether entrainment of neuronal oscillations underpins this phenomenon. Participants viewed a regular stream of images in silence, or in-synchrony or out-of-synchrony with an unmarked beat position of a slow (1.3 Hz) auditory rhythm. Focusing on occipital recordings, we analyzed evoked oscillations shortly before and event-related potentials (ERPs) shortly after image onset. The phase of beta-band oscillations in the in-synchrony condition differed from that in the out-of-synchrony and silence conditions. Additionally, ERPs revealed rhythm effects for a stimulus onset potential (SOP) and the N1. Both were more negative for the in-synchrony as compared to the out-of-synchrony and silence conditions and their amplitudes positively correlated with the beta phase effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that rhythmic expectations are supported by a reorganization of neural oscillations that seems to benefit stimulus processing at expected time points. Importantly, this reorganization emerges from global rhythmic cues, across modalities, and for frequencies significantly higher than the external rhythm. As such, our findings support the idea that entrainment of neuronal oscillations represents a general mechanism through which the brain uses predictive elements in the environment to optimize attention and stimulus perception.

Measurement of Neurophysiological Signals of Ignoring and Attending Processes in Attention Control	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 101; attention; control; executive function; neurophysiology; electroencephalography; event-related potential; attending; ignoring; sustained attention; intermodal; inter-sensory; auditory; visual	DISTRACTOR SUPPRESSION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; GUIDELINES; MODULATION	Attention control is the ability to selectively attend to some sensory signals while ignoring others. This ability is thought to involve two processes: enhancement of sensory signals that are to be attended and the attenuation of sensory signals that are to be ignored. The overall strength of attentional modulation is often measured by comparing the amplitude of a sensory neural response to an external input when attended versus when ignored. This method is robust for detecting attentional modulation, but precludes the ability to assess the separate dynamics of attending and ignoring processes. Here, we describe methodology to measure independently the neurophysiological signals of attending and ignoring using the intermodal attention task (IMAT). This task, when combined with electroencephalography, isolates neurophysiological sensory responses in auditory and visual modalities, when either attending or ignoring, with respect to a passive control. As a result, independent dynamics of attending and of a ignoring can be assessed in either modality. Our results using this task indicate that the timing and cortical sources of attending and ignoring effects differ, as do their contributions to the attention modulation effect, pointing to unique neural trajectories and demonstrating sample utility of measuring them separately.

J	Hsu, YF; Vincent, R; Waszak, F				Hsu, Yi-Fang; Vincent, Romain; Waszak, Florian			Optimistic, pessimistic, realistic: Event-related potential evidence for how depressive symptoms influences expectation formation in the Human brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Prediction error; Individual difference	SELF-INITIATED SOUNDS; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; AUDITORY-STIMULI; TIME; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; PITCH; N1	Recent research suggested a link between the prediction mechanism and depressive symptoms. While healthy people tend to maintain unrealistic optimism in the face of reality challenging their beliefs, depressed people show systematic pessimism. However, it remains unclear at which stage these individual differences in optimism/pessimism arise in the brain. In the current study we designed a simple gambling task with two difficulty levels, the easy game and the hard game. Participants were required to press one of four keys to gain a bonus signalled by a sinusoidal tone. For three of the four keys, the probability of getting a large bonus was 80% in the easy game and 8% in the hard game. In both games, the fourth key, randomly determined in each trial, yielded a large bonus with a probability of 100%. This arrangement allowed us to observe less/more depressed participants optimistic/pessimistic expectations about hitting the key that guarantees a large bonus. The opposite expectation patterns of less/more depressed participants were reflected on the N1 amplitude. Meanwhile, all participants were well aware of the true probability of obtaining certain bonus in each game as reflected on the P3 amplitude. The results suggest that the subjective system (tracking subjective beliefs) and the objective system (tracking objective evidence) are dissociable in the human brain, with the former feeding information into sensory areas and the latter representing prediction errors on a higher level. Moreover, individual differences arise from variability in the former rather than the latter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we investigate if functional abnormalities in this area indexed by attenuated responses to emotionally arousing stimuli, are also family-history-dependent. Methods: Neuromagnetic activity for emotional and neutral complex scenes was recorded by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 depressed patients without, 8 depressed patients with FH, and 15 healthy controls. Emotion-sensitive neuronal steady state responses were cortical source localized and tested for group-by-emotion interactions. Results: The group-by-emotion interaction (F(4, 80)=4.4, p=0.004) was explained by a significant modulation of right temporoparietal cortex activity by emotional arousal in controls and patients without FH. This effect was reduced in FH positive patients. The difference between patient groups remained when clinical variables such as symptom severity were accounted for. Limitations: All patients were medicated, but differences between patient groups remained after accounting for medication dosage. Further, the sample size was limited, but data driven resampling statistics showed the robustness of our effects. Finally, the sample consists of female patients only and we cannot generalize our results to male samples. Conclusions: Patients with FH show impaired recruitment of attention relevant cortical circuitry by emotional stimuli. The neuroanatomical locus of this effect accords with previous reports on structural abnormalities and electrophysiological deficits at rest in individuals with FH. L Our results speak to the relevance of right Lemporoparietal dysfunction in emotional information processing as a potential endophenotype for depression with FH. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we address the reproducibility of Bayesian model comparison (and inferences about model parameters) from three important perspectives namely: (i) reproducibility with independent data (obtained by averaging over odd and even trials); (ii) reproducibility over formally distinct models (namely, classic ERR and canonical microcircuit or CMC models); and (iii) reproducibility over inversion schemes (inversion of the grand average and estimation of group effects using empirical Bayes). Our hope was to illustrate the degree of reproducibility one can expect from DCM when analysing different data, under different models with different analyses.

The P600 is often understood as a correlate of structural analysis. This assumption has informed a number of neurocognitive models of language. However, the P600 strongly resembles the P3, likely a more general electrophysiological correlate of reorientation behaviour supported by noradrenergic input to the ventral attention network/VAN. Some researchers have proposed that the P600 is an instance of the P3, not a distinct component reflecting the analysis of structured inputs. Here, we tested the P600-as-P3 hypothesis by estimating the alignment of the P600 elicited in a visual sentence processing task to simultaneously collected behavioural measures. A similar analysis was undertaken for a P3 elicited in a separate non-linguistic (face detection) task. Since the P3 is usually aligned to reaction time/RT, the same should hold for the P600; a failure to find RT alignment of the P600 would pose a problem for the P600-as-P3 hypothesis. In contrast, RT alignment of the P600 would associate it with the well-established VAN/Locus Coeruleus - Noradrenaline - Network subserving cortical reorientation. We failed to falsify the hypothesis of RT alignment. Secondary measures, while less unambiguous, were more in agreement with the P600-as-P3 hypothesis. We interpret our results as corroborating the hypothesis that the P600 is a P3, in that it shows that the P600 is RT-aligned. This perspective is unpredicted by an account of the P600 as indexing high-level processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We previously reported that visual P300 was already impaired in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ). This study demonstrates how the visual P300, as well as earlier components P1, N1, and N200, changed at the 1-year follow-up after their initial measurement. Methods: Visual ERPs were recorded with the same experimental paradigm and acquisition protocol at both time points in FESZ (n = 18) and healthy comparison subjects (n = 24). Participants silently counted infrequent target stimuli ("x") amid standard stimuli ("y") presented on the screen while the 64-channel electroencephalogram was recorded. Results: FESZ showed smaller visual P300, N200, P1 (trend level) amplitude and delayed P300 and N1 latency at both time points; however, only P300 showed progressive amplitude reduction over the course of the illness at 1-year follow-up. P300 latency did not change over time in either group. FESZ showed significantly reduced Spatial Span total score at both time points, and there was a significant negative correlation between P300 peak amplitude and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptom score at baseline. Conclusion: These data show progressive P300 amplitude reduction in response to visual stimuli in the early stage of schizophrenia. These visual P300 findings support the concept of progression of schizophrenia, suggesting the usefulness of the visual P300 as a biological marker of progression.

To study the effect of handedness on the modulating effect of tDCS, we compared the difference in tDCS-boosted ERD during dominant and non-dominant hand motor imagery. EEGs were recorded over the left sensorimotor cortex of seven healthy right-handed volunteers, and we measured ERD induced either by dominant or non-dominant hand motor imagery. Ten minutes of anodal tDCS was then used to increase the cortical excitability of the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), and ERD was measured again. With anodal tDCS, we observed only a small increase in ERD during non-dominant hand motor imagery, whereas the same stimulation induced a prominent increase in ERD during dominant hand motor imagery. This trend was most obvious in the participants who used their dominant hand more frequently. Although our study is preliminary because of a small sample size, these results suggest that the increase in ERD by applying anodal tDCS was stronger on the dominant side than on the non-dominant side. The background excitability of M1 may determine the strength of the effect of anodal tDCS on ERD by hand motor imagery.

Typically, human studies that investigate the relationship between brain responses to food-related stimuli and obesity present food cues without subsequent delivery of food. However, in order to identify the brain correlates of cue reactivity, we must record brain responses to food-related cues signaling food availability. Therefore, we have developed a dispensing apparatus for use in a cued-food delivery task in which event-related potentials (ERPs) to food-related images predicting food delivery and images not predicting food delivery can be recorded. Here, we describe a method where: The experimental apparatus dispenses an edible item (i.e., a chocolate candy) which may or may not be eaten, or a non-edible control item (e.g., a plastic bead). Deposit boxes are available to store uneaten candies and the non-edible control items. The dispensing mechanism is capable of recording the exact timestamp when each delivery event occurs (e.g., release from the dispenser, arrival in the receptacle, storage in the deposit box).

N1 and Ta responses were symmetric between hemispheres, with responses elicited by the second tone of the 50 ms ISI tone-pairs. Tb responses to the second tones were significantly attenuated over the right hemisphere when compared to the left hemisphere for the 50 ms ISI tone-pairs, but returned to similar amplitudes in the 200 ms condition. Our results suggest that temporal integration windows of the left and right primary auditory areas are symmetric whereas those of the left and right secondary auditory areas are asymmetric. These findings are consistent with the asymmetric sampling in time hypothesis and provide justification for further investigation of the involvement of temporal integration in higher order auditory processes.

The ERPs recorded at the place names revealed that, compared to "distant places", "close places" enhanced ERP's components, associated with motivational relevance, in the context of the deictic Verbs of motion to come and to go, but not in the context of the static verb to be. Also, in the context of the verbs of motion source estimation showed that "close places" elicited more activity than "distant places" in the medial temporal cortex (around the parahippocampal gyms), suggesting projection of the reader's self-relevant information, or retrieval of geographical episodic memories. Finally, sentences describing motions congruent with the self-perspective (e.g. "going to distant place") elicited less activation than sentences incongruent with the self-perspective (e.g. "coming to distant place") in the right fronto-polar cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex, regions generally associated with the other's perspective or with self/other perspective conflict. These findings provide information on the brain processes underlying readers' perspective taking, guided by the deictic verbs of motion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Autism diagnosis differentiates neurophysiological responses to faces in adults with tuberous sclerosis complex	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; ERP; Face; Gaze; Tuberous sclerosis complex	YOUNG-CHILDREN; EYE-GAZE; SPECTRUM DISORDER; ATYPICAL FACE; ASD; RECOGNITION; ASSOCIATION; ATTENTION; EPILEPSY; INFANTS	Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder that is likely to be the outcome of complex aetiological mechanisms. One strategy to provide insight is to study ASD within tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a rare disorder with a high incidence of ASD, but for which the genetic cause is determined. Individuals with ASD consistently demonstrate face processing impairments, but these have not been examined in adults with TSC using event-related potentials (ERPs) that are able to capture distinct temporal stages of processing. Methods: For adults with TSC (n = 14), 6 of which had a diagnosis of ASD, and control adults (n = 13) passively viewed upright and inverted human faces with direct or averted gaze, with concurrent EEG recording. Amplitude and latency of the P1 and N170 ERPs were measured. Results: Individuals with TSC + ASD exhibited longer N170 latencies to faces compared to typical adults. Typical adults and adults with TSC-only exhibited longer N170 latency to inverted versus upright faces, whereas individuals with TSC + ASD did not show latency differences according to face orientation. In addition, individuals with TSC + ASD showed increased N170 latency to averted compared to direct gaze, which was not demonstrated in typical adults. A reduced lateralization was shown for the TSC + ASD groups on P1 and N170 amplitude. Conclusions: The findings suggest that individuals with TSC + ASD may have similar electrophysiological abnormalities to idiopathic ASD and are suggestive of developmental delay. Identifying brain-based markers of ASD that are similar in TSC and idiopathic cases is likely to help elucidate the risk pathways to ASD.

Furthermore, there is a significant and growing debate in the literature regarding the putative role of attention in the encoding of expectations in perception. The question then arises as to what are the behavioral and neural consequences, if any, of attention decrement on temporal expectations and related enhancement of sensory information processing. Here, we investigated behavioral performance and visual N1a, N1p and P1 components during a sustained attention reaction time task inducing attention decrement under two conditions. In one condition, the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) were randomly distributed to impede expectation effects while for the other, the ISI exhibited natural-like long-term correlations supposed to induce temporal expectations. Behavioral results show that natural-like fluctuations in ISI indeed induced faster RT due to temporal expectations. These temporal expectations were beneficial even under attention decrement circumstances. Further, temporal expectations were associated with reduced N1a amplitude while attention decrement was associated with reduced N1p amplitude. Our findings provide evidence that the effects of temporal expectations and attention decrement induced in a single task can be independent at the behavioral level, and are supported at separate information processing stages at the neural level in vision.

This study investigated if a realistic visualization in 3D of upper and lower limb movements can amplify motor related potentials during subsequent MI. We hypothesized that a richer sensory visualization might be more effective during instrumental conditioning, resulting in a more pronounced event related desynchronization (ERD) of the upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) over the sensorimotor cortices thereby potentially improving MI based brain-computer interface (BCI) protocols for motor rehabilitation. The results show a strong increase of the characteristic patterns of ERD of the upper alpha band components for left and right limb MI present over the sensorimotor areas in both visualization conditions. Overall, significant differences were observed as a function of visualization modality (VM; 2D vs. 3D). The largest upper alpha band power decrease was obtained during MI after a 3-dimensional visualization. In total in 12 out of 20 tasks the end-user of the 3D visualization group showed an enhanced upper alpha ERD relative to 2D VM group, with statistical significance in nine tasks.With a realistic visualization of the limb movements, we tried to increase motor cortex activation during subsequent MI. The feedback and the feedback environment should be inherently motivating and relevant for the learner and should have an appeal of novelty, real-world relevance or aesthetic value (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Merrill, 2007). Realistic visual feedback, consistent with the participant's MI, might be helpful for accomplishing successful MI and the use of such feedback may assist in making BCI a more natural interface for MI based BCI rehabilitation.

We have now examined the hypothesis that, during a series of painful cutaneous laser stimuli, thalamic signals will show stimulus-related gamma-band spectral activity, which is modulated by attention to vs. distraction from the painful stimulus. When the series of laser stimuli was presented, attention was focused by counting the laser stimuli (count laser task), while distraction was produced by counting backward (count back plus laser task). We have studied the effect of a cutaneous laser on thalamic local field potentials and EEG activity during awake procedures (deep brain stimulation implants) for the treatment of essential tremor. At different delays after the stimulus, three low gamma-(30-50 Hz) and two high gamma-band (70-90 Hz) activations were observed during the two tasks. Greater high-gamma activation was found during the count laser task for the earlier window, while greater high-gamma activation was found during the count back plus laser task for the later window. Thalamic signals were coherent with EEG signals in the beta band, which indicated significant synchrony. Thalamic cross-frequency coupling analysis indicated that the phase of the lower frequency activity (theta to beta) modulated the amplitude of the higher frequency activity (low and high gamma) more strongly during the count laser task than during the count back plus laser task. This modulation might result in multiplexed signals each encoding a different aspect of pain.	[Chien, J. H.; Liu, C. C.; Lenz, F.

Cerebral perfusion in pediatric type 1 diabetes: relation to vascular complications, psychological and neurophysiological functions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIABETES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Cerebral perfusion; SPECT; P300 latency & amplitude; EEG; Psychiatric morbidity	BLOOD-FLOW; SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA; YOUNG-CHILDREN; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; BRAIN VOLUME; HYPERGLYCEMIA; MELLITUS	Regional cerebral hypoperfusion has been reported in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic children also manifest a higher rate of mild cognitive dysfunction and electro-encephalographic abnormalities and these are best predicted by the occurrence of hypoglycemic events relatively early in life. More recent studies point toward the deleterious effect of chronic hyperglycemia on cognitive functioning and brain structure as measured with MRI. To study the relation between Regional cerebral perfusion in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes measured by Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and the vascular complications, psychological and neurophysiologic functions. One hundred children and adolescents with type 1 DM (64 females; mean age 15.3+/-3.1 years) and 40 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria comprised recent episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within the last 6 weeks. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using SPECT. Patients underwent electro-encephalogram (EEG) and long latency evoked potential assessment, as well as Psychiatric assessment. Our study showed significant mean frontal and mean basal ganglia hypo perfusion in children having diabetes of more than 10 years duration compared to controls (P<0.05). Mean frontal and basal ganglia perfusion were significantly related to different grades of hypoglycemia and longer diabetes duration but were not affected by history of diabetic ketoacidosis. Regional cerebral blood flow was not correlated to P300 latency or amplitude, EEG or psychiatric morbidity. Cerebral perfusion is affected by the duration of diabetes, and attacks of hypoglycemia, though not correlated to EEG findings or psychiatric morbidities. Frontal and basal ganglia are most areas affected.	[Salem, Mona A. K.; Tantawy, Azza A.

J	Beste, C; Saft, C				Beste, Christian; Saft, Carsten			Action selection in a possible model of striatal medium spiny neuron dysfunction: behavioral and EEG data in a patient with benign hereditary chorea	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Action control; Response selection; EEG; Benign hereditary chorea; Medium spiny neurons	HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; WAVELET ANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; P3B; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEMS	Chaining or cascading of different actions and responses is necessary to accomplish a goal. Yet, little is known about the functional neuroanatomical-electrophysiological mechanisms mediating these processes. Computational models suggest that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) play an important role in action cascading, but this assumption has hardly been tested relating neuroanatomical and electrophysiological parameters in a human model of circumscribed MSN dysfunction. As a possible human model of circumscribed MSN dysfunction, we investigate benign hereditary chorea in a case-control study applying bootstrap statistics. To investigate these mechanisms, we used a stop-change paradigm, where we apply mathematical constraints to describe the degree of how task goals are activated with more or less overlap during action cascading. We record event-related potentials and analyze neural synchronization processes. The results show that MSN dysfunctions lead to deficits in action cascading processes only when two response options seek simultaneous access to response selection resources. Attentional selection processes are not affected, but processes reflecting the transition between stimulus evaluation and responding are affected. The results underline computational models of MSN functioning and show that dysfunction in these networks leads to a more parallel and hence inefficient response selection.

J	Kong, YY; Somarowthu, A; Ding, N				Kong, Ying-Yee; Somarowthu, Ala; Ding, Nai			Effects of Spectral Degradation on Attentional Modulation of Cortical Auditory Responses to Continuous Speech	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						cortical entrainment; cochlear implant; spectral degradation; sound segregation; event-related potentials; auditory scene analysis	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COCKTAIL PARTY; ENTRAINMENT; CUES; RECOGNITION; CORTEX; SOUND	This study investigates the effect of spectral degradation on cortical speech encoding in complex auditory scenes. Young normal-hearing listeners were simultaneously presented with two speech streams and were instructed to attend to only one of them. The speech mixtures were subjected to noise-channel vocoding to preserve the temporal envelope and degrade the spectral information of speech. Each subject was tested with five spectral resolution conditions (unprocessed speech, 64-, 32-, 16-, and 8-channel vocoder conditions) and two target-to-masker ratio (TMR) conditions (3 and 0 dB). Ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and speech comprehension were measured in each spectral and TMR condition for each subject. Neural tracking of each speech stream was characterized by cross-correlating the EEG responses with the envelope of each of the simultaneous speech streams at different time lags. Results showed that spectral degradation and TMR both significantly influenced how top-down attention modulated the EEG responses to the attended and unattended speech. That is, the EEG responses to the attended and unattended speech streams differed more for the higher (unprocessed, 64 ch, and 32 ch) than the lower (16 and 8 ch) spectral resolution conditions, as well as for the higher (3 dB) than the lower TMR (0 dB) condition. The magnitude of differential neural modulation responses to the attended and unattended speech streams significantly correlated with speech comprehension scores. These results suggest that severe spectral degradation and low TMR hinder speech stream segregation, making it difficult to employ top-down attention to differentially process different speech streams.

Surface Laplacian of scalp electrical signals and independent component analysis resolve EMG contamination of electroencephalogram	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Surface Laplacian; Independent component analysis; Electromyogram; Steady state response; Oddball task; Evoked response	EEG DATA; ARTIFACTS; MUSCLE; CORTEX	The serious impact of electromyogram (EMG) contamination of electroencephalogram (EEG) is well recognised. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that combining independent component analysis with the surface Laplacian can eliminate EMG contamination of the EEG, and to validate that this processing does not degrade expected neurogenic signals. The method involves sequential application of ICA, using a manual procedure to identify and discard EMG components, followed by the surface Laplacian. The extent of decontamination is quantified by comparing processed EEG with EMG-free data that was recorded during pharmacologically induced neuromuscular paralysis. The combination of the ICA procedure and the surface Laplacian, with a flexible spherical spline, results in a strong suppression of EMG contamination at all scalp sites and frequencies. Furthermore, the ICA and surface Laplacian procedure does not impair the detection of well-known, cerebral responses; alpha activity with eyes-closed; ERP components (N1, P2) in response to an auditory oddball task; and steady state responses to photic and auditory stimulation. Finally, more flexible spherical splines increase the suppression of EMG by the surface Laplacian. We postulate this is due to ICA enabling the removal of local muscle sources of EMG contamination and the Laplacian transform being insensitive to distant (postural) muscle EMG contamination.

The main aim of the present study was to assess alterations in the electrophysiological correlates of monetary reward processing in adult patients with ADHD of the combined subtype. Fourteen adults with ADHD of the combined subtype and 14 healthy control participants performed an active and an observational probabilistic reward-based learning task while an electroencephalogramm (EEG) was recorded. Regardless of feedback valence, there was a general feedback-related negativity (FRN) enhancement in combination with reduced learning performance during both active and observational reward learning in patients with ADHD relative to healthy controls. Other feedback-locked potentials such as the P200 and P300 and response-locked potentials were unaltered in the patients. There were no significant correlations between learning performance, FRN amplitudes and clinical symptoms, neither in the overall group involving all participants, nor in patients or controls considered separately. This pattern of findings might reflect generally impaired reward prediction in adults with ADHD of the combined subtype. We demonstrated for the first time that patients with ADHD of the combined subtype show not only deficient active reward learning but are also impaired when learning by observing other people's outcomes.

Endogenous event-related potentials in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome without central nervous system involvement	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; P300; EEG; PERFORMANCE; AMPLITUDE	Objectives: Endogenous cognitive event-related potentials (CERPs) reflect higher-level processing of sensory information and can be used to evaluate cognitive functions. The aim of this paper was to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the electrophysiological parameters of CERPs in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) but without symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement or mental disorder. The analysis of CERP parameters was then correlated with the clinical status of the patients and with some of the immunological parameters in the patient group.Method: Thirty consecutive patients with pSS (29 females, one male) were included in the study. All the patients underwent CERP examination.Results: There was a significant prolongation of the latency of P300 and N200 potentials in patients with pSS. Abnormalities in electrophysiological parameters of CERPs correlated with the duration of the disease, salivary gland abnormalities, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values. Patients with coexisting chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) had larger P300 amplitudes. There were no statistically significant changes in the electrophysiological parameters of CERPs in patients with pSS dependent on the presence of peripheral nervous system (PNS) lesions, skin changes, arthritis, abnormalities in white blood cells and the immune system or the levels of blood lipids.Conclusions: The results of the study suggest the presence of a minor cognitive dysfunction in patients with pSS without symptoms of CNS involvement or mental disorder. Cognitive dysfunction correlated with the disease duration time and the severity of inflammatory changes (salivary gland abnormalities and inflammatory markers in the blood). Further and larger longitudinal studies are necessary for confirmation of this correlation.

Objectives: Based on the assumption that early neurodegeneration in AD is asymmetrical and that olfactory input is primarily processed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, we assessed whether unirhinal psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of olfactory function can contribute to the diagnostic workup of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Olfactory function of 13 MCI patients with positive amyloid PET, 13 aged-matched controls (AC) with negative amyloid PET and 13 patients with post-infectious olfactory loss (OD) was assessed unirhinally using (1) psychophysical testing of olfactory detection, discrimination and identification performance and (2) the recording of olfactory event-related brain potentials. Time-frequency analysis was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the electrophysiological responses. Psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of auditory and trigeminal chemosensory function served as controls. Results: As compared to AC and OD, MCI patients exhibited a significant asymmetry of olfactory performance. This asymmetry efficiently discriminated between MCI and AC (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 77%), as well as MCI and OD (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 70%). There was also an asymmetry of the electrophysiological responses, but not specific for MCI. In both MCI and OD, olfactory stimulation of the best nostril elicited significantly more activity than stimulation of the worse nostril, between 3-7.5 Hz and 1.2-2.0 s after stimulus onset. Trigeminal and auditory psychophysical testing did not show any difference between groups. Conclusion: MCI patients exhibit a marked asymmetry of behavioral olfactory function, which could be useful for the diagnostic workup of MCI.

We generated mice carrying a deletion of 1.2 Mb homologous to the 15q13.3 microdeletion in human patients. Here, we report that mice with a heterozygous deletion on a C57BL/6 background (D/+ mice) demonstrated phenotypes including enlarged/heavier brains (macrocephaly) with enlarged lateral ventricles, decreased social interactions, increased repetitive grooming behavior, reduced ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased auditory-evoked gamma band EEG, and reduced event-related potentials. D/+ mice had normal body weight, activity levels, sensory gating, and cognitive abilities and no signs of epilepsy/seizures. Our results demonstrate that D/+ mice represent ASD-related phenotypes associated with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Further investigations using this chromosome-engineered mouse model may uncover the common mechanism(s) underlying ASD and other neurodevelopmental/psychiatric disorders representing the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia.

However, it is unclear how we shift spatial attention itself away from disgusting stimuli. In the present study, we used a multisensory spatial-cuing paradigm as a tool to test if a disgusting sound is avoided by redirecting visual attention to the opposite side. Our results show that behavioral responses as well as the P3 component indicated an inverse validity effect when cued by disgust. Validity differences on the P3 were increased ipsilaterally instead of contralaterally over visual electrode sites. In contrast, the N1 component, time-locked to sound cues, indicated the typical contralateral attentional arousal effect. Thus, disgusting sound cues first attract attention toward their location and later, after the processing of their emotional content, direct spatial attention away from the location of their origin to the opposite location.

Aim of this work was to analyse embodied cognition of the learning object, when it is presented in 2D or in 3D presentation in AR. Our sample was composed by University Students that differed with respect to the knowledge of plankton (naive and competent condition). The subjects had to manipulate in AR some Application about plankton. After the AR manipulation, the subjects had to perform a recognition task during an EEG recording. We examined Event Related Potential P1, N2 and P3 components. Main result of the study was a significant change in amplitude in the parietal and central left lobe in all components in direction of greater amplitude in naive condition. We interpret these results like a modulatory effect in the interaction with augmented reality application.

Here, using three Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures of brain activity, we establish that preverbal 11-month-old infants are sensitive to the non-arbitrary correspondences between language sounds and concepts, that is, to sound symbolism. In each trial, infant participants were presented with a visual stimulus (e.g., a round shape) followed by a novel spoken word that either sound-symbolically matched ("moma") or mismatched ("kipi") the shape. Amplitude increase in the gamma band showed perceptual integration of visual and auditory stimuli in the match condition within 300 msec of word onset. Furthermore, phase synchronization between electrodes at around 400 msec revealed intensified large-scale, left-hemispheric communication between brain regions in the mismatch condition as compared to the match condition, indicating heightened processing effort when integration was more demanding. Finally, event-related brain potentials showed an increased adult-like N400 response an index of semantic integration difficulty in the mismatch as compared to the match condition. Together, these findings suggest that 11-month-old infants spontaneously map auditory language onto visual experience by recruiting a cross-modal perceptual processing system and a nascent semantic network within the first year of life.

Besides the significant health-related consequences of OSAS including hypertension, increased risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular events, notable neurocognitive lapses and excessive daytime somnolence are considered as potential burdens. The intermittent nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia which occur in OSAS are known to affect cerebral circulation and result in brain hypo-perfusion. Arousal instability is then resulted from altered cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs) reflected in sleep EEG. In chronic state, some pathological loss of gray matter may be resulted from obstructive sleep apnea. This is proposed to be related to an upregulated proinflammatory state which may potentially result in apoptotic cell loss in the brain. On this basis, a pragmatic framework of the possible neural mechanisms which underpin obstructive sleep apnea-related neurcognitive decline has been discussed in this review. In addition, the impact of OSAS on cerebral autoregulation and sleep microstructure has been articulated.

This procedure is uncomfortable, can trigger seizures or nausea, and relies on subjective evaluation. We hypothesize that a method combining vibrotactile stimulation and statistical clustering may provide improved somatosensory mapping. Methods: Seven pediatric candidates for surgical resection underwent a task in which their fingers were independently stimulated using a custom designed finger pad, during electrocorticographic monitoring. A cluster-based statistical analysis was then performed to localize the elicited activity on the recording grids. Results: Mid-Gamma clusters (65-115Hz) arose in areas consistent with anatomical predictions as well as clinical findings, with five subjects presenting a somatotopic organization of the fingers. This process allowed us to delineate finger representation even in patients who were sleeping, with strong interictal activity, or when electrical stimulation did not successfully locate eloquent areas. Conclusions: We suggest that this scheme, relying on the endogenous neural response rather than exogenous electrical activation, could eventually be extended to map other sensory areas and provide a faster and more objective map to better anticipate outcomes of surgical resection.

Forty ex-combatants and 20 non ex-combatants were recruited for this study. Empathy levels as well as executive functions were measured. Empathy level was used to create three groups. Group 1 (G1) included ex-combatants with normal empathy scores, and Group 2 included ex-combatants with low scores on at least one empathy sub-scales. In control group (Ctrl), participants with no antecedents of being combatants and with normal scores in empathy were included. Age, gender, educational and intelligence quotients level were controlled among groups. event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while individuals performed an affective picture processing task that included positive, neutral and negative emotional stimuli, which elicit an early modulation of emotion categorization (Early Posterior Negativity (EPN)) and late evaluative process (LPP). EPN differences were found among affective categories, but no group effects were observed at this component. LPP showed a main effect of category and group (higher amplitudes in ex-combatants). There was an inverse correlation between empathy and executive functions scores and ERPs. Results are discussed according to the impact of emotional processing on empathy profile.

Specifically, we analyzed EEG data from 11 normal hearing subjects to examine whether ITPC can predict noise-induced variations in the obligatory N1-P2 complex response. N1-P2 amplitude and latency data were obtained for the /bu/syllable in quiet and noise listening conditions. ITPC data in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands were calculated for the N1-P2 responses in the two passive listening conditions. Consistent with previous studies, background noise produced significant amplitude reduction and latency increase in N1 and P2, which were accompanied by significant ITPC decreases in all the three frequency bands. Correlation analyses further revealed that variations in ITPC were able to predict the amplitude and latency variations in N1-P2. The results suggest that trial-by-trial analysis of cortical neural synchrony is a valuable tool in understanding the modulatory effects of background noise on AERP measures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Subthalamic deep brain stimulation improves auditory sensory gating deficit in Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Auditory evoked potentials; Sensory gating; Subthalamic nucleus; Deep brain stimulation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIDDLE LATENCY COMPONENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PEDUNCULOPONTINE NUCLEUS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; P50 SUPPRESSION; MOTOR CONTROL; CORTEX; EEG	Objective: While motor effects of dopaminergic medication and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are well explored, their effects on sensory processing are less well understood. Here, we studied the impact of levodopa and STN-DBS on auditory processing. Methods: Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) was presented at frequencies between 1 and 6 Hz in a passive listening paradigm. High-density EEG-recordings were obtained before (levodopa ON/OFF) and 5 months following STN-surgery (ON/OFF STN-DBS). We compared auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) elicited by RAS in 12 PD patients to those in age-matched controls. Tempo-dependent amplitude suppression of the auditory P1/N1-complex was used as an indicator of auditory gating. Results: Parkinsonian patients showed significantly larger AEP-amplitudes (P1, N1) and longer AEP-latencies (N1) compared to controls. Neither interruption of dopaminergic medication nor of STN-DBS had an immediate effect on these AEPs. However, chronic STN-DBS had a significant effect on abnormal auditory gating characteristics of parkinsonian patients and restored a physiological P1/N1-amplitude attenuation profile in response to RAS with increasing stimulus rates. Conclusions: This differential treatment effect suggests a divergent mode of action of levodopa and STN-DBS on auditory processing. Significance: STN-DBS may improve early attentive filtering processes of redundant auditory stimuli, possibly at the level of the frontal cortex.

Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) provide the tools to examine the functional integrity of these areas and may provide useful indicators of early disease progression. Objective: To assess the functional integrity of visual association area processing in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) using VEPs. Methods: We investigated the visual processing of healthy older adults (n = 26), AD (n = 20), and aMCI (n = 25) patients in a visual oddball paradigm designed to elicit the visual P1, N1, and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN). Results: AD patients showed a significant reduction of P1 and N1 VEP amplitudes and aMCI patients showed a reduction in N1 amplitude compared to healthy older adults. P1 amplitude in response to deviant stimuli and vMMN amplitude were found to be associated with the degree of cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Conclusions: Changes in VEPs in AD may be a consequence of the microscopic AD pathology typically found in the extrastriate cortex. Neural measures of visual processing may help to better characterize subgroups of aMCI patients likely to develop AD. Additionally, VEPs and vMMN may provide objective markers of cognitive decline.

Antisocial behaviour typically onsets before adulthood and is reflected in antisocial individuals at the biological level. We therefore conducted a brain-based study of emotion processing in juvenile offenders. Male adolescent offenders and age-matched non-offenders passively viewed emotional images whilst their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography. The early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive potential (LPP) components were used as indices of emotion processing. For both juvenile offenders and non-offenders, the EPN differentiated unpleasant images from other image types, suggesting that early perceptual processing was not impaired in the offender group. In line with normal emotion processing, the LPP was significantly enhanced following unpleasant images for non-offenders. However, for juvenile offenders, the LPP did not differ across image categories, indicative of deficient emotional processing. The findings indicated that this brain-based hypo-reactivity occurred during a late stage of cognitive processing and was not a consequence of atypical early visual attention or perception. This study is the first to show attenuated emotion processing in juvenile offenders at the neural level. Overall, these results have the potential to inform interventions for juvenile offending.

Differently from iconic gestures, that must necessarily be accompanied by verbal language in order to be unambiguously understood, symbolic gestures are so conventionalized that they can be effortlessly understood in the absence of speech. Previous studies proposed that gesture and speech belong to a unique communication system. From an electrophysiological perspective the N400 modulation was considered the main variable indexing the interplay between two stimuli. However, while many studies tested this effect between iconic gestures and speech, little is known about the capability of an emblem to modulate the neural response to subsequently presented words. Using high-density EEG, the present study aimed at evaluating the presence of an N400 effect and its spatiotemporal dynamics, in terms of cortical activations, when emblems primed the observation of words. Participants were presented with symbolic gestures followed by a semantically congruent or incongruent verb. A N400 modulation was detected, showing larger negativity when gesture and words were incongruent. The source localization during N400 time window evidenced the activation of different portions of temporal cortex according to the gesture and word congruence. Our data provide further evidence of how the observation of an emblem influences verbal language perception, and of how this interplay is mainly instanced by different portions of the temporal cortex.

These BCI systems and motor rehabilitation in general involve several motor tasks for training. This study investigates the neurophysiological bases of an EEG-oscillation-driven BCI combined with a neuroprosthetic device to define the specific oscillatory signature of the BCI task. Controlling movements of a hand robotic orthosis with motor imagery of the same movement generates sensorimotor rhythm oscillation changes and involves three elements of tasks also used in stroke motor rehabilitation: passive and active movement, motor imagery, and motor intention. We recorded EEG while nine healthy participants performed five different motor tasks consisting of closing and opening of the hand as follows: 1) motor imagery without any external feedback and without overt hand movement, 2) motor imagery that moves the orthosis proportional to the produced brain oscillation change with online proprioceptive and visual feedback of the hand moving through a neuroprosthetic device (BCI condition), 3) passive and 4) active movement of the hand with feedback (seeing and feeling the hand moving), and 5) rest. During the BCI condition, participants received contingent online feedback of the decrease of power of the sensorimotor rhythm, which induced orthosis movement and therefore proprioceptive and visual information from the moving hand. We analyzed brain activity during the five conditions using time-frequency domain bootstrap-based statistical comparisons and Morlet transforms. Activity during rest was used as a reference. Significant contralateral and ipsilateral event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm was present during all motor tasks, largest in contralateral-postcentral, medio-central, and ipsilateral-precentral areas identifying the ipsilateral precentral cortex as an integral part of motor regulation. Changes in task-specific frequency power compared with rest were similar between motor tasks, and only significant differences in the time course and some narrow specific frequency bands were observed between motor tasks. We identified EEG features representing active and passive proprioception (with and without muscle contraction) and active intention and passive involvement (with and without voluntary effort) differentiating brain oscillations during motor tasks that could substantially support the design of novel motor BCI-based rehabilitation therapies. The BCI task induced significantly different brain activity compared with the other motor tasks, indicating neural processes unique to the use of body actuators control in a BCI context.

J	Wamain, Y; Pluciennicka, E; Kalenine, S				Wamain, Yannick; Pluciennicka, Ewa; Kalenine, Solene			A saw is first identified as an object used on wood: ERP evidence for temporal differences between Thematic and Functional similarity relations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERP; Semantic priming; Thematic and Functional Knowledge; Manipulable artifacts	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MANIPULATION KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; FMRI; EEG; PERCEPTION; MANIPULATABILITY; REPRESENTATIONS; SPECIFICITY	The role of functional and motor information in manipulable artifact object semantic organization is still poorly understood. In particular, several types of semantic relations involving object functional knowledge may be distinguished. Functional similarity relations group objects with similar functions at relatively specific (e.g. saw-axe, both used to cut wood) or general (saw-knife, both used to cut) levels. Thematic relations group objects based on their complementarity in events (saw used upon/with wood). Recent eye-tracking data showed distinct temporal time courses for the different semantic relations, with fastest processing of thematic relations and slowest processing of general function similarity relations. Behavioral data suggest the involvement of distinct cognitive mechanisms in manipulable artifact object semantic processing. The aim of the present study was to assess the neural correlates of thematic, and specific and general function similarity relation processing. Specifically, we investigated whether time course differences between semantic relations could be highlighted at the neurophysiological level. We used a protocol combining semantic priming with electroencephalography, and manipulated the type of semantic relation and the duration of the interval between prime and target objects. Two consistent and complementary results were shown. On N1 and P3 components, semantic priming was observed for thematic relations only. On N400 component, the type of semantic relation interacted with interval duration, and semantic priming was visible for all 3 relations after the longest interval only. Results revealed graded processing time courses for thematic, specific function similarity, and general function similarity relations at the neural level, and further indicate that thematic relations impact object processing during the early stages of object recognition. Findings suggest a hierarchical organization of three types of semantic relations based on functional knowledge. The parallel between semantic relations involving manipulable artifact objects and levels of action representations is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Social information processing is assumed to play a key role for this shared psychopathological phenomenon. The first steps in social information processing are to encode social cues and to create a mental representation of the social situation. The aim of the current study was to test whether the perception of social participation in patients with BPD and patients with SAD is biased in this initial stage of social processing. Focus was on the P3b, a brain potential related to stimulus evaluation that has been shown to be a sensitive indicator for the processes of interest. Twenty five unmedicated patients with BPD, 25 unmedicated patients with SAD and 25 healthy controls (HC) played an EEG-compatible version of Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing paradigm that experimentally induces social inclusion and exclusion. All participants showed a pronounced P3b when excluded. Only patients with BPD showed an enhanced P3b also during the inclusion condition, indicating altered processing of social inclusion. The EEG results for the BPD group were consistent with their self-report data. Patients with BPD felt more excluded during the inclusion condition of Cyberball than both HC and patients with SAD. Furthermore, heightened rejection expectancy (subscale of the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire) was associated with a smaller difference in the P3b amplitude between inclusion and exclusion. Results indicate a negatively biased perception of social inclusion in BPD already during the initial stage of social processing.

The brain mechanisms of how on-line sensory-motor processes affect off-line neural self-face representations are unknown. This study used 3D virtual reality to create a 'virtual mirror' in which participants saw an avatar's face moving synchronously with their own face movements. Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis during virtual mirror exposure revealed mu oscillations in sensory-motor cortex signalling on-line congruency between the avatar's and participants' movements. After such exposure and compatible with a change in their off-line self-face representation, participants were more prone to recognize the avatar's face as their own, and this was also reflected in the activation of face-specific regions in the inferotemporal cortex. Further EEG analysis showed that the on-line sensory-motor effects during virtual mirror exposure caused these off-line visual effects, revealing the brain mechanisms that maintain a coherent self-representation, despite our continuously changing appearance.

To define the effect of the color intensity on the human attention, all these colors are tested for two levels of intensity (High-Low). Healthy youth are involved in this study with normal or corrected to normal vision and ensemble averaging is implemented to extract the ERPs from the EEG background noise. The experimental results show a significant effect of the color intensity on the human attention since low responses are captured when the low intensity is presented and P300 responses vary within different color bands. Hence, using proper color combination to design the roads signs may enhance the driver attention and insure a high level of awareness.

DCM addresses observed responses of complex neuronal systems by looking at the neuronal interactions that generate them and how these responses reflect the underlying neurobiology. DCM is a technique for inferring the biophysical properties of cortical sources and their directed connectivity based on distinct neuronal and observation models. The DCM framework uses mathematical formalisms of neural masses, neural fields and mean-fields as forward or generative models for observed neuronal activity. We here consider conductance based neural mass, mean-field and field models-and review their latest technical developments. We use dynamically rich conductance based models to generate responses in laminar-specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models allow for the evaluation of neuronal connections and high-order statistics of neuronal states, using Bayesian estimation and inference. We also discuss recent clinical applications of DCM for convolution based neural mass models, in particular for the study of Parkinson's disease. We present a study of data from Parkinsonian patients, and model the large-scale network changes underlying the pathological excess of beta oscillations that characterise the Parkinsonian state.

Since the start of the millennium the BCI development cycle has undergone a metamorphosis. This is mainly due to the increased popularity of BCI applications in both commercial and research circles. One of the focuses of BCI research is to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial applications using this technology. A vast variety of new approaches are being employed for BCI development ranging from novel paradigms, such as simultaneous acquisitions, through to asynchronous BCI control. The strategic usage of computational techniques, comprising the heart of the BCI system, underwrites this vast range of approaches. This chapter discusses these computational strategies and translational techniques including dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification techniques.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully employed to alleviate symptoms of psychiatric conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome (TS). Common target structures are the NAcc and the ventral anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei (VA/VL) of the thalamus, for OCD and TS, respectively. The feedback related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential associated with feedback processing reflecting posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) activity. Here we report on three cases where we recorded scalp EEG and local field potentials (LFP) from externalized electrodes located in the NAcc or thalamus (VA/VL) while patients engaged in a modified time estimation task, known to engage feedback processing and elicit the FRN. Additionally, scalp EEG were recorded from 29 healthy participants (HP) engaged in the same task. The signal in all structures (pMFC, NAcc, and thalamus) was differently modulated by positive and negative feedback. LFP activity in the NAcc showed a biphasic time course after positive feedback during the FRN time interval. Negative feedback elicited a much weaker and later response. In the thalamus a monophasic modulation was recorded during the FRN time interval. Again, this modulation was more pronounced after positive performance feedback compared to negative feedback. In channels outside the target area no modulation was observed. The surface-FRN was reliably elicited on a group level in HP and showed no significant difference following negative feedback between patients and HP.

The multisensory gain of gamma-band activity between the audiovisual (AV) and auditory-only conditions in different noise environments was analyzed. Videos of face motion articulating words concordant with different levels of pink noise were used as stimuli. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 0, -4, -8, -12 and -16 dB were selected to measure the speech recognition accuracy and EEG activity for 20 healthy subjects. The power and phase of EEG gamma-band oscillations increased in a time window of 50-90 ms. The multisensory gains of evoked and total activity, as well as phase-locking factor, were greatest at the -12 dB SNR, which were consistent with the behavioral result. The multisensory gain of gamma-band activity showed an inverted U-shaped curve as a function of SNR. This finding confirmed the presence of cross-modal stochastic resonance. In addition, there was a significant correlation between evoked activity and phase-locking factor of gamma-band at five different SNRs. Gamma-band oscillation was believed to play a role in the rapid processing and information linkage strengthening of AV modalities in the early stage of cognitive processes.

However, the location of neurologic impairment cannot be determined from SEPs. Previous studies imply that the time-frequency characteristics of SEPs may reflect the location of the spinal cord injury. To validate the hypothesis that time-frequency patterns of SEPs are associated with the location of neurologic deficits in the spinal cord, we studied the time-frequency distributions of SEPs at different injury levels. Twenty-four rats were equally divided into one normal group and three injury groups, in which weight-drop contusions were delivered to the spinal cord of the rats at C4, C5, or C6 level, respectively. By comparing the time-frequency patterns of SEPs across groups, we found significant differences in several time-frequency regions of interest in the time-frequency distributions of the normal group and the injury groups. Importantly, the regions of interest were different across injury groups, suggesting that these regions of interest could be specific to injury locations. The results imply that changes of the time-frequency patterns of SEPs may be related to the location of the spinal cord injury.

The Timing of Regular Sequences: Production, Perception, and Covariation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; TEMPORAL PREDICTABILITY; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR; TIME; BEAT; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; ABILITY	The temporal structure of behavior provides information that allows the tracking of temporal regularity in the sensory and sensorimotor domains. In turn, temporal regularity allows the generation of predictions about upcoming events and to adjust behavior accordingly. These mechanisms are essential to ensure behavior beyond the level of mere reaction. However, efficient temporal processing is required to establish adequate internal representations of temporal structure. The current study used two simple paradigms, namely, finger-tapping at a regular self-chosen rate (spontaneous motor tempo) and ERPs of the EEG (EEG/ERP) recorded during attentive listening to temporally regular and irregular "oddball" sequences to explore the capacity to encode and use temporal regularity in production and perception. The results show that specific aspects of the ability to time a regular sequence of events in production covary with the ability to time a regular sequence in perception, probably pointing toward the engagement of domain-general mechanisms.

Threat modulates neural responses to looming visual stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion; oscillatory responses; time-to-collision; visual-evoked potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MOTION-ONSET VEPS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; CORTICAL RESPONSES; ATTENTION; MEMORY; TIME; SYNCHRONIZATION	Objects on a collision course with an observer produce a specific pattern of optical expansion on the retina known as looming, which in theory exactly specifies the time-to-collision (TTC) of approaching objects. It was recently demonstrated that the affective content of looming stimuli influences perceived TTC, with threatening objects judged as approaching sooner than non-threatening objects. Here, the neural mechanisms by which perceived threat modulates spatiotemporal perception were investigated. Participants judged the TTC of threatening (snakes, spiders) or non-threatening (butterflies, rabbits) stimuli, which expanded in size at a rate indicating one of five TTCs. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and oscillatory neural responses measured with electroencephalography were analysed. The arrival time of threatening stimuli was underestimated compared with non-threatening stimuli, though an interaction suggested that this underestimation was not constant across TTCs. Further, both speed of approach and threat modulated both VEPs and oscillatory responses. Speed of approach modulated the N1 parietal and oscillations in the beta band. Threat modulated several VEP components (P1, N1 frontal, N1 occipital, early posterior negativity and late positive potential) and oscillations in the alpha and high gamma band. The results for the high gamma band suggest an interaction between these two factors. Previous evidence suggests that looming stimuli activate sensorimotor areas, even in the absence of an intended action. The current results show that threat disrupts the synchronization over the sensorimotor areas that are likely activated by the presentation of a looming stimulus.

Though motor symptoms of the disease are often successfully addressed by dopaminergic medication, it still remains unclear, how dopaminergic therapy affects cognitive function. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of dopaminergic medication on visual and auditory attentional processing. 14 PD patients and 13 matched healthy controls performed a three-stimulus auditory and visual oddball task while their EEG was recorded. The patients performed the task twice, once on- and once off-medication. While the results showed no significant differences between PD patients and controls, they did reveal a significant increase in P3 amplitude on- vs. off-medication specific to processing of auditory distractors and no other stimuli. These results indicate significant effect of dopaminergic therapy on processing of distracting auditory stimuli. With a lack of between group differences the effect could reflect either 1) improved recruitment of attentional resources to auditory distractors; 2) reduced ability for cognitive inhibition of auditory distractors; 3) increased response to distractor stimuli resulting in impaired cognitive performance; or 4) hindered ability to discriminate between auditory distractors and targets. Further studies are needed to differentiate between these possibilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study we explored how the brain connectivity changes over the time for face-sensitive processing. We investigated the dynamic functional connectivity in face perception by analyzing time dependent EEG phase synchronization in four different frequency bands: theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz), beta (15-24 Hz), and gamma (25-45 Hz) bands in the early stages of face processing from 30 to 300 ms. High density EEG were recorded from subjects who were passively viewing faces, buildings, and chairs. The dynamic connectivity within the core system and between the extended system were investigated. Significant differences between faces and non-faces mainly appear in theta band connectivity: (1) at the time segment of 90-120 ms between parietal area and occipito-temporal area in the right hemisphere, and (2) at the time segment of 150-180 ms between bilateral occipito-temporal areas. These results indicate (1) the importance of theta-band connectivity in the face-sensitive processing, and (2) that different parts of network are involved for the initial stage of face categorization and the stage of face structural encoding.

Associative learning models postulate that observers pay more attention to stimuli previously experienced as reliable predictors of specific outcomes. To investigate the impact of learning experience on deployment of attention, we combined an associative learning task with a visual search task and measured event-related potentials of the EEG as neural markers of attention deployment. In the learning task, participants categorized stimuli varying in color/shape with only one dimension being predictive of category membership. In the search task, participants searched a shape target while disregarding irrelevant color distractors. Behavioral results showed that color distractors impaired performance to a greater degree when color rather than shape was predictive in the learning task. Neurophysiological results show that the amplified distraction was due to differential attention deployment (N2pc). Experiment 2 showed that when color was predictive for learning, color distractors captured more attention in the search task (ND component) and more suppression of color distractor was required (PD component). The present results thus demonstrate that priority in visual attention is biased toward predictive stimuli, which allows learning experience to shape selection. We also show that learning experience can overrule strong top-down control (blocked tasks, Experiment 3) and that learning experience has a longer-term effect on attention deployment (tasks on two successive days, Experiment 4).

Neural signatures of response planning occur midway through an incoming question in conversation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; TURN-TAKING; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; TASK; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SENTENCES; ATTENTION; RHYTHMS	A striking puzzle about language use in everyday conversation is that turn-taking latencies are usually very short, whereas planning language production takes much longer. This implies overlap between language comprehension and production processes, but the nature and extent of such overlap has never been studied directly. Combining an interactive quiz paradigm with EEG measurements in an innovative way, we show that production planning processes start as soon as possible, that is, within half a second after the answer to a question can be retrieved (up to several seconds before the end of the question). Localization of ERP data shows early activation even of brain areas related to late stages of production planning (e.g., syllabification). Finally, oscillation results suggest an attention switch from comprehension to production around the same time frame. This perspective from interactive language use throws new light on the performance characteristics that language competence involves.

Methods: CAEPs from 16 normal-hearing listeners were recorded using the speech syllable/ba/presented in quiet and speech-shaped noise at signal-to-noise ratios of 10 and 30 dB. The syllable was presented binaurally and monaurally at two presentation rates. Results: The amplitudes of N1 and N2 peaks were often significantly enhanced in the presence of low-level background noise relative to quiet conditions, while P1 and P2 amplitudes were consistently reduced in noise. P1 and P2 amplitudes were significantly larger during binaural compared to monaural presentations, while N1 and N2 peaks were similar between binaural and monaural conditions. Conclusions: Methodological choices impact CAEP peaks in very different ways. Negative peaks can be enhanced by background noise in certain conditions, while positive peaks are generally enhanced by binaural presentations. Significance: Methodological choices significantly impact CAEPs acquired in quiet and in noise. If CAEPs are to be used as a tool to explore signal encoding in noise, scientists must be cognizant of how differences in acquisition and processing protocols selectively shape CAEP responses.

Effects of Feedback Latency on P300-based Brain-computer Interface	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Feedback has been shown to affect performance when using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on sensorimotor rhythms. In contrast, little is known about the influence of feedback on P300-based BCIs. There is still an open question whether feedback affects the regulation of P300 and consequently the operation of P300-based BCIs. In this paper, for the first time, the influence of feedback on the P300-based BCI speller task is systematically assessed. For this purpose, 24 healthy participants performed the classic P300-based BCI speller task, while only half of them received feedback. Importantly, the number of flashes per letter was reduced on a regular basis in order to increase the frequency of providing feedback. Experimental results showed that feedback could significantly improve the P300-based BCI speller performance, if it was provided in short time intervals (e.g. in sequences as short as 4 to 6 flashes per row/column). Moreover, our offline analysis showed that providing feedback remarkably enhanced the relevant ERP patterns and attenuated the irrelevant ERP patterns, such that the discrimination between target and nontarget EEG trials increased.

The present study aimed to provide evidence about the role of prominence information for the incremental interpretation of arguments in Spanish. We investigated the time course of neural correlates associated to the comprehension of sentences that require a reversal of argument prominence hierarchization. We also studied how the amount of available prominence information may affect the incremental build-up of verbal expectations. Results of the ERP data revealed that at the disambiguating verb region, object-initial sentences (only one argument available) elicited a centro-parietal negativity with a peak at 400 ms post-onset. Subject-initial sentences (two arguments available) yielded a broadly distributed positivity at around 650 ms. This dissociation suggests that argument interpretation may depend on their morphosyntactic features, and also on the amount of prominence information available before the verb is encountered.

Temporal Expectation and Attention Jointly Modulate Auditory Oscillatory Activity in the Beta Band	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DATA	The neural response to a stimulus is influenced by endogenous factors such as expectation and attention. Current research suggests that expectation and attention exert their effects in opposite directions, where expectation decreases neural activity in sensory areas, while attention increases it. However, expectation and attention are usually studied either in isolation or confounded with each other. A recent study suggests that expectation and attention may act jointly on sensory processing, by increasing the neural response to expected events when they are attended, but decreasing it when they are unattended. Here we test this hypothesis in an auditory temporal cueing paradigm using magnetoencephalography in humans. In our study participants attended to, or away from, tones that could arrive at expected or unexpected moments. We found a decrease in auditory beta band synchrony to expected (versus unexpected) tones if they were unattended, but no difference if they were attended. Modulations in beta power were already evident prior to the expected onset times of the tones. These findings suggest that expectation and attention jointly modulate sensory processing.

The integrated approach was developed and used for the ERPs analysis. It includes the modeling of the distributed intracranial dipole sources of the ERPs' components by the weighted Minimum Norm Estimates (wMNE) method, the combination of distributed intracranial dipole sources with the MRI data and the statistical analysis of the current density. It was shown that a multiple network of brain structures was active during the early stage of analysis of line orientation. It includes not only primary striate visual area, but also the parietal, temporal and prefrontal corticies. The new data was obtained about the participation of structures, responsible for navigation (parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal area) in the line orientation detection. For the first time the gender-related differences in the organization of the line detection network were described. The obtained data provides a significant supplement to the knowledge of the mechanisms of the orientation sensitivity and assumes that orientation sensitivity plays an important role in the navigation.

In this study, a group of late learners of Spanish whose native language is English and a group of Spanish monolinguals were compared while they read sentences, some of which contained syntactic violations. A brain complex network analysis approach was used to assess the time-varying topological properties of the functional networks extracted from the electro-encephalography (EEG) recording. Late L2 learners showed a lower degree of parallel information transfer and a slower propagation between regions of the brain functional networks while processing sentences containing a gender mismatch condition as compared with a standard sentence configuration. In contrast, no such differences between these conditions were detected in the Spanish monolinguals. This indicates that when a morphosyntactic language incongruence that does not exist in the native language is presented in the second language, the neural activation pattern is configured differently in highly proficient late bilinguals than in monolinguals.

However, previous reports were based on across-trial averaging of LEP responses at the expense of losing information about intertrial variability related to attentional modulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of somatosensory spatial attention on single-trial parameters (i.e., amplitudes, latencies, and latency jitter) of LEP components (N2 and P2). Twelve subjects participated in a sustained spatial attention paradigm while noxious laser stimuli (left hand) and noxious electrical stimuli (right hand) were sequentially delivered to the dorsum of the respective hand with nonnoxious air puffs randomly interspersed within the sequence of noxious stimuli. Participants were instructed to mentally count all stimuli (i.e., noxious and nonnoxious) applied to the attended location. Laser stimuli, presented to the attended hand (ALS), elicited larger single-trial amplitudes of the N2 component compared with unattended laser stimuli (ULS). In contrast, single-trial amplitudes of the P2 component were not significantly affected by spatial attention. Single-trial latencies of the N2 and P2 were significantly smaller for ALS vs. ULS. Additionally, the across-trial latency jitter of the N2 component was reduced for ALS. Conversely, the latency jitter of the P2 component was smaller for ULS compared with ALS. With the use of single-trial analysis, the study provided new insights into brain dynamics of LEPs related to spatial attention. Our results indicate that single-trial parameters of LEP components are differentially modulated by spatial attention.	[Franz, Marcel; Ritter, Alexander; Miltner, Wolfgang H.

One common payoff procedure in multiple lottery choice tasks is the random payoff mechanism. This mechanism provides incentives for a truthful response in every single choice task since every decision should be treated as independent from other decisions. A second, often used payoff procedure is to realize all decision. Since all decisions are determining the final reward, subjects are not incentivized to treat their decisions independently. The difference in risk behavior between both payoff procedures is known as the portfolio effect. In our study, we address the question how these two payoff mechanisms differ in their evaluation process since the portfolio effect is caused by a divergence in the independent valuation of a choice task. Evaluation processes occur before observable behavior takes place and can be assigned to cognitive control mechanisms. In order to reveal such processes, we performed an EEG paradigm comprising two sessions with an identical lottery choice task design, but different payoff procedures. We focused on the stimulus-locked N200 component, an event-related potential closely related to cognitive control processes. Our behavioral data show differences between both payoff mechanisms which can be assigned to a portfolio effect. The analysis of the event-related potentials reveals a characteristic pattern of the N200 amplitude between choices inside and outside an area of indifference. Choices inside the indifference area evoke higher N200 amplitudes which can be attributed to a higher action control conflict when subjects are indecisive. Furthermore, a higher N200 amplitude is present for risky outside the indifference area choices when all decision are paid out. This is contrary to the random payoff mechanism in which an increased N200 is absent. This implies that more resources are allocated in a portfolio choice task when lotteries are chosen. Risky portfolio choices seem to involve additional choice criteria such as the relevance of previous decisions. As a consequence, a potential portfolio effect has to be related to a non-independent choice task evaluation solely in risky portfolio choices.

If the data is not natively represented in the form of SPD matrices, typically we may summarize them in such form by estimating covariance matrices of the data. However once we manipulate such covariance matrices on the Riemannian manifold we lose the representation in the original data space. For instance, we can evaluate the geometric mean of a set of covariance matrices, but not the geometric mean of the data generating the covariance matrices, the space of interest in which the geometric mean can be interpreted. As a consequence, Riemannian information geometry is often perceived by non-experts as a "black-box" tool and this perception prevents a wider adoption in the scientific community. Hereby we show that we can overcome this limitation by constructing a special form of SPD matrix embedding both the covariance structure of the data and the data itself. Incidentally, whenever the original data can be represented in the form of a generic data matrix (not even square), this special SPD matrix enables an exhaustive and unique description of the data up to second-order statistics. This is achieved embedding the covariance structure of both the rows and columns of the data matrix, allowing naturally a wide range of possible applications and bringing us over and above just an interpretability issue. We demonstrate the method by manipulating satellite images (pansharpening) and event-related potentials (ERPs) of an electroencephalography brain-computer interface (BCI) study. The first example illustrates the effect of moving along geodesics in the original data space and the second provides a novel estimation of ERP average (geometric mean), showing that, in contrast to the usual arithmetic mean, this estimation is robust to outliers. In conclusion, we are able to show that the Riemannian concepts of distance, geometric mean, moving along a geodesic, etc. can be readily transposed into a generic data space, whatever this data space represents.

PVS can be hard to distinguish from a state of minimal preserved consciousness ("minimally conscious state," MCS); the rate of misdiagnosis is high and has been estimated at 37-43%. In contrast, PVS is easily distinguished from brain death. We discuss the various diagnostic techniques that can be used to determine whether a patient is minimally conscious or in a persistent vegetative state. Methods: This article is based on a systematic review of pertinent literature and on a quantitative meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic methods for the minimally conscious state. Results: We identified and evaluated 20 clinical studies involving a total of 906 patients with either PVS or MCS. The reported sensitivities and specificities of the various techniques used to diagnose MCS vary widely. The sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI-based techniques are 44% and 67%, respectively (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of 19%-72% and 55%-77%); those of quantitative EEG are 90% and 80%, respectively (95% CI, 69%-97% and 66%-90%). EEG, event-related potentials, and imaging studies can also aid in prognostication. Contrary to prior assumptions, 10% to 24% of patients in PVS can regain consciousness, sometimes years after the event, but only with marked functional impairment. Conclusions: The basic diagnostic evaluation for differentiating PVS from MCS consists of a standardized clinical examination. In the future, modern diagnostic techniques may help identify patients who are in a subclinical minimally conscious state.

In awake rats, the occurrence of an OFF period in a brain area relevant for behavior results in performance errors. Here we investigated the potential relationship between local sleep events and negative behavioral outcomes in humans. Volunteers participated in two prolonged wakefulness experiments (24 h), each including 12 h of practice with either a driving simulation (DS) game or a battery of tasks based on executive functions (EFs). Multiple high-density EEG recordings were obtained during each experiment, both in quiet rest conditions and during execution of two behavioral tests, a response inhibition test and a motor test, aimed at assessing changes in impulse control and visuomotor performance, respectively. In addition, fMRI examinations obtained at 12 h intervals were used to investigate changes in inter-regional connectivity. The EF experiment was associated with a reduced efficiency in impulse control, whereas DS led to a relative impairment in visuomotor control. A specific spatial and temporal correlation was observed between EEG theta waves occurring in task-related areas and deterioration of behavioral performance. The fMRI connectivity analysis indicated that performance impairment might partially depend on a breakdown in connectivity determined by a "network overload." Present results demonstrate the existence of an association between theta waves during wakefulness and performance errors and may contribute explaining behavioral impairments under conditions of sleep deprivation/restriction.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show an elevated grip force in dynamic object handling, but temporal aspects of anticipatory grip force control are relatively preserved. In PD patients, beta frequency oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is suppressed prior to externally paced movements. However, the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anticipatory grip force control is not known. Methods: After implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the STN, PD patients performed adaptive and voluntary grip force tasks, while we recorded subthalamic local field potentials (LFP) and scalp EEG. Results: During adaptive grip force control (Shake), we found event related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band, which was time-locked to the grip force. In contrast, during voluntary grip force control (Press) we recorded a biphasic ERD, corresponding to peak grip force and grip force release. Beta synchronization between STN and cortical EEG was reduced during adaptive grip force control. Conclusion: The time-locked suppression of beta oscillatory activity in the STN is in linewith previous reports of beta ERD prior to voluntarymovements. Our results show that the STN is involved in anticipatory grip force control in PD patients. The difference in the phasic beta ERD between the two tasks and the reduction of cortico-subthalamic synchronization suggests that qualitatively different neuronal network states are involved in different grip force control tasks.

The N170 observed 'in the wild': robust event-related potentials to faces in cluttered dynamic visual scenes	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						faces; EEG; N170	INTERSTIMULUS PERCEPTUAL VARIANCE; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SENSITIVE N170; HUMAN BRAIN; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; ACCOUNT; GAZE	As a social species in a constantly changing environment, humans rely heavily on the informational richness and communicative capacity of the face. Thus, understanding how the brain processes information about faces in real-time is of paramount importance. The N170 is a high-temporal resolution electrophysiological index of the brain's early response to visual stimuli that is reliably elicited in carefully controlled laboratory-based studies. Although the N170 has often been reported to be of greatest amplitude to faces, there has been debate regarding whether this effect might be an artefact of certain aspects of the controlled experimental stimulation schedules and materials. To investigate whether the N170 can be identified in more realistic conditions with highly variable and cluttered visual images and accompanying auditory stimuli we recorded EEG 'in the wild', while participants watched pop videos. Scene-cuts to faces generated a clear N170 response, and this was larger than the N170 to transitions where the videos cut to non-face stimuli. Within participants, wild-type face N170 amplitudes were moderately correlated to those observed in a typical laboratory experiment. Thus, we demonstrate that the face N170 is a robust and ecologically valid phenomenon and not an artefact arising as an unintended consequence of some property of the more typical laboratory paradigm.

We tested the hypothesis that social interaction impairments in people with schizophrenia are related to alterations in the predictions of others' behavior and explored their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. METHODS: Electroencephalography was performed in 20 patients with schizophrenia and 25 well-matched control subjects. Participants played as proposers in the repeated version of the Ultimatum Game believing that they were playing with another human or with a computer. The power of oscillatory brain activity was obtained by means of the wavelet transform. We performed a trial-by-trial correlation between the oscillatory activity and the risk of the offer. RESULTS: Control subjects adapted their offers when playing with computers and tended to maintain their offers when playing with humans, as such revealing learning and bargaining strategies, respectively. People with schizophrenia presented the opposite pattern of behavior in both games. During the anticipation of others' responses, the power of alpha oscillations correlated with the risk of the offers made, in a different way in both games. Patients with schizophrenia presented a greater correlation in computer games than in human games; control subjects showed the opposite pattern. The alpha activity correlated with positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an alteration in social interaction in patients with schizophrenia that is related to oscillatory brain activity, suggesting maladjustment of expectation when patients face social and nonsocial agents. This alteration is related to psychotic symptoms and could guide further therapies for improving social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

It is a contributing factor in 30.5% of injury-related deaths among civilians. Additionally, since 2000, more than 260,000 service members were diagnosed with TBI, with the vast majority classified as mild or concussive (76%). The objective assessment of TBI via imaging is a critical research gap, both in the military and civilian communities. In 2011, the Department of Defense (DoD) prepared a congressional report summarizing the effectiveness of seven neuroimaging modalities (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], transcranial Doppler [TCD], positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, electrophysiologic techniques [magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography], and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) to assess the spectrum of TBI from concussion to coma. For this report, neuroimaging experts identified the most relevant peer-reviewed publications and assessed the quality of the literature for each of these imaging technique in the clinical and research settings. Although CT, MRI, and TCD were determined to be the most useful modalities in the clinical setting, no single imaging modality proved sufficient for all patients due to the heterogeneity of TBI. All imaging modalities reviewed demonstrated the potential to emerge as part of future clinical care. This paper describes and updates the results of the DoD report and also expands on the use of angiography in patients with TBI.

BCIs have been studied and developed as one of the important means for communication-aid between disabled with severe motor disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy patients and their caregivers. State-of-art BCIs have achieved the outstanding performance in information transfer rate and classification accuracy. However, most of conventional BCIs are still unavailable for patients with impaired oculomotor control due to requirement of visual modality. The present study aimed at developing a novel 2-class BCI which was independent of oculomotor control including eye-opening using event-related modulation of steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) associated with mental tasks under eyes-closed condition. Eleven healthy subjects aged 21-24 years old were recruited and directed to perform each of two mental tasks under an eyes-closed condition; mental focus on flicker stimuli and image recall of their favorite animals, respectively. The magnitudes of SSVEP in the posterior regions of almost all the subjects were seen to be modulated by performing the mental tasks under the conditions of the flickering frequency of 10 Hz and stimulus intensity of 3-5 lx, which was used to express a user's binary intent, namely, performing one of the mental tasks or not (rest). The classification performance on the mental focus, 80 %, was larger than that on the image recall, 75 %, in average across all the subjects. Shortening of the data length used for classification would improve the information transfer rate of the proposed BCI.

Influence of Physical Activity on Human Sensory Long-Term Potentiation	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF); Synaptic plasticity; Physical activity; Visual evoked potential; EEG; ERP	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; LTP-LIKE CHANGES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; OLDER-ADULTS; VOLUNTARY EXERCISE; AEROBIC EXERCISE	A growing body of literature has explored the influence of physical activity on brain structure and function. While the mechanisms of this relationship remain largely speculative, recent research suggests that one of the effects of physical exercise is an increase in synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). This has not yet been explored directly in humans due to the difficulty of measuring LTP non-invasively. However, we have previously established that LTP-like changes in visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) can be measured in humans. Here, we investigated whether physical fitness status affects the degree of visual sensory LTP. Using a self-report measure of physical activity, participants were split into two groups: a high-activity group, and a low-activity group. LTP was measured and compared between the two groups using the previously established electroencephalography-LTP paradigm, which assesses the degree to which the N1b component of the VEP elicited by a sine grating is potentiated (enhanced) following a rapid "tetanic" presentation of that grating. Both groups demonstrated increased negativity in the amplitude of the N1b component of the VEP immediately after presentation of the visual "tetanus," indicating potentiation. However, after a 30-min rest period, the N1b for the high-activity group remained potentiated while the N1b for the low-activity group returned to baseline. This study presents the first evidence for the impact of self-reported levels of physical activity on LTP in humans, and sheds light on potential neurological mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical fitness and cognition.

However, due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SEPs are generally measured using ensemble averaging across hundreds of trials, thus unavoidably producing a tardiness of SEPs to the potential damages caused by surgical maneuvers and a loss of dynamical information of cortical processing related to somatosensory inputs. Here, we aimed to enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs using Kalman filtering and time-frequency multiple linear regression (TF-MLR) and measure their single-trial parameters, both in the time domain and in the time-frequency domain. We first showed that, Kalman filtering and TF-MLR can effectively capture the single-trial SEP responses and provide accurate estimates of single- trial SEP parameters in the time domain and time-frequency domain, respectively. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between the stimulus intensity and a set of indicative single- trial SEP parameters, including the correlation coefficient (between each single-trial SEPs and their average), P37 amplitude, N45 amplitude, P37-N45 amplitude, and phase value (at the zero-crossing points between P37 and N45). Finally, based on each indicative single-trial SEP parameter, we investigated the minimum number of trials required on a single-trial basis to suggest the existence of SEP responses, thus providing important information for fast SEP extraction in intraoperative monitoring.

Early diagnosis of the subtypes is very challenging particularly in adolescence. In this study, 38 adolescents are participated including 18 patients with BD I and 20 patients with BD II. The electroencephalogram signal is recorded by 19 electrodes in open eyes at resting state. After preprocessing, the state of the art methods from various domains are implemented to provide a good feature set for classifying the two groups. In order to improve the classification accuracy, four different feature selection methods named mutual information maximization (MIM), conditional mutual information maximization (CMIM), fast correlation based filter (FCBF), and double input symmetrical relevance (DISR) are applied to select the most informative features. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with a hidden layer containing five neurons is used for classification with and without applying the feature selection methods. The accuracy of 82.68, 86.33, 89.67, 84.61, and 91.83 % were observed using entire extracted features and selected features using MIM, CMIM, FCBF, and DISR methods by MLP, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method can be used in clinical setting for more validation.

Event-related brain potentials to change in the frequency and temporal structure of sounds in typically developing 5-6-year-old children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing; EEG; Mismatch negativity (MMN); Late discriminative negativity (LDN); N250; T-complex	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ACOUSTIC CHANGE COMPLEX; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; N1 WAVE; MATURATION; INTEGRATION; STIMULI	The brain's ability to recognize different acoustic cues (e.g., frequency changes in rapid temporal succession) is important for speech perception and thus for successful language development. Here we report on distinct event-related potentials (ERPs) in 5-6-year-old children recorded in a passive oddball paradigm to repeated tone pair stimuli with a frequency change in the second tone in the pair, replicating earlier findings. An occasional insertion of a third tone within the tone pair generated a more merged pattern, which has not been reported previously in 5-6-year-old children. Both types of deviations elicited pre-attentive discriminative mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity (LDN) responses. Temporal principal component analysis (tPCA) showed a similar topographical pattern with fronto-central negativity for MMN and LDN. We also found a previously unreported discriminative response complex (P340-N440) at the temporal electrode sites at about 140 ms and 240 ms after the frequency deviance, which we suggest reflects a discriminative processing of frequency change. The P340 response was positive with a clear radial distribution preceding the fronto-central frequency MMN by about 30 ms. The results indicate that 5-6-year-old children can detect frequency change and the occasional insertion of an additional tone in sound pairs as reflected by MMN and LDN, even with quite short within-stimulus intervals (150 ms and 50 ms). Furthermore, MMN for these changes is preceded by another response to deviancy, temporal P340, which seems to reflect a parallel but earlier discriminatory process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Reactivity was operationalized as the impact of emotional pictures on the self-reported ongoing affective state. It was used to divide the subjects into high-and low-responders groups. Independent sources of brain activity were identified, localized with the DIPFIT method, and clustered across subjects to analyse the visual evoked potentials to affective pictures. Four of the identified clusters revealed effects of reactivity. The earliest two started about 120 ms from the stimulus onset and were located in the occipital lobe and the right temporoparietal junction. Another two with a latency of 200 ms were found in the orbitofrontal and the right dorsolateral cortices. Additionally, differences in pre-stimulus alpha level over the visual cortex were observed between the groups. The attentional modulation of perceptual processes is proposed as an early source of emotional reactivity, which forms an automatic mechanism of affective control. The role of top-down processes in affective appraisal and, finally, the experience of ongoing emotional states is also discussed.

If the system has two states, say state (good) and state 2 (bad), we need to infer which state the system is, by classifying the collected time-series signals. To make this work efficiently, it is important to search the least number of probes that would give best classification result. It is a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed approach works in two steps. We start with a large number of probes. As the first step, we cluster the time-series signals. and choose a representative one from each cluster. Next, we run pareto GA to select the smallest set of probes (from cluster representatives), that would give the highest classification result. Depending on the nature of the signals, and the target application, appropriate signal-features, clustering and classification algorithms will be different, but the basic principle is applicable to any system. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of our algorithm with EEG signals, to detect the presence or absence of ERP 300. Improved results with less number of probes compared with previous works validated the approach.

They have been widely claimed to be the neurological correlates of semantic and syntactic anomalies, respectively, but evidence accumulated over the last decade has raised some serious doubts about that interpretation. In this paper, I first review some of this evidence and then present an alternative way to think about the issue. My suggestion is built on Shannon's concept of noisy-channel decoding by tables of typical sets, and it is thus fundamentally statistical in nature. I show that a proper application of Shannon's concepts to the reading process provides an interesting reinterpretation of our notion of "syntax," thus questioning some fundamental assumptions of linguistics.

Here, we tested for the first time whether verbal cueing during sleep can improve vocabulary learning. We cued prior learned Dutch words either during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) or during active or passive waking. Re-exposure to Dutch words during sleep improved later memory for the German translation of the cued words when compared with uncued words. Recall of uncued words was similar to an additional group receiving no verbal cues during sleep. Furthermore, verbal cueing failed to improve memory during active and passive waking. High-density electroencephalographic recordings revealed that successful verbal cueing during NonREM sleep is associated with a pronounced frontal negativity in eventrelated potentials, a higher frequency of frontal slow waves as well as a cueing-related increase in right frontal and left parietal oscillatory theta power. Our results indicate that verbal cues presented during NonREM sleep reactivate associated memories, and facilitate later recall of foreign vocabulary without impairing ongoing consolidation processes. Likewise, our oscillatory analysis suggests that both sleep-specific slow waves as well as theta oscillations (typically associated with successful memory encoding during wakefulness) might be involved in strengthening memories by cueing during sleep.

Accordingly, the present study addressed the moderating role of emotional intensity in two regulatory stages-implementation (during regulation) and pre-implementation (prior to regulation), of two major cognitive regulatory strategies-distraction and reappraisal. According to our framework, because distraction implementation involves early attentional disengagement from emotional information before it gathers force, in high-intensity it should be more effective in the short-term, relative to reappraisal, which modulates emotional processing only at a late semantic meaning phase. Supporting findings showed that in high (but not low) intensity, distraction implementation resulted in stronger modulation of negative experience, reduced neural emotional processing (centro-parietal late positive potential, LPP), with suggestive evidence for less cognitive effort (frontal-LPP), relative to reappraisal. Related pre-implementation findings confirmed that anticipating regulation of high-intensity stimuli resulted in distraction (over reappraisal) preference. In contrast, anticipating regulation of low-intensity stimuli resulted in reappraisal (over distraction) preference, which is most beneficial for long-term adaptation. Furthermore, anticipating cognitively demanding regulation, either in cases of regulating counter to these preferences or via the more effortful strategy of reappraisal, enhanced neural attentional resource allocation (Stimulus Preceding Negativity).

In this study, we examined the relationship between interindividual variation of H-1-MRS-measured glutamate+glutamine (Glx) in the superior temporal gyrus and MMN for duration and frequency deviants in 19 healthy young adults (9 male). We found a significant relationship between the peak latency of the duration-MMN peak and creatine-scaled Glx (p=.0003, (2)=.43), with increased Glx level being associated to earlier peak of the duration-MMN (r=-.63). In contrast, the amplitude of the duration-MMN was not related to Glx. There was no significant relationship between Glx and the frequency-MMN. The present study is the first to demonstrate that interindividual variation in the glutamatergic neurotransmission affects the MMN response in healthy individuals.

Sighted individuals are thought to encode touch in both coordinate systems concurrently, whereas congenitally blind individuals exhibit a strong bias for using anatomical coordinates. We investigated the neural correlates of this differential dominance in the use of anatomical and external reference frames by assessing oscillatory brain activity during a tactile spatial attention task. The EEG was recorded while sighted and congenitally blind adults received tactile stimulation to uncrossed and crossed hands while detecting rare tactile targets at one cued hand only. In the sighted group, oscillatory alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz) in the cue-target interval was reduced contralaterally and enhanced ipsilaterally with uncrossed hands. Hand crossing attenuated the degree of posterior parietal alpha-band lateralization, indicating that attention deployment was affected by external spatial coordinates. Beamforming suggested that this posture effect originated in the posterior parietal cortex. In contrast, cue-related lateralization of central alpha-band as well as of beta-band activity (16-24 Hz) were unaffected by hand crossing, suggesting that these oscillations exclusively encode anatomical coordinates. In the blind group, central alpha-band activity was lateralized, but did not change across postures. The pattern of beta-band activity was indistinguishable between groups. Because the neural mechanisms for posterior alpha-band generation seem to be linked to developmental vision, we speculate that the lack of this neural mechanism in blind individuals is related to their preferred use of anatomical over external spatial codes in sensory processing.

J	Bagattini, C; Mazzi, C; Savazzi, S				Bagattini, Chiara; Mazzi, Chiara; Savazzi, Silvia			Waves of awareness for occipital and parietal phosphenes perception	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Dorsal stream; Ventral stream; Primary visual cortex; TMS-evoked potentials; EEG	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; TEST SCORE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; ACTIVATION; BLINDSIGHT; BRAIN; CONFIDENCE	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the occipital cortex is known to induce visual sensations, i.e. phosphenes, which appear as flashes of light in the absence of an external stimulus. Recent studies have shown that TMS can produce phosphenes also when the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is stimulated. The main question addressed in this paper is whether parietal phosphenes are generated directly by local mechanisms or emerge through indirect activation of other visual areas. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded while stimulating left occipital or parietal cortices inducing phosphene perception in healthy participants and in a hemianopic patient who suffered from complete destruction of the early visual cortex of the left hemisphere. Results in healthy participants showed that the onset of phosphene perception induced by occipital TMS correlated with differential cortical activity in temporal sites while the onset of phosphene perception induced by parietal TMS correlated with differential cortical activity in the stimulated parietal site. Moreover, IPS-TMS of the lesioned hemisphere of the hemianopic patient with a complete lesion to V1 showed again that the onset of phosphene perception correlated with differential cortical activity in the stimulated parietal site. The present data seem thus to suggest that temporal and parietal cortices can serve as different local early gatekeepers of perceptual awareness and that activity in the occipital cortex, although being relevant for perception in general, is not part of the neural bases of the perceptual awareness of phosphenes.

A good balance between bottom-up (attentional capture by unexpected salient stimuli) and top-down (selection of relevant information) mechanisms is crucial to be both task-efficient and aware of our environment. Only few studies have explored how an isolated unexpected task-irrelevant stimulus outside the attention focus can disturb the top-down attention mechanisms necessary to the good performance of the ongoing task, and how these top-down mechanisms can modulate the bottom-up mechanisms of attentional capture triggered by an unexpected event. We recorded scalp electroencephalography in 18 young adults performing a new paradigm measuring distractibility and assessing both bottom-up and top-down attention mechanisms, at the same time. Increasing task load in top-down attention was found to reduce early processing of the distracting sound, but not bottom-up attentional capture mechanisms nor the behavioral distraction cost in reaction time. Moreover, the impact of bottom-up attentional capture by distracting sounds on target processing was revealed as a delayed latency of the N100 sensory response to target sounds mirroring increased reaction times. These results provide crucial information into how bottom-up and top-down mechanisms dynamically interact and compete in the human brain, i.e. on the precarious balance between voluntary attention and distraction.

However in many cognitive and clinical applications, taking into account their variability across trials has turned out to be statistically more sensitive than comparing their means. New method: In this study we present a novel implementation of a single-trial topographic analysis (STTA) for discriminating auditory evoked potentials at predefined time-windows. This analysis has been previously introduced for extracting spatio-temporal features at the level of the whole neural response. Adapting the STTA on specific time windows is an essential step for comparing its performance to other time-window based algorithms. Results: We analyzed responses to standard vs. deviant sounds and showed that the new implementation of the STTA gives above-chance decoding results in all subjects (in comparison to 7 out of 11 with the original method). In comatose patients, the improvement of the decoding performance was even more pronounced than in healthy controls and doubled the number of significant results. Comparison with existing method(s): We compared the results obtained with the new STTA to those based on a logistic regression in healthy controls and patients. We showed that the first of these two comparisons provided a better performance of the logistic regression; however only the new STTA provided significant results in comatose patients at group level. Conclusions: Our results provide quantitative evidence that a systematic investigation of the accuracy of established methods in normal and clinical population is an essential step for optimizing decoding performance.

Our goal was to develop a method that can overcome these barriers by optimizing EEG electrode number and placement for P300 studies within a population of subjects. Methods: A Gibbs sampling method was developed to find the optimal electrode configuration given a set of P300 speller data. The method was tested on a set of data from 15 healthy subjects using an established 32-electrode pattern. Resulting electrode configurations were then validated using online prospective testing with a naive Bayes classifier in 15 additional healthy subjects. Results: The method yielded a set of four posterior electrodes (PO8, PO7, POZ, CPZ), which produced results that are likely sufficient to be clinically effective. In online prospective validation testing, no significant difference was found between subjects' performances using the reduced and the full electrode configurations. Conclusions: The proposed method can find reduced sets of electrodes within a subject population without reducing performance.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERCEPTUAL LOAD; LATE ND; DISTRACTION PARADIGM; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TARGET DETECTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; OLDER-ADULTS; TIME-COURSE; DUAL-TASK; MEMORY	An analysis of airplane accidents reveals that pilots sometimes purely fail to react to critical auditory alerts. This inability of an auditory stimulus to reach consciousness has been coined under the term of inattentional deafness. Recent data from literature tends to show that tasks involving high cognitive load consume most of the attentional capacities, leaving little or none remaining for processing any unexpected information. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence for a shared attentional capacity between vision and hearing. In this context, the abundant information in modern cockpits is likely to produce inattentional deafness. We investigated this hypothesis by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements with an ecological aviation task performed under contextual variation of the cognitive load (high or low), including an alarm detection task. Two different audio tones were played: standard tones and deviant tones. Participants were instructed to ignore standard tones and to report deviant tones using a response pad. More than 31% of the deviant tones were not detected in the high load condition. Analysis of the EEG measurements showed a drastic diminution of the auditory P300 amplitude concomitant with this behavioral effect, whereas the N100 component was not affected. We suggest that these behavioral and electrophysiological results provide new insights on explaining the trend of pilots' failure to react to critical auditory information. Relevant applications concern prevention of alarms omission, mental workload measurements and enhanced warning designs.

Electrophysiological activity was recorded in the baseline state and for 3 odors, lemon, peppermint, and vanilla, in 16 healthy participants. Electrodes were separated into groups according to the spatial position on the head. Fast Fourier transformation was performed on every set, and mean value of activity in theta was exported. As theta showed statistically significant results, further analysis was based only on the theta frequency band. On electrodes FP1, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8, TP9, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, PO9, and PO10 there was statistically significant difference in the electrical activity of the brain between four conditions. For peppermint and lemon, there was statistically significant difference in activity between different regionsF(1.576, 23.637) = 16.030, P = .000 and F(1.362, 20.425) = 4.54, P = .035, respectivelywhere the activity in the central area was significantly reduced compared with the activity in the other 4 areas and in the left and right anterior and left posterior area, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference for vanilla between specific areas, F(1.217, 18.257) = 1.155, P = .309. The results indicate that olfactory stimuli can affect the frequency characteristics of the electrical activity of the brain.

Early and Late Electrophysiological Effects of Distractor Frequency in Picture Naming: Reconciling Input and Output Accounts	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORD INTERFERENCE EVIDENCE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SEMANTIC INTERFERENCE; TEMPORAL SIGNATURES; LEXICAL SELECTION; ERROR NEGATIVITY; TIME-COURSE; STROOP; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION	The "distractor-frequency effect" refers to the finding that high-frequency (HF) distractor words slow picture naming less than low-frequency distractors in the picture-word interference paradigm. Rival input and output accounts of this effect have been proposed. The former attributes the effect to attentional selection mechanisms operating during distractor recognition, whereas the latter attributes it to monitoring/decision mechanisms operating on distractor and target responses in an articulatory buffer. Using high-density (128-channel) EEG, we tested hypotheses from these rival accounts. In addition to conducting stimulus-and response-locked whole-brain corrected analyses, we investigated the correct-related negativity, an ERP observed on correct trials at fronto-central electrodes proposed to reflect the involvement of domain general monitoring. The whole-brain ERP analysis revealed a significant effect of distractor frequency at inferior right frontal and temporal sites between 100 and 300-msec post-stimulus onset, during which lexical access is thought to occur. Response-locked, region of interest (ROI) analyses of fronto-central electrodes revealed a correct-related negativity starting 121 msec before and peaking 125 msec after vocal onset on the grand averages. Slope analysis of this component revealed a significant difference between HF and low-frequency distractor words, with the former associated with a steeper slope on the time window spanning from 100 msec before to 100 msec after vocal onset. The finding of ERP effects in time windows and components corresponding to both lexical processing and monitoring suggests the distractor frequency effect is most likely associated with more than one physiological mechanism.

Improving response inhibition systems in frontotemporal dementia with citalopram	BRAIN			English	Article						frontotemporal dementia; citalopram; magnetoencephalography; response inhibition; voxel-based morphometry	FRONTAL ASSESSMENT BATTERY; SEROTONIN DEPLETION IMPAIRS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BEHAVIORAL VARIANT; GO/NO-GO; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; STOP-SIGNAL; TRYPTOPHAN-DEPLETION; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONCENTRATIONS	Disinhibition is a cardinal feature of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia, presenting as impulsive and impetuous behaviours that are often difficult to manage. The options for symptomatic treatments are limited, but a potential target for therapy is the restoration of serotonergic function, which is both deficient in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and closely associated with inhibitory control. Based on preclinical studies and psychopharmacological interventions in other disorders, we predicted that inhibition would be associated with the right inferior frontal gyrus and dependent on serotonin. Using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography of a Go-NoGo paradigm, we investigated the neural basis of behavioural disinhibition in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition on the neural systems for response inhibition. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover design study, 12 patients received either a single 30 mg dose of citalopram or placebo. Twenty age-matched healthy controls underwent the same magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography protocol on one session without citalopram, providing normative data for this task. In the control group, successful NoGo trials evoked two established indices of successful response inhibition: the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3. Both of these components were significantly attenuated by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Cortical sources associated with successful inhibition in control subjects were identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal lobe, which have been strongly associated with behavioural inhibition in imaging and lesion studies. These sources were impaired by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Critically, citalopram enhanced the NoGo-P3 signal in patients, relative to placebo treatment, and increased the evoked response in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Voxel-based morphometry confirmed significant atrophy of inferior frontal gyrus, alongside insular, orbitofrontal and temporal cortex in our patient cohort. Together, these data suggest that the dysfunctional prefrontal cortical systems underlying response inhibition deficits in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia can be partially restored by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission. The results support a translational neuroscience approach to impulsive neurological disorders and indicate the potential for symptomatic treatment of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia including serotonergic strategies to improve disinhibition.

Repetition enhancement and memory effects for duration	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Time perception; Repetition enhancement; Decision making; Carryover effects; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; TEMPORAL INTERVALS; DECISION-PROCESSES; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; TIME; DISCRIMINATION; PERCEPTION	A remarkable aspect of conscious perception is that moments carryover from one to the next, also known as temporal continuity. This ability is thus crucial for detecting regularities, such as in speech and music, and may rely on an accurate perception of time. Investigations of human time perception have detailed two electroencephalographic (EEG) components associated with timing, the contingent negative variation (CNV) and late positive component of timing (LPCt); however, the precise roles of these components in timing remain elusive. Recently, we demonstrated that the perception of duration is influenced by durations presented on prior trials, which we explained by the creation of an implicit memory standard that adapts to local changes in sequence presentation. Here, we turn to the neural basis of this effect. Human participants performed a temporal bisection task in which they were required to classify the duration of auditory stimuli into short and long duration categories; crucially, the presentation order was first-order counterbalanced, allowing us to measure the effect of each presented duration on the next. EEG recordings revealed that the CNV and LPCt signals both covaried with the duration presented on the current trial, with CNV predicting reaction time and LPCt predicting choice. Additionally, both signals covaried with the duration presented in the prior trial but in different ways, with the CNV amplitude reflecting the change in the memory standard and the LPCt reflecting decision uncertainty. Furthermore, we observed a repetition enhancement effect of duration only for the CNV, suggesting that this signal additionally indexes the similarity of successive durations. These findings demonstrate dissociable roles for the CNV and LPCt, and demonstrate that both signals are continuously updated on a trial-by-trial basis that reflects shifts in temporal decisions.

Evidence against attentional state modulating scalp-recorded auditory brainstem steady-state responses	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Frequency-following response FFR; Envelope-following response; Attention; Auditory processing	FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EFFECT SIZE; SPEECH; ENVELOPE; SOUNDS	Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and their steady-state counterpart (subcortical steady-state responses, SSSRs) are generally thought to be insensitive to cognitive demands. However, a handful of studies report that SSSRs are modulated depending on the subject's focus of attention, either towards or away from an auditory stimulus. Here, we explored whether attentional focus affects the envelope-following response (EFR), which is a particular kind of SSSR, and if so, whether the effects are specific to which sound elements in a sound mixture a subject is attending (selective auditory attentional modulation), specific to attended sensory input (inter-modal attentional modulation), or insensitive to attentional focus. We compared the strength of EFR-stimulus phase locking in human listeners under various tasks: listening to a monaural stimulus, selectively attending to a particular ear during dichotic stimulus presentation, and attending to visual stimuli while ignoring dichotic auditory inputs. We observed no systematic changes in the EFR across experimental manipulations, even though cortical EEG revealed attention-related modulations of alpha activity during the task. We conclude that attentional effects, if any, on human subcortical representation of sounds cannot be observed robustly using EFRs.

Nevertheless, it may reach the cortex and influence our behavior. In this study, we investigated noninvasive neural signatures of unconscious cortical stimulus processing to understand mechanisms, which (1) prevent low-intensity somatosensory stimuli from getting access to conscious experience and which (2) can explain the associated impediment of conscious perception for additional stimuli. Stimulation of digit 2 in humans far below the detection threshold elicited a cortical evoked potential (P1) at 60 ms, but no further somatosensory evoked potential components. No event-related desynchronization was detected; rather, there was a transient synchronization in the alpha frequency range. Using the same stimulation during fMRI, a reduced centrality of contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was found, which appeared to be mainly driven by reduced functional connectivity to frontoparietal areas. We conclude that after subthreshold stimulation the (excitatory) feedforward sweep of bottom-up processing terminates in SI preventing access to conscious experience. We speculate that this interruption is due to a predominance of inhibitory processing in SI. The increase in alpha activity and the disconnection of SI from frontoparietal areas are likely correlates of an elevated perception threshold and may thus serve as a gating mechanism for the access to conscious experience.

The aim of this research is to explore the coupling patterns of brain dynamics during an auditory oddball task in schizophrenia (SCH). Approach. Event-related electroencephalographic (ERP) activity was recorded from 20 SCH patients and 20 healthy controls. The coupling changes between auditory response and pre-stimulus baseline were calculated in conventional EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma), using three coupling measures: coherence, phase-locking value and Euclidean distance. Main results. Our results showed a statistically significant increase from baseline to response in theta coupling and a statistically significant decrease in beta-2 coupling in controls. No statistically significant changes were observed in SCH patients. Significance. Our findings support the aberrant salience hypothesis, since SCH patients failed to change their coupling dynamics between stimulus response and baseline when performing an auditory cognitive task. This result may reflect an impaired communication among neural areas, which may be related to abnormal cognitive functions.

Multitasking: Effects of processing multiple auditory feature patterns	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; EEG; Normal volunteers; Auditory processes; Attention	WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MECHANISMS	ERPs and behavioral responses were measured to assess how task-irrelevant sounds interact with task processing demands and affect the ability to monitor and track multiple sound events. Participants listened to four-tone sequential frequency patterns, and responded to frequency pattern deviants (reversals of the pattern). Irrelevant tone feature patterns (duration and intensity) and respective pattern deviants were presented together with frequency patterns and frequency pattern deviants in separate conditions. Responses to task-relevant and task-irrelevant feature pattern deviants were used to test processing demands for irrelevant sound input. Behavioral performance was significantly better when there were no distracting feature patterns. Errors primarily occurred in response to the to-be-ignored feature pattern deviants. Task-irrelevant elicitation of ERP components was consistent with the error analysis, indicating a level of processing for the irrelevant features. Task-relevant elicitation of ERP components was consistent with behavioral performance, demonstrating a cost of performance when there were two feature patterns presented simultaneously. These results provide evidence that the brain tracked the irrelevant duration and intensity feature patterns, affecting behavioral performance. Overall, our results demonstrate that irrelevant informational streams are processed at a cost, which may be considered a type of multitasking that is an ongoing, automatic processing of task-irrelevant sensory events.

In our study, participants viewed a bilateral dual-stream rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Each trial had either one or two targets (T1, T2) presented either in the same or different streams. We found that the N2pc elicited by T1 was not affected by an immediately following T2 at the same location. However, if T2 was on the opposite hemifield, a second N2pc was elicited. These results suggest that the N2pc reflects neural processes involved in localizing a target to initiate the deployment of attention, rather than the sustained enhancement of processing at that location or distractor inhibition. We have created a computational model of a convergent gradient-filter model of attention that reproduces the observed event-related potential traces and makes five testable predictions to be addressed in future work.

Based on findings that demonstrated women to be more injustice sensitive than men, we expected sex to modulate effects of SI in deception tasks. We analyzed the P3 amplitudes of 57 participants in a deception task that comprised probe, target, and irrelevant pictures. Larger P3 amplitudes occurred for probes (known pictures that required deceptive responses) than for irrelevant pictures (unknown pictures that required truthful responses). Women with higher SI scores demonstrated larger P3 differences between probes and irrelevant stimuli. The findings suggest that women and men have different ways to process ethically-salient information and that SI modulates stimulus salience during deception. The effects of sex and personality have implications for the linkage between forensic psychophysiology and psychological assessment, because assessment is often based on individual differences.

However, neuroimaging research has mostly focused on artificial non-words or individual segments, which do not represent sound-symbolism in natural language. We used EEG to compare Japanese ideophones, which are phonologically distinctive sound-symbolic lexical words, and arbitrary adverbs during a sentence reading task. ldeophones elicit a larger visual P2 response than arbitrary adverbs, as well as a sustained late positive complex. Our results and previous literature suggest that the larger P2 may indicate the integration of sound and sensory information by association in response to the distinctive phonology of ideophones. The late positive complex may reflect the facilitated lexical retrieval of arbitrary words in comparison to ideophones. This account provides new evidence that ideophones exhibit similar cross-modal correspondences to those which have been proposed for non-words and individual sounds.

EEG methods could provide excellent markers to assess neuronal response variability with respect to temporal (intertrial coherence) and spatial variability (topographic consistency) as well as variations in activation intensity (low frequency variability of single trial global field power). We calculated intertrial coherence, topographic consistency and low frequency amplitude variability during target P300 in a continuous performance test in 263 15-year-olds from a cohort with psychosocial and biological risk factors. Topographic consistency and low frequency amplitude variability predicted reaction time fluctuations (RTSD) in a linear model. Higher RTSD was only associated with higher psychosocial adversity in the presence of the homozygous 6R-10R dopamine transporter haplotype. We propose that topographic variability of single trial P300 reflects noise as well as variability in evoked cortical activation patterns. Dopaminergic neuromodulation interacted with environmental and biological risk factors to predict behavioural reaction time variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to differentiate cortical mechanisms underlying subject-driven (i.e., top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) modes of attentional pain modulation, we recorded electric brain activity in healthy volunteers during painful laser stimulation while spatial attention and stimulus intensity were systematically varied. The subjects' task was to evaluate the pain intensity at the attended finger, while ignoring laser stimuli delivered to the other finger. Top-down (attention) and bottom up (intensity) influences differed in their effects on oscillatory response components. Attention towards pain induced a decrease in alpha and an increase in gamma band power, localized in the insula. Pain intensity modulated delta, alpha, beta and gamma band power. Source localization revealed stimulus driven modulation in the cingulate gyrus (CG) and somatosensory areas for gamma power changes. Our results indicate that bottom-up and top-down modes of processing exert different effects on pain induced slow and fast oscillatory activities. Future studies may examine pain-induced oscillations using this paradigm to test for altered attentional pain control in patients with chronic pain.

Children learn how to solve social situations by predicting and understanding other's behaviors. The way in which humans learn to interact successfully with others encompasses a complex interaction between neural, behavioral, and environmental elements. These have a role in the accomplishment of positive developmental outcomes, including peer acceptance, academic achievement, and mental health. All these social abilities depend on widespread brain networks that are recently being studied by neuroscience. In this paper, we will first review the studies on this topic, aiming to clarify the behavioral and neural mechanisms related to the acquisition of social skills during infancy and their appearance in time.

However, relations between their dynamical properties and behavior have not been well studied. Here, we used ECoG grids to cover large areas of motor cortex and some somatosensory cortex in monkeys while they performed an unconstrained reaching and a lever pulling task in three dimensional space with or without go cue. We used percentage of phase locking (PPL) as a dynamical property of beta oscillations aligned to behaviorally relevant events, reaching onsets (RO), lever onset (LO), and holding onset (HO) as well as multiple peaks of electromyography (EMG) recorded from various upper limb muscles. We showed that relative strength of PPL alinged to RO and LO were reserved with or without the external go cues. Furthermore, among the muscles that we recorded EMGs from, beta oscillations were not closely phase locked to any of EMG onsets. Therefore, phase locking of beta oscillations is related more to the attentive state and external cues as opposed to detailed muscle activities.

In this method, stability of IIR filter during design is assured by using lattice structure as it makes easy to maintain the stability with less computation cost. In addition to this, it also helps in designing higher order filter with better search capability. Performance of the algorithm is justified by comparing the fidelity parameter with existing algorithms, followed by a detailed analysis of different types of filter.

Electrophysiological evidence of statistical learning of long-distance dependencies in 8-month-old preterm and full-term infants	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Language; Infant; Statistics; Learning; Event-related potentials; Frequency tagging; Phase-locking; Prematurity	GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH; SENSITIVITY; RESPONSES; ACQUISITION; FREQUENCY; MEMORY; SEGMENTATION; PERCEPTION	Using electroencephalography, we examined 8-month-old infants' ability to discover a systematic dependency between the first and third syllables of successive words, concatenated into a monotonous speech stream, and to subsequently generalize this regularity to new items presented in isolation. Full-term and preterm infants, while exposed to the stream, displayed a significant entrainment (phase-locking) to the syllabic and word frequencies, demonstrating that they were sensitive to the word unit. The acquisition of the systematic dependency defining words was confirmed by the significantly different neural responses to rule-words and part-words subsequently presented during the test phase. Finally, we observed a correlation between syllabic entrainment during learning and the difference in phase coherence between the test conditions (rule-words vs part-words) suggesting that temporal processing of the syllable unit might be crucial in linguistic learning. No group difference was observed suggesting that non-adjacent statistical computations are already robust at 8 months, even in preterm infants, and thus develop during the first year of life, earlier than expected from behavioral studies.

Prolonged L2 immersion engenders little change in morphosyntactic processing of bilingual natives	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalography; grammatical gender; language attrition; language competition; morphosyntax; multilingualism	GENDER; 2ND-LANGUAGE; LANGUAGE; ERPS	Bilingual and monolingual language processing differ, presumably because of constant parallel activation of both languages in bilinguals. We attempt to isolate the effects of parallel activation in a group of German first-language (L1) attriters, who have grown up as monolingual natives before emigrating to an L2 environment. We hypothesized that prolonged immersion will lead to changes in the processing of morphosyntactic violations. Two types of constructions were presented as stimuli in an event-related potential experiment: (1) verb form combinations (auxiliaries+past participles and modals+infinitives) and (2) determiner-noun combinations marked for grammatical gender. L1 attriters showed the same response to violations of gender agreement as monolingual controls (i.e. a significant P600 effect strongest over posterior electrodes). Incorrect verb form combinations also elicited a significant posterior P600 effect in both groups. In attriters, however, there was an additional posterior N400 effect for this type of violation. Such biphasic patterns have been found before in L1 and L2 speakers of English and might reflect the influence of this language. Generally, we interpret our results as evidence for the stability of the deeply entrenched L1 system, even in the face of L2 interference. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, its neurobiological foundations remain largely unknown. In an electrophysiological study optimally designed to probe this rapid formation of new word memory circuits, we employed acoustically controlled novel word-forms incorporating native and non-native speech sounds, while manipulating the subjects' attention on the input. We found a robust index of neurolexical memory-trace formation: a rapid enhancement of the brain's activation elicited by novel words during a short (similar to 30 min) perceptual exposure, underpinned by fronto-temporal cortical networks, and, importantly, correlated with behavioural learning outcomes. Crucially, this neural memory trace build-up took place regardless of focused attention on the input or any pre-existing or learnt semantics. Furthermore, it was found only for stimuli with native-language phonology, but not for acoustically closely matching non-native words. These findings demonstrate a specialised cortical mechanism for rapid, automatic and phonology-dependent formation of neural word memory circuits. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We employed event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to study the time-course of neural processes involved in the recognition of previously unfamiliar faces in DPs and in age-matched control participants with normal face recognition abilities. Faces of different individuals were presented sequentially in one of three possible views, and participants had to detect a specific Target Face ("Joe"). EEG was recorded during task performance to Target Faces, Nontarget Faces, or the participants' Own Face (which had to be ignored). The N250 component was measured as a marker of the match between a seen face and a stored representation in visual face memory. The subsequent P600f was measured as an index of attentional processes associated with the conscious awareness and recognition of a particular face. Target Faces elicited reliable N250 and P600f in the DP group, but both of these components emerged later in DPs than in control participants. This shows that the activation of visual face memory for previously unknown learned faces and the subsequent attentional processing and conscious recognition of these faces are delayed in DP. N250 and P600f components to Own Faces did not differ between the two groups, indicating that the processing of long-term familiar faces is less affected in DP. However, P600f components to Own Faces were absent in two participants with DP who failed to recognize their Own Face during the experiment. These results provide new evidence that face recognition deficits in DP may be linked to a delayed activation of visual face memory and explicit identity recognition mechanisms.

An Explorative In-Depth Analysis of an Experimental Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; HUMAN SLEEP; EXPOSURE	This study aimed to investigate whether third generation mobile phone radiation peaks result in event related potentials. Thirty-one healthy females participated. In this single-blind, cross-over design, a 15 minute mobile phone exposure was compared to two 15 minute sham phone conditions, one preceding and one following the exposure condition. Each participant was measured on two separate days, where mobile phone placement was varied between the ear and heart. EEG activity and radiofrequency radiation were recorded jointly. Epochs of 1200ms, starting 200ms before and lasting until 1000ms after the onset of a radiation peak, were extracted from the exposure condition. Control epochs were randomly selected from the two sham phone conditions. The main a-priori hypothesis to be tested concerned an increase of the area in the 240-500ms post-stimulus interval, in the exposure session with ear-placement. Using multilevel regression analyses the placement* exposure interaction effect was significant for the frontal and central cortical regions, indicating that only in the mobile phone exposure with ear-placement an enlarged cortical reactivity was found. Post-hoc analyses based on visual inspection of the ERPs showed a second significantly increased area between 500-1000ms post-stimulus for almost every EEG location measured. It was concluded that, when a dialing mobile phone is placed on the ear, its radiation, although unconsciously, is electrically detected by the brain. The question of whether or not this cortical reactivity results in a negative health outcome has to be answered in future longitudinal experiments.

Here, we investigated this open question by using a previously established behavioral paradigm in combination with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Healthy human subjects encoded a series of scene images, which was combined with cues predicting an aversive electric shock with different probabilities (0.2, 0.5 or 0.8). After encoding, memory for the studied images was tested using a remember/know recognition task. Behaviorally, pain anticipation did not modulate recollection-based recognition memory per se, but interacted with the perceived unpleasantness of the electric shock [visual analogue scale rating from I (not unpleasant) to 10 (highly unpleasant)]. More precisely, the relationship between pain anticipation and recollection followed an inverted u-shaped function the more unpleasant the shocks were rated by a subject. At the physiological level, this quadratic effect was mimicked in the event-related magnetic fields associated with successful memory formation ('DM-effect') similar to 450 ms after image onset at left frontal sensors. Importantly, across all subjects, shock anticipation modulated oscillatory power in the low beta frequency range (13-20 Hz) in a linear fashion at left temporal sensors. Taken together, our findings indicate that beta oscillations provide a generic mechanism underlying pain anticipation; the effect on subsequent long-term memory, on the other hand, is much more variable and depends on the level of individual pain perception. As such, our findings give new and important insights into how aversive motivational states can drive memory formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, there is inconclusive scientific evidence concerning the potential risks associated with the energy deposition in the brain from Wi-Fi and whether Wi-Fi electromagnetism interacts with cognitive function. In this study we investigated possible neurocognitive effects caused by Wi-Fi exposure. First, we constructed a Wi-Fi exposure system from commercial parts. Dosimetry was first assessed by free space radiofrequency field measurements. The experimental exposure system was then modeled based on real geometry and physical characteristics. Specific absorption rate (SAR) calculations were performed using a wholebody, realistic human voxel model with values corresponding to conventional everyday Wi-Fi exposure (peak SAR(10g) level was 99.22 mW/kg with 1 W output power and 100% duty cycle). Then, in two provocation experiments involving healthy human volunteers we tested for two hypotheses: 1. Whether a 60 min long 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi exposure affects the spectral power of spontaneous awake electroencephalographic (sEEG) activity (N = 25); and 2. Whether similar Wi-Fi exposure modulates the sustained attention measured by reaction time in a computerized psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) (N = 19). EEG data were recorded at midline electrode sites while volunteers watched a silent documentary. In the PVT task, button press reaction time was recorded. No measurable effects of acute Wi-Fi exposure were found on spectral power of sEEG or reaction time in the psychomotor vigilance test. These results indicate that a single, 60 min WiFi exposure does not alter human oscillatory brain function or objective measures of sustained attention.

The latency of P100 and N170 components was shorter in the temporal, parietal and occipital areas in abstinent cannabinoid users in comparison with the control subjects. The cannabinoid group showed the decrease of P100 amplitude in the right temporal and parietal areas and the decrease of N/70 amplitude in the left temporal and parietal areas. There were no differences in the behavioral indices between these two groups. Thus, cannabinoids influence upon the mechanisms of early selection and these alterations of brain activity are stable and long-term.	[Larionova, E. V.; Garakh, Zh. V.; Novototsky-Vlasov, V.

Soft, curved electrode systems capable of integration on the auricle as a persistent brain-computer interface	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						soft electronics; auricle integration; brain-computer interface; text speller	DRY ELECTRODE; EPIDERMAL ELECTRONICS; EEG; SKIN; SIGNALS; DESIGN; SENSOR	Recent advances in electrodes for noninvasive recording of electroencephalograms expand opportunities collecting such data for diagnosis of neurological disorders and brain-computer interfaces. Existing technologies, however, cannot be used effectively in continuous, uninterrupted modes for more than a few days due to irritation and irreversible degradation in the electrical and mechanical properties of the skin interface. Here we introduce a soft, foldable collection of electrodes in open, fractal mesh geometries that can mount directly and chronically on the complex surface topology of the auricle and the mastoid, to provide high-fidelity and long-term capture of electroencephalograms in ways that avoid any significant thermal, electrical, or mechanical loading of the skin. Experimental and computational studies establish the fundamental aspects of the bending and stretching mechanics that enable this type of intimate integration on the highly irregular and textured surfaces of the auricle. Cell level tests and thermal imaging studies establish the biocompatibility and wearability of such systems, with examples of high-quality measurements over periods of 2 wk with devices that remain mounted throughout daily activities including vigorous exercise, swimming, sleeping, and bathing. Demonstrations include a text speller with a steady-state visually evoked potential-based brain-computer interface and elicitation of an event-related potential (P300 wave).	[Norton, James J.

Tracking lexical consolidation with ERPs: Lexical and semantic-priming effects on N400 and LPC responses to newly-learned words	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Memory consolidation; Word learning; N400; LPC; EEG; Semantic priming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN; RECOLLECTION; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; ACQUISITION	Novel words can be recalled immediately and after little exposure, but require a post-learning consolidation period to show word-like behaviour such as lexical competition. This pattern is thought to reflect a qualitative shift from episodic to lexical representations. However, several studies have reported immediate effects of meaningful novel words on semantic processing, suggesting that integration of novel word meanings may not require consolidation. The current study synthesises and extends these findings by showing a dissociation between lexical and semantic effects on the electrophysiological (N400, LPC) response to novel words. The difference in N400 amplitude between novel and existing words (a lexical effect) decreased significantly after a 24-h consolidation period, providing novel support for the hypothesis that offline consolidation aids lexicalisation. In contrast, novel words preceded by semantically related primes elicited a more positive LPC response (a semantic-priming effect) both before and after consolidation, indicating that certain semantic effects can be observed even when words have not been fully lexicalised. We propose that novel meanings immediately start to contribute to semantic processing, but that the underlying neural processes may shift from strategic to more automatic with consolidation.

The most popular P300 speller, the row-column paradigm (RCP), displays characters in a matrix within which rows and columns of characters are flashed eliciting P300 responses when the illuminated row or column contains the attended target character. Despite being a longstanding successful approach, this RCP faces several challenges, including the adjacency and crowding problems. A new P300 speller is introduced-the edges paradigm (EP). Distinct from existing P300 spellers, the EP presents a square adjacent to each column or row in the outer boundary of the matrix. By replacing each flash of a row or column with that square, this EP exhibited attenuated influences of crowding and adjacency-problems known to perturb the RCP. In the copy-spelling mode, 14 neurologically normal participants demonstrated an improved accuracy of 93.3 +/- 2.0% for the EP relative to 81.7 +/- 2.8% for the RCP, alongside a faster communication rate. Subjective ratings also indicated that the EP caused significantly less fatigue, while increasing alertness and comfort.

However, neural mechanisms involved in early imitative behaviours are still areas of active research. Neurophysiological and brain-imaging studies have been recently performed that provide initial evidence of brain activation associated with action observation in the first months of life. In this review we examine all studies exploring the effects of action observation on brain function assessed by means of non-invasive brain-mapping techniques. Seventeen papers were selected as a result of our literature search. The strongest evidence for a neural signature of action observation comes from studies exploring the desynchronization of the -rhythm, which was reported for both occluded and visible goal-directed grasp, and was correlated with the totality of the infant's own action experience. The effects of action observation were reported on event-related potentials (ERPs) or near infrared spectroscopy. Taken together, these studies suggest that, in early infancy, a direct visual-motor matching process is already detectable as early as 6months, suggesting a matching between action perception and execution already in infancy. If confirmed by future studies, these findings will shed light on the mechanisms of early motor development and imitation, and will be key to informing novel rehabilitation strategies in infants with congenital brain damage.

The following aspects of local contextual processing will be discussed and reviewed: (i) the correlates associated with contextual processing that have been identified in healthy adults, (ii) stimulus modality effects, (iii) specific alterations and deficits of local contextual processing in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric patient populations, including patients with prefrontal cortex lesions, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, (iv) the potential for utilizing the correlates of local context as biomarkers for frontal cognitive dysfunction and (v) the role of frontal networks in the processing of contextual information. Overall findings show that behavioral and neural correlates associated with processing of local context are comparable across stimulus modalities, but show specific alterations in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Methods: A scoping review of published English literature on BCI application in the field of rehabilitation was undertaken. IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus databases were searched since inception up to August 2012. All experimental studies published in English and discussed complete cycle of the BCI process was included in the review. Results and discussion: In total, 90 articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Various approaches that improve the accuracy and performance of BCI systems were discussed. Based on BCI's clinical application, reviewed articles were categorized into three groups: motion rehabilitation, speech rehabilitation and virtual reality control (VRC). Almost half of the reviewed papers (48%) concentrated on VRC. Speech rehabilitation and motion rehabilitation made up 33% and 19% of the reviewed papers, respectively. Among different types of electroencephalography signals, P300, steady state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery signals were the most common. Conclusions: This review discussed various applications of BCI in rehabilitation and showed how BCI can be used to improve the quality of life for people with neurological disabilities. It will develop and promote new models of communication and finally, will create an accurate, reliable, online communication between human brain and computer and reduces the negative effects of external stimuli on BCI performance.

Incorporating advanced language models into the P300 speller using particle filtering	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; language models; P300 Speller; electroencephalography; particle filters	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB	Objective. The P300 speller is a common brain-computer interface (BCI) application designed to communicate language by detecting event related potentials in a subject's electroencephalogram signal. Information about the structure of natural language can be valuable for BCI communication, but attempts to use this information have thus far been limited to rudimentary n-gram models. While more sophisticated language models are prevalent in natural language processing literature, current BCI analysis methods based on dynamic programming cannot handle their complexity. Approach. Sampling methods can overcome this complexity by estimating the posterior distribution without searching the entire state space of the model. In this study, we implement sequential importance resampling, a commonly used particle filtering (PF) algorithm, to integrate a probabilistic automaton language model. Main result. This method was first evaluated offline on a dataset of 15 healthy subjects, which showed significant increases in speed and accuracy when compared to standard classification methods as well as a recently published approach using a hidden Markov model (HMM). An online pilot study verified these results as the average speed and accuracy achieved using the PF method was significantly higher than that using the HMM method. Significance. These findings strongly support the integration of domain-specific knowledge into BCI classification to improve system performance.	[Speier, W.; Arnold, C.

J	Kononowicz, TW; Sander, T; van Rijn, H				Kononowicz, Tadeusz W.; Sander, Tillman; van Rijn, Hedderik			Neuroelectromagnetic signatures of the reproduction of supra-second durations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Contingent negative variation; Contingent magnetic variation; Magnetic fields; Supplementary motor area; Interval timing; Climbing neural activity	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CHOICE REACTION-TIME; NEUROMAGNETIC LOCALIZATION; TEMPORAL ACCUMULATION; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VARIATION CNV	When participants are asked to reproduce an earlier presented duration, EEG recordings typically show a slow potential that develops over the fronto-central regions of the brain and is assumed to be generated in the supplementary motor area (SMA). This contingent negative variation (CNV) has been linked to anticipation, preparation and formation of temporal judgment (Macar, Vidal, and Casini, 1999, Experimental Brain Research, 125(3), 271-80). Although the interpretation of the CNV amplitude is problematic (Kononowicz and Van Rijn, (2011), Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, 5(48); Ng, Tobin, and Penney, 2011, Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, 5(77)), the observation of this slow potential is extremely robust, and thus one could assume that magnetic recordings of brain activity should show similar activity patterns. However, interval timing studies using durations shorter than one second did not provide unequivocal evidence as to whether CNV has a magnetic counterpart (CMV). As interval timing has been typically associated with durations longer than one second, participants in this study were presented intervals of 2, 3 or 4 s that had to be reproduced in setup similar to the seminal work of Elbert et al. (1991, Psychophysiology, 28(6), 648-55) while co-recording EEG and MEG. The EEG data showed a clear CNV during the standard and the reproduction interval. In the reproduction interval the CNV steadily builds up from the onset of interval for both stimulus and response locked data. The MEG data did not show a CNV-resembling ramping of activity, but only showed a pre-movement magnetic field (preMMF) that originated from the SMA, occurring approximately 0.6 s before the termination of the timed interval. These findings support the notion that signatures of timing are more straightforwardly measured using EEG, and show that the measured MEG signal from the SMA is constrained to the end of reproduction interval, before the voluntary movement. Moreover, we investigated a link between timing behavior and the early iCNV and late CNV amplitudes to evaluate the hypothesis that these amplitudes reflect the accumulation of temporal pulses. Larger iCNV amplitudes predicted shorter reproduced durations. This effect was more pronounced for the 2 s interval reproduction, suggesting that preparatory strategies depend on the length of reproduced interval. Similarly to Elbert et al. (1991, Psychophysiology, 28(6), 648-55), longer reproductions were associated with smaller CNV amplitudes, both between conditions and across participants within the same condition. As the temporal accumulation hypothesis predicts the inverse, these results support the proposal by Van Rijn et al. (2011, Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, 5) that the CNV reflects other temporally driven processes such as temporal expectation and preparation rather than temporal accumulation itself.

The aim of the present study was to characterize, using EEG, the effects of pinprick stimulation intensity on the magnitude of pinprick-elicited brain potentials [event-related potentials (ERPs)] before and after secondary hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans. Pinprick-elicited ERPs and pinprick-evoked pain ratings were recorded in 19 healthy volunteers, with mechanical pinprick stimuli of varying intensities (0.25-mm probe applied with a force extending between 16 and 512 mN). The recordings were performed before (T0) and 30 min after (T1) intradermal capsaicin injection. The contralateral noninjected arm served as control. ERPs elicited by stimulation of untreated skin were characterized by 1) an early-latency negative-positive complex peaking between 120 and 250 ms after stimulus onset (N120-P240) and maximal at the vertex and 2) a long-lasting positive wave peaking 400-600 ms after stimulus onset and maximal more posterior (P500), which was correlated to perceived pinprick pain. After capsaicin injection, pinprick stimuli were perceived as more intense in the area of secondary hyperalgesia and this effect was stronger for lower compared with higher stimulus intensities. In addition, there was an enhancement of the P500 elicited by stimuli of intermediate intensity, which was significant for 64 mN. The other components of the ERPs were unaffected by capsaicin. Our results suggest that the increase in P500 magnitude after capsaicin is mediated by facilitated mechanical nociceptive pathways.

Generation of field potentials and modulation of their dynamics through volume integration of cortical activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						field potential; current source density; volume conduction; LFP	AUDITORY-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; REFLECTS; GAMMA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; SIGNALS; REACH	Field potentials (FPs) recorded within the brain, often called "local field potentials" (LFPs), are useful measures of net synaptic activity in a neuronal ensemble. However, due to volume conduction, FPs spread beyond regions of underlying synaptic activity, and thus an "LFP" signal may not accurately reflect the temporal patterns of synaptic activity in the immediately surrounding neuron population. To better understand the physiological processes reflected in FPs, we explored the relationship between the FP and its membrane current generators using current source density (CSD) analysis in conjunction with a volume conductor model. The model provides a quantitative description of the spatiotemporal summation of immediate local and more distant membrane currents to produce the FP. By applying the model to FPs in the macaque auditory cortex, we have investigated a critical issue that has broad implications for FP research. We have shown that FP responses in particular cortical layers are differentially susceptible to activity in other layers. Activity in the supragranular layers has the strongest contribution to FPs in other cortical layers, and infragranular FPs are most susceptible to contributions from other layers. To define the physiological processes generating FPs recorded in loci of relatively weak synaptic activity, strong effects produced by synaptic events in the vicinity have to be taken into account. While outlining limitations and caveats inherent to FP measurements, our results also suggest specific peak and frequency band components of FPs can be related to activity in specific cortical layers. These results may help improving the interpretability of FPs.

J	Ling, Z; Yue, C; Li, WJ; Fan, J				Zou Ling; Chen Yue; Li Wenjie; Jing Fan			Electroencephalogram Feature Detection and Classification in People with Internet Addiction Disorder with Visual Oddball Paradigm	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Event-Related Potentials; P300; Independent Component Analysis; Channel Selection; Pattern Recognition	COMPONENT ANALYSIS	In this paper, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from ten healthy and ten Internet Addiction (IA)-afflicted university students during a visual oddball paradigm. First, the original signals were preprocessed to remove some artifacts using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm. Then, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to select a subset of channels that preserve most of the information compared to the full set of 64 channels. Finally, features of P300 waves were extracted from the event related potentials (ERPs) and compared across the target ERPs and non-target ERPs, as well as across the IA group and control group. The extracted features were further used to train four classifiers: Fisher Linear Discriminate Analysis (FLDA), Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network, Bayesian Classifier (BC) and Bayesian Regularization Back Propagation (BRBP) Neural Network. The active channels were located in the frontal, parietal, occipital and parietal-occipital areas for both healthy and IA-afflicted university students. The latency of 42 trials' averaged ERPs under target stimulation was longer than that of 558 trials' averaged ERPs under non-target stimulation (p < 0.05), and the amplitude of 42 trials' averaged ERPs under target stimulation was larger than that of 558 trials' averaged ERPs under non-target (p < 0.05). It showed significant difference in P300 amplitudes between healthy subjects and Internet Addition subjects. The amplitudes of Internet Addition were lower (p < 0.05). The classification accuracy could reach above 93% using Bayesian-based method in active areas, while it was lower than 90% in central areas. The results show that there are negative influences on the brain response and memory abilities of IA-afflicted university students. The paper deals with practical digital filter implementation to suppress 50 Hz power noise using integer coefficients filters. Very fast and simple solution enables to suppress both basic and harmonic components of power noise with nonlinear distortions. Real ECG signals were used to test effectiveness of power noise suppression. Accuracy is evaluated for basic sinusoidal and rectangular wave of noise.

An electrophysiological study of noun-noun compound processing by very advanced L2 speakers of English	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						compounds; second language; word order; ERP; frequency effects; generalized additive mixed models	NOMINAL COMPOUNDS; MENTAL LEXICON; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; WORDS; POTENTIALS; HEADEDNESS; COMPONENT; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS	The processing of English noun-noun compounds (NNCs) was investigated to identify the extent and nature of differences between the performance of native speakers of English and advanced Spanish and German non-native speakers of English. The study sought to establish whether the word order of the equivalent structure in the non-native speakers' mothertongue (L1) had an influence on their processing of NNCs in their second language (L2), and whether this influence was due to differences in grammatical representation (i.e., incomplete acquisition of the relevant structure) or processing effects. Two mask-primed lexical decision experiments were conducted in which compounds were presented with their constituent nouns in licit vs. reversed order. The first experiment used a speeded lexical decision task with reaction time registration, and the second a delayed lexical decision task with EEG registration. There were no significant group differences in accuracy in the licit word order condition, suggesting that the grammatical representation had been fully acquired by the non-native speakers. However, the Spanish speakers made slightly more errors with the reversed order and had longer response times, suggesting an Li interference effect (as the reverse order matches the licit word order in Spanish). The EEG data, analyzed with generalized additive mixed models, further supported this hypothesis. The EEG waveform of the non-native speakers was characterized by a slightly later onset N400 in the violation condition (reversed constituent order). Compound frequency predicted the amplitude of the EEG signal for the licit word order for native speakers, but for the reversed constituent order for Spanish speakers the licit order in their Li supporting the hypothesis that Spanish speakers are affected by interferences from their L1. The pattern of results for the German speakers in the violation condition suggested a strong conflict arising due to licit constituents being presented in an order that conflicts with the expected order in both their Li and L2.

Spoken fragment primes either shared segments (related) with the spoken targets or not (unrelated), and this segmental overlap either corresponded to the first syllable of the target (e.g., /teis/ - /teisti/), or not (e.g., /teis/ - /teisles/). Similar prime conditions applied for word and pseudoword targets. Lexical decision latencies revealed facilitation due to related fragments that corresponded to the first syllable of the target (/teis/ - /teisti/). Despite segmental overlap, there were no positive effects for related fragments that mismatched the first syllable. No facilitation was observed for pseudowords. The EEG analyses showed a consistent effect of relatedness, independent of syllabic match, from 200 to 500 ms, including the P350 and N400 windows. Moreover, this held for words and pseudowords that differed however in the N400 window. The only specific effect of syllabic match for related prime-target pairs was observed in the time window from 200 to 300 ms. We discuss the nature and potential origin of these effects, and their relevance for speech processing and lexical access.

Accordingly, researchers have applied knowledge from the fields of psychology and human-computer interaction to understand the security behaviors of users. However, many cognitive processes and responses are unconscious or obligatory and yet still have a profound effect on users' security behaviors. With this in mind, researchers have begun to apply methods and theories of neuroscience to yield greater insights into the "black box" of user cognition. The goal of this approach-termed neurosecurity is to better understand and improve users' behaviors. This study illustrates the potential for neurosecurity by investigating how two fundamental biological-factors gender and color perception-affect users' reception of security warnings. This is important to determine because research has shown that users frequently fail to appropriately respond to security warnings. We conducted a laboratory experiment using electroencephalography, a proven method of measuring neurological activity in temporally sensitive tasks. We found that the amplitude of the P300-an event-related potential component indicative of decision-making ability-was higher for all participants when viewing malware warning screenshots relative to legitimate website shots. Additionally, we found that the P300 was greater for women than for men, indicating that women exhibit higher brain activity than men when viewing malware warnings. However, we found that there was no change in the P300 when viewing red warnings compared to grayscale warnings. Together, our results demonstrate the value of applying neurosecurity methods to the domain of cybersecurity and point to several promising avenues for future research.

The following tasks were tested: 1) a simple observation of the illuminations of the character in the matrix; 2) counting the number of highlights; 3) monitoring of the target symbol highlights and typing text with the P300 BCI. In a group of 14 people showed that the highest average length of visual fixation and the lowest dispersion of fixation observed for the second type of task. Statistically significant differences in the level of dispersion of visual fixations found between 1-2 and 1-3 modes; differences between the modes for the duration of fixations are at trends. Significant differences in the number of visual fixations on the target symbols wasn't detected. The overall conclusion is the high perspective of pairing methodology brain-computer interface on the P300 wave with eye tracking to optimize the characteristics of the stimulus in the BCI environment. The differences in the parameters of oculomotor activity between the tasks reflect the level of attention concentration in the target symbols of the P300 BCI.	[Basyul, I.

Previous literature interprets this effect as a pre-attentive and unconscious processing of sensory stimuli. By contrast, a violation to auditory global regularities, i. e. based on repeating groups of sounds, is typically detectable when subjects can consciously perceive them. Here, we challenge the notion that global detection implies consciousness by testing the neural response to global violations in a group of 24 patients with post-anoxic coma (three females, age range 45-87 years), treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia and sedation. By applying a decoding analysis to electroencephalographic responses to standard versus deviant sound sequences, we found above-chance decoding performance in 10 of 24 patients (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001), despite five of them being mildly hypothermic, sedated and unarousable. Furthermore, consistently with previous findings based on the mismatch negativity the progression of this decoding performance was informative of patients' chances of awakening (78% predictive of awakening). Our results show for the first time that detection of global regularities at neural level exists despite a deeply unconscious state.

Well-established electrophysiological [late positive potential (LPP) and facial electromyography (EMG)] and self-report [Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)] indices of valence and arousal, i.e., the primary orthogonal dimensions of affective experience, were used to test this prediction by examining affective experience in response to categorically ambiguous compared with unambiguous avatar and human faces (N = 30). LPP and EMG provided direct psychophysiological indices of affective state during passive observation and the SAM provided self-reported indices of affective state during explicit cognitive evaluation of static facial stimuli. The faces were drawn from well-controlled morph continua representing the UVH' dimension of human likeness (DHL). The results provide no support for the notion that category ambiguity along the DHL is specifically associated with enhanced experience of negative affect. On the contrary, the LPP and SAM-based measures of arousal and valence indicated a general increase in negative affective state (i.e., enhanced arousal and negative valence) with greater morph distance from the human end of the DHL. A second sample (N = 30) produced the same finding, using an ad hoc self-rating scale of feelings of familiarity, i.e., an oft-used measure of affective experience along the UVH' familiarity dimension. In conclusion, this multi-method approach using well-validated psychophysiological and self-rating indices of arousal and valence rejects for passive observation and for explicit affective evaluation of static faces the main prediction of the UVH.

Role of explicit verbal information in conditioned analgesia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PLACEBO ANALGESIA; EEG RESPONSES; STIMULUS SALIENCY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PAIN RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; EXPECTATION	BackgroundThe exact role of expectation in conditioned analgesia is still elusive as it is not clear whether conditioning is an automatic process or rather it is cognitively mediated. This study is aimed at understanding the role of explicit verbal information in conditioned analgesia. MethodsTwo groups of healthy subjects received a conditioning procedure whereby two visual cues were paired with increase and decrease in stimulus intensity. In the conditioning/verbal information' group (VER), subjects were informed about the meaning of the cues, whereas no information was given to the second group (noVER). After two conditioning blocks, an evocation session was run in which the stimulus intensity was the same, irrespective of the cues. Pain perception was assessed according to a numerical rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal pain). The N2-P2 component of laser-evoked potentials (LEP) was used as an index of index of brain responses to nociceptive stimuli. ResultsIn the evocation session, only the VER group reported a decrease in pain rating and LEP amplitude when the cues were presented, suggesting that the visual-analgesic association does not occur without explicit verbal information. ConclusionsIn line with the cognitive theory of conditioning, our results indicate that just pairing a cue with different pain stimulus intensities is not sufficient, per se, to produce a learning process. What matters is the informational cognitive content of the cue, i.e. the meaning assigned to the cue itself. These findings may help understand the mechanisms of conditioned analgesia and more in general of learning.

Language Membership Identification Precedes Semantic Access: Suppression during Bilingual Word Recognition	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SENTENCE CONTEXT; LEXICAL ACCESS; FILM SUBTITLES; BRAIN; TRANSLATION; HOMOGRAPHS; FREQUENCIES; KNOWLEDGE; COMPONENT; DECISION	Previous research suggests that bilingual comprehenders access lexical representations of words in both languages nonselectively. However, it is unclear whether global language suppression plays a role in guiding attention to target language representations during ongoing lexico-semantic processing. To help clarify this issue, this study examined the relative timing of language membership and meaning activation during visual word recognition. Spanish-English bilinguals performed simultaneous semantic and language membership classification tasks on single words during EEG recording. Go/no-go ERP latencies provided evidence that language membership information was accessed before semantic information. Furthermore, N400 frequency effects indicated that the depth of processing of words in the nontarget language was reduced compared to the target language. These results suggest that the bilingual brain can rapidly identify the language to which a word belongs and subsequently use this information to selectively modulate the degree of processing in each language accordingly.

The present experiment tested this interpretation. Ten expert and ten novice golfers completed 120 putts while high-alpha power was recorded and analyzed as a function of whether the previous putt was holed (i.e., a correct response) or missed (i.e., an error). Existing evidence indicates that more resources are allocated to response programming following errors. We observed less premovement high-alpha power following errors, especially in experts.

J	Steinberg, F; Vogt, T				Steinberg, Fabian; Vogt, Tobias			Context-dependent neuroelectric responses during motor control	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						N200; P300; Grasping; EEG; Attention; Cognition	GRASPING MOVEMENTS; ERP; COMPONENTS; TRANSPORT; ATTENTION; OBJECTS; VISION; REACH; P300	Research on brain responses during motor control is usually performed under typical laboratory settings. However, everyday life and the laboratory differ in many aspects, such as purposeful and motivated behavior; and there's no awareness of "being measured" in everyday life. In the laboratory, movements are usually explicitly instructed, overtly measured and follow no intrinsic motivated purpose. Therefore, here we present a new method to measure and reliably analyze neuroelectric brain responses by EEG, as well as kinematics during the performance of grasping movements in two different behavioral contexts. One context (L) simulates a typical laboratory task and another context (E) uses selected features of everyday behavior. However, in both tasks the mechanical constraints and stimuli for the movement are exactly the same. Amplitudes of event-related N200 and P300 measured at the brain's midline were differentially affected by the two contexts. P300 was increased in L compared to E. N200 was distinct at anterior electrode sites (Fz, Cz) in context E, while it was elevated at posterior electrode sites (Pz, Oz) in context L. For the first time, kinematic and electrophysiological recordings are combined to analyze identical movements, performed in varied behavioral contexts. The results indicate that brain responses measured under typical laboratory context may not be necessarily transferred to everyday life; thus, the present approach offers a wide range of new questions to analyze context-dependent brain responses.

Relating Tribological Stimuli to Somatosensory Electroencephalographic Responses	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			PERCEPTION; FRICTION; TOUCH	The present study deals with the extraction of neural correlates evoked by tactile stimulation of the human fingertip. A reciprocal sliding procedure was performed using a home-built tribometer while simultaneously electroencephalographic (EEG) data from the somatosensory cortex was recorded. The tactile stimuli were delivered by a sliding block with equidistant, perpendicular ridges. The experiments were designed and performed in a fully passive way to prevent attentional locked influences from the subjects. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of event related single-trials (ERPs), nonlocal means in addition to 2D-anisotropic denoising schemes based on tight Gabor frames were applied. This novel approach allowed for an easier extraction of ERP alternations. A negative correlation between the latency of the P100 component of the resulting brain responses and the intensity of the underlying lateral forces was found. These findings lead to the conclusion that an increasing stimulus intensity results in a decreasing latency of the brain responses.

The goal of the current study was to determine if exposure to brainwave entrainment (BWE) at the alpha centre frequency before and during performance of a divergent thinking task would result in increases in task-related, event-related synchrony and the production of more highly original ideas. We found that alpha entrainment interfered with the oscillatory dynamics associated with divergent thinking such that only the control group showed greater right hemispheric engagement. Furthermore, the control group showed greater self-rated originality. These findings provide confirmation of the importance of hemispheric asymmetry in alpha power to successful divergent thinking and indicate that refinements are required in order for BWE to be used effectively to improve divergent thinking performance.

It has been reported that ongoing activity of the frontal control regions across trials associates with the occurrence of performance errors. However, neural mechanisms that cause performance errors remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that some neural functions required for correct outcomes are lacking just before performance errors, and to determine this lack of neural function we applied a spatiotemporal analysis to high-density electroencephalogram signals recorded during a visual discrimination task, a d2 test of attention. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a difference in the temporal development of scalp ERP between trials with error, and correct outcomes as seen by topography during the d2 test of attention. We observed differences in the signal potential in the frontal region and then the occipital region between reaction times matched with correct and error outcomes. Our observations suggest that lapses of top-down signals from frontal control regions cause performance errors just after the lapses.

The mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to auditory stimuli has been proposed as an objective tool to measure the existence of auditory sensory memory traces. By increasing interstimulus intervals, attenuation of MMN peak amplitude and increased MMN peak latency have been suggested to reflect duration and decay of sensory memory traces. The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review of studies investigating sensory memory duration with MMN. Searches of electronic databases yielded 743 articles. Of these, 37 studies met final eligibility criteria. Results point to maturational changes in the time span of auditory sensory memory from birth on with a peak in young adulthood, as well as to a decrease of sensory memory duration in healthy aging. Furthermore, this review suggests that sensory memory decline is related to diverse neurological, psychiatric, and pediatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, and language disorders. This review underlines that the MMN provides a unique window to the cognitive processes of auditory sensory memory. However, further studies combining electrophysiological and behavioral data, and further studies in clinical populations are needed, also on individual levels, to validate the MMN as a clinical tool for the assessment of sensory memory duration.

The main function of BMIs is to detect, analyze and classify the modulation of EEG according to a user's intent and to decode it to demonstrate to others. Most of conventional BMIs with relatively high speed and high classification accuracy have a requisite that a user can open and move his/her eyes toward a target corresponding to user's intent and gaze at it. Locked-in patients, who have lost almost all motor function including facial muscle, cannot control the eye-movement as well as gaze. The present study aimed at developing a BMI which was independent of the eye-movement and eye-gaze as a final goal. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of binary class of BMI available with eyes-closed condition using a recent our newly observation that the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) could be modulated by performing the mental tasks even in the eyes-close state. Temporal evolution of the modulation of SSVEP was investigated using the amplitude of SSVEP and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The amplitudes of fundamental SSVEP (10 Hz) averaged across 11 participants showed significant difference between the mental focusing task and relaxed runs from the onset of the flicker stimuli with the frequency of 10 Hz and the intensity of 5 lx, whereas those of the second harmonic SSVEP (20 Hz) gave only small difference without statistical significance. For the image recalling task, the amplitude differences between the fundamental SSVEPs in the task and relaxed conditions did not show significant difference, whereas the amplitude differences of the second harmonic SSVEP showed the main effect of the image recall task. The KL divergences for the fundamental SSVEP amplitude showed large differences at the onset of flicker stimuli and gradual decrease with time at P4 and O2 for the mental focus task, yet no such characteristic evolution was not seen in KL divergence for the second harmonic SSVEP. On the other hand, the KL divergences during the image recalling were increased with time for both the fundamental and second harmonic SSVEPs at most of the electrode sites. The classification accuracies of the proposed BMI exceeded 75 % in average across the subjects for both tasks using Fisher's linear discriminant analysis.

Cognitive control account assumes that PES depends on error information, whereas orienting account posits that it depends on error frequency. This raises the question how the outcome valence and outcome frequency separably influence the generation of PES. To address this issue, we varied the probability of observation errors (50/50 and 20/80, correct/error) the "partner'' committed by employing an observation-execution task and investigated the corresponding behavioral and neural effects. On each trial, participants first viewed the outcome of a flanker-run that was supposedly performed by a 'partner', and then performed a flanker-run themselves afterwards. We observed PES in the two error rate conditions. However, electroencephalographic data suggested error-related potentials (oERN and oPe) and rhythmic oscillation associated with attentional process (alpha band) were respectively sensitive to outcome valence and outcome frequency. Importantly, oERN amplitude was positively correlated with PES. Taken together, these findings support the assumption of the cognitive control account, suggesting that outcome valence and outcome frequency are both involved in PES. Moreover, the generation of PES is indexed by oERN, whereas the modulation of PES size could be reflected on the alpha band.

An algorithmic procedure, relying on temporal patterning and built over archetypal analysis, is introduced. Archetypical brain waves are first derived from the ensemble of brain responses and then used to unfold the observed variability. Using these archetypes as anchor points, homogeneous groups of ST-responses are detected and contrasted with each other. The new methodology incorporates steps for organizing the variability and presenting it by means of low-dimensional maps. Magnetoencephalographic responses from a visual stimulation paradigm are used for demonstrating and validating the approach. The results show that a small number of archetypes is sufficient for describing reliably the response variability. The groups of ST-responses, delineated around these archetypes, reflect differences in the way the ongoing activity interacts with the incoming stimulus. Estimates of signal-to-noise ratio are utilized in order to demonstrate that there is a significant informatior loss when response variability is left untreated. Moreover, ensemble averaging is employed for uniquely recovering the "true" response. Archetypal analysis provides a concise description of response variability which potentially can contribute in the understanding of its origin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition to those factors involving processing times, in the present study we sought to use electrophysiological measures to find factors involving activations that could affect stopping success. We hypothesized that voluntarily-generated unimanual preparation would be a factor. To assess voluntarily-generated unimanual preparation in the stop-signal paradigm, we used a selective-stopping task without any precue. The selective-stopping task also allowed us to assess reaction times (RTs) even when stopping was successful. We demonstrated shorter RTs in signal-respond (i.e. unsuccessful stopping) than in signal-inhibit (successful stopping) trials, as is predicted by the race models. More importantly, we also demonstrated different pre-signal lateralized readiness potentials between the two types of trials and larger lateralized mu ERD in signal-respond than in signal-inhibit trials, suggesting that voluntarily-generated unimanual preparation affects stopping success. In addition to what is described in the race models of the stop-signal paradigm, the present results therefore demonstrated measures of pre-signal activations that could influence stopping success.

However, BCI performance varies considerably between users, the reasons for which are poorly understood. Here we investigated the relationship between sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI performance and brain structure. Participants were instructed to control a computer cursor using right-and left-hand motor imagery, which primarily modulated their left-and right-hemispheric SMR powers, respectively. Although most participants were able to control the BCI with success rates significantly above chance level even at the first encounter, they also showed substantial inter-individual variability in BCI success rate. Participants also underwent T1-weighted three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI data were subjected to voxel-based morphometry using BCI success rate as an independent variable. We found that BCI performance correlated with gray matter volume of the supplementary motor area, supplementary somatosensory area, and dorsal premotor cortex. We suggest that SMR-based BCI performance is associated with development of non-primary somatosensory and motor areas. Advancing our understanding of BCI performance in relation to its neuroanatomical correlates may lead to better customization of BCIs based on individual brain structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is unknown whether we use the same implicit process in attributing causality when observing others' actions as we do when making our own. The aim of this research was to investigate the neural processes involved in the implicit sense of agency we form between actions and effects, for both our own actions and when watching others' actions. Using an interval estimation paradigm to elicit intentional binding in self-made and observed actions, we measured the EEG responses indicative of anticipatory processes before an action and the ERPs in response to the sensory consequence. We replicated our previous findings that we form a sense of implicit agency over our own and others' actions. Crucially, EEG results showed that tones caused by either self-made or observed actions both resulted in suppression of the N1 component of the sensory ERP, with no difference in suppression between consequences caused by observed actions compared with self-made actions. Furthermore, this N1 suppression was greatest for tones caused by observed goal-directed actions rather than non-action or non-goal-related visual events. This suggests that top-down processes act upon the neural responses to sensory events caused by goal-directed actions in the same way for events caused by the self or those made by other agents.

The principal aims of the present study were the evaluation of: 1) the presence in covert actions as motor imagery of putative motor inhibitory mechanisms; 2) their underlying cerebral sources; 3) their differences or similarities with respect to cerebral networks underpinning the inhibition of overt actions during a Go/NoGo task. For these purposes, we performed a high density EEG study evaluating the cerebral microstates and their related sources elicited during two types of Go/NoGo tasks, requiring the execution or withholding of an overt or a covert imagined action, respectively. Our results show for the first time the engagement during motor imagery of key nodes of a putative inhibitory network (including pre-supplementary motor area and right inferior frontal gyrus) partially overlapping with those activated for the inhibition of an overt action during the overt NoGo condition. At the same time, different patterns of temporal recruitment in these shared neural inhibitory substrates are shown, in accord with the intended overt or covert modality of action performance. The evidence that apparently divergent mechanisms such as controlled inhibition of overt actions and contingent automatic inhibition of covert actions do indeed share partially overlapping neural substrates, further challenges the rigid dichotomy between conscious, explicit, flexible and unconscious, implicit, inflexible forms of motor behavioral control.

Recognition of such images may require an intuitive guess. We determined the spatial-temporal characteristics of intracranially-recorded gamma activity (at 50-120 Hz) augmented differentially by naming of ambiguous and unambiguous images. Methods: We studied 10 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery. Ambiguous and unambiguous images were presented during extraoperative electrocorticography recording, and patients were instructed to overtly name the object as it is first perceived. Results: Both naming tasks were commonly associated with gamma-augmentation sequentially involving the occipital and occipital-temporal regions, bilaterally, within 200 ms after the onset of image presentation. Naming of ambiguous images elicited gamma-augmentation specifically involving portions of the inferior-frontal, orbitofrontal, and inferior-parietal regions at 400 ms and after. Unambiguous images were associated with more intense gamma-augmentation in portions of the occipital and occipital-temporal regions. Conclusions: Frontal-parietal gamma-augmentation specific to ambiguous images may reflect the additional cortical processing involved in exerting intuitive guess. Occipital gamma-augmentation enhanced during naming of unambiguous images can be explained by visual processing of stimuli with richer detail. Significance: Our results support the theoretical model that guessing processes in visual domain occur following the accumulation of sensory evidence resulting from the bottom-up processing in the occipital-temporal visual pathways.

Catastrophising was previously associated with increased pain severity, emotional distress and disability in chronic pain patients, and is also a contributing factor in the development of neuropathic pain. To investigate the neural basis of how pain catastrophising affects pain observed in others, we acquired EEG data in groups of participants with high (High-Cat) or low (Low-Cat) pain catastrophising scores during viewing of pain scenes and graphically matched pictures not depicting imminent pain. The High-Cat group attributed greater pain to both pain and non-pain pictures. Source dipole analysis of even-trelated potentials during picture viewing revealed activations in the left (PHGL) and right (PHGR) paraphippocampal gyri, rostral anterior (rACC) and posterior cingulate (PCC) cortices. The late source activity (600-1100 ms) in PHGL and PCC was augmented in High-Cat, relative to Low-Cat, participants. Conversely, greater source activity was observed in the Low-Cat group during the mid-latency window (280-450 ms) in the rACC and PCC. Low-Cat subjects demonstrated a significantly stronger correlation between source activity in PCC and pain and arousal ratings in the long latency window, relative to high pain catastrophisers. Results suggest augmented activation of limbic cortex and higher order pain processing cortical regions during the late processing period in high pain catastrophisers viewing both types of pictures. This pattern of cortical activations is consistent with the distorted and magnified cognitive appraisal of pain threats in high pain catastrophisers. In contrast, high pain catastrophising individuals exhibit a diminished response during the midlatency period when attentional and top-down resources are ascribed to observed pain.

Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as smoothing) and filter artifacts. Method: We give some practical guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and frequency response) and the selection of filter types (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse response, FIR/IIR) and filter parameters (cutoff frequencies, filter order and roll-off, ripple, delay and causality) to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal distortions for selected electrophysiological applications. Results: Various filter implementations in common electrophysiology software packages are introduced and discussed. Resulting filter responses are compared and evaluated. Conclusion: We present strategies for recognizing common adverse filter effects and filter artifacts and demonstrate them in practical examples. Best practices and recommendations for the selection and reporting of filter parameters, limitations, and alternatives to filtering are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Studies of action inhibition largely investigated external stop signals, yet these are rare in everyday life. Instead healthy adults exert "self-control," implying an ability to decide internally to stop actions. We added "choose for yourself" stimuli to a conventional go/no-go task to compare reactive versus intentional action and inhibition. No-go reactions showed the N2 EEG potential characteristic of inhibiting prepotent motor responses, whereas go reactions did not. Interestingly, the N2 component was present for intentional choices both to act and also to inhibit. Thus, free choices involved a first step of intentionally inhibiting prepotent responses before generating or withholding an action. Intentional inhibition has a crucial role breaking the flow of stimulus-driven responding, allowing expression of volitional decisions. Even decisions to initiate self-generated actions require this prior negative form of volition, ensuring the "freedom from immediacy" characteristic of human behavior.

However, it is unclear whether ERD observed while attempting motor execution can be regarded as a neural marker that represents M1 excitability in survivors of severe stroke. Therefore we investigated the association between ERD and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal during attempted movement of a paralyzed finger in stroke patients. Nine chronic stroke patients received BCI training for finger extension movement 1 h daily for a duration of 1 month. The sensorimotor rhythm was recorded from the sensorimotor area of the damaged hemisphere, and ongoing amplitude variations were monitored using a BCI system. Either a visual alert or the action of a motor-driven orthosis was triggered in response to ERD of the sensorimotor rhythm while patients attempted extension movements of the paralyzed fingers. Inter-subject covariance between ERD and the BOLD response in the sensorimotor areas was calculated. After BCI training, an increased ERD over the damaged hemisphere was confirmed in all participants while they attempted extension of the affected finger and this increase was associated with a BOLD response in primary sensorimotor area. Whole-brain MRI revealed that the primary sensorimotor area and supplementary motor area were activated in the damaged hemisphere after 1 month of BCI training. ERD reflects the BOLD responses of the primary motor areas in either hemisphere while patients who have severe chronic hemiplegia due to a stroke attempt an extension movement of the paralyzed fingers. One month of BCI can alter motor-related brain area activation. Combining BCI with other methods to facilitate such changes may help to implement BCI for motor rehabilitation after stroke.

Sensitivity to Referential Ambiguity in Discourse: The Role of Attention, Working Memory, and Verbal Ability	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							THETA-POWER INCREASES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA-BAND; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EEG-ALPHA; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESOLUTION; CONTEXT	The establishment of reference is essential to language comprehension. The goal of this study was to examine listeners' sensitivity to referential ambiguity as a function of individual variation in attention, working memory capacity, and verbal ability. Participants listened to stories in which two entities were introduced that were either very similar (e.g., two oaks) or less similar (e.g., one oak and one elm). The manipulation rendered an anaphor in a subsequent sentence (e.g., oak) ambiguous or unambiguous. EEG was recorded as listeners comprehended the story, after which participants completed tasks to assess working memory, verbal ability, and the ability to use context in task performance. Power in the alpha and theta frequency bands when listeners received critical information about the discourse entities (e.g., oaks) was used to index attention and the involvement of the working memory system in processing the entities. These measures were then used to predict an ERP component that is sensitive to referential ambiguity, the Nref, which was recorded when listeners received the anaphor. Nref amplitude at the anaphor was predicted by alpha power during the earlier critical sentence: Individuals with increased alpha power in ambiguous compared with unambiguous stories were less sensitive to the anaphor's ambiguity. Verbal ability was also predictive of greater sensitivity to referential ambiguity. Finally, increased theta power in the ambiguous compared with unambiguous condition was associated with higher working-memory span. These results highlight the role of attention and working memory in referential processing during listening comprehension.

Technological advances allow for a novel wrist-worn device to continuously record electrodermal activity (EDA), a measure of pure sympathetic activity. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed to determine the yield of continuous EDA in patients treated with TH for coma after cardiac arrest during hypothermia and normothermia. Association between EDA parameters (event-related and nonspecific electrodermal responses (ER-EDR, NS-EDR)) and outcome measures (cerebral performance category [CPC]) (Full Outline in UnResponsivenss (FOUR) score) were assessed. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Total number of EDR (66.4 vs 12.0/24 h, p = 0.02), ER-EDR (39.5 vs 11.2/24 h, p = 0.009), median amplitude change of all EDR (0.08 vs 0.03 mu SI, p = 0.03) and ER-EDR (0.14 vs 0.05 mu SI, p = 0.025) were higher in patients with favorable (CPC 1-2) versus poor outcome (CPC 3-5) during hypothermia. Greater differences in EDA parameters were observed during hypothermia than normothermia. The FOUR score was correlated to the number of all EDR and median amplitudes. Conclusions: Continuous EDA potentially opens a new avenue for autonomic function monitoring in neurocritically ill patients. It is feasible in the ICU setting, even during hypothermic states. As a measure of a complete neurophysiological circuit, it may be a novel neurophysiologic biomarker of outcome after cardiac resuscitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined whether P50 gating deficits could help to discriminate individuals with APS and also those who are particularly likely to make a transition to psychosis. Method: 36 cases meeting PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation) criteria for the APS, all free of antipsychotics, and 60 controls performed an auditory conditioning-testing experiment while their electroencephalogram was recorded. The P50 ratio and its C-T difference were compared between groups. Subjects received follow-up for up to 2 years to determine their clinical outcome. Results: The P50 ratio was significantly higher and C-T difference lower in the APS group compared to controls. Of the individuals with APS who completed the follow-up (n = 36), nine (25%) developed psychosis. P50 ratio and the C-T difference did not significantly differ between those individuals who developed psychosis and those who did not within the APS group. Conclusion: P50 deficits appear to be associated with the pre-clinical phase of psychosis. However, due to the limitations of the study and its sample size, replication in an independent cohort is necessary, to clarify the role of P50 deficits in illness progression and whether this inexpensive and non-invasive EEG marker could be of clinical value in the prediction of psychosis outcomes amongst populations at risk.

Sustained attention and prediction are cognitive functions critical for optimizing sensory processing, and essential to efficiently adapt behaviors in an ever-changing world. The aim of the current study was to investigate the brain developmental trajectories of attentive and predictive processing through adolescence. We recorded EEG in 36 participants from the age of 12-24 years (three age groups: 12-14,14-17, 18-24 years) to target development during early and late adolescence, and early adulthood. We chose a visual target detection task which loaded upon sustained attention, and we manipulated target predictability. Continued maturation of sustained attention after age 12 was evidenced by improved performance (hits, false alarms (FAs) and sensitivity) in a detection task, associated with a frontal shift in the scalp topographies of the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) and P3 responses, with increasing age. No effect of age was observed on predictive processing, with all ages showing similar benefits in reaction time, increases in P3 amplitude (indexing predictive value encoding and memorization), increases in CNV amplitude (corresponding to prediction implementation) and reduction in target P3 latency (reflecting successful prediction building and use), with increased predictive content. This suggests that adolescents extracted and used predictive information to generate predictions as well as adults. The present results show that predictive and attentive processing follow distinct brain developmental trajectories: prediction abilities seem mature by the age of 12 and sustained attention continues to improve after 12-years of age and is associated with maturational changes in the frontal cortices.

Neuromarkers of anxiety and depression in a patient after neuro-ophthalmic surgery of the meningioma - effect of individually-tailored tDCS and neurofeedback	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						chronic pain; post-operative depression; pain	FRONTAL ALPHA ASYMMETRY	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of individually tailored anodal tDCs/neurofeedback protocol for the reduction of post-operative depression after a neuroophtalmological operation of the meningioma. The neuromarkers in Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event-related potentials (ERPs) were utilized in the construction of protocol and evaluation. Case description. A 45-year-old female after successful neuro-ophthalmic surgery of the meningioma, complained of severe pain and anxiety, difficulties with sleeping, attention and memory problems, as well as inability to continue working in her given profession. Neuropsychological testing showed lack of cognitive disturbances and post-operative depression. Two working hypotheses were tested to find neuromarkers of depression and anxiety. In line with the 'depression hypothesis' a frontal alpha asymmetry pattern was found in the patient, and in line with the 'anxiety' hypothesis an increased left temporal P1 wave in response to visual stimuli was found in ERPs. A specific alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol combined with an anodal tDCS was suggested. Twenty sessions of individually-tailored anodal tDCs/neurofeedback protocol were performed. The QEEG frontal asymmetry pattern and the excessive temporal P1 wave were normalized after the intervention. Conclusions. The patient recovered from post-operative depression and returned to work after 20 sessions of the combined neurofeedback/tDCS protocol. Specific patterns of QEEG and ERPs serve as neuromarkers for constructing the protocol and for monitoring the results of intervention.

Speakers are more likely to use sudden rises in pitch to arouse listener attention, rather than using falls; e.g., contrastive stress, questions seeking a response, beginnings of units of discourse, expressions of intense emotion, etc. The study evaluated whether there are brain responses that are more sensitive to stepwise raised vs. lowered spoken F0, and whether any such responses were also caused by pure tone stimuli. Three types of brain response were evaluated. Mismatch negativity (MMN), which reflects preattentive mechanisms, was only sensitive to degrees of F0 change, and not to direction. P300, which is an indicator of attention orientation, did not show sensitivity to F0 direction to nonspeech stimuli, but showed greater sensitivity to raised F0 than to lowered F0 in speech. lime frequency analysis of EEG data showed beta-band response in the right parietal area, when presented with spoken F0 elevation. Taken together, the P300 and beta band results suggest that attention modulation mechanisms are triggered when listeners are exposed to sudden rises in spoken F0. However, there was a lack of attention orientation response when non-speech F0 changes were presented, or when subjects were exposed to lowering of F0 in speech. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Arrays were presented with either automatic "pop-out" (bottom-up) or effortful "search" (top-down) behavior to younger and older participants. The phase-locking value was used to estimate coupling strength between scalp recordings. Behavioral performance decreased with age, with a greater age related decline in accuracy for the search than for the pop-out condition. Aging was associated with a declined coupling strength of theta and alpha frequency bands, with a greater age-related decline in whole-brain coupling values for the search than for the pop out condition. Specifically, prefronto-frontal coupling in theta- and alpha-bands, fronto-parietal and parieto-occipital couplings in beta-band for younger group showed a right hemispheric dominance, which was reduced with aging to compensate for the inhibitory dysfunction. While pop-out target detection was mainly associated with greater parieto-occipital beta coupling strength compared to search condition regardless of aging. Furthermore, prefronto-frontal coupling in theta-, alpha-, and beta-bands, and parieto-occipital coupling in beta-band functioned as predictors of behavior for both groups. Taken together these findings provide evidence that prefronto-frontal coupling of theta-, alpha-, and beta-bands may serve as a possible basis of aging during visual attention, while parieto-occipital coupling in beta-band could serve for a bottom-up function and be vulnerable to top-down attention control for younger and older groups.

Neural Signals Evoked by Stimuli of Increasing Social Scene Complexity Are Detectable at the Single-Trial Level and Right Lateralized	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; GAZE; PERCEPTION; P300; EYE; FACES; ATTENTION	Classification of neural signals at the single-trial level and the study of their relevance in affective and cognitive neuroscience are still in their infancy. Here we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of conditions of increasing social scene complexity using 3D human models as targets of attention, which may also be important in autism research. Challenging single-trial statistical classification of EEG neural signals was attempted for detection of oddball stimuli with increasing social scene complexity. Stimuli had an oddball structure and were as follows: 1) flashed schematic eyes, 2) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (only eye position changing), 3) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (head and eye position changing), 4) animated avatar alternated its gaze direction to the left and to the right (head and eye position), 5) environment with 4 animated avatars all of which change gaze and one of which is the target of attention. We found a late (> 300 ms) neurophysiological oddball correlate for all conditions irrespective of their complexity as assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. We attempted single-trial detection of this signal with automatic classifiers and obtained a significant balanced accuracy classification of around 79%, which is noteworthy given the amount of scene complexity. Lateralization analysis showed a specific right lateralization only for more complex realistic social scenes. In sum, complex ecological animations with social content elicit neurophysiological events which can be characterized even at the single-trial level. These signals are right lateralized. These finding paves the way for neuroscientific studies in affective neuroscience based on complex social scenes, and given the detectability at the single trial level this suggests the feasibility of brain computer interfaces that can be applied to social cognition disorders such as autism.

Evidence-based state of knowledge, current discussions and strategies for prevention and management	ANAESTHESIST			German	Article						Anesthesia complications; Unconsciousness; Anesthesia drug effects; EEG, end tidal anesthetic concentration; Anesthesia monitoring	AUDIT PROJECT NAP5; INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS; ACCIDENTAL AWARENESS; EXPLICIT RECALL	Patient awareness during general anesthesia and the later recall of what happened during surgery can be experienced by patients as horrifying events that leave lasting mental trauma in the form of posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSS). Awareness is related to a temporary insufficient depth of anesthesia. This phenomenon has been discussed for more than 20 years. According to randomized controlled studies, in the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in 1-2 per 1000 operations involving general anesthesia (0.1-0.2 %) and are classified as occasionally occurring critical events. An astonishing twist occurred elicited by the recent data from the 5th National Audit Project from Great Britain (NAP5) published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia and in Anaesthesia. The NAP5 evaluated patient reports of accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA) in a multicenter manner in more than 2.7 million cases and indicated incidences of awareness of only 1:19,600, a frequency 20 times less than previously reported. These results gave rise to some controversy. It seems likely that, due to the absence of structured interviews, the NAP5 data only demonstrated the tip of the iceberg and may have vastly underestimated the real incidence of intraoperative awareness. The present overview summarizes the current knowledge about awareness. Furthermore, it addresses the question whether the awareness problem has been overestimated by evidence-based criteria or underestimated by the results of the NAP5. The responsibility for sufficient anesthesia in the clinical routine requires knowledge of awareness risks and potential sequelae. A formal recommendation from the German Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) concerning awareness is not yet available; however, the recognition of evidence-based strategies in the management of anesthesia may minimize the occurrence of awareness and its sequelae.

Ignition's glow: Ultra-fast spread of global cortical activity accompanying local "ignitions" in visual cortex during conscious visual perception	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Consciousness; Visual awareness; Ignition; Visual cortex; ECoG; Global work-space; Subjective awareness	ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; ATTENTION; AWARENESS; HUMANS; ACCESS; V1	Despite extensive research, the spatiotemporal span of neuronal activations associated with the emergence of a conscious percept is still debated. The debate can be formulated in the context of local vs. global models, emphasizing local activity in visual cortex vs. a global fronto-parietal "workspace" as the key mechanisms of conscious visual perception. These alternative models lead to differential predictions with regard to the precise magnitude, timing and anatomical spread of neuronal activity during conscious perception. Here we aimed to test a specific aspect of these predictions in which local and global models appear to differ - namely the extent to which fronto-parietal regions modulate their activity during task performance under similar perceptual states. So far the main experimental results relevant to this debate have been obtained from non-invasive methods and led to conflicting interpretations. Here we examined these alternative predictions through large-scale intracranial measurements (Electrocorticogram - ECoG) in 43 patients and 4445 recording sites. Both ERP and broadband high frequency (50-150 Hz - BHF) responses were examined through the entire cortex during a simple 1-back visual recognition memory task. Our results reveal short latency intense visual responses, localized first in early visual cortex followed (at similar to 200 ms) by higher order visual areas, but failed to show significant delayed (300 ms) visual activations. By contrast, oddball image repeat events, linked to overt motor responses, were associated with a significant increase in a delayed (300 ms) peak of BHF power in fronto-parietal cortex. Comparing BHF responses with ERP revealed an additional peak in the ERP response - having a similar latency to the well-studied P3 scalp EEG response. Posterior and temporal regions demonstrated robust visual category selectivity. An unexpected observation was that high-order visual cortex responses were essentially concurrent (at similar to 200 ms) with an ultra-fast spread of signals of lower magnitude that invaded selected sites throughout fronto-parietal cortical areas. Our results are compatible with local models in demonstrating a clear task-dependence of the 300 ms fronto-parietal activation. However, they also reveal a more global component of low-magnitude and poor content selectivity that rapidly spreads into frontoparietal sites. The precise functional role of this global "glow" remains to be elucidated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Helen			Summary of recommendations for the management of infantile seizures: Task Force Report for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Infants; Seizures; Recommendations; Guidelines; Standard care; Optimal care	VAGUS-NERVE-STIMULATION; COMPLEX FEBRILE SEIZURES; MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; KETOGENIC DIET; UNPROVOKED SEIZURES; RISK-FACTORS; EPILEPTIC SYNDROMES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; WEST-SYNDROME; 1ST YEAR	Evidence-based guidelines, or recommendations, for the management of infants with seizures are lacking. A Task Force of the Commission of Pediatrics developed a consensus document addressing diagnostic markers, management interventions, and outcome measures for infants with seizures. Levels of evidence to support recommendations and statements were assessed using the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The report contains recommendations for different levels of care, noting which would be regarded as standard care, compared to optimal care, or state of the art interventions. The incidence of epilepsy in the infantile period is the highest of all age groups (strong evidence), with epileptic spasms the largest single subgroup and, in the first 2years of life, febrile seizures are the most commonly occurring seizures. Acute intervention at the time of a febrile seizure does not alter the risk for subsequent epilepsy (class 1 evidence). The use of antipyretic agents does not alter the recurrence rate (class 1 evidence), and there is no evidence to support initiation of regular antiepileptic drugs for simple febrile seizures (class 1 evidence). Infants with abnormal movements whose routine electroencephalography (EEG) study is not diagnostic, would benefit from video-EEG analysis, or home video to capture events (expert opinion, level U recommendation). Neuroimaging is recommended at all levels of care for infants presenting with epilepsy, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recommended as the standard investigation at tertiary level (level A recommendation). Genetic screening should not be undertaken at primary or secondary level care (expert opinion). Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personal at all levels of care (expert opinion). Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome, and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies, should be available in tertiary care (weak evidence, level C recommendation). Patients should be referred from primary or secondary to tertiary level care after failure of one antiepileptic drug (standard care) and optimal care equates to referral of all infants after presentation with a seizure (expert opinion, level U evidence). Infants with recurrent seizures warrant urgent assessment for initiation of antiepileptic drugs (expert opinion, level U recommendation). Infantile encephalopathies should have rapid introduction and increment of antiepileptic drug dosage (expert opinion, level U recommendation). There is no high level evidence to support any particular current agents for use in infants with seizures. For focal seizures, levetiracetam is effective (strong evidence); for generalized seizures, weak evidence supports levetiracetam, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, and clobazam; for Dravet syndrome, strong evidence supports that stiripentol is effective (in combination with valproate and clobazam), whereas weak evidence supports that topiramate, zonisamide, valproate, bromide, and the ketogenic diet are possibly effective; and for Ohtahara syndrome, there is weak evidence that most antiepileptic drugs are poorly effective. For epileptic spasms, clinical suspicion remains central to the diagnosis and is supported by EEG, which ideally is prolonged (level C recommendation). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is preferred for short-term control of epileptic spasms (level B recommendation), oral steroids are probably effective in short-term control of spasms (level C recommendation), and a shorter interval from the onset of spasms to treatment initiation may improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcome (level C recommendation). The ketogenic diet is the treatment of choice for epilepsy related to glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (expert opinion, level U recommendation). The identification of patients as potential candidates for epilepsy surgery should be part of standard practice at primary and secondary level care. Tertiary care facilities with experience in epilepsy surgery should undertake the screening for epilepsy surgical candidates (level U recommendation). There is insufficient evidence to conclude if there is benefit from vagus nerve stimulation (level U recommendation). The key recommendations are summarized into an executive summary. The full report is available as Supporting Information. This report provides a comprehensive foundation of an approach to infants with seizures, while identifying where there are inadequate data to support recommended practice, and where further data collection is needed to address these deficits.

Participants responded to a middle target letter flanked by compatible or incompatible flankers. The target was surrounded by a small or large circular cue which was presented simultaneously or 500 ms prior. Poor decoders showed a greater RT cost for incompatible stimuli preceded by large cues and less RT benefit for compatible stimuli. Poor decoders also showed reduced modulation of ERPs by cue-size at left hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and by flanker compatibility at right hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and frontal sites (N2), consistent with processing differences in fronto-parietal attention networks. These findings have potential implications for understanding the relationship between spatial attention and phonological decoding in dyslexia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the proposed method, FIR filter is designed by optimizing the integral squares in passband and stopband from ideal response such that the fractional derivatives of designed filter response become zero at a given frequency point. Lagrange multiplier method is exploited for finding the optimized filter coefficients. Optimal value of fractional derivative constraints for optimized filter coefficients are determined by minimizing the objective function constructed using a sum of maximum passband ripple and maximum stopband ripple in frequency domain using CS algorithm. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by passband error (phi(p)), stopband error (phi(s)), stopband attenuation (A(s)), maximum passband ripple (MPR), maximum stopband ripple (MSR) and CPU time. A comparative study of the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) for designing FIR filters using the proposed method is also made. (C) 2015 ISA.

The current study was conducted with football players to analyze these assumptions. Football players have trained with a series of bodily exercises for a month of period. Before and after the training, sustained attention and inhibition performances of experiment subjects and control group were assessed with a standard go/nogo task. The task was applied as both pre- and post-tests. Simultaneously with go/nogo task, EEG recordings with 16 channel were also taken. Thus, both behavioral and physiological assessments were able to be done. Results showed that training have improving effect on sustained attention and inhibition performances of subjects. Football players who had training showed higher performance on golnogo post-test than pre-test. On the other hand, football players who are not given any training did show no improvement on post-test. These results prove the assumption that complex motor exercises have improving effect on cognitive abilities, and they are also in concordance with literature.

Swedish word accents offer a prime testing ground to better understand this division. Although similar to lexical tones, word accents are determined by words' morphosyntactic structure, which enables listeners to use the tone at the beginning of a word to predict its grammatical ending. We recorded electrophysiological and hemodynamic brain responses to words where stem tones matched or mismatched inflectional suffixes. Tones produced brain potential effects after 136 ms, correlating with subject variability in average BOLD in left primary auditory cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Invalidly cued suffixes activated the left inferior parietal lobe, arguably reflecting increased processing cost of their meaning. Thus, interaction of word accent tones with grammatical morphology yielded a rapid neural response correlating in subject variability with activations in predominantly left-hemispheric brain areas.

Despite their efficacy and good safety profile however, none of these drugs represent the perfect solution to the treatment of this disorder. Therefore, there is still room for improvement of this class of drugs and for addressing still unmet clinical needs. Lorediplon is a new promising drug acting on the GABAA receptor currently under clinical evaluation which selectively binds to the alpha 1 subunit of the GABAA receptor. In animals, Lorediplon showed potent sedative effects and much less potent activity on inhibition of muscular tone. No development of tolerance was shown to the sedative effect of Lorediplon after 5 days continuous daily treatment. Preclinical in vivo studies also demonstrated that Lorediplon at hypnotic dose has a low risk of development of amnesia, next-day hangover effects, or development of physical dependence. The pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic profile of Lorediplon were evaluated in three clinical studies. After oral administration, the molecule is absorbed quickly with a dose-related linear profile and T-max around 2 h. In a phase advance model of insomnia in healthy human volunteers, Lorediplon, compared to Zolpidem, showed a longer lasting maintenance of sleep. The sleep induced by Lorediplon was rated by the subjects participating in the study as of improved quality while EEG recording in mice demonstrated that Lorediplon-induced sleep is less fragmented and more physiological than that induced by Zolpidem. Lorediplon also shows an excellent safety profile with a comparable to Zolpidem number of adverse events reported in clinical studies. Therefore, Lorediplon has the potential to become the best-in-class GABAA acting hypnotic and a major player in the treatment of insomnia and related disorders.

While it is well established that mental imagery can both exacerbate and alleviate acute and chronic pain, it is currently unknown how imagery mechanisms regulate pain perception. For example, studies to date have been unable to determine whether imagery effects depend upon a general redirection of attention away from pain or focused attentional mechanisms. To address these issues, we recorded subjective, behavioral and ERP responses using 64-channel EEG while healthy human participants applied a mental imagery strategy to decrease or increase pain sensations. When imagining a glove covering the forearm, participants reported decreased perceived intensity and unpleasantness, classified fewer high-intensity stimuli as painful, and showed a more conservative response bias. In contrast, when imagining a lesion on the forearm, participants reported increased pain intensity and unpleasantness, classified more low-intensity stimuli as painful, and displayed a more liberal response bias. Using a mass-univariate approach, we further showed differential modulation of the N2 potentials across conditions, with inhibition and facilitation respectively increasing and decreasing N2 amplitudes between 122 and 180 ms. Within this time window, source localization associated inhibiting vs. facilitating pain with neural activity in cortical regions involved in cognitive inhibitory control and in the retrieval of semantic information (i.e., right inferior frontal and temporal regions). In contrast, the main sources of neural activity associated with facilitating vs. inhibiting pain were identified in cortical regions typically implicated in salience processing and emotion regulation (i.e., left insular, inferior-middle frontal, supplementary motor and precentral regions). Overall, these findings suggest that the content of a mental image directly alters pain-related decision and evaluative processing to flexibly produce hypoalgesic and hyperalgesic outcomes.

Functional Roles of Neural Preparatory Processes in a Cued Stroop Task Revealed by Linking Electrophysiology with Behavioral Performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT; INHIBITION; COMPONENTS; SWITCH; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	It is well established that cuing facilitates behavioral performance and that different aspects of instructional cues evoke specific neural preparatory processes in cued task-switching paradigms. To deduce the functional role of these neural preparatory processes the majority of studies vary aspects of the experimental paradigm and describe how these variations alter markers of neural preparatory processes. Although these studies provide important insights, they also have notable limitations, particularly in terms of understanding the causal or functional relationship of neural markers to cognitive and behavioral processes. In this study, we sought to address these limitations and uncover the functional roles of neural processes by examining how variability in the amplitude of neural preparatory processes predicts behavioral performance to subsequent stimuli. To achieve this objective 16 young adults were recruited to perform a cued Stroop task while their brain activity was measured using high-density electroencephalography. Four temporally overlapping but functionally and topographically distinct cue-triggered event related potentials (ERPs) were identified: 1) A left-frontotemporal negativity (250-700 ms) that was positively associated with word-reading performance; 2) a midline-frontal negativity (450-800 ms) that was positively associated with color-naming and incongruent performance; 3) a left-frontal negativity (450-800 ms) that was positively associated with switch trial performance; and 4) a centroparietal positivity (450-800 ms) that was positively associated with performance for almost all trial types. These results suggest that at least four dissociable cognitive processes are evoked by instructional cues in the present task, including: 1) domain-specific task facilitation; 2) switch-specific task-set reconfiguration; 3) preparation for response conflict; and 4) proactive attentional control. Examining the relationship between ERPs and behavioral performance provides a functional link between neural markers and the cognitive processes they index.

In the present study, we investigated whether these N170 markers for Chinese, a very complex script, could emerge quickly after short-term learning (similar to 100 min) in young Chinese children, and whether early writing experience can enhance the acquisition of these neural markers for expertise. Two groups of preschool children received visual identification and free writing training respectively. Short-term character training resulted in selective enhancement of the N170 to characters, consistent with normal expert processing. Visual identification training resulted in increased N170 amplitude to characters in the right hemisphere, and N170 amplitude differences between characters and faces were decreased; whereas the amplitude difference between characters and tools increased. Writing training led to the disappearance of an initial amplitude difference between characters and faces in the right hemisphere. These results show that N170 markers for visual expertise emerge rapidly in young children after word learning, independent of the type of script young children learn; and visual identification and writing produce different effects.

LOC activation increases with proportion of symmetrical dots (pSymm) in a degraded display. In the current work, we recorded a posterior ERP called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN), which is relatively negative for symmetrical compared to random patterns. We predicted that SPN would also scale with pSymm, because it is probably generated by the LOC. Twenty-four participants viewed dot patterns with different levels of regularity: 0% regularity (full random configuration) 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% (full reflection symmetry). Participants judged if the pattern contained "some regularity" or "no regularity". As expected, the SPN amplitude increased with pSymm, while the latency and duration was the same in all conditions. The SPN was independent of the participant's decision, and it was present on some trials where people reported 'no-regularity'. We conclude that the SPN is generated at an intermediate stage of visual processing, probably in the LOC, where perceptual goodness is represented. This comes after initial visual analysis, but before subsequent decision stages, which apply a threshold to the analog LOC response. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Maternal anxiety and neural responses to infant faces	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Anxiety; Motherhood; Infant faces; N170; LPP	POSTPARTUM ANXIETY; FACIAL EXPRESSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PARENTAL STATUS; SOCIAL ANXIETY; BABY SCHEMA; MOTHERS; DEPRESSION; PERCEPTION; SYMPTOMS	Background: Women may be especially vulnerable to anxiety during the postpartum period and early infancy. However, little is known regarding the potential impact of maternal anxiety on the neural processing of infant-relevant information. Methods: In this ERP study, 47 recent mothers viewed neutral and distressed infant faces, concurrent with EEG collection. We examined the N170 as a perceptual marker of face processing and the late positive potential (LPP) as an index of engagement with stimulus processing. Mothers also completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: While the N170 was unaffected by infant affect and anxiety levels, the LPP was greater in amplitude for distressed vs. neutral faces. Moreover, the degree of LPP amplitude elicited by neutral infant faces was positively correlated with state anxiety. There were no associations between anxiety and the LPP elicited by distressed infant faces. Limitations: We employed self-report measures of state and trait anxiety symptomatology and including diagnostic classification of anxiety disorders will be important in future research. Conclusions: These results indicate that recent mothers with higher levels of state anxiety may be more engaged with processing neutral infant cues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How the Brain Interprets the Pregnant Pause in Conversation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; WORD RECOGNITION; TURN SILENCE; ERP EVIDENCE; COMPREHENSION; SENTENCES; CUES; ANTICIPATION; ORGANIZATION; SPEECH	In conversation, negative responses to invitations, requests, offers, and the like are more likely to occur with a delay-conversation analysts talk of them as dispreferred. Here we examine the contrastive cognitive load 'yes' and 'no' responses make, either when relatively fast (300 ms after question offset) or delayed (1000 ms). Participants heard short dialogues contrasting in speed and valence of response while having their EEG recorded. We found that a fast 'no' evokes an N400-effect relative to a fast 'yes'; however, this contrast disappeared in the delayed responses. 'No' responses, however, elicited a late frontal positivity both if they were fast and if they were delayed. We interpret these results as follows: a fast 'no' evoked an N400 because an immediate response is expected to be positive-this effect disappears as the response time lengthens because now in ordinary conversation the probability of a 'no' has increased. However, regardless of the latency of response, a 'no' response is associated with a late positivity, since a negative response is always dispreferred. Together these results show that negative responses to social actions exact a higher cognitive load, but especially when least expected, in immediate response.

J	Luft, CD; Bhattacharya, J				Luft, Caroline Di Bernardi; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Aroused with heart: Modulation of heartbeat evoked potential by arousal induction and its oscillatory correlates	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA; CARDIAC AWARENESS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; INTEROCEPTIVE SENSITIVITY; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; FLUCTUATIONS	Recent studies showed that the visceral information is constantly processed by the brain, thereby potentially influencing cognition. One index of such process is the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an ERP component related to the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP is sensitive to a number of factors such as motivation, attention, pain, which are associated with higher levels of arousal. However, the role of arousal and its associated brain oscillations on the HEP has not been characterized, yet it could underlie the previous findings. Here we analysed the effects of high-(HA) and low-arousal (LA) induction on the HEP. Further, we investigated the brain oscillations and their role in the HEP in response to HA and LA inductions. As compared to LA, HA was associated with a higher HEP and lower alpha oscillations. Interestingly, individual differences in the HEP modulation by arousal induction were correlated with alpha oscillations. In particular, participants with higher alpha power during the arousal inductions showed a larger HEP in response to HA compared to LA. In summary, we demonstrated that arousal induction affects the cortical processing of heartbeats; and that the alpha oscillations may modulate this effect.

Congenital prosopagnosia (cPA), a selective and lifelong impairment in familiar face recognition without evidence of an acquired cerebral lesion, offers a unique opportunity to support this fundamental hypothesis. However, in spite of the pronounced behavioural impairment, identification of a functionally relevant neural alteration in congenital prosopagnosia by electrophysiogical methods has not been achieved so far. Here we show that persons with congenital prosopagnosia can be distinguished as a group from unimpaired persons using magnetoencephalography. Early face-selective MEG-responses in the range of 140 to 200ms (the M170) showed prolonged latency and decreased amplitude whereas responses to another category (houses) were indistinguishable between subjects with congenital prosopagnosia and unimpaired controls. Latency and amplitude of face-selective EEG responses (the N170) which were simultaneously recorded were statistically indistinguishable between subjects with cPA and healthy controls which resolves heterogeneous and partly conflicting results from existing studies. The complementary analysis of categorical differences (evoked activity to faces minus evoked activity to houses) revealed that the early part of the 170ms response to faces is altered in subjects with cPA. This finding can be adequately explained in a common framework of holistic and part-based face processing. Whereas a significant brain-behaviour correlation of face recognition performance and the size of the M170 amplitude is found in controls a corresponding correlation is not seen in subjects with cPA. This indicates functional relevance of the alteration found for the 170ms response to faces in cPA and pinpoints the impairment of face processing to early perceptual stages.

Causal involvement of visual area MT in global feature-based enhancement but not contingent attentional capture	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Area MT; Frequency tagging; Frontoparietal network; Selective attention; Temporoparietal junction; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; CONTROL SETTINGS	When visual attention is set for a particular target feature, such as color or shape, neural responses to that feature are enhanced across the visual field. This global feature-based enhancement is hypothesized to underlie the contingent attentional capture effect, in which task-irrelevant items with the target feature capture spatial attention. In humans, however, different cortical regions have been implicated in global feature-based enhancement and contingent capture. Here, we applied intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to assess the causal roles of two regions of extrastriate cortex - right area MT and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) - in both global feature-based enhancement and contingent capture. We recorded cortical activity using EEG while participants monitored centrally for targets defined by color and ignored peripheral checkerboards that matched the distractor or target color. In central vision, targets were preceded by colored cues designed to capture attention. Stimuli flickered at unique frequencies, evoking distinct cortical oscillations. Analyses of these oscillations and behavioral performance revealed contingent capture in central vision and global feature-based enhancement in the periphery. Stimulation of right area MT selectively increased global feature-based enhancement, but did not influence contingent attentional capture. By contrast, stimulation of the right TPJ left both processes unaffected. Our results reveal a causal role for the right area MT in feature-based attention, and suggest that global feature-based enhancement does not underlie the contingent capture effect.

J	Beste, C; Kneiphof', J; Woitalla, D				Beste, Christian; Kneiphof', Janina; Woitalla, Dirk			Effects of fatigue on cognitive control in neurosarcoidosis	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Neurosarcoidosis; Response selection; Fatigue; EEG; Cognitive control; Proinflammatory cytokines	MENTAL FATIGUE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; RESPONSE SELECTION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; INTERLEUKIN-2-RECEPTOR; DEPRESSION	Fatigue is a usual reaction to prolonged performance but also a major symptom in various neuroimmunological diseases. In neurosarcoidosis fatigue is a core symptom, but little is known about the relevance of fatigue on cognitive functions in this disease. Previous results in healthy subjects suggest that fatigue strongly affects cognitive control processes. However, fatigue is not a uni-dimensional construct but consists of different facets. It is unknown which of these facets are most important for mechanisms of cognitive control. In the current study we investigate conflict monitoring and response selection processes in neurosarcoidosis patients as a 'model disease' of fatigue and healthy controls in relation to the impact of 'cognitive' and 'motor fatigue' on these processes using event-related potentials (ERPs). We focus on ERPs reflecting attentional selection (P1, N1) and conflict monitoring/response selection processes (N2). ERPs reflecting attentional selection processes were unchanged. The N2 on incompatible trials was reduced in neurosarcoidosis suggesting that response selection and conflict monitoring functions are dysfunctional. Of note, fatigue strongly modulates responses selection processes in conflicting situations (N2) in controls and neurosarcoidosis; but the effect of fatigue on these processes was stronger in neurosarcoidosis. Neuroimmunological parameters like TNF-alpha and soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum concentrations do not seem to modulate the pattern of results. Concerning fatigue it seems to be the 'cognitive' dimension and not the 'motor' dimension that is of relevance for the modulation of response selection in conflicting situations.

Localization of electrophysiological responses to semantic and syntactic anomalies in language comprehension with MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; SAM beamforming; ERF; N400m; Semantic; Syntax; Sentence comprehension	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG-ALPHA; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POWER INCREASES; SPEECH; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY	Syntactically and semantically anomalous words encountered during sentence comprehension are known to elicit dissociable electrophysiological responses, which are thought to reflect distinct aspects of language processing. However, the sources of these responses have not been well characterized. We used beamforming analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to map generators of electrophysiological responses to linguistic anomalies. Anomalous words occurred in the context of a sentence acceptability judgement task conducted in both visual and auditory modalities. Time-frequency analysis revealed that both kinds of violations elicited event-related synchronization (ERS) in the delta-theta frequency range (1-5 Hz), and desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-beta range (8-30 Hz). In addition, these responses were differentially modulated by violation type and presentation modality. 1-5 Hz responses were consistently localized within medial prefrontal cortex and did not vary significantly across violation types, but were stronger for visual presentation. In contrast, 8-30 Hz ERD occurred in different regions for different violation types. For semantic violations the distribution was predominantly in the bilateral occipital cortex and left temporal and inferior frontal regions, and these effects did not differ for visual and auditory presentation. In contrast, syntactic responses were strongly affected by presentation modality. Under visual presentation, syntactic violations elicited bilateral 8-30 Hz ERD extending into dorsal parietal and frontal regions, whereas effects were much weaker and mostly statistically insignificant in the auditory modality. These results suggest that delta-theta ERS reflects generalized increases in working memory demands related to linguistic anomaly detection, while alpha-beta ERD reflects specific activation of cortical regions involved in distinct aspects of linguistic processing, such as semantic vs. phonological short-term memory. Beamforming analysis of time-domain average signals (ERFs) revealed an N400m effect for semantic anomalies in both modalities, localized to left superior temporal and posterior frontal regions, and a later P600-like effect for syntactic anomalies in both modalities, widespread over bilateral frontal, posterior temporal, and parietal regions. These results indicate that time-domain averaged responses and induced oscillatory responses have distinct properties, including localization and modality dependence, and likely reflect dissociable and complementary aspects of neural activity related to language comprehension and additional task-related processes.

Given these impairments, the question arises as to whether motor and nonmotor deficits can be ameliorated similarly. We reason that a domain-general sensorimotor circuit involved in temporal processing may support the remediation of such deficits. Following findings that auditory cuing benefits gait kinematics, we explored whether reported language-processing deficits in IPD can also be remediated via auditory cuing. During continuous EEG measurement, an individual diagnosed with IPD heard two types of temporally predictable but metrically different auditory beat-based cues: a march, which metrically aligned with the speech accent structure, a waltz that did not metrically align, or no cue before listening to naturally spoken sentences that were either grammatically well formed or were semantically or syntactically incorrect. Results confirmed that only the cuing with a march led to improved computation of syntactic and semantic information. We infer that a marching rhythm may lead to a stronger engagement of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit that compensates dysfunctional striato-cortical timing. Reinforcing temporal realignment, in turn, may lead to the timely processing of linguistic information embedded in the temporally variable speech signal.

J	Cowell, JM; Decety, J				Cowell, Jason M.; Decety, Jean			The Neuroscience of Implicit Moral Evaluation and Its Relation to Generosity in Early Childhood	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; JUDGMENT; FAIRNESS; ERP; SENSITIVITY; ADOLESCENTS; POTENTIALS; INFANTS	Despite cultural and individual variation, humans are a judgmental bunch [1]. There is accumulating evidence for early social and moral evaluation as shown by research with infants and children documenting the notion that some behaviors are perceived as right and others are perceived as wrong [2]. Moreover, social interactions are governed by a concern for fairness and others' well-being [3, 4]. However, although generosity increases between infancy and late childhood, it is less clear what mechanisms guide this change [5]. Early predispositions toward prosociality are thought to arise in concert with the social and cultural environment, developing into adult morality, a complex incorporation of emotional, motivational, and cognitive processes [6, 7]. Using EEG combined with eye tracking and behavioral sharing, we investigated, for the first time, the temporal neurodynamics of implicit moral evaluation in 3- to 5-year-old children. Results show distinct early automatic attentional (EPN) and later cognitively controlled (N2, LPP) patterns of neural response while viewing characters engaging in helping and harming behaviors. Importantly, later (LPP), but not early (EPN), waveforms predicted actual generosity. These results shed light on theories of moral development by documenting the respective contribution of automatic and cognitive neural processes underpinning social evaluation and directly link these neural computations to prosocial behavior in children.

Moving Away From Error-Related Potentials to Achieve Spelling Correction in P300 Spellers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalogram; error-related potential (ErrP); noisy channel model; P300 speller	ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; PEOPLE	P300 spellers can provide a means of communication for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. However, its use as an effective communication tool is reliant on high P300 classification accuracies (>70%) to account for error revisions. Error-related potentials (ErrP), which are changes in EEG potentials when a person is aware of or perceives erroneous behavior or feedback, have been proposed as inputs to drive corrective mechanisms that veto erroneous actions by BCI systems. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that training an additional ErrP classifier for a P300 speller is not necessary, as we hypothesize that error information is encoded in the P300 classifier responses used for character selection. We perform offline simulations of P300 spelling to compare ErrP and non-ErrP based corrective algorithms. A simple dictionary correction based on string matching and word frequency significantly improved accuracy (35-185%), in contrast to an ErrP-based method that flagged, deleted and replaced erroneous characters (-47 - 0%). Providing additional information about the likelihood of characters to a dictionary-based correction further improves accuracy. Our Bayesian dictionary-based correction algorithm that utilizes P300 classifier confidences performed comparably (44-416%) to an oracle ErrP dictionary-based method that assumed perfect ErrP classification (43-433%).

J	Balas, B; Conlin, C				Balas, Benjamin; Conlin, Catherine			The Visual N1 Is Sensitive to Deviations from Natural Texture Appearance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IMAGE STATISTICS; PERCEPTION; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; REVERSAL; FACES; SHAPE	Disruptions of natural texture appearance are known to negatively impact performance in texture discrimination tasks, for example, such that contrast-negated textures, synthetic textures, and textures depicting abstract art are processed less efficiently than natural textures. Presently, we examined how visual ERP responses (the P1 and the N1 in particular) were affected by violations of natural texture appearance. We presented participants with images depicting either natural textures or synthetic textures made from the original stimuli. Both stimulus types were additionally rendered either in positive or negative contrast. These appearance manipulations (negation and texture synthesis) preserve a range of low-level features, but also disrupt higher-order aspects of texture appearance. We recorded continuous EEG while participants completed a same/different image discrimination task using these images and measured both the P1 and N1 components over occipital recording sites. While the P1 exhibited no sensitivity to either contrast polarity or real/synthetic appearance, the N1 was sensitive to both deviations from natural appearance. Polarity reversal and synthetic appearance affected the N1 latency differently, however, suggesting a differential impact on processing. Our results suggest that stages of visual processing indexed by the P1 and N1 are sensitive to high-order statistical regularities in natural textures and also suggest that distinct violations of natural appearance impact neural responses differently.

Face configuration affects speech perception: Evidence from a McGurk mismatch negativity study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Multisensory; Audiovisual; Speech perception; Face perception; Mismatch negativity; EEG	INVERSION; ORIENTATION; INFORMATION; ILLUSION; BRAIN; MMN	We perceive identity, expression and speech from faces. While perception of identity and expression depends crucially on the configuration of facial features it is less clear whether this holds for visual speech perception. Facial configuration is poorly perceived for upside-down faces as demonstrated by the Thatcher illusion in which the orientation of the eyes and mouth with respect to the face is inverted (Thatcherization). This gives the face a grotesque appearance but this is only seen when the face is upright. Thatcherization can likewise disrupt visual speech perception but only when the face is upright indicating that facial configuration can be important for visual speech perception. This effect can propagate to auditory speech perception through audiovisual integration so that Thatcherization disrupts the McGurk illusion in which visual speech perception alters perception of an incongruent acoustic phoneme. This is known as the McThatcher effect. Here we show that the McThatcher effect is reflected in the McGurk mismatch negativity (MMN). The MMN is an event-related potential elicited by a change in auditory perception. The McGurk-MMN can be elicited by a change in auditory perception due to the McGurk illusion without any change in the acoustic stimulus. We found that Thatcherization disrupted a strong McGurk illusion and a correspondingly strong McGurk-MMN only for upright faces. This confirms that facial configuration can be important for audiovisual speech perception. For inverted faces we found a weaker McGurk illusion but, surprisingly, no MMN. We also found no correlation between the strength of the McGurk illusion and the amplitude of the McGurk-MMN. We suggest that this may be due to a threshold effect so that a strong McGurk illusion is required to elicit the McGurk-MMN. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the temporal characteristics of cognitive control across conflict adaptation using prestimulus electroencephalogram oscillatory activity and an event-related potential component, N1. Prestimulus frontal (Fz) and posterior (01 and 02) alphal (7-9 Hz) and alpha2 (10-13 Hz) activities were enhanced in trials preceded by incompatible stimuli more than those preceded by compatible stimuli. Furthermore, there were significant differences of alpha2 current densities between previous trial compatibilities in the superior/medial frontal cortex. We suggested that the modulation of alpha activity by previous trial compatibility was associated with proactive attentional control. N1 amplitude was decreased in trials preceded by incompatible stimuli more than in those preceded by compatible stimuli. N1 current densities in the right inferior frontal cortex were smaller for an incompatible stimulus preceded by an incompatible stimulus than those preceded by a compatible stimulus, suggesting that demands of transient cognitive control induced by an incompatible stimulus were decreased by the proactive control. Moreover, correlational analysis showed that participants with a larger increase in alpha2 activity tended to have a larger decrease in N1 in trials preceded by incompatible stimulus. These findings revealed that the manner of cognitive control for the incompatible stimulus was transited from reactive control to proactive control across conflict adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Impaired Neural Response to Negative Prediction Errors in Cocaine Addiction	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						addiction; cocaine; event-related potentials; feedback negativity; reward-prediction error; self-medication	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; RISKY DECISION-MAKING; REWARD PREDICTION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; WORKING-MEMORY; DRUG-ADDICTION; TEMPORAL PREDICTION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Learning can be guided by unexpected success or failure, signaled via dopaminergic positive reward prediction error (+RPE) and negative reward-prediction error (-RPE) signals, respectively. Despite conflicting empirical evidence, RPE signaling is thought to be impaired in drug addiction. To resolve this outstanding question, we studied as a measure of RPE the feedback negativity (FN) that is sensitive to both reward and the violation of expectation. We examined FN in 25 healthy controls; 25 individuals with cocaine-use disorder (CUD) whotested positive for cocaine on the study day(CUD+), indicating cocaine use within the past 72 h; and in 25 individuals with CUD who tested negative for cocaine (CUD-). EEG was acquired while the participants performed a gambling task predicting whether they would win or lose money on each trial given three known win probabilities (25, 50, or 75%). FN was scored for the period in each trial when the actual outcome (win or loss) was revealed. A significant interaction between prediction, outcome, and group revealed that controls showed increased FN to unpredicted compared with predicted wins (i.e., intact + RPE) and decreased FN to unpredicted compared with predicted losses (i.e., intact - RPE). However, neither CUD subgroup showed FN modulation to loss (i.e., impaired - RPE), and unlike CUD + individuals, CUD - individuals also did not show FN modulation to win (i.e., impaired + RPE).

A large body of research has demonstrated dissociable representations of the near space immediately surrounding the body and the more distance far space. In this study, we investigated whether right hemisphere activations commonly reported for tasks involving spatial attention (such as the line bisection and landmark tasks) are specific to stimuli presented in near space. In separate blocks of trials, participants judged either whether a vertical transector was to the left or right of the centre of a line (landmark task) or whether the line was red or blue (colour task). Stimuli were seen from four distances (30, 60, 90, 120 cm). We used EEG to measure an ERP component (the 'line-bisection effect') specific to the direction of spatial attention (i.e., landmark minus colour). Consistent with previous results, spatial attention produced a right-lateralized negativity over occipito-parietal channels. The magnitude of this negativity was inversely related to viewing distance, being largest in near space and reduced in far space. These results suggest that the right occipito-temporal cortex may be specialized not just for the orientation of spatial attention generally, but specifically for orienting attention in the near space immediately surrounding the body.

Theta and Alpha Band Modulations Reflect Error-Related Adjustments in the Auditory Condensation Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; errors; time-frequency decomposition; theta oscillations; alpha oscillations; post-error adaptations; post-error trials	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EEG DYNAMICS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; GENERIC METHOD; CONFLICT; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION	Error commission leads to adaptive adjustments in a number of brain networks that subserve goal-directed behavior, resulting in either enhanced stimulus processing or increased motor threshold depending on the nature of errors committed. Here, we studied these adjustments by analyzing post error modulations of alpha and theta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Errors were followed by increased frontal midline theta (FMT) activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression in the parietal and the left central regions; parietal alpha suppression correlated with the task performance, left central alpha suppression correlated with the post-error slowing, and FMT increase correlated with both behavioral measures. On post-error correct trials, left-central alpha band suppression started earlier before the response, and the response was followed by weaker FMT activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression distributed over the entire scalp. These findings indicate that several separate neuronal networks are involved in post-error adjustments, including the midfrontal performance monitoring network, the parietal attentional network, and the sensorimotor network. Supposedly, activity within these networks is rapidly modulated after errors, resulting in optimization of their functional state on the subsequent trials, with corresponding changes in behavioral measures.

Emotion regulation has repeatedly been studied with emotional go/no-go paradigms. To date, no study has examined if the left-frontal hypoactivation associated with depression generalizes to active tasks. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the hemispheric asymmetry of the N2 component in depressed adolescents in an emotion regulation paradigm. MethodsTwenty-four adolescents diagnosed with major depression (age 11-18) and 30 healthy controls (age 11-18) performed two emotional go/no-go tasks exhibiting negative faces as go trials and positive faces as no-go trials and vice versa. ResultsOn the behavioral level, no significant group differences emerged. On the neural level, we found a more right-lateralized N2-amplitude in depressed subjects, while it was more left-lateralized in controls. Furthermore, both groups showed a less negative N2-amplitude to positive no-go stimuli. ConclusionThis study provides strong support for a general left-frontal hypoactivity in adolescent depression, which also applies to active emotional go/no-go paradigms. Furthermore, the less negative N2 to positive stimuli is consistent with a generally enhanced impulsivity of adolescents toward appetitive stimuli, which is possibly the base of the differential clinical pattern of adolescent in contrast to adult depression.

More broadly, we discussed cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) which constitutes a fundamental component in therapeutic interaction at many centres worldwide. Equally presented is a comprehensive model of rehabilitation, the fundamental component of which is CRT. It should be noted that the principles of this approach first arose in Poland in the 1970s, in other words, several decades before their appearance in other programmemes. Taken into consideration are four factors conditioning the effectiveness of such a process: comprehensiveness, earlier interaction, universality and its individualized character. A comprehensive programmeme of rehabilitation covers: cognitive rehabilitation, individual and group rehabilitation with the application of a therapeutic environment, specialist vocational rehabilitation, as well as family psychotherapy. These training programmemes are conducted within the scope of the 'Academy of Life,' which provides support for the patients in their efforts and shows them the means by which they can overcome existing difficulties. Equally emphasized is the close cooperation of the whole team of specialists, as well as the active participation of the family as an essential condition for the effectiveness of rehabilitation and, in effect, a return of the patient to a relatively normal life. Also presented are newly developing neurothechnologies and the neuromarkers of brain injuries. This enables a correct diagnosis to be made and, as a result, the selection of appropriate methods for neuropsychological rehabilitation, including neurotherapy.

Surprisingly little, however, is known about the possible role of oxytocin in processes required for social interactive behavior such as joint task performance. The current study investigated whether intranasal administration of oxytocin leads to increased self-other integration using a social Simon task. A placebo-controlled double-blind between-subjects design was used. Behavioral and EEG measures were obtained from 63 healthy male volunteers who either received 24 intranasal units (IU) oxytocin or a placebo while they performed the social Simon task in an individual and a joint/social context. The behavioral results demonstrated an enhanced Simon effect in the social context after oxytocin administration. At the electrophysiological level, the stimulus-locked N2 component, reflecting response conflict, was increased in the social compared to the individual context for Go trials, but only after oxytocin administration. The 93 component, reflecting response inhibition, was increased for social compared to individual contexts, irrespective of condition. Both the behavioral and N2 findings suggest that oxytocin enhances self-other integration. While more inhibition is needed in the social context, this process seems less sensitive to changes in self-other integration. To conclude, the current study is the first to show oxytocin-induced modulations of processes that play a central role in joint task performance and thus importantly adds to our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the diverse social effects of oxytocin.

Alcohol-Induced Changes in Conflict Monitoring and Error Detection as Predictors of Alcohol Use in Late Adolescence	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							GO/NO-GO TASK; SUBSTANCE USE; POTENTIAL REACTIVITY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; DRUG-USE; CUES; CONSUMPTION; INDIVIDUALS	Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the development of substance use and related problems. Understanding how exposure to drugs influences the adolescent brain could reveal mechanisms underlying risk for addiction later in life. In the current study, 87 adolescents (16-20-year olds; the local legal drinking age was I 6, allowing the inclusion of younger subjects than usually possible) underwent EEG measurements during a Go/No-Go task with and without alcohol cues; after placebo and a low dose of alcohol (0.45 g/kg), Conflict monitoring and error detection processes were investigated with the N2 and the error-related negativity (ERN) ERP components. Participants were followed-up after 6 months to assess changes in alcohol use. The NoGo-N2 was larger for alcohol cues and acute alcohol decreased the amplitude of the NoGo-N2 for alcohol cues. ERN amplitude was blunted for alcohol cues. Acute alcohol decreased the amplitude of the ERN, specifically for control cues. Furthermore, the differences in ERN for alcohol cues between the placebo and alcohol conditions predicted alcohol use 6 months later subjects who showed stronger blunting of the ERN after acute alcohol were more likely to return to more moderate drinking patterns. These results suggest that cues signalling reward opportunities might activate a go-response mode and larger N2 (detection of increased conflict) for these cues might be necessary for inhibition. The ERN results suggest a deficiency in the monitoring system for alcohol cues. Finally, a lack of alcohol-induced deterioration of error monitoring for cues with high salience might be a vulnerability factor for alcohol abuse in adolescents.

The present study investigated neurocognitive processes of learning to read after one year of schooling. We aimed to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying neural tuning for print that has been shown to play an important role for reading and dyslexia. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 68 (Swiss-)German monolingual first grade children (mean age: 7.6) performed a one-back task with different types of letter and false-font strings. Print tuning was indexed by the N1 difference in the ERPs between German words and false-font strings, while the N1 lexicality effect was indexed by the difference between German words and pseudowords. In addition, we measured reading fluency, rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, auditory memory span, and vocabulary. After one year of formal reading instruction N1 print tuning was clearly present at the group level, and could be detected at the individual level in almost 90% of the children. The N1 lexicality effect, however, could not be reliably found. On the cognitive level, next to word-reading fluency, vocabulary was also associated with N1 print tuning, but not measures reflecting phonological processing. These results demonstrate the presence of print tuning in the first year of reading acquisition and its development at the individual level. Moreover, individual differences in print tuning are not only related to word-reading fluency, but also to semantic knowledge, indicating that at early stages of learning to read the top-down modulation of print tuning is semantic rather than phonological in nature.

Brain signatures of perceiving a smile: Time course and source localization	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						facial expression; smile; temporospatial PCA; brain sources; lateralization	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; EXOGENOUS ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FACE; ERP; RESPONSES; FEATURES; FEARFUL	Facial happiness is consistently recognized faster than other expressions of emotion. In this study, to determine when and where in the brain such a recognition advantage develops, EEG activity during an expression categorization task was subjected to temporospatial PCA analysis and LAURA source localizations. Happy, angry, and neutral faces were presented either in whole or bottom-half format (with the mouth region visible). The comparison of part- versus whole-face conditions served to examine the role of the smile. Two neural signatures underlying the happy face advantage emerged. One peaked around 140 ms (left N140) and was source-located at the left IT cortex (MTG), with greater activity for happy versus non-happy faces in both whole and bottom-half face format. This suggests an enhanced perceptual encoding mechanism for salient smiles. The other peaked around 370 ms (P3b and N3) and was located at the right IT (FG) and dorsal cingulate (CC) cortices, with greater activity specifically for bottom-half happy versus non-happy faces. This suggests an enhanced recruitment of face-specific information to categorize (or reconstruct) facial happiness from diagnostic smiling mouths.

J	Rogenmoser, L; Elmer, S; Jancke, L				Rogenmoser, Lars; Elmer, Stefan; Jaencke, Lutz			Absolute Pitch: Evidence for Early Cognitive Facilitation during Passive Listening as Revealed by Reduced P3a Amplitudes	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; CODING STRATEGIES; CRITICAL PERIOD; RELATIVE PITCH; POTENTIAL ERP; TONE LANGUAGE; MUSICAL PITCH; BRAIN	Absolute pitch (AP) is the rare ability to identify or produce different pitches without using reference tones. At least two sequential processing stages are assumed to contribute to this phenomenon. The first recruits a pitch memory mechanism at an early stage of auditory processing, whereas the second is driven by a later cognitive mechanism (pitch labeling). Several investigations have used active tasks, but it is unclear how these two mechanisms contribute to AP during passive listening. The present work investigated the temporal dynamics of tone processing in AP and non-AP (NAP) participants by using EEG. We applied a passive oddball paradigm with between-and within-tone category manipulations and analyzed the MMN reflecting the early stage of auditory processing and the P3a response reflecting the later cognitive mechanism during the second processing stage. Results did not reveal between-group differences in MMN waveforms. By contrast, the P3a response was specifically associated with AP and sensitive to the processing of different pitch types. Specifically, AP participants exhibited smaller P3a amplitudes, especially in between-tone category conditions, and P3a responses correlated significantly with the age of commencement of musical training, suggesting an influence of early musical exposure on AP. Our results reinforce the current opinion that the representation of pitches at the processing level of the auditory-related cortex is comparable among AP and NAP participants, whereas the later processing stage is critical for AP. Results are interpreted as reflecting cognitive facilitation in AP participants, possibly driven by the availability of multiple codes for tones.

How to stop or change a motor response: Laplacian and independent component analysis approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Stop-signal task; Cognitive control; Laplacian; Independent component analysis	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; GO/NO-GO TASKS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; EEG DYNAMICS; SIGNAL TASK; RECOGNITION MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GENERIC METHOD; BASAL GANGLIA	Response inhibition is an essential control function necessary to adapt one's behavior. This key cognitive capacity is assumed to be dependent on the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. It is unresolved whether varying inhibitory demands engage different control mechanisms or whether a single motor inhibitory mechanism is involved in any situation. We addressed this question by comparing electrophysiological activity in conditions that require stopping a response to conditions that require switching to an alternate response. Analyses of electrophysiological data obtained from stop-signal tasks are complicated by overlapping stimulus-related activity that is distributed over frontal and parietal cortical recording sites. Here, we applied Laplacian transformation and independent component analysis (ICA) to overcome these difficulties. Participants were faster in switching compared to stopping a response, but we did not observe differences in neural activity between these conditions. Both stop-and change-trials Laplacian transformed ERPs revealed a comparable bilateral parieto-occipital negativity around 180 ms and a frontocentral negativity around 220 ms. ICA results suggested an inhibition-related frontocentral component which was characterized by a negativity around 200 ms with a likely source in anterior cingulate cortex. The data provide support for the importance of posterior mediofrontal areas in inhibitory response control and are consistent with a common neural pathway underlying stopping and changing of a motor response. The methodological approach proved useful to distinguish frontal and parietal sources despite similar timing and the ICA approach allowed assessment of single-trial data with respect to behavioral data.

One of the first steps in perception is processing of basic information such as spatial frequencies (SF), which represent details and global information. However, although behavioural perception of SF is well investigated, the developmental trajectory of the temporal characteristics of SF processing is not yet well understood. The speed of processing of this basic visual information is crucial, as it determines the speed and possibly accuracy of subsequent visual and social processes. The current study investigated developmental changes in the temporal characteristics of selective processing of high SF (HSF; details) versus low SF (LSF; global). To this end, brain activity was measured using EEG in 108 children aged 3-15 years, while HSF or LSF grating stimuli were presented. Interest was in the temporal characteristics of brain activity related to LSF and HSF processing, specifically at early (N80) or later (P1 or N2) peaks in brain activity. Analyses revealed that from 7-8 years onwards HSF but not LSF stimuli evoked an N80 peak. In younger children, aged 3-8 years, the visual manipulation mainly affected the visual N2 peak. Selective processing of HSF versus LSF thus occurs at a rather late time-point (N2 peak) in young children. Although behavioural research previously showed that 3-6 year-olds can perceive detailed information, the current results point out that selective processing of HSF versus LSF is still delayed in these children. The delayed processing in younger children could impede the use of LSF and HSF for emotional face processing. Thus, the current study is a starting point for understanding changes in basic visual processing which underlie social development.

Correspondingly, fMRI studies have found that, in addition to activity level [5, 6], the neural activation pattern similarity across repetitions (i.e., self-similarity) was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten items [7-9]. This self-similarity has been suggested to reflect pattern reinstatement due to study-phase retrieval [7, 10, 11]. However, the low temporal resolution of fMRI measures could determine neither the temporal precision of study-phase reinstatement nor the processing stage at which the reinstatement supported subsequent memory [12]. Meanwhile, although self-similarity has been shown to correlate with the activity level in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) [10, 13], a causal link between left LPFC function and pattern similarity remains to be established. Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and EEG, we found that greater spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) across repetitions of the same item (i.e., self-STPS) during encoding predicted better subsequent memory. The self-STPS located in the right frontal electrodes occurred approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset, reflected item-specific encoding, and contributed to memory above and beyond the effects of ERP amplitude and global pattern similarity (i.e., similarity to all other items in memory space). Anodal stimulation over the left LPFC specifically enhanced memory performance and item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes. These results support a causal role of LPFC in enhancing STPS and memory and contribute to a mechanistic understanding of memory formation.

This work has begun to yield new insights into fundamental questions about the nature of the mind and important clues about the origins of mental illness. In particular, this research demonstrates that stress, anxiety, and other kinds of emotion can profoundly influence key elements of cognition, including selective attention, working memory, and cognitive control. Often, this influence persists beyond the duration of transient emotional challenges, partially reflecting the slower molecular dynamics of catecholamine and hormonal neurochemistry. In turn, circuits involved in attention, executive control, and working memory contribute to the regulation of emotion. The distinction between the 'emotional' and the 'cognitive' brain is fuzzy and context-dependent. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that brain territories and psychological processes commonly associated with cognition, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and working memory, play a central role in emotion. Furthermore, putatively emotional and cognitive regions influence one another via a complex web of connections in ways that jointly contribute to adaptive and maladaptive behavior. This work demonstrates that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven in the fabric of the brain, suggesting that widely held beliefs about the key constituents of 'the emotional brain' and 'the cognitive brain' are fundamentally flawed. We conclude by outlining several strategies for enhancing future research. Developing a deeper understanding of the emotional-cognitive brain is important, not just for understanding the mind but also for elucidating the root causes of its disorders.

Social touch-based contact, particularly hand caressing, plays an important role in social bonding. Pre-programmed neural circuits likely support actions (or predispositions to act) toward caressing contacts. We searched for pre-set motor substrates toward caressing by exposing volunteers to bonding cues and having them gently stroke a very soft cloth, a caress-like movement. The bonding cues were pictures with interacting dyads and the control pictures presented non-interacting dyads. We focused on the readiness potential, an electroencephalographic marker of motor preparation that precedes movement execution. The amplitude of the readiness potential preceding the grasping of pleasant emotional-laden stimuli was previously shown to be reduced compared with neutral ones. Fingers flexor electromyography measured action output. The rationale here is that stroking the soft cloth when previously exposed to bonding cues, a compatible context, would result in smaller amplitudes of readiness potentials, as compared to the context with no such cues. Exposure to the bonding pictures increased subjective feelings of sociability and decreased feelings of isolation. Participants who more frequently engage in mutual caress/groom a "significant other" in daily life initiated the motor preparation earlier, reinforcing the caress-like nature of the task. As hypothesized, readiness potentials preceding the caressing of the soft cloth were significantly reduced under exposure to bonding as compared to control pictures. Furthermore, an increased fingers flexor electromyographic activity was identified under exposure to the former as compared to the latter pictures. The facilitatory effects are likely due to the recruitment of pre-set cortical motor repertoires related to caress-like movements, emphasizing the distinctiveness of neural signatures for caress-like movements.

Two mechanisms underlying this may be temporal attending and temporal prediction. Temporal fluctuations in attentional resources may influence the processing of rhythmic events by heightening sensitivity at metrically strong positions. Temporal predictions may attenuate responses to events that are highly expected within a metrical structure. In the current study we aimed to disentangle these two mechanisms by examining responses to unexpected sounds, using intensity increments and decrements as deviants. Temporal attending was hypothesized to lead to better detection of deviants in metrically strong (on the beat) than weak (offbeat) positions due to heightened sensitivity on the beat. Temporal prediction was hypothesized to lead to best detection of increments in offbeat positions and decrements on the beat, as they would be most unexpected in these positions. We used a speeded detection task to measure detectability of the deviants under attended conditions (Experiment 1). Under unattended conditions (Experiment 2), we used EEG to measure the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component known to index the detectability of unexpected auditory events. Furthermore, we examined the amplitude of the auditory evoked P1 and N1 responses, which are known to be sensitive to both attention and prediction. We found better detection of small increments in offbeat positions than on the beat, consistent with the influence of temporal prediction (Experiment 1). In addition, we found faster detection of large increments on the beat as opposed to offbeat (Experiment 1), and larger amplitude P1 responses on the beat as compared to offbeat, both in support of temporal attending (Experiment 2). As such, we showed that both temporal attending and temporal prediction shape our processing of metrical rhythm.

C	Brooks, AL			IEEE	Brooks, Anthony L.			Sensors for the Senses: Meaning-making via self-active entertainment experiences Keynote	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment	JUN 10-12, 2015	Torino, ITALY			sensor-based systems; human-computer interaction; human science; art; video games; healthcare; rehabilitation		In his ACM Computers in Entertainment article, titled "Artist and Audience: Emerging the Nano-entertainment experience" [1], the author posited on how Inhabited Information Spaces, created as core catalyst of research, may be questioned as a multisensory future virtual work of art. This themed Human-Computer Interaction for Entertainment contribution for the EAI INTETAIN 2015 conference builds upon the earlier work by questioning meaning making from such self-active entertainment experiences. Contextually, self-active relates to actor empowerment via ICT, whilst entertainment refers to HCI paradigms that are fun, engaging, and enjoyable. Conceptualizing, designing and realizing alternative digital media entertainment situations in stage performance, interactive installations and exhibitions at leading Museums for Modern Art, National and International major events, contributed to development of a sensor-based system conceived as a platform to investigate meaning making having societal impact beyond art. The system involves arrays of selectable sensor profiles mixed and matched according to requirements. Sensing of human input can be through worn (biosignal e.g. EEG, ECG, EMG, GSR), held, and/or non-worn sensors (volumetric, linear and planar interface profiles). Mapping of sourced human data is to a variety of digital content including art-based (music making, digital painting, lighting effects), video games, Virtual Reality and robotic devices. System adaptability promotes participant profile matching e.g. according to desired outcome. All ages and abilities are potential users. Preceding the commonly known camera-based game controllers such as EyeToy, Wii, and Kinect; the SoundScapes Virtual Interactive Space [2] system has been used in institutes, hospitals and clinics to empower people with impairment to unconsciously push their limits of functionality via creative and playful expression. Rehabilitation is less mundane and boring, where variety of ICT-based intervention motivates whilst offering creative opportunities for facilitators. Additionally, in a randomized intervention study with frail elderly patients, Hagedorn and Holm reported significant clinical rehabilitation impact up to 400% in the ICT feedback training specific performance [3]. This work highlights how co-informing paradigms between computer and human science and art, games and healthcare, can result in societal impact as well as commercial patented product and industry start-ups. At the core of the research is a rethinking in the way a human interacts with ICT. Current research explores a concept of dynamic air and alternative physical-virtual environments. Conclusions introduce a suggested need of increased researcher awareness of post-research effect following intervention/trials within healthcare and rehabilitation.

Multiple behavioral and electrophysiological studies have revealed the cognitive and neural mechanisms supporting adults selective attention of visual percepts for encoding in VWM. However, research on children is more limited. What are the neural mechanisms involved in children's selection of incoming percepts in service of VWM? Do these differ from the ones subserving adults selection? Ten-year-olds and adults used a spatial arrow cue to select a colored item for later recognition from an array of four colored items. The temporal dynamics of selection were investigated through EEG signals locked to the onset of the memory array. Both children and adults elicited significantly more negative activity over posterior scalp locations contralateral to the item to for encoding (N2pc). However, this activity was elicited later and for longer in children compared to adults. Furthermore, although children as a group did not elicit a significant N2pc during the time window in which N2pc was elicited in adults, the magnitude of N2pc during the "adult time-window" related to their behavioral performance during the later recognition phase of the task. This in turn highlights how children's neural activity subserving attention during encoding relates to better subsequent VWM performance. Significant differences were observed when children were divided into groups of high vs. low VWM capacity as a function of cueing benefit. Children with large cue benefits in VWM capacity elicited an adult-like contralateral negativity following attentional selection of the to-be-encoded item, whereas children with low VWM capacity did not These results corroborate the close coupling between selective attention and VWM from childhood and elucidate further the attentional mechanisms constraining VWM performance in children.

N400-like responses to three-chord harmonic sequences with unexpected out-of-key endings: scalp topography, cortical sources, and perspectives for a clinical use	ARCHIVES ITALIENNES DE BIOLOGIE			English	Article						Music; Musical chords; Priming; N400; Cortical sources; Consciousness	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX; DEFAULT MODE; MUSIC; LANGUAGE; EEG; P300; DISORDERS; N400	A series of ERP components, each provided with both a precise timing with respect to stimulation and a specific cortical localization, reflects the temporal succession of processing stages of music information. This makes the musical stimulus potentially usable to probe residual brain functions in non-communicating patients with disorders of consciousness. In an attempt to find a simple stimulation protocol that was suitable for use in a clinical setting, the purpose of this study was to verify whether a minimum-length musical stimulus, provided with a definite music-syntactic connotation, was still able to elicit musical ERPs in a group of eight healthy subjects. The stimulus was composed of the minimum number of chords necessary and sufficient to enable the subject to predict a plausible closure of the sequence (priming) and, at the same time, to provide him/her with the closing chord of the sequence (target), either congruous (probable closing) or not (improbable closing) to the tonal context. The subject's task was to discriminate and recognize the irregular targets. The components that were expected to be elicited, in this experimental situation, were ERAN N5, P600/LPC. Conversely, in addition to these former components, we unexpectedly observed a N400-like component. To determine whether this component was a real N400, we submitted our data to a sLORETA analysis in order to identify its cortical generators. Irregular chords showed higher current densities with respect to regular ones on the right-sided medial and superior temporal gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, and on the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. In particular, the N400-like wave seems to share with the word-primed music-elicited N400 certain generators that are located in cortical areas BA 21/37 and BA 22. This suggests that even chord-primed chord targets can convey extra-musical meanings and that, consequently, they might be useful in assessing residual higher-order information-processing capabilities in non-communicating patients with disorders of consciousness.

Ad-hoc and context-dependent adjustments of selective attention in conflict control: An ERP study with visual probes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Flanker task; Visual evoked potentials (VEP); Cognitive control; Selective attention; N200	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; TASK-RELEVANT; FLANKER TASK; STIMULUS; INFORMATION; SUPPRESSION	Cognitive conflict control in flanker tasks has often been described using the zoom-lens metaphor of selective attention. However, whether and how selective attention - in terms of suppression and enhancement - operates in this context has remained unclear. To examine the dynamic interplay of selective attention and cognitive control we used electrophysiological measures and presented task-irrelevant visual probe stimuli at foveal, parafoveal, and peripheral display positions. Target-flanker congruency varied either randomly from trial to trial (mixed-block) or block-wise (fixed-block) in order to induce reactive versus proactive control modes, respectively. Three EEG measures were used to capture ad-hoc adjustments within trials as well as effects of context-based predictions: the N1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP) to probes, the VEP to targets, and the conflict-related midfrontal N2 component. Results from probe-VEPs indicate that enhanced processing of the foveal target rather than suppression of the peripheral flankers supports interference control. In incongruent mixed-block trials VEPs were larger to probes near the targets. In the fixed-blocks probe-VEPs were not modulated, but contrary to the mixed-block the preceding target-related VEP was affected by congruency. Results of the control-related N2 reveal largest amplitudes in the unpredictable context, which did not differentiate for stimulus and response incongruency. In contrast, in the predictable context, N2 amplitudes were reduced overall and differentiated between stimulus and response incongruency. Taken together these results imply that predictability alters interference control by a reconfiguration of stimulus processing. During unpredictable sequences participants adjust their attentional focus dynamically on a trial-by-trial basis as reflected in congruency-dependent probe-VEP-modulation. This reactive control mode also elicits larger N2 amplitudes. In contrast, when task demands are predictable, participants focus selective attention earlier as reflected in the target-related VEPs. This proactive control mode leads to smaller N2 amplitudes and absent probe effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition to chronic stress in social and work environments, physical and chemical exposures at home, at work, and during leisure activities are causal or contributing environmental stressors that deserve attention by the general practitioner as well as by all other members of the health care community. It seems certainly necessary now to take "new exposures" like electromagnetic field (EMF) into account. Physicians are increasingly confronted with health problems from unidentified causes. Studies, empirical observations, and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. Individual susceptibility and environmental factors are frequently neglected. New wireless technologies and applications have been introduced without any certainty about their health effects, raising new challenges for medicine and society. For instance, the issue of so-called non-thermal effects and potential long-term effects of low-dose exposure were scarcely investigated prior to the introduction of these technologies. Common EMF sources include Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones including their base stations, Bluetooth devices, ELF magnetic fields from net currents, ELF electric fields from electric lamps and wiring close to the bed and office desk. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that long-term-exposure to certain EMF exposures is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease and male infertility. On the other hand, the emerging electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities, disability administrators and case workers, politicians, as well as courts of law. We recommend treating EHS clinically as part of the group of chronic multisystem illnesses (CMI) leading to a functional impairment (EHS), but still recognizing that the underlying cause remains the environment. In the beginning, EHS symptoms often occur only occasionally, but over time they may increase in frequency and severity. Common EHS symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleeping problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue and flu-like symptoms. A comprehensive medical history, which should include all symptoms and their occurrences in spatial and temporal terms and in the context of EMF exposures, is the key to the diagnosis. The EMF exposure can be assessed by asking for typical sources like Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones and measurements at home and at work. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure, that is, reducing or eliminating all sources of EMF at home and in the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). If a detrimental EMF exposure is reduced sufficiently, the body has a chance to recover and EHS symptoms will be reduced or even disappear. Many examples have shown that such measures can prove effective. Also the survival rate of children with leukemia depends on ELF magnetic field exposure at home. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the broad range of other environmental factors that contribute to the total body burden should also be addressed. Anything that supports a balanced homeostasis will increase a person's resilience against disease and thus against the adverse effects of EMF exposure. There is increasing evidence that EMF exposure has a major impact on the oxidative and nitrosative regulation capacity in affected individuals. This concept also may explain why the level of susceptibility to EMF can change and why the number of symptoms reported in the context of EMF exposures is so large. Based on our current understanding, a treatment approach that minimizes the adverse effects of peroxynitrite - as has been increasingly used in the treatment of multisystem disorders - works best. This EMF Guideline gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding EMF-related health risks and provides concepts for the diagnosis and treatment and accessibility measures of EHS to improve and restore individual health outcomes as well as for the development of strategies for prevention.

Mental Schemas Hamper Memory Storage of Goal-Irrelevant Information	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						episodic memory; schemas; EEG; congruency; old/new effect	EPISODIC MEMORIES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DIVIDED ATTENTION; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; RECOLLECTION; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL; ERP; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL	Mental schemas exert top-down control on information processing, for instance by facilitating the storage of schema-related information. However, given capacity-limits and competition in neural network processing, schemas may additionally exert their effects by suppressing information with low momentary relevance. In particular, when existing schemas suffice to guide goal-directed behavior, this may actually reduce encoding of the redundant sensory input, in favor of gaining efficiency in task performance. The present experiment set out to test this schema induced shallow encoding hypothesis. Our approach involved a memory task in which faces had to be coupled to homes. For half of the faces the responses could be guided by a pre-learned schema, for the other half of the faces such a schema was not available. Memory storage was compared between schema-congruent and schema-incongruent items. To characterize putative schema effects, memory was assessed both with regard to visual details and contextual aspects of each item. The depth of encoding was also assessed through an objective neural measure: the parietal old/new ERR effect. This ERR effect, observed between 500-800 ms post-stimulus onset, is thought to reflect the extent of recollection: the retrieval of a vivid memory, including various contextual details from the learning episode. We found that schema-congruency induced substantial impairments in item memory and even larger ones in context memory. Furthermore, the parietal old/new ERR effect indicated higher recollection for the schema-incongruent than the schema-congruent memories. The combined findings indicate that, when goals can be achieved using existing schemas, this can hinder the in-depth processing of novel input, impairing the formation of perceptually detailed and contextually rich memory traces. Taking into account both current and previous findings, we suggest that schemes can both positively and negatively bias the processing of sensory input. An important determinant in this matter is likely related to momentary goals, such that mental schemas facilitate memory processing of goal-relevant input, but suppress processing of goal-irrelevant information. Highlights - Schema-congruent information suffers from shallow encoding. - Schema congruency induces poor item and context memory. - The parietal old/new effect is less pronounced for schema-congruent items. - Schemas exert different influences on memory formation depending on current goals.
