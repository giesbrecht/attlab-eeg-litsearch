Presently, classification of BCI classes is limited due to consideration of several trials of ERP as average case for generalisation or some time single-trial ERP detection is preferred for subject specific schemes. Present study tries to develop a methodology for utilisation of co-variant nature of ERP, based on the sub-band decomposed ERPs. Proposed idea also explores a new dimension in BCI system design, as multi-class classification for execution of multiple commands through single ERP. Sub-band ERPs and their power spectrum-based features are extracted and classified successfully with 70.64% accuracy using artificial neural network.

EEG is contaminated by artefacts that degrade ERP classification performance. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is normally employed to decompose EEG into independent components (ICs) associated to artefact and non-artefact sources. Sources identified as artefacts are removed and a cleaned EEG is reconstructed. This paper presents an alternative use of ICA for the EEG signal to extract ERP feature rather than artefact reduction. Average ERP classification accuracy increases by 15%, to 83.9%, on clinical-grade EEG data from 9 participants, when compared to similar approaches with cleaned EEG. Additionally, the proposed method obtained better performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art xDAWN method.

In contrast with the subjective evaluation, a novel method based on electroencephalography (EEG) is proposed to explore the possibility of quantifying tactile sensation in an objective way. The proposed experiments adopt cutaneous electrical stimulation to generate two kinds of sensations (vibration and pressure) with three grades (low/medium/strong) on eight subjects. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) are extracted from EEG, which are used as evaluation indexes to distinguish between vibration and pressure, and also to discriminate sensation grades. Results show that five-phase P1-N1-P2-N2-P3 deflection is induced in EEG. Using amplitudes of latter ERP components (N2 and P3), vibration and pressure sensations can be discriminated on both individual and grand-averaged ERP (p < 0.05). The grand-average ERPs can distinguish the three sensations grades, but there is no significant difference on individuals. In addition, ERS/ERD features of mu rhythm (8 13Hz) are adopted. Vibration and pressure sensations can be discriminated on grand-average ERS/ERD (p < 0.05), but only some individuals show significant difference. The grand-averaged results show that most sensation grades can be differentiated, and most pairwise comparisons show significant difference on individuals (p < 0.05). The work suggests that ERP- and ERS/ERD-based EEG features may have potential to quantify tactile sensations for medical diagnosis or engineering applications.

In this study, we studied the brain fatigue induced during a 3 hours mental arithmetic task using electroencephalography (EEG) power indices and P300 component of event-related potential (ERP). In two different states such as before or after the mental arithmetic, the behavior response and EEG measures were conducted, and the ERPs induced from an oddball task were acquired on six subjects. The results show that the accuracy and reaction times, the EEG alpha, theta and beta, the amplitude of P300 wave of event-related potential (ERP) are significantly different before and after finishing the mental arithmetic. These metrics are possible indices for measuring simulated mental fatigue. With the deepening of brain fatigue, the cognitive information processing speed and the brain arousal level will decrease, and the damage on cognitive information processing ability is insignificant over a short period of time. In contrast, the impact of mental fatigue on alertness is more obvious and direct.

J	Zou, Y; Nathan, V; Jafari, R				Zou, Yuan; Nathan, Viswam; Jafari, Roozbeh			Automatic Identification of Artifact-Related Independent Components for Artifact Removal in EEG Recordings	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electrode-scalp impedance; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); hierarchical clustering; independent component analysis (ICA)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE; ICA	Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity produced by the firing of neurons within the brain. These activities can be decoded by signal processing techniques. However, EEG recordings are always contaminated with artifacts which hinder the decoding process. Therefore, identifying and removing artifacts is an important step. Researchers often clean EEG recordings with assistance from independent component analysis (ICA), since it can decompose EEG recordings into a number of artifact-related and event-related potential (ERP)-related independent components. However, existing ICA-based artifact identification strategies mostly restrict themselves to a subset of artifacts, e.g., identifying eye movement artifacts only, and have not been shown to reliably identify artifacts caused by nonbiological origins like high-impedance electrodes. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm for the identification of general artifacts. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: 1) an event-related feature-based clustering algorithm used to identify artifacts which have physiological origins; and 2) the electrodescalp impedance information employed for identifying nonbiological artifacts. The results on EEG data collected from ten subjects show that our algorithm can effectively detect, separate, and remove both physiological and nonbiological artifacts. Qualitative evaluation of the reconstructed EEG signals demonstrates that our proposed method can effectively enhance the signal quality, especially the quality of ERPs, even for those that barely display ERPs in the raw EEG. The performance results also show that our proposed method can effectively identify artifacts and subsequently enhance the classification accuracies compared to four commonly used automatic artifact removal methods.

The quality of the signal is dependent on several factors, including the selection of the amplifier system and electrode type. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of two electrode types, active and passive, with their respectively optimized amplifier system, in distinguishing an ERP signal. The QuickAmp system was used with passive electrodes, while the ActiCHamp was used with active electrodes. EEG data were recorded by the two amplifier systems in different experimental sessions. In each experimental session, the same participant listened to the same set of acoustically controlled English sentences. Data were obtained from the participant via a 32-channel Easycap (10-20 configuration), through the amplifier, to the BrainVision signal recording software. Based on the analysis using EEGlab, it appears that ActiCHamp reduced noise power, but also yielded lower signal power. The results are preliminary, being from a single participant, but suggest both electrode types can yield comparable signal-to-noise ratios.

Twenty-one participants first studied 40 face-name (FN) pairs; 20 were presented four times (4R) and 20 were shown once (1R). Recognition memory was assessed by asking participants to make old/new judgments for 80 FN pairs, of which half were previously studied items and half were novel FN pairs (N). Simultaneous EEG and ET recording were collected during recognition trials. Comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs) for correctly identified FN pairs were compared across the three item types revealing classic ERP old/new effects including 1) relative positivity (1R > N) bi-frontally from 300 to 500 ms, reflecting enhanced familiarity, 2) relative positivity (4R > 1R and 4R > N) in parietal areas from 500 to 800 ms, reflecting enhanced recollection, and 3) late frontal effects (1R > N) from 1000 to 1800 ms in right frontal areas, reflecting post-retrieval monitoring. ET analysis also revealed significant differences in eye movements across conditions. Exploration of cross-modality relationships suggested associations between memory and executive function measures and the three ERP effects. Executive function measures were associated with several indicators of saccadic eye movements and fixations, which were also associated with all three ERP effects. This novel characterization of face-name recognition memory performance using simultaneous EEG and ET reproduced classic ERP and ET effects, supports the construct validity of the multimodal FN paradigm, and holds promise as an integrative tool to probe brain networks supporting memory and executive functioning.

Specifically during the initial design of a BCI, a simulation framework that could replicate the operational performance of the system would be a useful tool for designers to make design choices. In this manuscript, we develop a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic simulation framework for electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI design. We employ one event-related potential (ERP) based typing and one steady-state evoked potential (SSVEP) based control interface as testbeds. We compare the results of simulations with real-time experiments. Even though over-and underestimation of the performance is possible, the statistical results over the Monte Carlo simulations show that the developed framework generally provides a good approximation of the real-time system performance.

It is based on eliciting and detecting event-related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, in response to rare target stimulus events. One of the challenges to fast and reliable communication is the fact that the P300-based ERP has a refractory period that induces temporal dependence in the user's EEG responses. Refractory effects negatively affects the performance of the speller. The contribution of this paper is to provide a model for the P300 speller as a communication process with memory to account for refractory effects. Using this model, we design codebooks that maximize the mutual information rate between the user's desired characters and the measured EEG responses to the stimulus events. We show simulation results that compare our codebook with other codebooks described in literature.

J	Yu, JH; Sim, KB				Yu, Je-Hun; Sim, Kwee-Bo			Classification of color imagination using Emotiv EPOC and event-related potential in electroencephalogram	OPTIK			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Event-related potential (ERP); Arduino; Emotiv EPOC; Artificial neural network	TRIAL	In this paper, we proposed a method that classifies electroencephalography (EEG) from color imagination data using the Emotiv EPOC headset. For EEG measurement and the event-related potential (ERP) method, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems were used in the experiment. In the experiment, the subjects gaze at a non-flicker visual stimulus of color (i.e., red, green, blue, white, and yellow) and then proceed to imagine the color. To concentrate on the LED light, all experiments were performed in a dimly lit room. The flickered visual stimulus was made using an Arduino microcontroller board and LEDs with the purpose of prompting color imagination. As a result, we obtained significant EEG responses of thoughts related to certain colors. The EEG response is classified using classification algorithms including a support vector machine (SVM) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), an artificial neural network (ANN) with LDA, and an ANN without LDA. In addition, fivefold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance. From the results, we found robust electrodes (T7 and F4). The technology developed in this paper can be used to assist paralyzed individuals and the elderly. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Strong latency variability pervades cognitive EEG responses across single trials, but is not taken into consideration by the conventional averaging method yielding event-related potentials (ERPs). This trial-to-trial variability may strongly smear and mix ERP components and diminish their amplitudes, impeding proper identification of the spatiotemporal representation of brain activities reflecting specific cognitive subprocesses. Furthermore, rich dynamic information about single trials is lost in averaged ERPs. Here we propose a model of ERPs as consisting of temporally overlapping components locked to different external events or varying in latency from trial to trial as a foundation for a new ERP decomposition and reconstruction method, residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). RIDE obtains latency-corrected waveforms and topography of the components, and retrieves the latencies and amplitudes of the separated components in single trials. RIDE was tested with real data and provides new perspectives for investigating brain-behavior relationships using EEG data in latency-corrected reconstructed ERPs, separated components, and information about variability in single trials.

More specifically, we aimed to investigate sex sensitivity with respect to the P300 ERP. Each female and male study participant underwent an oddball paradigm electroencephalography ERP session. ERP data were subjected to preprocessing and postprocessing, as well as statistical analysis. The results of the study showed that men had larger P300 amplitudes on average for both low-probability and high-probability stimuli compared with women (P<0.001). Men also showed shorter P300 latencies on average than did women (P<0.001). Significant differences in ERPs between men and women were observed in this study. The results indicate the existence of sex sensitivity to the P300 ERP, which may be because of men eliciting higher response inhibition compared with women.

These signals have very low SNR and are contaminated by background EEG. Extraction of single trial ERPs from background EEG is a challenging task due to overlapping nature of the frequency bands of ERP and EEG signals and much higher power of EEG than ERPs. In this paper we proposed a method based on wavelet transform and adaptive noise cancelers in order to extract single trial ERPs from background EEG in very low SNR conditions. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing methods. In addition, performance of the algorithm is justified under different noise models namely White Gaussian Noise, Auto Regressive, and Real EEG signals.

EVENT-RELATED BRAIN RESPONSES WHILE LISTENING TO ENTIRE PIECES OF MUSIC	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials; music; electroencephalography; musical features; N100; P200	PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FMRI; SOUND; EMOTIONS; TIMBRE; NOISE; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION	Brain responses to discrete short sounds have been studied intensively using the event-related potential (ERP) method, in which the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is divided into epochs time-locked to stimuli of interest. Here we introduce and apply a novel technique which enables one to isolate ERPs in human elicited by continuous music. The ERPs were recorded during listening to a Tango Nuevo piece, a deep techno track and an acoustic lullaby. Acoustic features related to timbre, harmony, and dynamics of the audio signal were computationally extracted from the musical pieces. Negative deflation occurring around 100 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (N100) and positive deflation occurring around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (P200) ERP responses to peak changes in the acoustic features were distinguishable and were often largest for Tango Nuevo. In addition to large changes in these musical features, long phases of low values that precede a rapid increase - and that we will call Preceding Low-Feature Phases - followed by a rapid increase enhanced the amplitudes of N100 and P200 responses. These ERP responses resembled those to simpler sounds, making it possible to utilize the tradition of ERP research with naturalistic paradigms.

The proposed RFC is an iterative algorithm based on functional principal component analysis, where cluster membership is updated via predictions of the functional trajectories obtained through a non-parametric random effects model. We consider functional data resulting from event-related potential (ERP) waveforms representing EEG time-locked to stimuli over the course of an implicit learning experiment, after applying a previously proposed meta-preprocessing step. This meta-preprocessing is designed to increase the low signal-to-noise ratio in the raw data and to mitigate the longitudinal changes in the ERP waveforms which characterize the nature and speed of learning. The resulting functional ERP components (peak amplitudes and latencies) inherently exhibit covariance heterogeneity due to low data quality over some stimuli inducing the averaging of different numbers of waveforms in sliding windows of the meta-preprocessing step. The proposed RFC algorithm incorporates this known covariance heterogeneity into the clustering algorithm, improving cluster quality, as illustrated in the data application and extensive simulation studies. ASD is a heterogeneous syndrome and identifying subgroups within ASD children is of interest for understanding the diverse nature of this complex disorder. Applications to the implicit learning paradigm identify subgroups within ASD and typically developing children with diverse learning patterns over the course of the experiment, which may inform clinical stratification of ASD.

The proposed analysis of ERP signal is to predict the performance of working memory retention for various frequency bands such as gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta. This study is intended to process the EEG data into ERP data and analyze the ERP signal based on power spectrum density. This method is applied to data of normal children with age between 7 to 12 years old. Result showed that alpha power band increases during working memory retention towards visual stimuli compared to the other frequency band. 9 years old has the highest amplitude alpha power compared to the other group of age. Therefore, the alpha power band at the prefrontal cortex will be used for the next analysis of the working memory retention.

Electroencephalographic study showing that tactile stimulation by fabrics of different qualities elicit graded event-related potentials	SKIN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fabric; tactile stimulation; passive touch; brain perception; pleasantness; electroencephalography	SKIN; FRICTION; COEFFICIENT; TRIBOLOGY; COMFORT; HANDLE	Background/purposeNeurophysiologic data on reactions of the human brain towards tactile stimuli evoked by fabrics moved on the skin are scarce. Furthermore, evaluation of fabrics' pleasantness using questionnaires suffers subjective biases. That is why we used a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to objectively evaluate real-time brain reactions to fabric-skin interactions. MethodsTactile stimuli were triggered by selected fabrics of different qualities, i.e. modal/polyamide single jersey, cotton double rib and a jute fabric, applied hidden to either the palm or forearm of 24 subjects via a custom-made fabric-to-skin applicator called SOFIA. One-way anova analysis was carried out to verify the EEG data. ResultsThe modal/polyamide fabric applied to the forearm and palm led to slightly stronger emotional valence scores in the brain than the conventional or baseline fabric. Furthermore, the single jersey elicits significant higher event-related potential (ERP) signals in all subjects when applied to the forearm, suggesting less distraction and better cognitive resources during the fabric/skin interaction. The brain thus reacts with instantaneous ERP to tactile stimulation of fabrics and is able to discriminate different qualities via implicit preferences. ConclusionThe test procedure described here may be a tool to evaluate the fabric feel with the exclusion of subjective biases.	[Hoefer, D.; Handel, M.; Hammer, T.

The optimization problems in LDA and linearly-constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformers are formally equivalent. The approaches differ in that, in LCMV beamformers, the spatial patterns are derived from a source model, whereas in an LDA beamformer the spatial patterns are derived directly from the data (i.e., the ERP peak). Using a formal proof and MEG simulations, we show that the LDA beamformer is robust to correlated sources and offers a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the LCMV beamformer and PCA. As an application, we use EEG data from an oddball experiment to show how the LDA beamformer can be harnessed to detect single-trial ERP latencies and estimate connectivity between ERP sources. Concluding, the LDA beamformer optimally reconstructs ERP sources by maximizing the ERP signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, it is a highly suited tool for analyzing ERP source time series, particularly in EEG/MEG studies wherein a source model is not available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To avoid and alleviate these problems, we propose a method of a multilinear discriminant analysis with constraints to augment parameter reduction, regularization, and additional prior information for event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs. The method reduces the number of parameters by multilinearization, regularizes the ill-posedness via subspaces that constrain the parameter spaces, and incorporates a brain functional connectivity through the constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy rates in a single-trial ERP processing.

A Feasibility Study of Using Event-Related Potential as a Biometrics	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				The use of an individual's neural response to stimuli (the event-related potential or ERP) has potential as a biometric because it is highly resistant to fraud relative to other conventional authentication systems. P300 is an ERP in human electroencephalography (EEG) that occurs in response to an oddball stimulus when an individual is actively engaged in a target detection task. Because P300 is consistently detectable from almost every subject, it is considered a potential signal for biometric applications. This paper presents a feasibility study of using topological plots of P300 as a biometric in subject authentication. The variation in latency and location of P300 response of 24 participants performing the P300Speller task were studied. Data sets from four participants were used for algorithm training; data from the other 20 participants were used as imposters for algorithm validation. The result showed that the algorithm was able to correctly identify three out of these four participants. Validation test also proved that the algorithm was able to reject 95% of the imposters for those three authenticated participants.

These studies vary in their approach, experimental conditions, paradigms, and outcomes. However, it is essential to integrate previous findings and experimental methods for a better demonstration of current issues and challenges in designing such studies. This Review examines methodologies and experimental conditions of neuroelectrophysiological research among heroin addicts during withdrawal, abstinence, and methadone maintenance treatment and presents the findings. The results show decrements in attentional processing and dysfunctions in brain response inhibition as well as brain activity abnormalities induced by chronic heroin abuse. Chronic heroin addiction causes increased and 2 power activity, latency of P300 and P600, and diminished P300 and P600 amplitude. Findings confirm that electroencephalography (EEG) band power and coherence are associated with craving indices and heroin abuse history. First symptoms of withdrawal can be seen in high-frequency EEG bands, and the severity of these symptoms is associated with brain functional connectivity. EEG spectral changes and event-related potential (ERP) properties have been shown to be associated with abstinence length and tend to normalize within 3-6 months of abstinence. From the conflicting criteria and confounding effects in neuroelectrophysiological studies, the authors suggest a comprehensive longitudinal study with a multimethod approach for monitoring EEG and ERP attributes of heroin addicts from early stages of withdrawal until long-term abstinence to control the confounding effects, such as nicotine abuse and other comorbid and premorbid conditions.

Visual deviant stimuli produce mismatch responses in the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related potential (ERP); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Oscillations; Peripheral vision; Visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR)	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; THETA OSCILLATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DEPTH-PERCEPTION; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; NEGATIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; FEEDBACK	Objectives: Auditory and visual deviant stimuli evoke mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, which can be recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, little is known about the role of neuronal oscillations in encoding of rare stimuli. We aimed at verifying the existence of a mechanism for the detection of deviant visual stimuli on the basis of oscillatory responses, so-called visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR). Methods: Peripheral visual stimuli in an oddball paradigm, standard vs. deviant (7: 1), were presented to twenty healthy subjects. The oscillatory responses to an infrequent change in the direction of moving peripheral stimuli were recorded with a 60-channel EEG system. In order to enhance the detection of oscillatory responses, we used the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, designed for the optimal extraction of changes in the amplitude of oscillations. Results: Both standard and deviant visual stimuli produced Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Synchronization (ERS) primarily in the occipito-parietal cortical areas. ERD and ERS had overlapping time-courses and peaked at about 500-730 ms. These oscillatory responses, however, were significantly stronger for the deviant than for the standard stimuli. A difference between the oscillatory responses to deviant and standard stimuli thus reflects the presence of vMOR. Conclusions: The present study shows that the detection of visual deviant stimuli can be reflected in both synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal oscillations. This broadens our knowledge about the brain mechanisms encoding deviant sensory stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One of the most efficient paradigms, namely, the event-related potential (ERP) based BCI. As a result, the visual stimulation is being recognized to be a most efficient stimulus for a multiple BCI system. In this paper, therefore, we offline investigated the effects of visual flickering stimuli for ERP recording in terms of optimizing the parameter of visual simulation, which presents a time-locked EEG classification. Different experimental conditions were compared to achieve the best performance. The best experiment showed that the classification accuracy rate of 80% approximately when the stimulus epoch interval was 500 ms across 3 trials. It can be useful for implementing real-time multiple ERP based BCI system.

Unlike conventional authentication methods which do not require users to re-authenticate themselves for sustained access, continuous authentication affirms human identity in real-time, therefore is a solution for continued access monitoring in trusted autonomous systems. Robust continuous authentication needs robust multi-modal data sources. In this paper, we design a multi-modal biometrics system that continuously verifies the presence of a logged-in user. Two types of biometric data are used, face images and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Information from individual modalities is fused at matching score level. For face modality, matching scores are calculated by distances between eigenface coefficients. While for EEG signals, an event-related potential (ERP) modality is established by a simple ERP elicitation protocol and calculation of cross-correlation similarities. Scores from the two modalities are normalized and fused using three schemes, namely the sum-score, max-score and min-score scheme. The experiments reveal that individual variations found in the ERPs are detectable and can be used for continuous authentication. This is an interesting finding which indicates that the ERP biometrics are feasible for user authentication and worthy of further research. Results also show that combining ERP biometric with face biometric using sum-score scheme outperforms each modality in isolation. This piece of finding indicates the potential of integrating ERP into multi-modal authentication systems.

In the past, EOG artifact removals have been studied in tasks with a single fixation point in the screen center, with less attention to the sensitivity of cornea-retinal dipole orientations to the EEG head map. In the present study, we hypothesized the existence of a systematic EOG influence that differs according to coupling conditions of eye-movement directions with viewing areas including different fixation points. The effect was validated in the linear regression analysis by using 12 task conditions combining horizontal/vertical eye-movement direction and three segregated zones of gaze in the screen. In the first place, event-related potential topographic patterns were analyzed to compare the 12 conditions and propagation coefficients of the linear regression analysis were successively calculated in each condition. As a result, the EOG influences were significantly different in a large number of EEG channels, especially in the case of horizontal eye-movements. In the cross validation, the linear regression analysis using the appropriate dataset of the target direction/viewing area combination demonstrated an improved performance compared with the traditional methods using a single fixation at the center. This result may open a potential way to improve artifact correction methods by considering the systematic EOG influence that can be predicted according to the view angle such as using eye-tracker systems.

J	Giroldini, W; Pederzoli, L; Bilucaglia, M; Melloni, S; Tressoldi, P				Giroldini, William; Pederzoli, Luciano; Bilucaglia, Marco; Melloni, Simone; Tressoldi, Patrizio			A new method to detect event-related potentials based on Pearson's correlation	EURASIP JOURNAL ON BIOINFORMATICS AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Brain-computer interfaces; Pearson's correlation	TIME-FREQUENCY; EEG; REMOVAL; SIGNALS; ARTIFACTS	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used in brain-computer interface applications and in neuroscience. Normal EEG activity is rich in background noise, and therefore, in order to detect ERPs, it is usually necessary to take the average from multiple trials to reduce the effects of this noise. The noise produced by EEG activity itself is not correlated with the ERP waveform and so, by calculating the average, the noise is decreased by a factor inversely proportional to the square root of N, where N is the number of averaged epochs. This is the easiest strategy currently used to detect ERPs, which is based on calculating the average of all ERP's waveform, these waveforms being time- and phase-locked. In this paper, a new method called GW6 is proposed, which calculates the ERP using a mathematical method based only on Pearson's correlation. The result is a graph with the same time resolution as the classical ERP and which shows only positive peaks representing the increase-in consonance with the stimuli-in EEG signal correlation over all channels. This new method is also useful for selectively identifying and highlighting some hidden components of the ERP response that are not phase-locked, and that are usually hidden in the standard and simple method based on the averaging of all the epochs. These hidden components seem to be caused by variations (between each successive stimulus) of the ERP's inherent phase latency period (jitter), although the same stimulus across all EEG channels produces a reasonably constant phase. For this reason, this new method could be very helpful to investigate these hidden components of the ERP response and to develop applications for scientific and medical purposes. Moreover, this new method is more resistant to EEG artifacts than the standard calculations of the average and could be very useful in research and neurology. The method we are proposing can be directly used in the form of a process written in the well-known Matlab programming language and can be easily and quickly written in any other software language.

Single-Trial ERP Component Analysis Using a Spatiotemporal LCMV Beamformer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Beamformer; brain models; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; multivariate analysis	EEG; WORD; STATISTICS; POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE; N400; MEG; AGE	Goal: For statistical analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), there are convincing arguments against averaging across stimuli or subjects. Multivariate filters can be used to isolate an ERP component of interest without the averaging procedure. However, we would like to have certainty that the output of the filter accurately represents the component. Methods: We extended the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which is traditionally used as a spatial filter for source localization, to be a flexible spatiotemporal filter for estimating the amplitude of ERP components in sensor space. In a comparison study on both simulated and real data, we demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the beamformer as well as a range of supervised learning approaches. Results: In the context of measuring the amplitude of a specific ERP component on a single-trial basis, we found that the spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer is a filter that accurately captures the component of interest, even in the presence of both structured noise (e.g., other overlapping ERP components) and unstructured noise (e.g., ongoing brain activity and sensor noise). Conclusion: The spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer method provides an accurate and intuitive way to conduct analysis of a known ERP component, without averaging across trials or subjects. Significance: Eliminating averaging allows us to test more detailed hypotheses and apply more powerful statistical models. For example, it allows the usage of multilevel regression models that can incorporate between subject/stimulus variation as random effects, test multiple effects simultaneously, and control confounding effects by partial regression.

The reduced attention-related ERP waves show much similarity between MDD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, raising the question whether there are similarities in the neurophysiologic process that underlies attention dysfunction in these pathologies. The present work suggests that there is such a unified underlying neurophysiologic process, which results in reduced attention in the three pathologies. Naturally, as these pathologies involve different clinical manifestations, we expect differences in their underlying neurophysiology. These differences and their subtle manifestation in the ERP marker for attention are also discussed. MDD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are just three of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, which involve changes in the EEG/ERP manifestations of attention. Further work should expand the basic model presented here to offer comprehensive modeling of these multiple disorders and to emphasize similarities and dissimilarities of the underlying neurophysiologic processes.

However, despite its widespread use, no studies have thoroughly evaluated how the morphology of the visual event-related potentials (ERPs) varies according to the spatial location of stimuli. Hence, the purpose of this study was to perform a detailed retinotopic mapping of visual ERPs. We recorded EEG activity while participants were visually stimulated with 60 pattern-reversing checkerboards placed at different polar angles and eccentricities. Our results show five pattern-reversal ERP components. C1 and C2 components inverted polarity between the upper and lower hemifields. P1 and N1 showed higher amplitudes and shorter latencies to stimuli located in the contralateral lower quadrant. In contrast, P2 amplitude was enhanced and its latency was reduced by stimuli presented in the periphery of the upper hemifield. The retinotopic maps presented here could serve as a guide for selecting optimal visuo-spatial locations in future ERP studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The search for neural biomarkers of performance remains a challenge in movement science and sport psychology. The non-invasive nature of high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recording has made it a most promising avenue for providing quantitative feedback to practitioners and coaches. Here, we review the current relevance of the main types of EEG oscillations in order to trace a perspective for future practical applications of BEG and event-related potentials (ERP) in sport. In this context, the hypotheses of unified brain rhythms and continuity between wake and sleep states should provide a functional template for EEG biomarkers in sport. The oscillations in the thalamo-cortical and hippocampal circuitry including the physiology of the place cells and the grid cells provide a frame of reference for the analysis of delta, theta, beta, alpha (incl.mu), and gamma oscillations recorded in the space field of human performance. Based on recent neuronal models facilitating the distinction between the different dynamic regimes (selective gating and binding) in these different oscillations we suggest an integrated approach articulating together the classical biomechanical factors (3D movements and EMG) and the high-density EEG and ERP signals to allow finer mathematical analysis to optimize sport performance, such as microstates, coherency/directionality analysis and neural generators.

Here, we argue that the averaged event-related potential (ERP) may provide the potential for more accurate biometric identification, as its elicitation allows for some control over the cognitive state of the user to be obtained through the design of the challenge protocol. We describe the Cognitive Event-RElated Biometric REcognition (CEREBRE) protocol, an ERP biometric protocol designed to elicit individually unique responses from multiple functional brain systems (e.g., the primary visual, facial recognition, and gustatory/appetitive systems). Results indicate that there are multiple configurations of data collected with the CEREBRE protocol that all allow 100% identification accuracy in a pool of 50 users. We take this result as the evidence that ERP biometrics are a feasible method of user identification and worthy of further research.

Here we leveraged the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) to study the neural consequences of a global, continuous distractor on signal-detection processes. Healthy, young adults performed the dSAT task, a translational sustained-attention task that has been used across different species and in clinical groups, in the presence and absence of ongoing distracting stimulation. We found the presence of distracting stimuli impaired participants' ability to behaviorally detect task -re-levant signal stimuli and greatly affected the neural cascade of processes underlying signal detection. Specifically, we found distraction reduced an anterior and a posterior early-latency N2 ERP component (similar to 140-220 ms) and modulated long-latency, detection-related P3 components (P3a: similar to 200-330 ms, P3b: 300-700 ms), even to correctly detected targets. These data provide evidence that distraction can induce powerful alterations in the neural processes related to signal detection, even when stimuli are behaviorally detected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A Preliminary Investigation Into the Neural Basis of the Production Effect	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE EXPERIMENTALE			English	Article						production effect; memory; distinctiveness; electroencephalography; P300	RECOGNITION MEMORY; DISTINCTIVENESS; P300; PARADIGM; SPEAKING; BENEFITS; P3A	Items that are produced (e.g., read aloud) during encoding typically are better remembered than items that are not produced (e.g., read silently). This "production effect" has been explained by distinctiveness: Produced items have more distinct features than nonproduced items, leading to enhanced retrieval. The goal of the current study was to use electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural basis of the production effect. During study, participants were presented with words that they were required to read silently, read aloud, or sing while EEG data were recorded. Subsequent memory performance was tested using a yes/no recognition test. Analysis focused on the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by the encoding instruction cue for each instruction condition. Our data revealed enhanced memory performance for produced items and a greater P300 ERP amplitude for instructions to sing or read aloud compared with instructions to read silently. Our results demonstrate that the amplitude of the P300 is modulated by at least 1 aspect of production, vocalization (singing/reading aloud relative to reading silently), and are consistent with the distinctiveness account of the production effect. The ERP methodology is a viable tool for investigating the production effect.

ERP correlates of error processing during performance on the Halstead Category Test	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						feedback-related negativity (FRN); Halstead Category Test; Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA); event-related potentials (ERP); feedback processing	CARD SORTING TEST; FEEDBACK; CORTEX; TASK	The Halstead Category Test (HCT) is a neuropsychological test that measures a person's ability to formulate and apply abstract principles. Performance must be adjusted based on feedback after each trial and errors are common until the underlying rules are discovered. Event-related potential (ERP) studies associated with the HCT are lacking. This paper demonstrates the use of a methodology inspired on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to EEG signals, to remove high amplitude ocular and movement artifacts during performance on the test. This filtering technique introduces no phase or latency distortions, with minimum loss of relevant EEG information. Importantly, the test was applied in its original clinical format, without introducing adaptations to ERP recordings. After signal treatment, the feedback -related negativity (FRN) wave, which is related to error-processing, was identified. This component peaked around 250ms, after feedback, in fronto-central electrodes. As expected, errors elicited more negative amplitudes than correct responses. Results are discussed in terms of the increased clinical potential that coupling ERP information with behavioral performance data can bring to the specificity of the HCT in diagnosing different types of impairment in frontal brain function.

However, scalp-channel averaged ERPs sum volume-conducted contributions from many cortical areas, reducing the functional specificity and interpretability of channel-based ERP measures. This study represents the first attempt to investigate rapid auditory processing in infancy using independent component analysis (ICA), allowing exploration of source-resolved ERP dynamics and identification of ERP cortical generators. Here, we recorded 60-channel EEG data in 34 typically developing 6-month-old infants during a passive acoustic oddball paradigm presenting 'standard' tones interspersed with frequency-or duration-deviant tones. ICA decomposition was applied to single-subject EEG data. The best-fitting equivalent dipole or bilaterally symmetric dipole pair was then estimated for each resulting independent component (IC) process using a four-layer infant head model. Similar brain-source ICs were clustered across subjects. Results showed ERP contributions from auditory cortex and multiple extra-auditory cortical areas (often, bilaterally paired). Different cortical source combinations contributed to the frequency-and duration-deviant ERP peak sequences. For ICs in an ERP-dominant source cluster located in or near the mid-cingulate cortex, source-resolved frequency-deviant response N2 latency and P3 amplitude at 6 months-of-age predicted vocabulary size at 20 months-of-age. The same measures for scalp channel F6 (though not for other frontal channels) showed similar but weaker correlations. These results demonstrate the significant potential of ICA analyses to facilitate a deeper understanding of the neural substrates of infant sensory processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

They have various applications, such as in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Numerous recent investigations have focused on the development of dry sensors, but few concern the simultaneous attachment of high-density dry sensors to different regions of the scalp to receive qualified EEG signals from hairy sites. An inflatable and wearable wireless 32-channel EEG device was designed, prototyped, and experimentally validated for making EEG signal measurements; it incorporates spring-loaded dry sensors and a novel gasbag design to solve the problem of interference by hair. The cap is ventilated and incorporates a circuit board and battery with a high-tolerance wireless (Bluetooth) protocol and low power consumption characteristics. The proposed system provides a 500/250 Hz sampling rate, and 24 bit EEG data to meet the BCI system data requirement. Experimental results prove that the proposed EEG system is effective in measuring audio event-related potential, measuring visual event-related potential, and rapid serial visual presentation. Results of this work demonstrate that the proposed EEG cap system performs well in making EEG measurements and is feasible for practical applications.

These signals are influenced by different potentials. Currently, there exists no measure that can evaluate the measure influence among the signals. A new measure of influence has been proposed based on the distribution of correlation (DCOR) that quantifies the relative influence of constituent sub-band signals over full band signal. To estimate the inter-influence, scaled correlation analysis of signal sub-components is investigated. Results so obtained demonstrate that the signal influence of highest-frequency components present in the signal is more in case of linear/stationary signals, compared with non-linear/non-stationary (EEG/event related potential) signals. These findings are concluded with two types of analysis: (i) mixed influence analysis and (ii) mutual influence analysis. It is demonstrated that for separation of negative and positive correlations (CORs) using the proposed novel measure of signal influence (DCOR) is 14.24% better than other conventional COR method.

The Electrophysiology of Basic Phrase Building	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBE; SUPERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; SEMANTIC CONTEXT; WORD; COMPREHENSION; N400	A defining trait of linguistic competence is the ability to combine elements into increasingly complex structures to denote, and to comprehend, a potentially infinite number of meanings. Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) work has investigated these processes by comparing the response to nouns in combinatorial (blue car) and non-combinatorial (rnsh car) contexts. In the current study we extended this paradigm using electroencephalography (EEG) to dissociate the role of semantic content from phonological well-formedness (yerl car). We used event-related potential (ERP) recordings in order to better relate the observed neurophysiological correlates of basic combinatorial operations to prior ERP work on comprehension. We found that nouns in combinatorial contexts (blue car) elicited a greater centro-parietal negativity between 180-400ms, independent of the phonological well-formedness of the context word. We discuss the potential relationship between this 'combinatorial' effect and classic N400 effects. We also report preliminary evidence for an early anterior negative deflection immediately preceding the critical noun in combinatorial contexts, which we tentatively interpret as an electrophysiological reflex of syntactic structure initialization.

By measuring participants' brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG), we found face-recognition event related potentials (ERPs) in the visual cortex, around 200-250 ms, to be prominent for the different familiarity levels. A less positive component was found for self-recognized pictures (P200) than pictures of others, showing similar effects in both real faces and look-alike avatars. A rapid adaptation in the same component was found when comparing the neural processing of avatar faces vs. real faces, as if avatars in general were assimilated as real face representations over time. ERP results also showed that in the case of the self-avatar, the P200 component correlated with more complex conscious encodings of self-representation, i.e., the difference in voltage in the P200 between the self-avatar and the self-picture was reduced in participants that felt the avatar looked like them.

Cortical activity during cued picture naming predicts individual differences in stuttering frequency	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Stuttering; Speech preparation; Auditory event-related potentials; EEG; Event-related desynchronization	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; TEMPORAL SIGNATURES; SPEECH PRODUCTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; AUDIENCE SIZE; EEG; ADULTS; ALPHA	Objective: Developmental stuttering is characterized by fluent speech punctuated by stuttering events, the frequency of which varies among individuals and contexts. Most stuttering events occur at the beginning of an utterance, suggesting neural dynamics associated with stuttering may be evident during speech preparation. Methods: This study used EEG to measure cortical activity during speech preparation in men who stutter, and compared the EEG measures to individual differences in stuttering rate as well as to a fluent control group. Each trial contained a cue followed by an acoustic probe at one of two onset times (early or late), and then a picture. There were two conditions: a speech condition where cues induced speech preparation of the picture's name and a control condition that minimized speech preparation. Results: Across conditions stuttering frequency correlated to cue-related EEG beta power and auditory ERP slow waves from early onset acoustic probes. Conclusions: The findings reveal two new cortical markers of stuttering frequency that were present in both conditions, manifest at different times, are elicited by different stimuli (visual cue, auditory probe), and have different EEG responses (beta power, ERP slow wave). Significance: The cue-target paradigm evoked brain responses that correlated to pre-experimental stuttering rate. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The role of saccades is beyond mechanical, in fact they are closely tied to mechanisms of visual cognition, in particular to spatial attention. Two physiological processes, pre-saccadic shifts of attention and saccadic suppression illustrate the interplay of saccades and visual perception: while the attentional shift enhances visual sensitivity to the future saccade target, saccadic suppression inhibits it for non-target objects. Both processes are transient and active already before the saccade onset. So far, these processes have been studied primarily behaviorally in human subjects or via invasive electrophysiological recordings in monkeys. Despite considerable advances, a physiological characterization of these two mechanisms is still lacking in the human literature. Here, we will present a new methodology for investigating perisaccadic events in human subjects. Using electro-encephalography (EEG) co-registered with eye tracking (ET), we sampled the complete time-course of perisaccadic activity and identified two ERP components - pre-saccadic voltage enhancement and post saccadic voltage reduction - that likely relate to shifts of spatial attention and saccadic suppression.

The use of event related potentials (ERPs) relies on both estimation accuracy and processing time. We tested a particle filter that uses a large number of particles to construct a probability distribution. Methods: We constructed a simple model for recording EEG comprising three components: ERPs approximated via a trend model, background waves constructed via an autoregressive model, and noise. We evaluated the performance of the particle filter based on mean squared error (MSE), P300 peak amplitude, and latency. We then compared our filter with the Kalman filter and a conventional simple averaging method. To confirm the efficacy of the filter, we used it to estimate ERP elicited by a P300 BCI speller. Results: A 400-particle filter produced the best MSE. We found that the merit of the filter increased when the original waveform already had a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (i.e., the power ratio between ERP and background EEG). We calculated the amount of averaging necessary after applying a particle filter that produced a result equivalent to that associated with conventional averaging, and determined that the particle filter yielded a maximum 42.8% reduction in measurement time. The particle filter performed better than both the Kalman filter and conventional averaging for a low SNR in terms of both MSE and P300 peak amplitude and latency. For EEG data produced by the P300 speller, we were able to use our filter to obtain ERP waveforms that were stable compared with averages produced by a conventional averaging method, irrespective of the amount of averaging. Conclusions: We confirmed that particle filters are efficacious in reducing the measurement time required during simulations with a low SNR. Additionally, particle filters can perform robust ERP estimation for EEG data produced via a P300 speller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In previous studies, multiple event-related potential (ERP) components (e.g., P1, N1, P2, and P3) were used to improve the performance of object categorization of visual stimuli. In this study, we introduce a novel method that uses multiple-kernel support vector machine to fuse multiple ERP component features. We investigate whether fusing the potential complementary information of different ERP components (e.g., P1, N1, P2a, and P2b) can improve the performance of four-category visual object classification in single-trial EEGs. We also compare the classification accuracy of different ERP component fusion methods. Our experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy increases through multiple ERP fusion. Additional comparative analyses indicate that the multiple-kernel fusion method can achieve a mean classification accuracy higher than 72 %, which is substantially better than that achieved with any single ERP component feature (55.07 % for the best single ERP component, N1). We compare the classification results with those of other fusion methods and determine that the accuracy of the multiple-kernel fusion method is 5.47, 4.06, and 16.90 % higher than those of feature concatenation, feature extraction, and decision fusion, respectively. Our study shows that our multiple-kernel fusion method outperforms other fusion methods and thus provides a means to improve the classification performance of single-trial ERPs in brain-computer interface research.

For this reason, recent clinical brain research and brain computer interface (BCI) studies use EEG signals in many applications. Due to the significant noise in EEG traces, signal processing to enhance the signal to noise power ratio (SNR) is necessary for EEG analysis, especially for non-invasive EEG. A typical method to improve the SNR is averaging many trials of event related potential (ERP) signal that represents a brain's response to a particular stimulus or a task. The averaging, however, is very sensitive to variable delays. In this study, we propose two time delay estimation (TDE) schemes based on a joint maximum likelihood (ML) criterion to compensate the uncertain delays which may be different in each trial. We evaluate the performance for different types of signals such as random, deterministic, and real EEG signals. The results show that the proposed schemes provide better performance than other conventional schemes employing averaged signal as a reference, e.g., up to 4 dB gain at the expected delay error of 10 degrees.

In this paper, we propose a new method for background noise removal from single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded with a multi-channel EEG. An observed signal is separated into multiple signals with a multi-channel Wiener filter, whose coefficients are estimated based on a probabilistic generative model in the time-frequency domain. The main contribution is a method to estimate covariance matrices for each frequency bins of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representing different spatial spread of a multi-channel EEG signal according to frequencies. An experiment using a pseudo-ERP data set demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

J	Ostwald, D; Starke, L				Ostwald, Dirk; Starke, Ludger			Probabilistic delay differential equation modeling of event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG; PERCEPTION; STIMULI; MEG/EEG	"Dynamic causal models" (DCMs) are a promising approach in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data due to their biophysical interpretability and their consolidation of functional-segregative and functional-integrative propositions. In this theoretical note we are concerned with the DCM framework for electroencephalographically recorded event-related potentials (ERP-DCM). Intuitively, ERP-DCM combines deterministic dynamical neural mass models with dipole-based EEG forward models to describe the event-related scalp potential time-series over the entire electrode space. Since its inception, ERP-DCM has been successfully employed to capture the neural underpinnings of a wide range of neurocognitive phenomena. However, in spite of its empirical popularity, the technical literature on ERP-DCM remains somewhat patchy. A number of previous communications have detailed certain aspects of the approach, but no unified and coherent documentation exists. With this technical note, we aim to close this gap and to increase the technical accessibility of ERP-DCM. Specifically, this note makes the following novel contributions: firstly, we provide a unified and coherent review of the mathematical machinery of the latent and forward models constituting ERP-DCM by formulating the approach as a probabilistic latent delay differential equation model. Secondly, we emphasize the probabilistic nature of the model and its variational Bayesian inversion scheme by explicitly deriving the variational free energy function in terms of both the likelihood expectation and variance parameters. Thirdly, we detail and validate the estimation of the model with a special focus on the explicit form of the variational free energy function and introduce a conventional nonlinear optimization scheme for its maximization. Finally, we identify and discuss a number of computational issues which may be addressed in the future development of the approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We had employed electroencephalography (EEG) a well-known noninvasive method for recording of brain emotion signals in order to analyze the emotion regulations in children. The international affective picture system (IAPS) pictures dataset was used for selection of stimuli presentation. The stimulus presentation was commonly practiced to induce the emotional responses from human brain. Brain signals were recorded using EEG electrodes and analyzed after preprocessing. There are rare studies available for detection of emotion regulation in children using late positive potential (LPP) analysis. The event related potential (ERP) is well known for analysis in cognitive neuroscience that was used in this paper for analysis of LPP. In this paper, we proposed the LPP as a neural marker for physiatrists and neurophysiologists to detect the mood disruption in children. We employed 21 subjects in this investigation, which were aged from 12 to 14 years. The ERP was analyzed through stimulus lock strategy which includes 180 stimuli of four emotions (arousal-valence). Each stimulus time duration was 1.5 s following of 0.5 s of rest time. Results show the increased modulation of LPP amplitude under all brain regions.

The aim of this review is to describe lithium-induced EEG changes in bipolar disorder and to discuss potential underlying factors. A literature survey about lithium-induced EEG changes in bipolar disorder was performed. Lithium consistently enhances magnitudes of brain oscillations in slow frequencies ( delta and theta) in both resting-state EEG studies as well as event-related oscillations studies. Enhancement of magnitudes of beta oscillations is specific to event-related oscillations. Correlation between serum lithium levels and brain oscillations has been reported. Lithium-induced changes in brain oscillations might correspond to lithium-induced alterations in neurotransmitters, signaling cascades, plasticity, brain structure, or biophysical properties of lithium. Therefore, lithium-induced changes in brain oscillations could be promising biomarkers to assess the molecular mechanisms leading to variability in efficacy. Since the variability of lithium response in bipolar disorder is due to the genetic differences in the mechanisms involving lithium, it would be highly promising to assess the lithium-induced EEG changes as biomarkers in genetic studies.

Methods for detecting the ERN from EEG signals have been widely investigated. Many known techniques use the ERN component of event-related potentials (ERP) by extracting relevant features and feeding those features to a classifier. In these approaches, feature extraction becomes the key point. In this paper, we used the t-CWT method which was based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's t-test for extracting ERN features. In the experiment, EEG was recorded from 5 electrode sites (Fz, FC1, Cz, FCz and FC2) during a sustianed attention experiment in 10 subjects. We used a support vector machine for classification. In addition, the algorithm provides fully automated detection and quantification methods for extracting the most discrimantive? ERP components between two cognitive states and are particular suitable for classifying single-trial ERPs. The features extracted by the algorithm can be interpreted in terms of signal characteristics that are contributing to the efficiency of classification, giving a new method for brain activity investigation.

Single Trial Variability of Event-Related Brain Potentials as an Index of Neural Efficiency During Working Memory	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION: NEUROERGONOMICS AND OPERATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE, AC 2016, PT I	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Augmented Cognition (AC) Held as Part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HIC International)	JUL 17-22, 2016	Toronto, CANADA			Working memory; ERP; Single trial variability	LATENCY VARIABILITY; HABITUATION; ACTIVATION; P300; BACK	Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to a particular stimulus are extracted from the continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) through signal averaging techniques. The most extensively studied ERP component, P300 (P3, or P3b), occurs at approximately 300-800 ms post-stimulus. P3 amplitude and latency are markers of the attentional/cognitive resources devoted to the task and the timing (within msecs) of central processing speed of an individual's cognitive response to a stimulus, respectively. Variability in the timing and amplitude of components in the single EEG trials that contribute to the averaged ERP has been of particular interest to our laboratory because it may provide an index of central information processing efficiency. Examination of single trial variability (STV) can provide a level of analysis beyond traditional ERP measures and offers a unique marker of the functional integrity of neural pathways. In the present study we examined ERP STV as it relates to WM demand or load during a visual nback task in normal adult participants. Performance measures and the scalprecorded EEG were obtained during the n-back task. Frontal and parietal scalp averaged ERPs were derived from the EEG time-locked to the stimuli. The mean and variability (SD) of the peak amplitude and latency were then obtained from the single trial data for each participant and condition. Results showed that as WM load increased, behavioral measures of processing speed slowed, behavioral efficiency decreased, and the number of correct responses decreased. Correlations for both latency and amplitude between the P3 component derived from the averaged ERP and the P3 component derived from the single trials were generally high, indicating that the P3s for individual trials identified by our STV procedure were representative of the P3s in the averaged ERP obtained by standard signal averaging procedures. P3 STV analyses also showed differential effects between frontal and parietal scalp sites for both amplitude and latency variability that were related to WM load. Both frontal P3 latency STV and amplitude increased as WM load increased, indicating decreased neural efficiency associated with an increase in WM load. Single trial ERP variability measures may provide potential physiological markers of the neural efficiency of brain processes engaged in cognitive functions, such as working memory.

While ERP have been broadly used in AD, it has up to now been very little applied in KS or in the comparison of KS and AD. Within the framework of dual-process models, an influential theory postulating that addictive states result from an imbalance between under-activated reflective system and over-activated automatic-affective one, this paper proposes: (1) a brief synthesis of the main results of ERP studies in AD and KS, and (2) new research avenues using ERP to identify the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive and emotional dysfunction in KS. These experimental perspectives aim at exploring the continuity hypothesis, which postulates a gradient of impairments from AD to KS. We conclude on the possibility of developing neuropsychological strategies with electrophysiological follow-up to ensure KS diagnosis and test the efficacy of patient's neurocognitive rehabilitation.

The current study investigated the temporal course of emotional processing in AnDs by examining Event-related potential (ERP) components. Twenty-three AnDs and twenty-four age- and gender-matched HCs viewed emotional (fearful, happy) and neutral faces while their electroencephalograms were recorded. Early (P100, N170), middle (early posterior negativity; EPN), and late ERP components late positive potential were analyzed. To localize ERP source activity, standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used. AnDs displayed significantly enhanced mean amplitude of the EPN compared to HCs when fearful faces were presented. In addition, the EPN's mean amplitude elicited by fearful faces was more pronounced than for happy and neutral faces in AnDs, whereas in HCs the EPN elicited by fearful faces was only augmented compared to neutral faces. Finally, sLORETA analysis revealed that the source activity of the EPN (fearful minus happy face condition) was increased in the cuneus and precuneus in AnDs compared to HCs. Our results indicate that the EPN is a distinct ERP component modulated by facial emotional processing in AnDs. Furthermore, the results show that anxiety symptoms enhance selective attention for fearful faces. Finally, it revealed that the cuneus and precuneus are involved in fearful face processing in AnDs.

However, several studies have provided evidence for the involvement of the same circuits in motor imagery tasks, in the absence of overt responses. The present study aimed to test whether imagined performance of a stop-signal task produces a similar pattern of motor-related EEG activity than that observed during real performance. To this end, mu and beta event related desynchronization (ERD) and the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) were analyzed. The study also aimed to clarify the functional significance of the Stop-N2 and Stop-P3 event-related potential (ERPs) components, which were also obtained during both real and imagined performance. The results showed a common pattern of brain electrical activity, and with a similar time course, during covert performance and overt execution of the stop-signal task: presence of LRP and Stop-P3 in the imagined condition and identical LRP onset, and similar mu and beta ERD temporal windows for both conditions. These findings suggest that a similar inhibitory network may be activated during both overt and covert execution of the task. Therefore, motor imagery may be useful to improve inhibitory skills and to develop new communicating systems for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices based on inhibitory signals.

Usually, EEG is assumed to be a Gaussian process with unknown mean and covariance, and the estimation of these parameters are required for BCI inference. However, relatively high dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the recorded EEG with respect to the number of supervised observations usually leads to a rank deficient covariance matrix estimator. In our typing BCI, RSVP Keyboard TM, we solve this problem by applying regularization on the maximum likelihood covariance matrix estimators. Alternatively, in this manuscript we propose a Kronecker product structure for covariance matrices. Our underlying hypothesis is that the a structure imposed on the covariance matrices will improve the estimation accuracy and accordingly will result in typing performance improvements. Through an offline analysis we assess the classification accuracy of the proposed model. The results represent a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to an RDA approach which does not assume any structure on the covariance.

One approach to studying associations between dysfunctional auditory dynamics and LLI, is to implement a training protocol tapping into this potential while quantifying pre- and post-intervention status. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are highly sensitive to the brain correlates of these dynamic changes and are therefore ideally suited for examining hypotheses regarding dysfunctional auditory processes. In this study, ERP measurements to rapid tone sequences (standard and deviant tone pairs) along with behavioral language testing were performed in 6- to 9-year-old LLI children (n = 21) before and after audiovisual training. A non-treatment group of children with typical language development (n = 12) was also assessed twice at a comparable time interval. The results indicated that the LLI group exhibited considerable gains on standardized measures of language. In terms of ERPs, we found evidence of changes in the LLI group specifically at the level of the P2 component, later than 250 ms after the onset of the second stimulus in the deviant tone pair. These changes suggested enhanced discrimination of deviant from standard tone sequences in widespread cortices, in LLI children after training.

Electrocortical Sources Related to Whole-Body Surface Translations during a Single- and Dual-Task Paradigm	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						posture; standing balance; EEG; EEG/ERP; balance control; independent component analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; BALANCE REACTIONS; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; INTERFERENCE; WALKING; RESPONSES; BRAIN	Appropriate reactive motor responses are essential in maintaining upright balance. However, little is known regarding the potential location of cortical sources that are related to the onset of a perturbation during single- and dual-task paradigms. The purpose of this study was to estimate the location of cortical sources in response to a whole-body surface translation and whether diverted attention decreases the N1 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude related to a postural perturbation. This study utilized high-resolution electroencephalography in conjunction with measure projection analysis from ERPs time-locked to backwards surface translation onsets to determine which cortical sources were related to whole-body postural perturbations. Subjects (n = 15) either reacted to whole-body surface translations with (dual task) or without (single task) performing a visual working memory task. For the single task, four domains were identified that were mainly localized within the frontal and parietal lobes and included sources from the prefrontal, premotor, primary and supplementary motor, somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortex. Five domains were estimated for the dual task and also included sources within the frontal and parietal lobes, but the sources also shifted to other locations that included areas within the temporal and occipital lobes. Additionally, mean absolute N1 ERP amplitudes representing the activity from similar locations in both tasks were greater for the single than dual task. The present localization results highlight the importance of frontal, parietal and anterior cingulate cortical areas in reactive postural control and suggest a re-allocation or shift of cortical sources related to reactive balance control in the presence of a secondary task. Thus, this study provides novel insight into the underlying neurophysiology and contribution of cortical sources in relation to the neural control of reactive balance.

Recent psychophysical studies suggest that these specificities, which have been associated with early retinotopic visual cortex, may in fact not be inherent in perceptual learning and could be related to higher-order brain functions. Here we provide direct electrophysiological evidence in support of this proposition. In a series of event-related potential (ERP) experiments, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from human adults over the course of learning in a texture discrimination task (TDT). The results consistently showed that the earliest C1 component (68-84 ms), known to reflect V1 activity driven by feedforward inputs, was not modulated by learning regardless of whether the behavioral improvement is location specific or not. In contrast, two later posterior ERP components (posterior P1 and P160-350) over the occipital cortex and one anterior ERP component (anterior P160-350) over the prefrontal cortex were progressively modified day by day. Moreover, the change of the anterior component was closely correlated with improved behavioral performance on a daily basis. Consistent with recent psychophysical and imaging observations, our results indicate that perceptual learning can mainly involve changes in higher-level visual cortex as well as in the neural networks responsible for cognitive functions such as attention and decision making.

This work complements such method by combining Event-Related Potentials (ERP) and Eye-Tracking (ET) techniques and using semantic priming to elicit user perception. Our study focuses on package design and follows the basic structure of classic ERP experiments where participants are presented an ordered sequence of frames (stimuli) in a computer screen for a certain period of time: attention frame, semantic priming frame (descriptive adjeCtive), neutral background, target frame (product image), and a question regarding coherence between priming and target frames. The eye-tracking system works in combination with the ERP experiment. The results of our study reveal the connection between adjectives (semantic priming) and package design attributes (based on the analysis of the N400 ERP component), and the connection between adjectives and the specific visual elements that get more attention (based on the information provided by eye-tracking analysis software).

The current work aimed to confirm this age related difference in response to emotional stimuli of diverse intensities by examining Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory power in time-frequency analysis. Methods: Time-frequency analyses were performed on the EEG data recorded for highly negative (HN), moderately negative (MN) and Neutral pictures in 20 adolescents and 20 adults during a covert emotional task. The results showed a significant age by emotion interaction effect in the theta and beta oscillatory power during the 500-600 ms post stimulus. Results: Adolescents showed significantly less pronounced theta synchronization (ERS, 5.5-7.5 Hz) for HN stimuli, and larger beta desynchronization (ERD; 18-20 Hz) for both HN and MN stimuli, in comparison with neutral stimuli. By contrast, adults exhibited no significant emotion effects in theta and beta frequency bands. In addition, the analysis of the alpha spectral power (10.5-12 Hz; 850-950 ms) showed a main effect of emotion, while the emotion by age interaction was not significant. Irrespective of adolescents or adults, HN and MN stimuli elicited enhanced alpha suppression compared to Neutral stimuli, while the alpha power was similar across HN and MN conditions. Conclusions: These results confirmed prior findings that adolescents are more sensitive to emotionally negative stimuli compared to adults, regardless of emotion intensity, possibly due to the developing prefrontal control system during adolescence.

However, in contrast to faces, name processing has rarely been studied in individuals with ASD. Here, we investigated brain activity and functional connectivity associated with recognition of names in the high-functioning ASD group and in the control group. Methods: EEG was recorded in 15 young males with ASD and 15 matched one-to-one control individuals. EEG data were analyzed with the event-related potential (ERP), event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization (ERD/ S), as well as coherence and direct transfer function (DTF) methods. Four categories of names were presented visually: one's own, close-other's, famous, and unknown. Results: Differences between the ASD and control groups were found for ERP, coherence, and DTF. In individuals with ASD, P300 (a positive ERP component) to own-name and to a close-other's name were similar whereas in control participants, P300 to own-name was enhanced when compared to all other names. Analysis of coherence and DTF revealed disruption of fronto-posterior task-related connectivity in individuals with ASD within the beta range frequencies. Moreover, DTF indicated the directionality of those impaired connections-they were going from parieto-occipital to frontal regions. DTF also showed inter-group differences in short-range connectivity: weaker connections within the frontal region and stronger connections within the occipital region in the ASD group in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a lack of the self-preference effect and impaired functioning of the attentional network during recognition of visually presented names in individuals with ASD.

The Deceptively Simple N170 Reflects Network Information Processing Mechanisms Involving Visual Feature Coding and Transfer Across Hemispheres	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; mutual information; information transmission; face processing; reverse correlation	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ACQUIRED PROSOPAGNOSIA; FACE CATEGORIZATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; BRAIN NETWORK; FMRI; RESPONSES; HUMANS; EEG	A key to understanding visual cognition is to determine "where", "when", and "how" brain responses reflect the processing of the specific visual features that modulate categorization behavior-the "what". The N170 is the earliest Event-Related Potential (ERP) that preferentially responds to faces. Here, we demonstrate that a paradigmatic shift is necessary to interpret the N170 as the product of an information processing network that dynamically codes and transfers face features across hemispheres, rather than as a local stimulus-driven event. Reverse-correlation methods coupled with information-theoretic analyses revealed that visibility of the eyes influences face detection behavior. The N170 initially reflects coding of the behaviorally relevant eye contralateral to the sensor, followed by a causal communication of the other eye from the other hemisphere. These findings demonstrate that the deceptively simple N170 ERP hides a complex network information processing mechanism involving initial coding and subsequent cross-hemispheric transfer of visual features.

Using concurrent EEG and fMRI to probe the state of the brain in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Concurrent EEG plus fMRI; Perception; N100; P200; Schizophrenia; Avolition/apathy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; DEFAULT MODE; NEUROMAGNETIC RESPONSES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RESTING-STATE; COMPONENT; HALLUCINATIONS; PERCEPTION	Perceptional abnormalities in schizophrenia are associated with hallucinations and delusions, but alsowith negative symptoms and poor functional outcome. Perception can be studied using EEG-derived event related potentials (ERPs). Because of their excellent temporal resolution, ERPs have been used to ask when perception is affected by schizophrenia. Because of its excellent spatial resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to ask where in the brain these effects are seen. We acquired EEG and fMRI data simultaneously to explore when and where auditory perception is affected by schizophrenia. Thirty schizophrenia (SZ) patients and 23 healthy comparison subjects (HC) listened to 1000 Hz tones occurring about every second. We used joint independent components analysis (jICA) to combine EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) and fMRI responses to tones. Five ERP-fMRI joint independent components (JIC) were extracted. The "N100" JIC had temporal weights during N100 (peaking at 100 ms post-tone onset) and fMRI spatial weights in superior and middle temporal gyri (STG/MTG); however, it did not differ between groups. The "P200" JIC had temporal weights during P200 and positive fMRI spatial weights in STG/MTG and frontal areas, and negative spatial weights in the nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and visual cortex. Groups differed on the "P200" JIC: SZ had smaller "P200" JIC, especially those with more severe avolition/apathy. This is consistent with negative symptoms being related to perceptual deficits, and suggests patients with avolition/apathy may allocate too few resources to processing external auditory events and too many to processing internal events.

Neural modulation of directed forgetting by valence and arousal: An event-related potential study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Valence; Arousal; Emotion; Directed forgetting; Memory; Event-related potentials	EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; MEMORY; ERP; MECHANISMS; WORDS; BIAS; ANXIETY; IMAGES; FMRI	Intentional forgetting benefits memory by removing no longer needed information and promoting processing of more relevant materials. This study sought to understand how the behavioural and neurophysiological representation of intentional forgetting would be impacted by emotion. We took a novel approach by examining the unique contribution of both valence and arousal on emotional directed forgetting. Participants completed an item directed forgetting task for positive, negative, and neutral words at high and lower levels of arousal while brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Behaviourally, recognition of to-be-remembered (TBR) and to-be-forgotten (TBF) items varied as a function of valence and arousal with reduced directed forgetting for high arousing negative and neutral words. In the brain, patterns of frontal and posterior activation in response to TBF and TBR cues respectively replicated prior EEG evidence to support involvement of inhibitory and selective rehearsal mechanisms in item directed forgetting. Interestingly, emotion only impacted cue-related posterior activity, which varied depending on specific interactions between valence and arousal. Together, results suggest that the brain handles valence and arousal differently and highlights the importance of considering in a collective manner the multidimensional nature of emotion in experimentation.

J	Roy, RN; Bonnet, S; Charbonnier, S; Campagne, A				Roy, Raphaelle N.; Bonnet, Stephane; Charbonnier, Sylvie; Campagne, Aurelie			Efficient Workload Classification based on Ignored Auditory Probes: A Proof of Concept	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						workload; classification; auditory evoked potentials; spatial filtering	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; MENTAL WORKLOAD; BRAIN; TASK; LOAD; EEG; ERP; COMPONENTS	Mental workload is a mental state that is currently one of the main research focuses in neuroergonomics. It can notably be estimated using measurements in electroencephalography (EEG), a method that allows for direct mental state assessment. Auditory probes can be used to elicit event-related potentials (ERPs) that are modulated by workload. Although, some papers do report ERP modulations due to workload using attended or ignored probes, to our knowledge there is no literature regarding effective workload classification based on ignored auditory probes. In this paper, in order to efficiently estimate workload, we advocate for the use of such ignored auditory probes in a single-stimulus paradigm and a signal processing chain that includes a spatial filtering step. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on data acquired from participants that performed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery - II. They carried out this task during two 10-min blocks. Each block corresponded to a workload condition that was pseudorandomly assigned. The easy condition consisted of two monitoring tasks performed in parallel, and the difficult one consisted of those two tasks with an additional plane driving task. Infrequent auditory probes were presented during the tasks and the participants were asked to ignore them. The EEG data were denoised and the probes ERPs were extracted and spatially filtered using a canonical correlation analysis. Next, binary classification was performed using a Fisher LDA and a fivefold cross-validation procedure. Our method allowed for a very high estimation performance with a classification accuracy above 80% for every participant, and minimal intrusiveness thanks to the use of a single-stimulus paradigm. Therefore, this study paves the way to the efficient use of ERPs for mental state monitoring in close to real-life settings and contributes toward the development of adaptive user interfaces.

Various studies have already verified the relationship between emotion and the event-related potentials (ERPs). In this paper, a new methodology for emotion recognition is investigated by detecting single-trial ERPs related to some specific level of emotions. First, a spatial filter is constructed to estimate the ERP components. Then the most discriminative spatial and temporal features of the entire ERP waveform are extracted with linear discriminant analysis. The performance of this method is tested by classifying the emotional valence on three levels, the extremely negative, the moderately negative and the neutral, with the support vector machine (SVM). The result shows that the proposed method is effective.

Research suggests that 'wanting' as opposed to 'liking' is related to dopaminergic processes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that risk allele carriers of the Taq1A polymorphism exhibit late ERP changes in reaction to words representing incentive motivation, i.e. 'wanting' (word categories 'lust' and 'anticipation'), but not to words representing 'liking' ('closeness'). Methods: Seventy-two male participants performed an emotional-word Stroop task during EEG recording and were genotyped according to the Taq1A polymorphism of ANKK1/DRD2. Results: Positive emotional words related to anticipation and lust revealed blunted responses in the late positive potential (LPP) in carriers of the A1 allele, an effect absent in response to 'liking'-related words. These differences were not evident in the earlier posterior negativity (EPN). Conclusion: As no differences in dependence of the Taq1A genotype were observed in reaction to 'wanting'-and 'liking'-related words in the EPN, but merely in the LPP, it can be assumed that incentive-motivational stimuli only modify motivation-related ERP responses in carriers of the A1 allele of the Taq1A polymorphism, indicating the role of dopamine in late ERP components.

Evaluation of a clinically practical, ERP-based neurometric battery: Application to age-related changes in brain function	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Evoked potential; Neurometrics; EEG; ERP	MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; ASSESSMENT MOCA; EEG; BIOMARKERS; ATTENTION; SEARCH; MMN	Objective: Event-related potentials (ERPs) show promise as markers of neurocognitive dysfunction, but conventional recording procedures render measurement of many ERP-based neurometrics clinically impractical. The purpose of this work was (a) to develop a brief neurometric battery capable of eliciting a broad profile of ERPs in a single, clinically practical recording session, and (b) to evaluate the sensitivity of this neurometric profile to age-related changes in brain function. Methods: Nested auditory stimuli were interleaved with visual stimuli to create a 20-min battery designed to elicit at least eight ERP components representing multiple sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes (Frequency & Gap MMN, P50, P3, vMMN, C1, N2pc, and ERN). Data were recorded from 21 younger and 21 high-functioning older adults. Results: Significant multivariate differences were observed between ERP profiles of younger and older adults. Metrics derived from ERP profiles could be used to classify individuals into age groups with a jackknifed classification accuracy of 78.6%. Conclusions: Results support the utility of this design for neurometric profiling in clinical settings. Significance: This study demonstrates a method for measuring a broad profile of ERP-based neurometrics in a single, brief recording session.

First, we show the statistical significance of the P300 component in event-related potential (ERP) data from 14-channel EEGs across 25 subjects. We then apply a variety of machine learning techniques, comparing the user identification performance of various different combinations of a dimensionality reduction technique followed by a classification algorithm. Experimental results show that an identification accuracy of 72% can be achieved using only a single 800 ms ERP epoch. In addition, we demonstrate that the user identification accuracy can be significantly improved to more than 96.7% by joint classification of multiple epochs.

A lot of attention is devoted to investigation of emotional faces and expressions perception, but issue of context influence on face recognition process is not so explored. In the current study subjects had watched emotional film fragment before their EEG were recorded during the task with photos of neutral faces: actors from the film and fillers (actors who didn't appear in the film). Method of event-related potentials were used (ERP). The difference between amplitude of P200 component on faces of culprit and victim was found that may be connect with different subjective relevance of stimuli for person, who watched the film. Correlations between personal traits of subjects (anxiety, aggression, animosity) and enhanced amplitude of P200 on face of victim in comparison with filler face also were found. Further investigation of emotional context influence on face perception process is necessary.	[Kanunikov, I. E.; Pavlova, V.

Switching EEG Headsets Made Easy: Reducing Offline Calibration Effort Using Active Weighted Adaptation Regularization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Active learning; active transfer learning; active weighted adaptation regularization; domain adaptation; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential; single-trial classification; transfer learning; visual evoked potential; weighted adaptation regularization	FRAMEWORK	Electroencephalography (EEG) headsets are the most commonly used sensing devices for brain-computer interface. In real-world applications, there are advantages to extrapolating data from one user session to another. However, these advantages are limited if the data arise from different hardware systems, which often vary between application spaces. Currently, this creates a need to recalibrate classifiers, which negatively affects people's interest in using such systems. In this paper, we employ active weighted adaptation regularization (AwAR), which integrates weighted adaptation regularization (wAR) and active learning, to expedite the calibration process. wAR makes use of labeled data from the previous headset and handles class-imbalance, and active learning selects the most informative samples from the new headset to label. Experiments on single-trial event-related potential classification show that AwAR can significantly increase the classification accuracy, given the same number of labeled samples from the new headset. In other words, AwAR can effectively reduce the number of labeled samples required from the new headset, given a desired classification accuracy, suggesting value in collating data for use in wide scale transfer-learning applications.

This technique was tested to detect the N400 which is an ERP generally associated with recall. The chief advantages of the proposed technique are that it is robust to different ocular artifacts and yet sensitive to event related potentials. Further each signal will correspond to only a few features as opposed to 100s and 1000s of features obtained by traditional feature extraction techniques. The proposed steps involve a) Computing the first and second order difference of the data b) measuring mean and variance respectively for first and second order differencing over 1 second windows c) repeating the steps a and b after lagging the signal by 0.5 seconds. Differencing computes the change in amplitude of EEG signals, which is considered important in ERP analysis. Step (b) is a unique way of getting rid of abrupt signal changes which are artifacts, as for abrupt changes in the signal; the computed variance of the second difference is high. Also, computing windowed average of the first difference reveals the (increasing/decreasing) trend of the data. Step (c) ensures that potential changes are not missed if they lie across two windows during the first phase of windowing. The proposed approach of feature extraction by the above steps outperforms three established traditional feature extraction schemes in identifying N400 waveforms using support vector machines. The average classification accuracy obtained by the proposed feature set is 96.91%.

The effects of reward magnitude on reward processings: An averaged and single trial event-related potential study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Reward positivity; Dopamine; Approach motivation; P3b; Late positive potential	FEEDBACK; DOPAMINE; POSITIVITY; AMPLITUDE; VALENCE; LOSSES; SYSTEM; NUMBER; TASK; EEG	From a neurobiological and motivational perspective, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and reward positivity (RewP) event-related potential (ERP) components should increase with reward magnitude (reward associated with valence (success/failure) feedback). To test this hypothesis, we recorded participants electroencephalograms while presenting them with potential monetary rewards ($0.00$4.96) pre-trial for each trial of a reaction time task and presenting them with valence feedback post-trial. Averaged ERPs time-locked to valence feedback were extracted, and results revealed a valence by magnitude interaction for neural activity in the FRN/RewP time window. This interaction was driven by magnitude affecting RewP, but not FRN, amplitude. Moreover, single trial ERP analyses revealed a reliable correlation between magnitude and RewP, but not FRN, amplitude. Finally, P3b and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes were affected by magnitude. Results partly support the neurobiological (dopamine) account of the FRN/RewP and suggest motivation affects feedback processing, as indicated by multiple ERP components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This question was studied by presenting liminal targets in one of the four quadrants of the screen and asking the participants to make forced-choice localization responses and to rate their subjective visual awareness of each target, while electroencephalography was measured. In the analyses of event-related potential (ERP) correlates of awareness, response accuracy was kept constant so that only the subjectively rated awareness varied between high-awareness ('seen' rating) and low-awareness ('unseen' rating) targets. High-awareness-correct trials were associated with enhanced contralateral N200 at 180-280 ms as compared with low-awareness-correct trials. This effect (visual awareness negativity, VAN) also correlated with aware sensitivity to the presence vs. absence of the stimulus (d'). In addition, high-awareness-correct trials were associated with later enhanced P3 amplitudes (after 350 ms), but this effect correlated only with the response bias (c). ERP5 to low-awareness-correct trials elicited larger contralateral N200 than ERP5 to low-awareness-incorrect trials, and this effect correlated with conservative response bias, suggesting that it reflected weak awareness rather than unconscious processing. The results suggest that the enhanced N200 correlates with graded awareness. The results support theories of visual awareness in which early activity in visual cortex gives rise to subjective visual experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent research demonstrates that the perceived communicative embedding of perceptually identical language messages alters their cortical processing. When emotional trait-adjectives are perceived as human-generated personality feedback, event-related brain potentials are considerably larger than when the same adjectives are perceived as random computer-generated feedback. Here, we investigate the unique role of ascribed sender humanness for the underlying neural mechanisms. Participants were told that they were going to receive written positive, negative, or neutral feedback from an unknown stranger or from a socially intelligent computer system while high-density EEG was recorded. In the event-related potential (ERP), feedback from the 'human sender' elicited larger P2, Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), P3, and Late Positive Potential (LPP) components. The sources of this activity were localized in extended visual cortex, but also in the right superior frontal gyri, related to mentalizing about others, and the bilateral postcentral gyri implicated in embodied language processing. For emotional feedback, larger EPN, P3 and LPP amplitudes were also observed, resulting from enhanced activity in visual and temporal regions. Finally, for the EPN an interaction between sender and emotion was found, showing substantially increased visual processing of human-generated emotional feedback. These data confirm visual amplification effects induced by motivated attention but crucially also reveal distinct effects of perceiving a communication partner as human that activate 'social brain' structures. Obviously who is perceived as saying something can be as relevant as what is said and induce specific brain activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This contribution will explore the worth of overcoming this effort. The question will be discussed using as an example neuro-dialectological studies that apply the most important neuro-dialectological method to-date: the measurement of event-related potentials (ERPs) with electroencephalography (EEG). First, the course of linguistic change will be examined. Studies on Upper and Central German have demonstrated that phonological stability and change involve completely different process signatures in the brain physiology when speakers and hearers of neighboring dialects are in contact. Second, co-present varieties, i. e. that are used next to one another in everyday life (dialect vs. regiolect or standard), will be discussed. The co-presence alters the phonological processing of dialect whereby an integrated phonological system for both varieties begins to develop. The third point concerns the object-subject word order in various German and closely related varieties. Can it be shown that there are processing differences between varieties that maintain a distinction between nominative and accusative on the one hand, and varieties that have case syncretism (Zurich German, Frisian) on the other hand?

J	Shahaf, G				Shahaf, Goded			Migraine as dysfunctional drive reduction: Insight from electrophysiology	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article						Migraine; EEG; ERP; Drive reduction; Stress	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; STRESS; DOPAMINE; HABITUATION; DEPRESSION; SEROTONIN; ATTACKS; BRAIN	Migraine is a prevalent disease, which may cause significant discomfort and reduced functioning for days, including the preictal and postictal periods. During the interictal period, however, migraineurs seem to function normally. It is puzzling, therefore, that event-related potentials (ERPs) of migraine patients often differ at the group level also in the asymptomatic, interictal phase, both in early and later ERP waves. Furthermore both types of ERP waves demonstrate changes, which are often noticed 12-48 h before a migraine attack and continue throughout it. On the basis of previous work, it might be possible to associate these ERP differences and their dynamics with changes in patient attention, which might be further associated with stress. This paper suggests that such stress-related dynamics can explain both the ERP findings as well as the dynamics in clinical symptoms throughout the migraine cycle. It further suggests that migraine can be viewed as a (dysfunctional) stress-reducing solution. In this sense migraine can be viewed as a representative case for other stress-related and psychopathological disorders, which are also stress-reducing solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

EEG is electrical signals which are recorded by the sensors attached on the human scalp to detect human's brain activities along the scalp. EEG signal processing has been a technically challenging problem for researchers due to its extremely noisy nature compared to other different kinds of digital data such as voice or image. However, EEG signals also create promising research areas and applications for the human being. This paper aims at designing a brain-controlled interface using P300 component in EEG signal processing. The EEG signal's P300 component is an event related potential (ERP) component elicited by the human's brain in the process of decision making. We use the oddball paradigm presented by the P300-Speller to create the brain-computer interface for the subject to express their intention of thinking via the computer screen. The device used to record the brain signal is the Emotiv EPOC headset. We exploit the Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) to classify the P300 signals. We conduct the experiments to help people express their thought in 1-out-of-4-choice interfaces in real time. The choices, which are presented on the computer screen, could be anything from letters to images or specific symbols. The experimental results reveal the acceptable accuracy of correct classification to be 80 percent and the best bitrate of over 10 bits per minute.

Brain Network Activation Analysis Utilizing Spatiotemporal Features for Event Related Potentials Classification	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BNA; ERP; EEG; STEP; functional connectivity; machine learning	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; ALGORITHMS; COMPONENTS; STIMULI; LATENCY; FIELDS; TARGET	The purpose of this study was to introduce an improved tool for automated classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) using spatiotemporally parcellated events incorporated into a functional brain network activation (BNA) analysis. The auditory oddball ERP paradigm was selected to demonstrate and evaluate the improved tool. Methods: The ERPs of each subject were decomposed into major dynamic spatiotemporal events. Then, a set of spatiotemporal events representing the group was generated by aligning and clustering the spatiotemporal events of all individual subjects. The temporal relationship between the common group events generated a network, which is the spatiotemporal reference BNA model. Scores were derived by comparing each subject's spatiotemporal events to the reference BNA model and were then entered into a support vector machine classifier to classify subjects into relevant subgroups. The reliability of the BNA scores (test-retest repeatability using intraclass correlation) and their utility as a classification tool were examined in the context of Target-Novel classification. Results: BNA intraclass correlation values of repeatability ranged between 0.51 and 0.82 for the known ERP components N100, P200, and P300. Classification accuracy was high when the trained data were validated on the same subjects for different visits (AUCs 0.93 and 0.95). The classification accuracy remained high for a test group recorded at a different clinical center with a different recording system (AUCs 0.81, 0.85 for 2 visits). Conclusion: The improved spatiotemporal BNA analysis demonstrates high classification accuracy. The BNA analysis method holds promise as a tool for diagnosis, follow-up and drug development associated with different neurological conditions.

N.			Developing Brain Vital Signs: Initial Framework for Monitoring Brain Function Changes Over Time	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						clinical neuroscience; ERPs; evoked potentials; vital signs; neurology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RETEST RELIABILITY; VEGETATIVE STATE; CONSCIOUSNESS; COMA; IMPAIRMENT; DISORDERS; SCALE	Clinical assessment of brain function relies heavily on indirect behavior-based tests. Unfortunately, behavior-based assessments are subjective and therefore susceptible to several confounding factors. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs), derived from electroencephalography (EEG), are often used to provide objective, physiological measures of brain function. Historically, ERPs have been characterized extensively within research settings, with limited but growing clinical applications. Over the past 20 years, we have developed clinical ERP applications for the evaluation of functional status following serious injury and/or disease. This work has identified an important gap: the need for a clinically accessible framework to evaluate ERP measures. Crucially, this enables baseline measures before brain dysfunction occurs, and might enable the routine collection of brain function metrics in the future much like blood pressure measures today. Here, we propose such a framework for extracting specific ERPs as potential "brain vital signs." This framework enabled the translation/transformation of complex ERP data into accessible metrics of brain function for wider clinical utilization. To formalize the framework, three essential ERPs were selected as initial indicators: (1) the auditory N100 (Auditory sensation): (2) the auditory oddball P300 (Basic attention): and (3) the auditory speech processing N400 (Cognitive processing). First step validation was conducted on healthy younger and older adults (age range: 22-82 years). Results confirmed specific ERPs at the individual level (86.81-98.96%), verified predictable age-related differences (P300 latency delays in older adults, p < 0.05), and demonstrated successful linear transformation into the proposed brain vital sign (BVS) framework (basic attention latency sub-component of BVS framework reflects delays in older adults, p < 0.05). The findings represent an initial critical step in developing, extracting, and characterizing ERPs as vital signs, critical for subsequent evaluation of dysfunction in conditions like concussion and/or dementia.

Far less attention has been dedicated to the investigation of brain processes in more traditional workplaces, such as manual assembly, which are still ubiquitous in industry. The present study investigates whether assembly workers' attention can be enhanced if they are instructed with which hand to initiate the assembly operation, as opposed to the case when they can commence the operation with whichever hand they prefer. For this aim, we replicated a specific workplace, where 17 participants in the study simulated a manual assembly operation of the rubber hoses that are used in vehicle hydraulic brake systems, while wearing wireless electroencephalography (EEG). The specific EEG feature of interest for this study was the P300 components' amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP), as it has previously been shown that it is positively related to human attention. The behavioral attention-related modality of reaction times (RTs) was also recorded. Participants were presented with two distinct tasks during the simulated operation, which were counterbalanced across participants. In the first task, digits were used as indicators for the operation initiation (Numbers task), where participants could freely choose with which hand they would commence the action upon seeing the digit. In the second task, participants were presented with arrows, which served as instructed operation initiators (Arrows task), and they were instructed to start each operation with the hand that corresponded to the arrow direction. The results of this study showed that the P300 amplitude was significantly higher in the instructed condition. Interestingly, the RTs did not differ across any task conditions. This, together with the other findings of this study, suggests that attention levels can be increased using instructed responses without compromising work performance or operators' well-being, paving the way for future applications in manual assembly task design.

Twenty-five aMCI (16 F; 68.5 +/- 8 years) and 25 age-and gender-matched normal control subjects (16 F; 65.4 +/- 7.1 years) completed two visual Go/NoGo tasks. In the single car task, responses were made based on single exemplars of a car (Go) and a dog (NoGo) (basic). In the object animal task, responses were based on multiple exemplars of objects (Go) and animals (NoGo) (superordinate). The aMCI subjects had higher commission errors on the NoGo trials compared to the control subjects, whereas both groups had comparable omission errors and reaction times during the Go trials. The aMCI subjects had significantly prolonged N2 ERP latency during Go and NoGo trials across tasks compared to the controls. Both groups showed similar categorization effects and response type effects in N2/P3 ERP latencies and P3 amplitude. Our findings indicate that altered early neural processing indexed by N2 latency distinguishes subjects with aMCI from controls during the Go/NoGo task. Prolonged Go-N2 latency in aMCI appears to precede behavioral changes in response execution, whereas prolonged NoGo-N2 latency underlies behavioral deterioration in response inhibition.

Apathy, Novelty Processing, and the P3 Potential in Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; apathy; novelty; ERP; P3	DEPRESSION; EEG; ATTENTION; STIMULI; EVENTS; ERP	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by deficits in goal-directed behavior as well as mood and motivational symptoms, including apathy, depression, and anxiety. The present study investigated novelty processing in PD, using event-related potentials (ERPs) to characterize electrophysiological reflections of visual novelty processing. Since apathy has been associated with decreased novelty processing (P3 potentials) in highly apathetic PD patients, we were particularly interested to see if this relationship exists in a sample of PD patients with heterogeneous levels of apathy. Non-demented patients with PD receiving dopaminergic treatment (n = 14) and healthy control participants (n = 12) completed a three-stimulus oddball task while EEG was recorded. Relative to controls, the PD patients exhibited reductions in centrofrontally distributed P3 potentials when viewing novel distracters during this task. Distracter-related P3 amplitudes evoked by novel distracters were strongly associated with apathy symptoms, even after controlling for the effects of depression, anxiety, and executive function. Executive dysfunction was also predictive of novelty-related P3 processing, yet this relationship was independent from that of apathy. These findings suggest that the brain's electrophysiological response to novelty is closely related to both motivational and cognitive symptoms in PD, even for patients whose apathy symptoms are not excessive. These results have significant implications for our understanding of non-motor symptoms in this clinical population.	[Kaufman, David A.

Atypical sensory reactivity influences auditory attentional control in adults with autism spectrum disorders	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						P50; P1; N100; autism; attention; EEG; ERP; sensory; reactivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROCESSING ABNORMALITIES; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY	Frequent observations of atypical sensory reactivity in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) suggest that the perceptual experience of those on the Spectrum is dissimilar to neurotypicals. Moreover, variable attention abilities in people with ASD, ranging from good control to periods of high distractibility, may be related to atypical sensory reactivity. This study used auditory event-related potential (ERP) measures to evaluate top-down and bottom-up attentional processes as a function of perceptual load, and examined these factors with respect to sensory reactivity. Twenty-five age and IQ-matched participants (ASD: 22.5 year, SD=4.1 year; Controls: 22.8 year, SD=5.1 year) completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile prior to performing a modified 3-stimulus (target, non-target, and distractor) auditory oddball target detection task EEG was recorded during task completion. ERP analysis assessed early sensory processing (P50, approximate to 50 ms latency; N100, approximate to 100 ms latency), cognitive control (N200, approximate to 200 ms latency), and attentional processing (P3a and P3b, approximate to 300 ms latency). Behavioral data demonstrates participants with ASD and neurotypical performed similarly on auditory target detection, but diverged on sensory profiles. Target ERP measures associated with top-down control (P3b latency) significantly increased under greater load in controls, but not in participants with ASD. Early ERP responses associated with bottom-up attention (P50 amplitude) were positively correlated to increased sensory sensitivity. Findings suggest specific neural mechanisms for increased perceptual capacity and enhanced bottom-up processing of sensory stimuli in people with autism. Results from participants with ASD are consistent with load theory and enhanced perceptual functioning. Autism Res2016, 9: 1079-1092.

Preliminary evidence of reduced brain network activation in patients with post-traumatic migraine following concussion	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sport-related concussion; Brain network activation; Electroencephalography; Post-traumatic migraine	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIGH-SCHOOL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RECOVERY; SPORT; IMPACT; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; PREDICTORS	Post-traumatic migraine (PTM) (i.e., headache, nausea, light and/or noise sensitivity) is an emerging risk factor for prolonged recovery following concussion. Concussions and migraine share similar pathophysiology characterized by specific ionic imbalances in the brain. Given these similarities, patients with PTM following concussion may exhibit distinct electrophysiological patterns, although researchers have yet to examine the electrophysiological brain activation in patients with PTM following concussion. A novel approach that may help differentiate brain activation in patients with and without PTM is brain network activation (BNA) analysis. BNA involves an algorithmic analysis applied to multichannel EEG-ERP data that provides a network map of cortical activity and quantitative data during specific tasks. A prospective, repeated measures design was used to evaluate BNA (during Go/NoGo task), EEG-ERP, cognitive performance, and concussion related symptoms at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-injury intervals among athletes with a medically diagnosed concussion with PTM (n=15) and without (NO-PTM) (n=22); and age, sex, and concussion history matched controls without concussion (CONTROL) (n=20). Participants with PTM had significantly reduced BNA compared to NO-PTM and CONTROLS for Go and NoGo components at 3 weeks and for NoGo component at 4 weeks post-injury. The PTM group also demonstrated a more prominent deviation of network activity compared to the other two groups over a longer period of time. The composite BNA algorithm may be a more sensitive measure of electrophysiological change in the brain that can augment established cognitive assessment tools for detecting impairment in individuals with PTM.

Seventy six patients and 61 controls were selected and assigned into two study groups, MCI and control, respectively. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) was used for assessment of early trauma, episodic memory and association learning scales for memory evaluation. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured using electroencephalography (EEG) to indicate brain electrical activity of subjects during memory/cognitive tests. MCI patients showed higher scores of physical neglect and lower scores of emotional abuse in childhood than control group. Physical neglect score was negatively correlated with scores of MMSE, MoCA, episodic memory, calculation, and the amplitude of CzP300, FzP300 and PzP300, while a positive correlation was seen between the score of physical neglect and the latency of PzN200, FzN200, CzN200, CzP300, FzP300 and PzP300. The score of emotional abuse was weakly correlated with FzP300 amplitude, but not with any other ERP components. Our results suggested that early childhood exposure to physical neglect may lead to impairment in learning and memory, particularly in the associative learning and episodic memory, in old age.

In a specially designed experiment, usually in which a large number of identical stimuli are presented repeatedly Event-related potential (ERP) can be extracted by averaging EEG epochs together. Since ERP is the measured brain response that is the direct result of a specific sensory or cognitive event, it has been widely used in the research fields of neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and has important application in Brain computer interface (BCI). Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) are cerebral cortex responses to a repetitive visual stimulus oscillating at a constant frequency, and P300 component evoked by a rare, random, task-relevant stimulus. Although there have been many attempts in extraction and analysis of P300 and SSVEP, most of the traditional ERP paradigms only evoke one kind of EEG pattern for the subsequent studies, and up to now there is no work to focus on the interaction of SSVEP and P300. In this work, we present a new ERP paradigm that involves signal-detection task in frequency flashing stimulation, which would generate P300 and SSVEP simultaneously. By analysis of the feature of SSVEP and P300 in spatial and temporal modals, the interactions of SSVEP and P300 are presented: there are mutual effects between the P300 and SSVEP SSVEP stimuli increase the amplitude and delay the latency of P300, while P300 task reduces the power of SSVEP. This study has potentially important application in the development of hybrid BCI, and help to cognitive science, psychology research.

The electrophysiological characteristics may serve as valuable biomarkers for the genetic vulnerability underlying alcoholism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the SGIP1 gene and the theta ERP quantitative traits. Method. The theta band (4-7 Hz) visual ERP occurring in the P300 response in the resting EEG were examined to explore the electrophysiological effects of alcohol on the brain in five regions: frontal, central, parietal, temporal and occipital in patients with alcohol addiction. In addition, we tested the potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the SGIP1 gene and ERP quantitative traits. Results. We found that the amplitude of the auditory P300 response differed considerably among groups of alcoholics in the frontal, central and temporal areas of the brain and it was lower in the studied brain regions in alcoholics in comparison to non-alcoholics. However, among subjects in the young adult group (GR-1) there was no statistical difference in amplitude of P300 response with control subjects in all studied brain regions in comparison with non-alcoholics. Moreover, we revealed that SNP rs10889635 had a significant effect on P300 amplitude in the central and temporal regions. The reduced P300 amplitude was in AA carriers in comparison to both carriers of GG and GA alleles. Conclusion. The present study demonstrated a possible association of target P300 evoked theta and of alcohol dependence with SNPs from the gene SGIP1 in the region of rs10889635, but further studies are required.

Most neurophysiological studies of crowding employed functional neuroimaging, but because of its low temporal resolution, no definitive answer can be given to the question: is crowding arising at the earliest or at later stages of visual processing? Here, we used a classic letters crowding paradigm in combination with electroencephalography (EEG). We manipulated the critical space between peripheral target and flankers, while ensuring a proper control of basic stimulus characteristics. Analyses were focused on event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands. At the ERP level, we found that the first sign of a crowding induced modulation of EEG activity was a suppression of the N1 component. Oscillatory analysis revealed an early stimulus-evoked gamma enhancement and a later alpha reduction that, however, were not influenced by the amount of crowding. Importantly, reduction in the beta band reflected the amount of crowding (i.e., stronger reduction for strong relative to mid crowding condition) and correlated with individual behavioral performance. Collectively, these findings show that crowding for complex objects emerges at later stages of visual processing, possibly as a result of large-scale network interaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggests that the decline in tic severity and the ability to suppress tics relate to the development of self-regulatory functions in late childhood and adolescence. Hence, tasks measuring performance monitoring might provide insight into the regulation of tics in children with TS. Method: Twenty-five children with TS, including 14 with comorbid Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 39 children with ADHD and 35 typically developing children aged 8-12 years were tested with a modified Eriksen-Flanker task during a 34-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Task performance, as well as stimulus-locked and response-locked event-related potentials (ERP) were analyzed and compared across groups. Results: Participants did not differ in their behavioral performance. Children with TS showed higher amplitudes of an early P3 component of the stimulus-locked ERPs in ensemble averages and in separate trial outcomes, suggesting heightened orienting and/or attention during stimulus evaluation. In response-locked averages, children with TS had a slightly higher positive complex before the motor response, likely also reflecting a late P3. Groups did not differ in post-response components, particularly in the error-related negativity (ERN) and error-related positivity (Pe). Conclusions: These findings suggest that children with TS may employ additional attentional resources as a compensatory mechanism to maintain equal behavioral performance.

Electroencephalogram data were recorded when participants decided whether the metaphor using an animal word for the vehicle rendered by a picture was appropriate or not. There were two conditions: appropriateness (e.g., sport utility vehicles + tiger) vs. inappropriateness (e.g., sport utility vehicles + cat). The ERP results showed that inappropriate metaphor elicited larger N300 (280-360 ms) and N400 (380-460 ms) amplitude than appropriate one, which were different from previous exclusively verbal metaphor studies that rarely observed the N300 effect. A P600 (550-750 ms) was also observed and larger in appropriate metaphor condition. Besides, the time-frequency principal component analysis revealed that two independent theta activities indexed the separable processes (retrieval of semantic features and semantic integration) underlying the N300 and N400. Delta band was also induced within a later time window and best characterized the integration process underlying P600. These results indicate the specific cognitive mechanism of multimodal metaphor comprehension that is different from verbal metaphor processing, mirrored by several separable processes indexed by ERP components and time-frequency components. The present study extends the metaphor research by uncovering the functional roles of delta and theta as well as their unique contributions to the ERP components during multimodal metaphor comprehension.

Such estimation, however, requires a large number of sweeps and/or a careful rejection of artifacts affecting the electroencephalographic recording. New method: In this article we propose a method for estimating ERPs as they are naturally contaminated by biological and instrumental artifacts. The proposed estimator makes use of multivariate spatio-temporal filtering to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This approach integrates a number of relevant advances in ERP data analysis, such as single-sweep adaptive estimation of amplitude and latency and the use of multivariate regression to account for ERP overlapping in time. Results: We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator analyzing a dataset comprising 24 subjects involving a visual odd-ball paradigm, without performing any artifact rejection. Comparison with existing method(s): As compared to the arithmetic average, a lower number of sweeps is needed. Furthermore, artifact rejection can be performed roughly using permissive automatic procedures. Conclusion: The proposed ensemble average estimator yields a reference companion to the arithmetic ensemble average estimation, suitable both in clinical and research settings. The method can be applied equally to event related fields (ERF) recorded by means of magnetoencephalography. In this article we describe all necessary methodological details to promote testing and comparison of this proposed method by peers. Furthermore, we release a MATLAB toolbox, a plug-in for the EEGLAB software suite and a stand-alone executable application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spectral entropy feature subset selection using SEPCOR to detect alcoholic impact on gamma sub band visual event related potentials of multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG)	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Visual event related potentials (ERP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Spectral entropy; Gamma sub band; Separability & Correlation (SEPCOR); Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network; k-Nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers; Independent Component Analysis (ICA)	SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; ARTIFACTS	The problem of analyzing and identifying regions of high discrimination between alcoholics and controls in a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is modeled as a feature subset selection technique that can improve the recognition rate between both groups. Several studies have reported efficient detection of alcoholics by feature extraction and selection in gamma band visual event related potentials (ERP) of a multichannel EEG signal. However, in these studies the correlation between features and their class information is not considered for feature selection. This may lead to redundancy in the feature set and result in over fitting. Therefore in this study, a statistical feature selection technique based on Separability & Correlation analysis (SEPCOR) is proposed to select an optimal feature subset automatically that possesses minimum correlation between selected channels and maximum class separation. The optimal feature selection consists of a ranking method that assigns ranks to channels based on a variability measure (V-measure). From the ranked feature set of highly discriminative features, different subsets are automatically selected by heuristically applying a correlation threshold in steps from 0.02 to 0.1. These subsets are applied as input features to multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers to discriminate alcoholic and control visual ERP. Prior to feature selection, spectral entropy features are computed in gamma sub band (30-55 Hz) interval of a 61-channel multi-trial EEG signal with multiple object recognition tasks. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is performed on raw EEG data to remove eye blink, motion and muscle artifacts. Results indicate that both classifiers exhibit excellent classification accuracy of 99.6%, for a feature subset of 22 optimal channels with correlation threshold of 0.1. In terms of computation time, k-NN classifier outperforms multilayer perceptron-back propagation (MLP-BP) network with 7.93 s whereas MLP network takes 55 s to perform the recognition task with the same accuracy. Compared to feature section methods used in previous studies on the same EEG alcoholic database, there is a significant improvement in classification accuracy based on the proposed SEPCOR method.

The Repeated Measures Anova (RMANOVA) test is used to determine within group and between group variability of SE values in (61 channels) various specified regions of the brain during a visual single object recognition task. In order to discriminate visual ERPs produced in alcoholics and controls within the beta band, SE features are applied to a k-NN classifier. RMANOVA tests show that there is little statistical significance (p>0.05) as far as the marginal mean between groups is considered. However, the marginal mean variability within group indicates that there are some selected channels in which the statistical significance is observed (p<0.05). The classification results show that k-NN classification achieves 90.41% accuracy with k=8. It is also observed that the mean of spectral entropy values increase mainly in the left frontal region of the brain in alcoholics as compared to controls.

The degree to which participants engage in effective encoding can be indexed in electroencephalographic (EEG) data by studying event-related potential (ERP) subsequent memory effects. The current study investigated ERP correlates of memory success operationalised with two different measures-memory selectivity and global memory-to assess whether previously observed ERP subsequent memory effects reflect focused encoding of task-relevant information (memory selectivity), general encoding success (global memory), or both. Building on previous work, the present study combined an attention switching paradigm-in which participants were presented with compound object-word stimuli and switched between attending to the object or the word across trials with a later recognition memory test for those stimuli, while recording their EEG. Our results provided clear evidence that subsequent memory effects resulted from selective attentional focusing and effective top-down control (memory selectivity) in contrast to more general encoding success effects (global memory). Further analyses addressed the question of whether successful encoding depended on similar control mechanisms to those involved in attention switching. Interestingly, differences in the ERP correlates of attention switching and successful encoding, particularly during the poststimulus period, indicated that variability in encoding success occurred independently of prestimulus demands for top-down cognitive control. These results suggest that while effects of selective attention and selective encoding co-occur behaviourally their ERP correlates are at least partly dissociable.

Bootstrap Signal-to-Noise Confidence Intervals: An Objective Method for Subject Exclusion and Quality Control in ERP Studies	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERP); signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); bootstrap confidence intervals; subject exclusion criteria	EEG-DATA; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL	Analysis of event-related potential (ERP) data includes several steps to ensure that ERPs meet an appropriate level of signal quality. One such step, subject exclusion, rejects subject data if ERP waveforms fail to meet an appropriate level of signal quality. Subject exclusion is an important quality control step in the ERP analysis pipeline as it ensures that statistical inference is based only upon those subjects exhibiting clear evoked brain responses. This critical quality control step is most often performed simply through visual inspection of subject-level ERPs by investigators. Such an approach is qualitative, subjective, and susceptible to investigator bias, as there are no standards as to what constitutes an ERP of sufficient signal quality. Here, we describe a standardized and objective method for quantifying waveform quality in individual subjects and establishing criteria for subject exclusion. The approach uses bootstrap resampling of ERP waveforms (from a pool of all available trials) to compute a signal-to-noise ratio confidence interval (SNR-CI) for individual subject waveforms. The lower bound of this SNR-CI (SNRLB) yields an effective and objective measure of signal quality as it ensures that ERP waveforms statistically exceed a desired signal-to-noise criterion. SNRLB provides a quantifiable metric of individual subject ERP quality and eliminates the need for subjective evaluation of waveform quality by the investigator. We detail the SNR-CI methodology, establish the efficacy of employing this approach with Monte Carlo simulations, and demonstrate its utility in practice when applied to ERP datasets.

Previous studies revealed that participants can solve arithmetic problems by using several arithmetic strategies. In this review, we discuss the added value of using electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate such strategies. Indeed, this technique enables to delineate different aspects of information processing, and can further our understanding of arithmetic strategies. The investigation of processes involved within arithmetic strategies with event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency analyses allows to discover how participants solve different types of problems by enabling to distinguish arithmetic strategies on the bases of their electrophysiological signatures. Moreover, this technique is fruitful to investigate the time course of arithmetic strategy selection and execution. EEG can also help to investigate the role of general cognitive processes during execution of arithmetic strategies. Finally, EEG is also a powerful tool to specify how strategy use differs between groups of different skills or ages. Overall, by addressing these ends, EEG further our understanding of variations in participants' arithmetic performance as a function of different characteristics, such as participants' (e.g., age, skills), problems' (e.g., problem or split size, rule violation), or situations' (e.g., strategy execution on previous problems, correctness of proposed answers) characteristics.

The current study examined neurocognitive individual differences associated with preferences to use technology in relation to social-emotional outcomes. In Study 1 (N=91), a self-report measure, the Social Media Communication Questionnaire (SMCQ), was evaluated as an assessment of preferences for communicating positive and negative emotions on a scale ranging from purely via CMC to purely face-to-face. In Study 2, SMCQ preferences were examined in relation to event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with early emotional attention capture and reactivity (the frontal N1) and later sustained emotional processing and regulation (the late positive potential (LPP)). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while 22 participants passively viewed emotional and neutral pictures and completed an emotion regulation task with instructions to increase, decrease, or maintain their emotional responses. A greater preference for CMC was associated with reduced size of and satisfaction with social support, greater early (N1) attention capture by emotional stimuli, and reduced LPP amplitudes to unpleasant stimuli in the increase emotion regulatory task. These findings are discussed in the context of possible emotion- and social-regulatory functions of CMC.

When an oddball paradigm is applied to elicit ERPs, difference wave (DW, responses of deviant stimuli minus those of standard ones) is often used to remove the common responses between the deviant and the standard. Thus, DW can be produced first, and then ICA is used to decompose the DW. Or, ICA is performed on responses of the deviant and standard stimuli separately, and then DW is applied on the filtered responses. In this study, we compared the two approaches to analyzing mismatch negativity (MMN). We found that DW introduced noise in the time and space domains, resulting in more difficulty to obtain the spatial properties of MMN by ICA on DW. Thus, we suggest using ICA to spatially filter event-related responses of each stimulus; and then DW is produced by the filtered responses.

Stability of an ERP-based measure of brain network activation (BNA) in athletes: A new electrophysiological assessment tool for concussion	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Athlete; brain network activation; concussion; electroencephalography; event-related potential; reliability	SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; IMPAIRMENT; FOOTBALL	Primary objective: To determine test-re-test reliabilities of novel Evoked Response Potential (ERP)-based Brain Network Activation (BNA) scores in healthy athletes.Research design: Observational, repeated-measures study.Methods and design: Forty-two healthy male and female high school and collegiate athletes completed auditory oddball and go/no-go ERP assessments at baseline, 1 week, 6 weeks and 1 year. The BNA algorithm was applied to the ERP data, considering electrode location, frequency band, peak latency and normalized amplitude to generate seven unique BNA scores for each testing session.Main outcomes and results: Mean BNA scores, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values and reliable change (RC) values were calculated for each of the seven BNA networks. BNA scores ranged from 46.3 34.9 to 69.9 +/- 22.8, ICC values ranged from 0.46-0.65 and 95% RC values ranged from 38.3-68.1 across the seven networks.Conclusions: The wide range of BNA scores observed in this population of healthy athletes suggests that a single BNA score or set of BNA scores from a single after-injury test session may be difficult to interpret in isolation without knowledge of the athlete's own baseline BNA score(s) and/or the results of serial tests performed at additional time points. The stability of each BNA network should be considered when interpreting test-re-test BNA score changes.

Methods: Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design, this pilot study assessed the effect of treatment for 1 week with SLT and placebo (1 week washout period) on neurocognitive and cardiovascular function in healthy adults. Sixteen adults completed a computerised neuropsychological test battery (Compass), and had their electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and cardiovascular system function assessed. Primary outcome measures were cognitive test scores and oddball task event-related potential (ERP) component amplitudes. Secondary outcome measures were resting EEG spectral band amplitudes, and cardiovascular parameters. Results: Treatment with SLT, compared to placebo, resulted in small improvements in working memory, a slight increase in auditory target (cf. nontarget) P3a amplitude, and a decrease in auditory N1 target (cf. nontarget) amplitude. There was no effect of SLT on EEG amplitude in delta, theta, alpha, or beta bands in both eyes open and eyes closed resting conditions, or on aortic and peripheral pulse pressure, and resting heartrate. Conclusions: Findings suggest that SLT has the potential to improve working memory performance in healthy adults; a larger sample size is needed to confirm this.

Method and Scope: First, the recent history leading to the use of EEG measures as endophenotypes and biomarkers for disease and treatment response are reviewed. Two key controversies within the area of noninvasive human electrophysiology research are discussed, and problems that currently either function as barriers or provide gateways to progress. First, the differences between the main types of EEG measurements (event-related potentials, quantitative EEG, and time-frequency measures) and how they can contribute collectively to better understanding of cortical dynamics underlying cognition and behavior are highlighted. Second, we focus on the ongoing shift in analytic focus to specific cortical sources and source networks whose dynamics are relevant to the clinical and experimental focus of the study, and the effective increase in source signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that may be obtained in the process. Conclusions: Understanding of these issues informs any discussion of current trends in EEG research. We highlight possible ways to evolve our understanding of brain dynamics beyond the apparent contradictions in understanding and modeling EEG activity highlighted by these controversies. Finally, we summarize some promising future directions of EEG biomarker research in child psychopathology.

Gain/loss ratios around 2: 1 mark an indifference point with a maximum decision conflict. Biological/psychological mechanisms behind this decision bias are largely unknown. Previous studies used a trait perspective with LA as an overall decision strategy, aggregated over many decisions. The present event-related potential (ERP) study on N = 36 healthy participants investigates neural correlates of LA using a different, situational approach by contrasting the 2: 1 ratio trials with low conflict trials and examining the interaction with trait LA. Results show an attenuation of a posterior positive slow wave in 2: 1 compared with low conflict decisions. In participants with high trait LA, this attenuation appears even in low conflict decisions. We suggest this indicates a relative negativity associated with conflict detection and perception depending on trait LA.

Twenty-three advanced second language speakers of English (first language [L1] German) were compared to a control group of 19 L1 English speakers from an earlier study. We found a frontocentral negativity for regular relative to irregular past-tense forms (e.g., asked vs. held) during (silent) production, and no difference for the present-tense condition (e.g., asks vs. holds), replicating the ERP effect obtained for the L1 group. This ERP effect suggests that combinatorial processing is involved in producing regular past-tense forms, in both late bilinguals and L1 speakers. We also suggest that this paradigm is a useful tool for future studies of online language production.

Specifically, research on patients' ability to flexibly shift between cognitive sets is still scarce and unsystematic. The present study set out to compensate for this lack by providing an in-depth analysis of ALS-related set-shifting impairments. Method: We first present a quantitative overview of the literature revealing that the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is sensitive to set-shifting impairments in ALS. Moreover, we evaluated patients' performance on a computerized task-switching paradigm modeled after the WCST to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying their set-shifting impairments. Twenty-one ALS patients and 21 age-and education-matched controls were required to respond to changing task demands while their EEG was being measured. Results: Behavioral results revealed significant set-shifting deficits in patients suffering from ALS. Executive deficits were accompanied by substantial alterations of event-related brain activity. While switch cues elicited a more positive posterior event-related potential (ERP) waveform than repeat cues in healthy controls, ERP amplitudes did not vary as a function of switching demand in ALS patients. Individual differences in posterior switch positivity were reliably associated with patients' performance on neuropsychological tests of executive functioning. Conclusions: The absence of switch-related ERP modulations appears to be a sensitive indicator of executive deficits in ALS patients. Our results suggest that ALS compromises the frontoparietal brain networks involved in anticipatory set-shifting, rendering patients unable to flexibly adapt to changes in environmental contingencies.

Most common BCIs are based on visual stimulation and it require good control of the user's eye movements. However, people who have lost their control over eye muscles needed BCI systems that do not rely on the visual modality. In this paper, we compared three types of BCI paradigms which based on auditory event related potential (ERP), tactile ERP and motor imagery. Ten healthy subjects (7 male, aged 23-26 years) took part in this study.

The computation of ERPs involves averaging over multiple participants and multiple stimuli. Especially with speech stimuli, which also evoke substantial exogenous excitation, even averaging within conditions results in pooling many sources of variance. This raises questions about the statistical processing needed to uncover reliable differences between conditions. In this study we investigate differences between ERPs when participants listened to full and reduced pronunciations of verb forms in Dutch, in isolation and in mid-sentence position. Conventional statistical analysis uncovers some (but not all) differences between full and reduced forms in isolation, but not in mid-sentence position. In this paper, we show that linear mixed models (lmer) and generalized additive models (gam), which are able to account for participant- and stimulus-related variance may uncover more effects than conventional statistical models. However, depending on the complexity of the data, lmer and gam models may not be able to fit the data closely enough to warrant blind interpretation of the summary output. We discuss opportunities and threats of these approaches to analyzing ERP signals.

Spatial filters reduce the dimensionality of the data while suppressing the noise contribution and spectral filters attenuate frequency component that most likely belong to noise subspace. However, the frequency spectrum of ERPs overlap with that of the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) and different types of artifacts. Therefore, proper selection of the spectra filter cutoffs is not a trivial task. In this research work, we developed a supervised method to estimate the spatit and finite impulse response (FIR) spectral filters, simultaneously. We evaluated the performance of the methodon offline single trial classification of ERPs in datasets recorded during an oddball paradigm. The propose spatio-spectral filter improved the overall single-trial classification performance by almost 9% on averab compared with the case that no spatial filters were used. We also analyzed the effects of different spectral filter lengths and the number of retained channels after spatial filtering.

Typing is an interesting candidate for investigating further this issue. First, typing presumably relies on the same distributed left-lateralized brain network as handwriting and speech production. Second, typing has its own set of highly specific motor constraints, such as internal keystroke representations that hold information about both letter identity and spatial characteristics of the key to strike. The present study aims to further develop research on typed production, by targeting the dynamics between linguistic and motor neural networks. Specifically, we used a typed picture-naming task to examine the interplay between response retrieval and motor planning. To track processes associated with both linguistic processing and keystroke representation, we manipulated, respectively, the semantic context in which the target appeared and the side of the first keystrokes of the word. We recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) continuously from the presentation of a picture, to the typing of its name, and computed both event-related potentials (ERP) and beta-band power analyses. Non-parametric data-driven analysis revealed a clear pattern of response preparation over both hemispheres close to response time, in both the ERP and beta-band power modulations. This was preceded by a left-lateralized power decrease in the beta-band, presumably representing memory retrieval, and an early contrast in ERP, between left and right keystrokes' preparation. We discuss these results in terms of a dynamic access approach for internal keystroke representations, and argue for an integrative rather than separatist view of linguistic and motor processes.

Reduced habituation of auditory evoked potentials indicate cortical hyper-excitability in Fragile X Syndrome	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PSYCHOTIC BIPOLAR DISORDER; MOUSE MODEL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PAIRED STIMULI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ABNORMALITIES; INDIVIDUALS; MINOCYCLINE	Sensory hypersensitivities are common, clinically distressing features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Preclinical evidence suggests this abnormality may result from synaptic hyper-excitability in sensory systems. This model predicts reduced sensory habituation to repeated stimulus presentation. Fourteen adolescents and adults with FXS and 15 age-matched controls participated in a modified auditory gating task using trains of 4 identical tones during dense array electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potential and single trial time-frequency analyses revealed decreased habituation of the N1 event-related potential response in FXS, and increased gamma power coupled with decreases in gamma phase-locking during the early-stimulus registration period. EEG abnormalities in FXS were associated with parent reports of heightened sensory sensitivities and social communication deficits. Reduced habituation and altered gamma power and phase-locking to auditory cues demonstrated here in FXS patients parallels preclinical findings with Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, the EEG abnormalities seen in FXS patients support the model of neocortical hyperexcitability in FXS, and may provide useful translational biomarkers for evaluating novel treatment strategies targeting its neural substrate.

Because faces consist of similar physical structures, cosmetic makeup is typically used to highlight individual features, particularly those of the eyes (i.e., eye shadow) and mouth (i.e., lipstick). Though event-related potentials have been utilized to study various aspects of facial processing, the influence of cosmetics on specific ERP components remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the application of cosmetic makeup and the amplitudes of the P1 and N170 event-related potential components during facial perception tasks. Moreover, the influence of visual perception on N170 amplitude, was evaluated under three makeup conditions: Eye Shadow, Lipstick, and No Makeup. Electroencephalography was used to monitor 17 participants who were exposed to visual stimuli under each these three makeup conditions. The results of the present study subsequently demonstrated that the Lipstick condition elicited a significantly greater N170 amplitude than the No Makeup condition, while P1 amplitude was unaffected by any of the conditions. Such findings indicate that the application of cosmetic makeup alters general facial perception but exerts no influence on the perception of low-level visual features. Collectively, these results support the notion that the application of makeup induces subtle alterations in the processing of facial stimuli, with a particular effect on the processing of specific facial components (i.e., the mouth), as reflected by changes in N170 amplitude.

Methods: Participants were 11 children who stutter (CWS; mean age 8.1, age range 6.3-9.5 years) and 19 typically developed children (TDC; mean age 8.1, age range 5.8-9.6 years). They performed a visual Go/Nogo task with simultaneous EEG recording to obtain ERP responses. Results: Results showed that CWS had longer N2 and P3 latencies in the Go condition compared to the TDC. In contrast, the groups did not differ significantly in the Nogo condition or behavioural measures. Conclusions: Our findings did not confirm less efficient inhibitory control in CWS but suggest atypical attentional processing such as stimulus evaluation and response selection. Educational Objectives: The reader will be able to (a) describe recent findings on attention and inhibitory control in children who stutter, (b) describe the measurement of attentional processing, including inhibitory control, and (c) describe the findings on attentional processing in children who stutter as indexed by the event-related potentials in a visual Go/Nogo paradigm.

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL CORRELATES OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION COMPETENCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						meditation; mindfulness; event-related potentials; attention	STRESS REDUCTION; EEG; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION	Objective: This cross-sectional study evaluated event-related potentials (ERPs) across three groups: naive, novice, and experienced meditators as potential physiological markers of mindfulness meditation competence. Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected during a target tone detection task and a Breath Counting task. The Breath Counting task served as the mindfulness meditation condition for the novice and experienced meditator groups. Participants were instructed to respond to target tones with a button press in the first task (Tones), and then ignore the primed tones while Breath Counting. The primary outcomes were ERP responses to target tones, namely the N2 and P3, as markers of stimulus discrimination and attention, respectively. Results: As expected, P3 amplitudes elicited by target tones were attenuated within groups during the Breath Counting task in comparison to the Tones task (p < .001). There was a task by group interaction for P3 (p = .039). Both meditator groups displayed greater change in peak-to-trough P3 amplitudes, with higher amplitudes during the Tones condition and more pronounced reductions in P3 amplitudes during the Breath Counting meditation task in comparison to the naive group. Conclusions: Meditators had stronger P3 amplitude responses to target tones when instructed to attend to the tones, and a greater attenuation of P3 amplitudes when instructed to ignore the same tones during the Breath Counting task. This study introduces the idea of identifying ERP markers as a means of measuring mindfulness meditation competence, and results suggest this may be a valid approach. This information has the potential to improve mindfulness meditation interventions by allowing objective assessment of mindfulness meditation quality. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IBRO.

Previously, no evidence or method was apparent to validate the two competing models, the evoked model and the oscillation model. One argument is whether the pre-stimulus brain oscillation could influence the following ERP. This study carried out an innovative visual oddball task experiment to investigate the dynamic process of visual evoked potentials. A period of stable oscillations of specified dominant frequencies and initial phases, i.e. the steady-state baseline, would be induced before responses to transient stimuli of different contrasts, which could overcome the artifact problem caused by the 'sorting' method. The result first revealed a 'three-period-transition' for the generation of visual evoked potentials by an objective decomposition. The ERP almost retained the preceding oscillation during the first period, provided an unstable negative potential in the second period, and generated the N1 component in the third period. The cross term analysis showed that the evoked model couldn't be the whole explanation for the ERP generation. Furthermore, the component analysis revealed that the N1 latency was sensitive to the initial phase under the low stimulus contrast (supporting the oscillation model) but not under the high stimulus contrast (supporting the evoked model). It demonstrated that the external stimulus contrast is a significant factor deciding the explicit model for ERPs. Our method and preliminary results may help reconcile the previous, seemly contradictory findings on the ERP mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The physical movements and thinking capability (Cognition) of humans depend on the brain activity. Based on certain changes that occur within the brain, electric fields will be generated within the brain. Analyzing brain signals plays vital role in diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. Brain signals are obtained from electrodes of Electroencephalogram (EEG) or Magneto encephalogram (EMG). These are linear mixture of evoked potentials (EVP) of large number of neurons due to variations in conductive and geometric properties in the layers of 3 layer head model or 4 layer head model. Earlier work(1-5) considered processing these mixed signals for analyzing brain functioning of brain disabled patients. But working on the source signals gives an authoritative result. Hence there is a need to separate the source signals from the measured (electrode) signals. This work will suggest a suitable approach in extracting source signals of disabled patients while they were used as subjects under experiment of retrieving event related potentials (ERP). This work retrieved the signals of non target trails i.e., non event related potentials (NERP) and extracted original source signals by the best Gaussian estimate and the algorithm proposed.

Semantic parafoveal-on-foveal effects and preview benefits in reading: Evidence from Fixation Related Potentials	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						ERPs; Fixation Related Potentials; Reading; Parafovea; Parafoveal-on-foveal effect; Preview benefit; N400	EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORDS; COREGISTRATION; ERP; EEG	During reading parafoveal information can affect the processing of the word currently fixated (parafovea-on-fovea effect) and words perceived parafoveally can facilitate their subsequent processing when they are fixated on (preview effect). We investigated parafoveal processing by simultaneously recording eye movements and EEG measures. Participants read word pairs that could be semantically associated or not. Additionally, the boundary paradigm allowed us to carry out the same manipulation on parafoveal previews that were displayed until reader's gaze moved to the target words. Event Related Potentials time-locked to the prime-preview presentation showed a parafoveal-on-foveal N400 effect. Fixation Related Potentials time locked to the saccade offset showed an N400 effect related to the prime-target relationship. Furthermore, this later effect interacted with the semantic manipulation of the previews, supporting a semantic preview benefit. These results demonstrate that at least under optimal conditions foveal and parafoveal information can be simultaneously processed and integrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

New Method: We propose a novel approach for the objective selection of epilepsy-related independent components (ICs) from EEG data collected during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, called PROJection onto Independent Components (PROJIC). Inter-ictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are identified on a reference EEG dataset collected outside the MRI scanner by an expert neurophysiologist, and the resulting average IED is projected onto the IC space of the EEG data collected simultaneously with fMRI. The power of the IED projection is then used to inform a k-means clustering algorithm of the ICs, allowing for the classification of epilepsy-related ICs. Comparison with existing methods: The performance of PROJIC was compared with two methods previously proposed for the objective selection of EEG ICs of interest, which are based on the explicit similarity of the ICs with spatio-temporal templates of the events of interest, instead of the projection power. Results: The proposed PROJIC method outperformed the others for both artificial and real data (19 datasets collected from 6 patients with drug-refractory focal epilepsy), with an average accuracy of 98.6%. Conclusions: The ability of our method to accurately and objectively select epilepsy-related ICs makes it an important contribution for simultaneous EEG-fMRI epilepsy studies, with potential applications in the analysis of event-related EEG activity more generally, and also in EEG artefact correction.

Research on sports has revealed that behavioral responses and event-related brain potentials (ERP) are better in expert than in novice athletes for sport-related tasks. Focused attention is essential for optimal athletic performance across different sports but mainly in combat disciplines. During combat, long periods of focused attention (i. e., sustained attention) are required for a good performance. Few investigations have reported effects of expertise on brain electrical activity and its neural generators during sport-unrelated attention tasks. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of expertise (i. e., skilled and novice martial arts athletes) analyzing the ERP during a sustained attention task (Continuous Performance Task; CPT) and the cortical three-dimensional distribution of current density, using the sLORETA technique. Methods. CPT consisted in an oddball-type paradigm presentation of five stimuli (different pointing arrows) where only one of them (an arrow pointing up right) required a motor response (i. e., target). CPT was administered to skilled and novice martial arts athletes while EEG were recorded. Amplitude ERP data from target and non-target stimuli were compared between groups. Subsequently, current source analysis for each ERP component was performed on each subject. sLORETA images were compared by condition and group using Statistical Non-Parametric Mapping analysis. Results. Skilled athletes showed significant amplitude differences between target and non-target conditions in early ERP components (P100 and P200) as opposed to the novice group; however, skilled athletes showed no significant effect of condition in N200 but novices did show a significant effect. Current source analysis showed greater differences in activations in skilled compared with novice athletes between conditions in the frontal (mainly in the Superior Frontal Gyrus and Medial Frontal Gyrus) and limbic (mainly in the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus) lobes. Discussion. These results are supported by previous findings regarding activation of neural structures that underlie sustained attention. Our findings may indicate a better-controlled attention in skilled athletes, which suggests that expertise can improve effectiveness in allocation of attentional resources during the first stages of cognitive processing during combat.

Optimal digital filters for analyzing the mid-latency auditory P50 event-related potential in patients with Alzheimer's disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related potential; P50; Sensory gating; Alzheimer's disease; Digital filter; Filter distortion	GATING DEFICIT; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG DYNAMICS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ERP; SUPPRESSION; NEGATIVITY; COGNITION; ADULTS	Background: Filtering is an effective pre-processing technique for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of ERP waveforms. Filters can, however, introduce substantial distortions into the time-domain representations of ERP waveforms. Inappropriate filter parameters may lead to the presence of statistically significant but artificial effects, whereas true effects may appear as insignificant. New method: The present study aimed to determine the optimal digital filters for analyzing the auditory P50 component in patients with Alzheimer's disease. To provide evidence of the optimal filter settings, different high-pass and low-pass filters were applied to ERP waveforms obtained from a conditioning testing paradigm. The results facilitate practical recommendations for selection of filters that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the P50 components without introducing significant distortions. Results: The present study confirms that filter parameters have a significant effect on the amplitude and gating measures of the P50 component. Setting the high-pass cut-off at 0.1 Hz and the low-pass cut-off at 90Hz (or above) is recommended for P50 component analyses. Comparison with existing methods: The majority of ERP studies on sensory gating report using high-pass filters with 10-Hz cut-offs to measure P50 suppression. Such a high cut-off appeared to induce significant distortions into the ERP waveforms; thus, the authors advise against using these excessive high-pass cut-offs. Conclusions: Filtering broadband signals, such as ERP signals, necessary results in time-domain distortions. However, by adjusting the filter parameters carefully according to the components of interest, it is possible to minimize filter artifacts and obtain more easily interpretable ERP waveforms.

However, in reality the sounds surrounding us are spectrally and temporally complex, dynamic and overlapping. Thus, research using natural sounds is crucial in understanding the operation of the brain in its natural environment. Music is an excellent example of natural stimulation which, in addition to sensory responses, elicits vast cognitive and emotional processes in the brain. Here we show that the preattentive P50 response evoked by rapid increases in timbral brightness during continuous music is enhanced in dancers when compared to musicians and laymen. In dance, fast changes in brightness are often emphasized with a significant change in movement. In addition, the auditory N100 and P200 responses are suppressed and sped up in dancers, musicians and laymen when music is accompanied with a dance choreography. These results were obtained with a novel event-related potential (ERP) method for natural music. They suggest that we can begin studying the brain with long pieces of natural music using the ERP method of electroencephalography (EEG) as has already been done with functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), these two brain imaging methods complementing each other.

Compared to existing electroencephalography-based brain-machine interfaces that depend on visual stimuli, fixation-related potentials have the advantages that they can be used in free, unconstrained viewing conditions and can also be classified on a single-trial level. Thus, fixation-related potentials have the potential to allow for conceptually different brain-machine interfaces that directly interpret cortical activity related to the visual processing of specific objects. However, existing research has investigated fixation-related potentials only with very restricted and highly unnatural stimuli in simple search tasks while participant's body movements were restricted. We present a study where we relieved many of these restrictions while retaining some control by using a gaze-contingent visual search task. In our study, participants had to find a target object out of 12 complex and everyday objects presented on a screen while the electrical activity of the brain and eye movements were recorded simultaneously. Our results show that our proposed method for the classification of fixation-related potentials can clearly discriminate between fixations on relevant, non-relevant and background areas. Furthermore, we show that our classification approach generalizes not only to different test sets from the same participant, but also across participants. These results promise to open novel avenues for exploiting fixation-related potentials in electroencephalography-based brain-machine interfaces and thus providing a novel means for intuitive human-machine interaction.

PharmaCog Consortium	Clinical and biomarker profiling of prodromal Alzheimer's disease in workpackage 5 of the Innovative Medicines Initiative PharmaCog project: a 'European ADNI study'	JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						biomarkers; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; prodromal AD	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID BIOMARKERS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG SOURCES; LONGITUDINAL REPRODUCIBILITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; SPATIAL STATISTICS	Background. In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the validation of biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and for use as a surrogate outcome in AD clinical trials is of considerable research interest. Objective. To characterize the clinical profile and genetic, neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers of prodromal AD in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients enrolled in the IMI WP5 PharmaCog (also referred to as the European ADNI study). Methods. A total of 147 aMCI patients were enrolled in 13 European memory clinics. Patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and lumbar puncture to assess the levels of amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (A beta 42), tau and p-tau, and blood samples were collected. Genetic (APOE), neuroimaging (3T morphometry and diffusion MRI) and EEG (with resting-state and auditory oddball event-related potential (AO-ERP) paradigm) biomarkers were evaluated. Results. Prodromal AD was found in 55 aMCI patients defined by low A beta 42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (A beta positive). Compared to the aMCI group with high A beta 42 levels (A beta negative), A beta positive patients showed poorer visual (P = 0.001), spatial recognition (P < 0.0005) and working (P = 0.024) memory, as well as a higher frequency of APOE4 (P < 0.0005), lower hippocampal volume (P = 0.04), reduced thickness of the parietal cortex (P < 0.009) and structural connectivity of the corpus callosum (P < 0.05), higher amplitude of delta rhythms at rest (P = 0.03) and lower amplitude of posterior cingulate sources of AO-ERP (P = 0.03). Conclusion. These results suggest that, in aMCI patients, prodromal AD is characterized by a distinctive cognitive profile and genetic, neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers. Longitudinal assessment will help to identify the role of these biomarkers in AD progression.	[Galluzzi, S.; Marizzoni, M.; Antelmi, L.; Bagnoli, C.; Rolandi, E.; Frisoni, G.

Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) Reflecting Feedback and Error Processing in the Context of Education	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE-JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						feedback; error processing; error-related negativity (ERN); feedback-related negativity (FRN); education	BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURAL SYSTEM	Feedback allows individuals to detect errors and to adapt subsequent behavior in order to ensure goal achievement. As such, feedback provides rich and essential information for human learning. Consequently, feedback is of great importance for education and has been extensively studied by educational researchers (see Dion & Restrepo, 2016). One way to examine feedback and error processing is by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the human electroencephalography (EEG). The aim of this commentary is to portray two ERPs which have been directly linked to feedback and error processing in the human brain, namely the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the error-related negativity (ERN). Firstly, the core empirical findings regarding the FRN/ERN are described, followed by a brief outline of two theories accounting for both ERPs. Finally, the potential of the FRN/ERN in advancing our understanding of feedback and error processing in the context of learning and instruction is discussed.

Intracranial EEG correlates of implicit relational inference within the hippocampus	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						memory; declarative; non-declarative; ERP; awareness	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; TRANSITIVE INFERENCE; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; FIELD POTENTIALS; AWARENESS; BRAIN; BINDING; EVENTS; HUMANS	Drawing inferences from past experiences enables adaptive behavior in future situations. Inference has been shown to depend on hippocampal processes. Usually, inference is considered a deliberate and effortful mental act which happens during retrieval, and requires the focus of our awareness. Recent fMRI studies hint at the possibility that some forms of hippocampus-dependent inference can also occur during encoding and possibly also outside of awareness. Here, we sought to further explore the feasibility of hippocampal implicit inference, and specifically address the temporal evolution of implicit inference using intracranial EEG. Presurgical epilepsy patients with hippocampal depth electrodes viewed a sequence of word pairs, and judged the semantic fit between two words in each pair. Some of the word pairs entailed a common word (e.g., winter-red, red-cat) such that an indirect relation was established in following word pairs (e.g., winter-cat). The behavioral results suggested that drawing inference implicitly from past experience is feasible because indirect relations seemed to foster fit judgments while the absence of indirect relations fostered do not fit judgments, even though the participants were unaware of the indirect relations. A event-related potential (ERP) difference emerging 400 ms post-stimulus was evident in the hippocampus during encoding, suggesting that indirect relations were already established automatically during encoding of the overlapping word pairs. Further ERP differences emerged later post-stimulus (1,500 ms), were modulated by the participants' responses and were evident during encoding and test. Furthermore, response-locked ERP effects were evident at test. These ERP effects could hence be a correlate of the interaction of implicit memory with decision-making. Together, the data map out a time-course in which the hippocampus automatically integrates memories from discrete but related episodes to implicitly influence future decision making.

The EEG data showed a clear centro-parietal, bi-hemispheric N400 effect in response to unrelated image-pairs compared to related ones. Although with ECoG the N400 effect was more widely spread across both hemispheres, compared to linguistic stimuli, it was relatively localized within each ECoG grid as it was present only in some electrodes and, in some cases, even had its polarity reversed. We advocate this could be due to some grids gauging dipoles at different positions when covering sulci and gyri.

We conducted two experiments in which event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with semantic priming and recognition were recorded, either when priming was embedded within a recognition test (Experiment 1), or when these two phases were separated (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we observed 300-500 ms differences between primed and unprimed old words as well as differences between old and new primed words, but these two effects did not differ topographically and both showed midline central maxima. In Experiment 2, the N400 for priming was recorded exclusively during encoding and again showed a midline central distribution. The ERP component of recognition was only found for unrelated words (not primed previously during encoding), and also showed a midline central maximum, but, in addition, was present in the left frontal area of the scalp. Conversely, the priming effect was absent in the left frontal cluster. This pattern of results indicate that FN400 and N400 potentials share similar neural generators; but when priming and recognition are not confounded, these potentials do not entirely overlap in terms of topographical distribution and presumably reflect functionally distinct processes.

We measured and analyzed the event related potential (ERP), including the N2 component, which has previously been linked to cognitive conflict from competing decision tendencies. In a modified Go/No-go task designed to trigger moral conflict participants had to shoot suddenly appearing human like avatars in a virtual reality scene. The scene was seen either from an ego perspective with targets appearing directly in front of the participant or from a bird's view, where targets were seen from above and more distant. To control for low level visual features, we added a visually identical control condition, where the instruction to shoot was replaced by an instruction to detect. ERP waveforms showed differences between the two tasks as early as in the N1 time-range, with higher N1 amplitudes for the close perspective in the shoot task. Additionally, we found that pre-stimulus alpha power was significantly decreased in the ego, compared to the bird's view only for the shoot but not for the detect task. In the N2 time window, we observed main amplitude effects for response (No-go > Go) and distance (ego > bird perspective) but no interaction with task type (shoot vs. detect). We argue that the pre-stimulus and N1 effects can be explained by reduced attention and arousal in the distance condition when people are instructed to shoot. These results indicate a reduced moral engagement for increased distance. The lack of interaction in the N2 across tasks suggests that at that time point response execution dominates. We discuss potential implications for real life shooting situations, especially considering recent developments in drone shootings which are per definition of a distant view.

This paper proposes a unified application of wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM), as a channel selection method, for classifying two motor imagery (MI) tasks using optimal electroencephalography (EEG) sources. The EEG data, which are collected from publicly available BCI Competition III, are captured from five healthy individuals. This source optimization tool has been validated with a generic BCI framework, which utilizes common spatial pattern with and without regularization as preprocessing tools. However, the best classification accuracy attained is 98% using only 11 selected channels that is close to 100% attained using available 118 channels. This result summarizes how optimal EEG channels can be used to develop a BCI system without compromising the performance significantly.	[Hossain, Md. Shakhawat; Saha, Simanto; Habib, Md.

Evidence from an event-related potential study	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Geographical perspective; Deictic verbs; Reading comprehension; Event-related potentials; N400; Discourse coherence	DISCOURSE; ERP; COMPREHENSION; INTEGRATION; KNOWLEDGE; SENTENCES; EEG	This ERP study explores how the reader's brain is sensitive to the protagonist's perspective in the fictitious environment of narratives. Participants initially received narratives describing a protagonist living in a given geographical place. Later on they were given short paragraphs describing another character as "coming" or "going" to a place either close to or distant from the protagonist. Paragraphs referring to distant places elicited larger negative waves than those with places close to the protagonist. Moreover, narratives with the verb to come incoherent with the protagonist's perspective (e.g., "she came to the distant place") elicited larger negative-going waves in the 320-400 ms time window than coherent paragraphs (e.g., "she came to the close place"). These results indicate that readers of narratives were able to take the protagonist's geographical perspective, showing discourse-level coherence effects when they read motion sentences with the marked deictic verb to come.

In order to avoid perceptual confounds, we induced valence experimentally during a learning phase by assigning positive, negative, and neutral valences to tone-frequencies in a balanced design. In a subsequent test phase, EEG was recorded while these tones were entirely task-irrelevant. The amplitude of the auditory N1 was increased for valenced compared with neutral tones, indicating enhanced attention. While behavioral results of the learning phase, and both implicit and explicit measures of tone evaluation indicated differentiation between positive and negative valence, there was no such differentiation on the N1 amplitude. Our results suggest that it is the general relevance of the valenced tones that governs early attentional processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is unclear whether this is true for different identifiable levels within a single category. In the present study, we used ERP recording to examine the neural response to different identification levels and orientations (upright vs. inverted) of Chinese characters. The results showed that P1, N170, and P250 were modulated by different identification levels of Chinese characters. Moreover, time frequency analysis showed similar results, indicating that identification levels were associated with object recognition, particularly during processing of a single categorical stimulus.

EEG equipment and data analysis methods have been characterized by remarkable developments, but the skin-to-electrode signal transfer remains a challenge for EEG recording. New method: A novel quasi-dry system - the polymer wick-based electrode - was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional dry and wet silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes for EEG recording. Results: Nine participants completed an auditory oddball protocol with simultaneous EEG acquisition using both the conventional Ag/AgCl and the wick electrodes. Wick system successfully recorded the expected P300 modulation. Comparison with existing method(s): Standard ERP analysis, residual random noise analysis, and single trial analysis of the P300 wave were performed in order to compare signal acquired by both electrodes. It was found that the novel wick electrode performed similarly to the conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Conclusions: The developed wick electrode appears to be a reliable alternative for EEG research, representing a promising halfway alternative between wet and dry electrodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We used a backward masking task presenting participants with fearful or neutral faces. We asked participants for face discrimination and then probed their metacognitive awareness with confidence rating (CR) and post-decision wagering (PDW) scales. We also analysed psychophysiological correlates of awareness with event-related potential (ERP) components: P1, N170, early posterior negativity (EPN), and P3. We have not observed any differences between PDW and CR conditions in the emotion identification task. However, the "aware" ratings were associated with increased accuracy performance. This effect was more pronounced in PDW, especially for fearful faces, suggesting that emotional stimuli awareness may be enhanced by monetary incentives. EEG analysis showed larger N170, EPN and P3 amplitudes in aware compared to unaware trials. It also appeared that both EPN and P3 ERP components were more pronounced in the PDW condition, especially when emotional faces were presented. Taken together, our ERP findings suggest that metacognitive awareness of emotional stimuli depends on the effectiveness of both early and late visual information processing. Our study also indicates that awareness of emotional stimuli can be enhanced by the motivation induced by wagering.

New method: The present study investigated the influence of electromagnetic field (static magnetic field, radio frequency (RF) pulse, and gradient switching) and experimental environment on posterior N100 and P300 ERP components in four different settings with six healthy subjects using a visual oddball task: (1) classic fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., supine position, mirror glasses for stimulus presentation), (2) standard behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., seated position, keyboard response), (3) controlled fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., organic light-emitting diode (OLED) goggles for stimulus presentation) inside; and (4) modified behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., supine position, OLED goggles). Results: The study findings indicated that the experimental environment in simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition could substantially delay NIP, P300 latency, and RT inside the scanner, and was associated with a reduced N1P amplitude. Comparison with existing methods: There was no effect of electromagnetic field in the prolongation of RT, N1P and P300 latency inside the scanner. NIP, but not P300, latency was sensitive to stimulus presentation method inside the scanner. Conclusion: Future simultaneous EEG/fMRI data collection should consider experimental environment in both design and analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We showed that valence and origin (two distinct affective properties of stimuli) help to account for the ERP correlates of LDT. The origin of emotion is a factor derived from the emotion duality model. This model distinguishes between the automatic and controlled elicitation of emotional states. The subjects' task was to discriminate words from pseudo-words. The stimulus words were carefully selected to differ with respect to valence and origin whilst being matched with respect to arousal, concreteness, length and frequency in natural language. Pseudo words were matched to words with respect to length. The subjects were 32 individuals aged from 19 to 26 years who were invited to participate in an EEG study of lexical decision making. They evaluated a list of words and pseudo-words. We found that valence modulated the amplitude of the FN400 component (290-375 ms) at centrofrontal (Fz, Cz) region, whereas origin modulated the amplitude of the component in the LPC latency range (375-670 ms). The results indicate that the origin of stimuli should be taken into consideration while deliberating on the processing of emotional words.

Participants were asked to decide as quickly as possible whether to buy a book based on limited information including its title, keywords and number of positive and negative reviews. Obedience was induced by forcing participants to buy books which received mostly negative reviews. In contrast, conformity was aroused by majority influence (caused by positive and negative comments). P3 and N2, two kinds of ERP components related to social cognitive process, were measured and recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) test. The results show that compared with conformity decisions, obedience decisions induced greater cognitive conflicts. In ERP measurements, greater amplitudes of N2 component were observed in the context of obedience. However, consistency level did not make a difference on P3 peak latency for both conformity and obedience. This shows that classification process is implicit in both conformity and obedience decision-making. In addition, for both conformity and obedience decisions, augmented P3 was observed when the reviews consistency (either negative or positive) was higher.

However, the substantial interindividual variability of N1 could be a possible confounding factor when comparing different individuals or groups. Therefore, identifying the neuronal mechanism and origin of the interindividual variability of N1 is crucial in basic research and clinical applications. This study is aimed to use simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the coupling between Ni and spontaneous functional connectivity (FC). EEG and fMRI data were simultaneously collected from a group of healthy individuals during a pure-tone listening task. Spontaneous FC was estimated from spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals that were isolated by regressing out task evoked BOLD signals from raw BOLD signals and then was correlated to N1 magnitude across individuals. It was observed that spontaneous FC between bilateral Heschl's gyms was significantly and positively correlated with Ni magnitude across individuals (Spearman's R= 0.829, p < 0.001). The specificity of this observation was further confirmed by two whole-brain voxelwise analyses (voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity analysis and seed-based connectivity analysis). These results enriched our understanding of the functional significance of the coupling between event-related brain responses and spontaneous brain connectivity, and hold the potential to increase the applicability of brain responses as a probe to the mechanism underlying pathophysiological conditions.

Cortical correlates of response time slowing in older adults: ERP and ERD/ERS analyses during passive ankle movement	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Proprioception; Passive movement; Event-related potential; Beta ERD/ERS	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BETA EEG-CHANGES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOMOTOR EXCITABILITY; STANCE PERTURBATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NERVE-CONDUCTION; POSTURAL CONTROL	Objectives: The response time (RT) to kinesthetic perception has been used as a proprioceptive measurement, for example, in older individuals. However, the RT cannot provide information on impairments at specific stages of the respective sensorimotor processing. In the present study, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded during passive ankle movement with and without an associated perceptual task of movement detection. The main purpose was to analyze differences between young and older adults both in terms of RT and cortical responses. Putative differences in the latter were expected to point to changes in the processing associated with neural pathways or cortical regions in the older subjects. Methods: The EEG activity of nineteen older (OA, 65-76 years) and 19 young adults (YA, 21-32 years) was recorded during passive ankle movement, without motor voluntary response (NVR, sensory condition), and during a condition with voluntary motor response (VR, with measurement of the RT). Event-related potentials (ERP) and beta event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) were recorded and analyzed in both experimental conditions. Results: The RT in OA was larger than in YA (P < 0.0001). EEG analyses showed that the N1 amplitude was larger in the VR than in the NVR condition (P = 0.006), whereas no difference for latency was obtained between conditions (P = 0.376). Comparisons between the groups revealed attenuated (P = 0.019) and delayed (P = 0.001) N1 in the OA group, irrespective of the condition (no interaction group vs condition). Only OA showed correlations between RT and N1, with significant correlation for both amplitude (r = -0.603, P = 0.006) and latency (r = 0.703, P = 0.001). The ERD/ERS analyses revealed a task-dependent group effect: in NVR, significant differences were obtained only for the ERS amplitude, which was attenuated in OA (P = 0.003). In VR, larger (P = 0.004) and delayed (P = 0.003) ERD and attenuated (P = 0.029) and delayed (P = 0.017) ERS peaks were observed in the older group. Conclusions: The results suggest that a larger response time to proprioceptive stimuli in older adults is associated with a weaker and delayed proprioceptive afferent inflow to the cortex. In this scenario, older adults would need a higher cognitive effort (larger ERD) to process the sensory inputs when attempting to properly perform a sensorimotor task. Significance: ERP and ERD/ERS measurements during kinesthetic assessment provide new insights on identification of the origin of sensorimotor slowing in older adults.

On the use of Match Filtering for the P300 Detection	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (CSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSIC)	DEC 15-17, 2016	Las Vegas, NV	Amer Council Sci & Educ		EEG; ERP; Artifacts; P300; Classification; Matched filters; ICA; Wiener filter		The P300 is an endogenous event-related potential (ERP) that is naturally elicited by rare and significant stimuli, located in the parietal lobe of the brain. P300s are increasingly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) because the users of ERP-based BCIs need no special training. In order to detect P300s, most studies in the field have been focused on a supervised approach, dealing with over-fitting filters and the need for later validation. In this paper we start bridging this gap by modeling an unsupervised classifier of the P300 presence based on a weighted score. This is carried out through the use of matched filters that weight more heavily events that are likely to represent the P300 wave. The optimal weights are determined through a study of the data's features. The combination of different artifact cancellation methods and P300 extraction techniques provides a marked, statistically significant, improvement in accuracy at the level of the top-performing algorithms for a supervised approach presented in the literature to date. This innovation brings a notable impact in ERP-based communicators, appointing to the development of a faster and more reliable BCI technology.	[Lafuente, Victor; Gorriz, J.

Fifteen mild to moderate ALS patients and 15 healthy controls were administered a brief neuropsychological test battery and an ERPs paradigm assessing selective attention. Four types of auditory stimuli were presented in random order: short standard (200Hz, 200ms), long standard (200Hz, 500ms), short deviant (1000Hz, 200ms) and long deviant (1000Hz, 500ms). Participants had to respond to the long deviant stimuli only. During the task the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The N200, P300 and re-orienting negativity (RON) ERP components were analysed. Compared to controls ALS patients showed reduced amplitudes and delayed latencies of N200, P300 and RON. These results could be attributable to both an alteration in change detection resulting in a reduction of the allocation and re-orientation of attentional resources or a general slowing or reduction of neural processing efficiency in the same system. The ERPs results support the hypothesis that ALS involves extramotor cognitive functions including auditory attentional processing at all processing stages, early (200ms) and late (300-600ms). These data prove the usefulness and sensitivity of the auditory ERPs in detection of cognitive functions in ALS patients.

An ERP source imaging study of the oddball task in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; Attention; Oddball; Event-related potential; Source localization; Children	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX AREA-10; INTERFERENCE INHIBITION; AUDITORY ODDBALL; P300 COMPONENT; GENERATORS; SYSTEMS; BRAIN; EEG; METAANALYSIS	Objective: Children with ADHD have difficulties attending to task-relevant events, which has been consistently associated with reductions in the amplitude of the P3b event-related potential (ERP) component. However, the underlying neural networks involved in this P3b reduction remain elusive. Therefore, this study explored source localization of P3b alterations in children with ADHD, aiming at a more detailed account of attentional difficulties. Methods: Dense array ERPs were obtained for 36 children with ADHD and 49 typically developing children (TD) using an auditory oddball task. The P3b component (310-410 ms) was individually localized with the LAURA distributed linear inverse solution method and compared between groups. Results: The ADHD group showed reduced P3b amplitudes in response to targets compared to the TD group. Differences were located primarily in frontopolar (cinguloopercular network, BA10) and temporoparietal regions (ventral attention network, BA39 and 19) in the left hemisphere. Reductions in P3b amplitudes were related to more inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity problems in the ADHD group. Conclusions: The results show alterations in both top-down and bottom-up attention-related brain areas, which may underlie P3b amplitude reductions in children with ADHD. Significance: This study provides novel data on both temporal and spatial aspects of dysfunctional attention processes in ADHD. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Early averted gaze processing in the right Fusiform Gyrus: An EEG source imaging study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Gaze processing; Face memory; Evoked potentials; Topographic EEG analyses; EEG source imaging	DYNAMIC FACIAL EXPRESSION; VISUAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EYE-GAZE; TIME-COURSE; FACE RECOGNITION; NEUTRAL FACES; BRAIN; DIRECTION; ERP; EMOTION	Humans are able to categorize face properties with impressively short latencies. Nevertheless, the latency at which gaze recognition occurs is still a matter of debate. Through spatio-temporal analysis of high-density event-related potentials (ERP), we investigated the brain activity underlying the ability to spontaneously and quickly process gaze. We presented neutral faces with direct and averted gaze in a matching picture paradigm, where subjects had to detect repetition of identical faces and gaze was implicitly manipulated. The results indicate that faces with averted gaze were better discriminated than faces with direct gaze, and evoked stronger P100 amplitudes localized to the right fusiform gyrus. In contrast, direct gaze induced stronger activation in the orbital frontal gyrus at this latency. Later in time, at the beginning of the N170 component, direct gaze induced changes in scalp topography with a stronger activation in the right medial temporal gyrus. The location of these differential activations of direct vs. averted gaze further support the view that faces with averted gaze are perceived as less rewarding than faces with direct gaze. We additionally found differential ERP responses between repeated and novel faces as early as 50 ms, thereby replicating earlier studies of very fast detection of mnestic aspects of stimuli. Together, these results suggest an early dissociation between implicit gaze detection and explicit identity processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neuropsychology together with lesion models and intracranial recordings and imaging work yielded important insights into the functional neuroanatomical correlates of grasping, one important function of our hands, pointing toward a functional parietofrontal brain network. Eventrelated potentials (ERPs) register directly electrical brain activity and are endowed with high temporal resolution but have long been assumed to be susceptible to movement artifacts. Recent work has shown that reliable ERPs can be obtained during movement execution. Here, we review the available ERP work on (uni) manual grasping actions. We discuss various ERR components and how they may be related to functional components of grasping according to traditional distinctions of manual actions such as planning and control phases. The ERP results are largely in line with the assumption of a parietofrontal network. But other questions remain, in particular regarding the temporal succession of frontal and parietal ERP effects. With the low number of ERP studies on grasping, not all ERP effects appear to be coherent with one another. Understanding the control of our hands may help to develop further neurocognitive theories of grasping and to make progress in prosthetics, rehabilitation or development of technical systems for support of human actions.

FRP peak latency and sources were compared between "seen" trials and "not seen" trials, respectively related and unrelated to the primary visual consciousness. Three salient features of visual stimuli were considered (visuospatial, emotional face expression, and written words). Results showed the typical visual FRP components in both "seen" and "not seen" trials. There was no statistical difference in the ERP peak latencies between the "seen" and "not seen" trials, suggesting a similar timing of the cortical neural synchronization regardless the primary visual consciousness. In contrast, ERP sources showed differences between "seen" and "not seen" trials. For the visuospatial stimuli, the primary consciousness was related to higher activity in dorsal occipital and parietal sources at about 400 ms post-stimulus. For the emotional face expressions, there was greater activity in parietal and frontal sources at about 180 ms post-stimulus. For the written letters, there was higher activity in occipital, parietal and temporal sources at about 230 ms post-stimulus. These results hint that primary visual consciousness is associated with an enhanced cortical neural synchronization having entirely different spatiotemporal characteristics as a function of the features of the visual stimuli and possibly, the relative qualia (i.e., visuospatial, face expression, and words). In this framework, the dorsal visual stream may be synchronized in association with the primary consciousness of visuospatial and emotional face contents. Analogously, both dorsal and ventral visual streams may be synchronized in association with the primary consciousness of linguistic contents. In this line of reasoning, the ensemble of the cortical neural networks underpinning the single visual features would constitute a sort of multi-dimensional palette of colors, shapes, regions of the visual field, movements, emotional face expressions, and words. The synchronization of one or more of these cortical neural networks, each with its peculiar timing, would produce the primary consciousness of one or more of the visual features of the scene.

Here, we investigated how the relationship between event-related power changes in the EEG (ERPC) and BOLD responses varies for the typical EEG frequency bands and depending on the distance between the fMRI voxel and the EEG recording site. As cognitive task we chose an auditory Stroop experiment. We observed that for small distances event-related BOLD responses were positively correlated with ERPC in the gamma band, just as, in contrast to previous studies, in the alpha band. BOLD responses were negatively correlated with EEG power in the delta range for regions close to the EEG recording site.	[Kranz, T.

The effects of co-occurring ADHD symptoms on electrophysiological correlates of cognitive control in young people with Tourette syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						tourette syndrome; attention-deficit; hyperactivity disorder; cognitive control; electrophysiology; comorbidity	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; IMPULSE-CONTROL DISORDERS; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; RESPONSE ERRORS; HABIT-REVERSAL; TIC DISORDERS; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS	Efficient cognitive control is implicated in tic control in young people with Tourette syndrome (TS). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occurs with TS and is associated with impaired cognitive control. Young people with TS and ADHD (TS+ADHD) show poorer cognitive control performance than those with TS, but how co-occurring ADHD affects underlying neural activity is unknown. We investigated this issue by examining behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) correlates of cognitive control in young people with these conditions. Participants aged 9-17 with TS (n=17), TS+ADHD (n=17), ADHD (n=11), and unaffected controls (n=20) performed a visual Go/Nogo task during electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Behavioural performance measures (D-prime, RT, reaction time variability, post-error slowing) and ERP measures (N2, P3, error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe)) were analysed in a 2 (TS-yes, TS-no) x 2 (ADHD-yes, ADHD-no) factorial analysis to investigate the effects of TS, ADHD, and their interaction. The results of these analyses showed that ADHD was associated with poorer performance and reduced amplitude of all ERPs, reflecting widespread cognitive control impairments. Tourette syndrome was associated with slowed RTs, which might reflect a compensatory slowing of motor output to facilitate tic control. There was no interaction between the TS and ADHD factors for any behavioural or ERP measure, indicating the impairing effects of ADHD on behaviour and electrophysiological markers of cognitive control were present in TS+ADHD and that RT slowing associated with TS was unaffected by co-occurring ADHD symptoms.

This event-related brain potential (ERP) study investigated whether listening to personal and possessive pronouns elicits different modes of self-processing regarding time-course and neural sources. Going beyond previous research, first (1PP) and second person (2PP) pronouns were included to determine the specificity of self-processing. Participants listened passively to German pronouns while the electroencephalogram was recorded. Modulation of ERPs revealed a processing advantage for the 2PP personal pronoun "du" ("you") already in early time windows. Regarding possessive pronouns, N1 amplitudes indicated increased attention orientation to the 1PP pronoun "mein" ("my"), whereas during later time windows, processing of 1PP and 2PP possessive pronouns did not differ but differed from the third person pronoun "sein" ("his"). ERP source imaging suggests that primary sensory brain regions (auditory cortex), the insula and cortical midline structures are differentially involved into these two processing modes. The results support the idea of distinct self-processing modes ("I" and "ME") and confirm their dynamic nature. Moreover, they demonstrate that on a neural level neither "I" or "ME" are invariantly tied to the first person, in line with the hypothesis that self-processing is relational and context-dependent.

To better understand how auditory cognition affects speech intelligibility with the CI, we performed an electroencephalography study in which we examined the relationship between central auditory processing, cognitive abilities, and speech intelligibility. Postlingually deafened CI users (N=13) and matched normal-hearing (NH) listeners (N=13) performed an oddball task with words presented in different background conditions (quiet, stationary noise, modulated noise). Participants had to categorize words as living (targets) or non-living entities (standards). We also assessed participants' working memory (WM) capacity and verbal abilities. For the oddball task, we found lower hit rates and prolonged response times in CI users when compared with NH listeners. Noise-related prolongation of the N1 amplitude was found for all participants. Further, we observed group-specific modulation effects of event-related potentials (ERPs) as a function of background noise. While NH listeners showed stronger noise-related modulation of the N1 latency, CI users revealed enhanced modulation effects of the N2/N4 latency. In general, higher order processing (N2/N4, P3) was prolonged in CI users in all background conditions when compared with NH listeners. Longer N2/N4 latency in CI users suggests that these individuals have difficulties to map acoustic-phonetic features to lexical representations. These difficulties seem to be increased for speech-in-noise conditions when compared with speech in quiet background. Correlation analyses showed that shorter ERP latencies were related to enhanced speech intelligibility (N1, N2/N4), better lexical fluency (N1), and lower ratings of listening effort (N2/N4) in CI users. In sum, our findings suggest that CI users and NH listeners differ with regards to both the sensory and the higher-order processing of speech in quiet as well as in noisy background conditions. Our results also revealed that verbal abilities are related to speech processing and speech intelligibility in CI users, confirming the view that auditory cognition plays an important role for CI outcome. We conclude that differences in auditory-cognitive processing contribute to the variability in speech performance outcomes observed in CI users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event Related Potentials Reveal Early Phonological and Orthographic Processing of Single Letters in Letter-Detection and Letter-Rhyme Paradigms	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; event related potentials; evoked potentials; global field power; language; letter processing	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; MASKED REPETITION; TIME-COURSE; PHONEME CONVERSION; LETTER PERCEPTION; ERP; READERS; EXPERTISE; LANGUAGE; STIMULI	Introduction: When and where phonological processing occurs in the brain is still under some debate. Most paired-rhyme and phonological priming studies used word stimuli, which involve complex neural networks for word recognition and semantics. This study investigates early (<300 ms) and late (:300 ms) orthographic and phonological processing of letters. Methods: Fifteen participants aged 20-35 engaged in three two-forced choice experiments, one letter-detection (LetterlD) and two letter-rhyme (Paired-Rhyme and Letter-Rhyme) tasks. From the EEG recordings, event related potential (ERP) differences within and across task stimuli were found. We also calculated the global field power (GFP) for each participant. Accuracies and reaction times were also measured from their button presses for each task. Results: Behavioral: Reaction times were 18 ms faster to letter than pseudoletter stimuli, and 27 ms faster to rhyme than nonrhyme stimuli. FRP/GFP: In the LetterlD task, grand-mean evoked potentials (EPs) showed typical P1, N1, P2, and P3 waveform morphologies to letter and pseudoletter stimuli, with GFPs to pseudoletters being greater than letters from 160-600 ms. Across both rhyme tasks, there were greater negativities for nonrhyme than for rhyme stimuli at 145 ms and 426 ms. The P2 effect for rhyme stimuli was smaller than letter stimuli when compared across tasks. Conclusion: Differences in early processing of letters vs. pseudoletters between 130-190 ms suggest that letters are processed earlier and perhaps faster in the brain than pseudoletters. The P2 effect between letter and rhyme stimuli likely reflect sublexical phonological processing. Together, findings from our study fill in evidence for the temporal dynamics of orthographic and phonological processing of single letters.

Effects of interstimulus intervals on behavioral, heart rate, and event-related potential indices of infant engagement and sustained attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Interstimulus intervals; ERPs; Infant sustained attention	PERIPHERAL STIMULUS LOCALIZATION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; FACE; RECOGNITION; ERP; DISTRACTIBILITY; SPECIALIZATION; COMPONENTS; ADULT	Maximizing infant attention to stimulus presentation during an EEG or ERP experiment is important for making valid inferences about the neural correlates of infant cognition. The present study examined the effects of stimulus presentation interstimulus interval (ISI) on behavioral and physiological indices of infant attention including infants' fixation to visual presentation, the amount of heart rate (HR) change during sustained attention, and ERP components. This study compared an ISI that is typically used in infant EEG/ERP studies (e.g., 1,500-2,000 ms) with two shorter durations (400-600 ms and 600-1,000 ms). Thirty-six infants were tested cross-sectionally at 3, 4.5, and 6 months. It was found that using the short (400-600 ms) and medium (600-1,000 ms) ISIs resulted in more visually fixated trials and reduced frequency of fixation disengagement per experimental block. We also found larger HR changes during sustained attention to both of the shorter ISIs compared with the long ISI, and larger ERP responses when using the medium ISI compared to using the short and long ISIs. These data suggest that utilizing an optimal ISI (e.g., 600-1,000 ms), which increases the presentation complexity and provides sufficient time for information processing, can promote infant engagement and sustained attention during stimulus presentation.

A brief overview of current modeling strategies in brain research is given, spatial scales ranging from single neuron to large scale activity of and between brain regions are considered. The models are mainly time-invariant. Three time-variant modeling strategies, which enable a model-based signal analysis, are described and applied to large scale signals. The first is derived from adaptive filter theory and covers linear system and linear as well as nonlinear process models. The second is based on modeled brain source signals, i.e., the inverse problem must be solved. The third strategy consists of a generalization of Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM); DCM is frequently used for analysis of directed interactions between brain structures. Examples are derived from neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring of preterm and fullterm newborns. A further example is based on high-density recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) and shows the combination of a time-variant ERP-based source model, as a part of a realistic head model, with a multivariate process model to analyze the time evolution of interactions between source processes before and during the execution of a complex motoric task. In two other examples hemodynamic signals (functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) are utilized for analysis of interactions between brain regions, where nonlinear, multivariate models are used.

Participants completed lexical decision tasks while EEG was recorded: monolinguals completed the task in English only, and bilinguals completed two lexical decision tasks, one in English and one in French. Effects of NoS were observed in both participant groups, with shorter response times and reduced N400 amplitudes to high relative to low NoS items. These effects were stronger in monolinguals than in bilinguals. Moreover, we found dissociations across languages in bilinguals, with stronger behavioral NoS effects in English and stronger event-related potential (ERP) NoS effects in French. This finding suggests that different aspects of linguistic performance may be stronger in each of a bilingual's two languages.

By definition, MHE is characterized by cognitive function impairment in the domains of attention, vigilance and integrative function, but obvious clinical manifestation are lacking. MHE has been shown to affect daily functioning, quality of life, driving and overall mortality. The diagnosis can be achieved through neuropsychological testing, recently developed computerized psychometric tests, such as the critical flicker frequency and the inhibitory control tests, as well as neurophysiological procedures. Event related potentials can reveal subtle changes in patients with normal neuropsychological performances. Spectral analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and quantitative analysis of sleep EEG provide early markers of cerebral dysfunction in cirrhotic patients with MHE. Neuroimaging, in particular MRI, also increasingly reveals diffuse abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity and altered organization of functional connectivity networks. Medical treatment for MHE to date has been focused on reducing serum ammonia levels and includes non-absorbable disaccharides, probiotics or rifaximin. Liver transplantation may not reverse the cognitive deficits associated with MHE. We performed here an updated review on epidemiology, burden and quality of life, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, neurophysiology and therapy in subjects with MHE.

Patterns and reliability of EEG during error monitoring for internal versus external feedback in schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event related potentials; Schizophrenia; Principal component analysis; Reward; Electroencephalography; Performance monitoring	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; ANTISACCADE TASK; REWARD MAGNITUDE; NEURAL SYSTEM; NEGATIVITY; ERP; STATE	Background: Accurately monitoring one's performance on daily life tasks, and integrating internal and external performance feedback are necessary for guiding productive behavior. Although internal feedback processing, as indexed by the error-related negativity (ERN), is consistently impaired in schizophrenia, initial findings suggest that external performance feedback processing, as indexed by the feedback negativity (FN), may actually be intact. The current study evaluated internal and external feedback processing task performance and test-retest reliability in schizophrenia. Methods: 92 schizophrenia outpatients and 63 healthy controls completed a flanker task (ERN) and a time estimation task (FN). Analyses examined the Delta ERN and Delta FN defined as difference waves between correct/positive versus error/negative feedback conditions. A temporal principal component analysis was conducted to distinguish the Delta ERN and Delta FN from overlapping neural responses. We also assessed test-retest reliability of Delta ERN and Delta FN in patients over a 4-week interval. Results: Patients showed reduced Delta ERN accompanied by intact Delta FN. In patients, test-retest reliability for both Delta ERN and Delta FN over a four-week period was fair to good. Conclusion: Individuals with schizophrenia show a pattern of impaired internal, but intact external, feedback processing. This pattern has implications for understanding the nature and neural correlates of impaired feedback processing in schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the offline experiment, all the subjects have to do is counting the target stimulus when they were using the visual-evoked event-related potential (ERP) based BCIs. The recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data was used to train the classification mode. However, subjects may get distracted in counting the target stimulus when the non-target stimulus affected the subjects or subjects lost their attentions which may negatively affect the task performance. In this study, some green flashing points was added into the stimuli. The subjects have to focus on the target stimulus and count the number of the green points in target stimulus at the same time. In this way, it will make subjects concentrate more on the target to count the green points compared to the pattern without green points. The result showed that the performance of the BCI system could be improved using the method presented in this paper.

However, an important limitation of the available fMRI studies is that hemodynamic signals only provide an indirect measure of the neuronal activity. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures electrophysiological activity of the brain. However, little is known about the brain-wide organization of such spontaneous neuronal population signals at the resting state. It is not entirely clear if or how the network structure built upon slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals is represented in terms of fast, dynamic, and spontaneous neuronal activity. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological representation of RSNs from simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data in the resting human brain. We developed a data-driven analysis approach that reconstructed multiple large-scale electrophysiological networks from high-resolution EEG data alone. The networks derived from EEG were then compared with RSNs independently derived from simultaneously acquired fMRI in their spatial structures as well as temporal dynamics. Results reveal spatially and temporally specific electrophysiological correlates for the fMRI-RSNs. Findings suggest that the spontaneous activity of various large-scale cortical networks is reflected in macroscopic EEG potentials.

Methods: Intracerebral EEG was recorded from 205 sites of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes in 18 epileptic patients, who responded by button pressing together with mental counting to target stimuli in visual oddball task. Results: Post-movement event-related potentials (ERPs) with mean latency 295 +/- 184 ms after movement were found in all subjects in 64% of sites investigated. Generators were consistently observed in mesiotemporal structures, anterior midcingulate, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. Task-variant nonspecific and target specific post-movement ERPs were identified, displaying no significant differences in distribution among generating structures. Both after correct and incorrect performances the post-performance ERPs were observed in frontal and temporal cortices with latency sensitive to error commission in several frontal regions. Conclusion: Mesiotemporal structures and regions in anterior midcingulate, prefrontal and temporal cortices seem to represent integral parts of network activated after correct motor response in visual oddball task with mental counting. Our results imply equivalent involvement of these structures in task-variant nonspecific and target specific processes, and suggest existence of common nodes for correct and incorrect responses. Significance: Our results contribute to better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behavior. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Many BCI implementations are based on the recognition of task-specific event-related potentials (ERP) such as P300 responses. However, because of the high signal-to-noise ratio in noninvasive brain recordings, reliable detection of single trial ERPs is challenging. Furthermore, the relevant signal is often heterogeneously distributed over several channels. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for recognizing a sequence of attended events from multi-channel brain recordings. The framework utilizes spatial filtering to reduce both noise and signal space considerably. We introduce different models that can be used to construct the spatial filter and evaluate the approach using magnetoencephalography (MEG) data involving P300 responses, recorded during a BCI experiment. Compared to the accuracy achieved in the BCI experiment performed without spatial filtering, the recognition rate increased significantly to up to 95.3% on average (SD: 5.3%). In combination with the data-driven spatial filter construction we introduce here, our framework represents a powerful method to reliably recognize a sequence of brain potentials from high-density electrophysiological data, which could greatly improve the control of BCIs.

This study is to investigate age-related changes of event-related potentials with detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA) [11,12] to explore the discrimination between the young and the older. We hypothesized that the DPCCA coefficients were affected by age-related changes which could be reflected in the ERP indices, and differed with different neural communication. An oddball task was conducted in two experimental groups, the young (N= 15) and the older (N= 15), to analyze long-time coherence. The results show the difference of DPCCA coefficients from the young and the older. Moreover, this study provides some explanation and suggestion for these findings.

This deficit consistently manifests itself in a PD-related increase in the number of perseverative errors committed on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). However, the neural processes underlying perseverative WCST performance in PD are still largely unknown. The present study is the first to investigate the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of cognitive inflexibility on the WCST in PD patients. Thirty-two PD patients and 35 matched control participants completed a computerized version of the WCST while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Behavioral results revealed the expected increase in perseverative errors in patients with PD. ERP analysis focused on two established indicators of executive processes: the fronto-central P3a as an index of a ttentional orienting and the sustained parietal positivity (SPP) as an index of set-shifting processes. In comparison to controls, P3a amplitudes were significantly attenuated in PD patients. Regression analysis further revealed that P3a and SPP amplitudes interactively contributed to the prediction of perseverative errors in PD patients: The number of perseverative errors was only increased when both ERP amplitudes were attenuated. Notably, the two ERP markers of executive processes accounted for more than 40% of the variance in perseverative errors in PD patients. We conclude that cognitive inflexibility in PD occurs when the neural bases of multiple executive processes are affected by the pathophysiology of PD. The combined measurement of P3a and SPP might yield an electrophysiological marker of cognitive inflexibility in PD.

As such, these decisions require fast access to relative information. Therefore, we expect that signatures of the comparative process should be observable in electrophysiological components at an early stage of information processing. However, to date, little is known about the neural time course of social target comparisons. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in 2 electroencephalography (EEG) studies using a social distance effect paradigm. The distance effect capitalizes on the fact that stimuli close on a certain dimension take longer to compare than stimuli clearly differing on this dimension. Here, we manipulated the distance of face characteristics regarding their levels of attractiveness (Study 1) and trustworthiness (Study 2), 2 essential social dimensions. In both studies, size comparisons served as a nonsocial control condition. In Study 1, distance related effects were apparent 170 ms (vertex positive potential, VPP) and 200 ms (N2) after stimulus onset for attractiveness comparisons. In Study 2, trustworthiness comparisons took effect already after 100 ms (N1) and likewise carried over to an event-related N2. Remarkably, we observed a similar temporal pattern for social (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) dimensions. These results speak in favor of an early encoding of comparative information and emphasize the primary role of comparison in social information processing.

In the context of social communication, the voice is the most important sound category. However, the existing studies do not directly address whether and how the salience of an unexpected vocal change in an auditory sequence influences the orientation of attention. In this study, frequent tones were interspersed with task-relevant infrequent tones and task-irrelevant infrequent vocal sounds (neutral, happy and angry vocalizations). Eighteen healthy college students were asked to count infrequent tones. A combined event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency approach was used, with the focus on the P3 component and on the early auditory evoked gamma band response, respectively. A spatial-temporal principal component analysis was used to disentangle potentially overlapping ERP components. Although no condition differences were observed in the 210-310 ms window, larger positive responses were observed for emotional than neutral vocalizations in the 310-410 ms window. Furthermore, the phase synchronization of the early auditory evoked gamma oscillation was enhanced for happy vocalizations. These findings support the idea that the brain prioritizes the processing of emotional stimuli, by devoting more attentional resources to salient social signals even when they are not task-relevant.

A proposal for bio-synchronized transmission of EEG/ERP data	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Wireless EEG; Brain-computer interfaces; e-health; Telemedicine; Bio-synchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MIDDLE LATENCY RESPONSES; EVOKED POTENTIALS; AMBULATORY EEG; NEUROFEEDBACK; SYSTEM; VIDEO; TELEMETRY; CHILDREN; SERVICE	Acquisition of event-related potentials (ERPs) requires a nearly perfect synchronization between the stimulus player and the EEG acquisition unit that clinical systems implement at hardware level by means of a wired link. Out of clinical context, current brain-computer interface technology offers wireless and wearable EEG headsets that provide ubiquitous EEG acquisition. However, they are not adequate for ERPs acquisition since they lack the physical wire with the stimulus player. In this paper, we propose a novel technique devoted to provide a solution to this problem by means of a bio-synchronization approach. This technique adds to the stimulus data, a tagged audio preamble for synchronization (TAP-S) that embeds a synchronization mechanism in its physiological response based on pseudo random sequences. In this way, the EEG data elicited by the preamble and the stimulus are recorded together and the stimulus onset can be directly extracted from the EEG data by preamble detection. TAP-S is tailored to work with any low-cost multimedia player and wireless EEG headsets. Our preliminary results reveal TAP-S as a first, promising, and low-cost approach that, after further improvement, could enable remote processing of ERPs with wireless acquisition with application in telemedicine, ambient assisted living, or brain-computer interfaces.

Studies on the neural underpinnings of beat processing in the general population suggest that the auditory system is capable of pre -attentively generating a predictive model of upcoming sounds in a rhythmic pattern, subserved largely within auditory cortex and reflected in mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3 event -related potential (ERP) components. The current study examined these neural correlates of beat perception in two beat -deaf individuals, Mathieu and Marjorie, and a group of control participants under conditions in which auditory stimuli were either attended or ignored. Compared to control participants, Mathieu demonstrated reduced behavioral sensitivity to beat omissions in metrical patterns, and Marjorie showed a bias to identify irregular patterns as regular. ERP responses to beat omissions reveal an intact pre -attentive system for processing beat irregularities in cases of beat deafness, reflected in the MMN component, and provide partial support for abnormalities in later cognitive stages of beat processing, reflected in an unreliable P3b component exhibited by Mathieu but not Marjorie compared to control participants. P3 abnormalities observed in the current study resemble P3 abnormalities exhibited by individuals with pitch -based amusia, and are consistent with attention or auditory -motor coupling accounts of deficits in beat perception.

There is, however, a paucity of research into the underlying neurophysiological correlates of empathy deficits in this disorder. Accordingly, we sought: (1) to identify whether dysfunctional empathic abilities in schizophrenia are related to alterations in early or late brain processes, and (2) to explore the potential relationship between brain activity and mood, self-reported empathy and symptom severity. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy matched controls performed an empathy-for-pain paradigm where photographs of hands in neutral or painful situations were shown while we recorded their electroencephalography (EEG), and we examined mood, empathic concern for others and symptom severity. Significant group differences between patients and controls emerged in early (50-150 ms after stimulus onset) and late (after 300 ms) timeframes. Moreover, brain activity was related with unpleasantness ratings in all participants, with self-reported empathic concern only in controls and with negative mood and personal distress only in patients. Differences in social behavior in schizophrenia may be explained by early as well as late differences, affecting mostly the early frontocentral ERPs, i.e. those suggested to correspond to the emotional sharing component of empathy.

However, in studies which involve arbitrary auditory stimuli evoked by sensory unspecific motor actions, learned associations may underlie ERP differences. Here, in a new paradigm, eye motor output generated auditory sensory input, a naive action-sensation contingency. We measured the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 40 participants exposed to pure tones, which they produced with either a button-press or volitional saccade. We found that button-press-initiated stimuli evoked reduced amplitude compared to externally initiated stimuli for both the N1 and P2 ERP components, whereas saccade-initiated stimuli evoked intermediate attenuation at N1 and no reduction at P2. These results indicate that the motor-to-sensory mapping involved in speech production may be partly generalized to other contingencies, and that learned associations also contribute to the N1 attenuation effect.

Although it has been shown that knowing in advance, when the probe would be presented, reduces the attentional blink and increases the amplitude of event-related potential (ERP) elicited by the probe, the neural mechanism by which attention mitigates the AB remains unclear. Here, we used time-frequency analysis to further explore the mechanism of the auditory attentional blink. Participants were presented a series of rapid auditory stimuli and asked to indicate whether a target and a probe were present in the sequence. In half of the trials, participants were cued to the probe position relative to the target ('Early' or 'Late'). Probe detection and ERP amplitude elicited by the probe decreased when the probe was presented shortly after the target compared to when it was presented later after the target. Importantly, the behavioral and ERP correlates of probe discrimination significantly improved when the 'Early' cue was presented. The improvement in processing the probe in the cued condition was accompanied by the decrease in alpha activity (8-13 Hz) after the time when the probe was expected; suggesting that successfully directing attention to time window where the probe would likely occur reduces the processing resources needed to suppress distractors. This in turn freed up available processing resources for the target and probe at the short-term consolidation stage, which ultimately reduced the auditory attentional blink.

J	Lin, HY; Schulz, C; Straube, T				Lin, Huiyan; Schulz, Claudia; Straube, Thomas			Effects of expectation congruency on event-related potentials (ERPs) to facial expressions depend on cognitive load during the expectation phase	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive load; Expectation congruency; Facial expressions; N2; EPN; LPP	THREATENING FACES; MODULATION; ATTENTION; EMOTION; STIMULI; FEARFUL; ANTICIPATION; DISTRACTION; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES	Previous studies have shown that event-related potentials (ERPs) to facial expressions are modulated by expectation (congruency) and that the ERP effects of expectation congruency are altered by cognitive tasks during the expectation phase. However, it is as yet unknown whether the congruency ERP effects can be modulated by the amount of cognitive load during the expectation phase. To address this question, electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired when participants viewed fearful and neutral facial expressions. Before the presentation of facial expressions, a cue indicating the expression of a face and subsequently, an expectation interval without any cues were presented. Facial expressions were congruent with the cues in 75% of all trials. During the expectation interval, participants had to solve a cognitive task, in which several letters were presented for target letter detection. The letters were all the same under low load, but differed under high load. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that the amount of cognitive load during the expectation phase altered the congruency effect in N2 and EPN amplitudes for fearful faces. Congruent as compared to incongruent fearful expressions elicited larger N2 and smaller EPN amplitudes under low load, but these congruency effects were not observed under high load. For neutral faces, a congruency effect in late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes was modulated by cognitive load during the expectation phase. The LPP was more positive for incongruent as compared to congruent faces under low load, but the congruency effect was not evident under high load. The findings indicate that congruency effects on ERPs are modulated by the amount of cognitive load the expectation phase and that this modulation is altered by facial expression.

What can cognitive neuroscience tell us about human development?	17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	17th European Conference on Developmental Psychology	SEP 08-12, 2015	Braga, PORTUGAL	European Assoc Dev Psychol, Univ Minho			SPEECH-PERCEPTION; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; RACE; FACE; CHILDREN; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; INFANCY; OSCILLATIONS	The increasing availability of safe, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques has led to an explosion in cognitive neuroscience research on infants, children, and adolescents. Two justifications for this research are: (1) that neuroscience methods can tell us more about the mechanisms underpinning development than behavioural studies alone, and (2) that the insights gained will have a feed- forward impact on clinical and educational practice and policy. Given recent scepticism towards both arguments, this paper brings together examples from different fields within developmental cognitive neuroscience to discuss specific cognitive domains and both typical and atypical pediatric populations, using a variety of different neuroimaging technologies. The paper addresses the progress made in developmental psychology by the use of functional near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography/event related potentials (EEG/ERP) in both typical and atypical development. It is argued that cognitive neuroscience has provided new hypotheses that have served to drive the field forward and clarify developmental mechanisms, as well as neural markers for working memory training and for distinguishing behavioural scores " in the normal range" from their atypical neural underpinnings.

To explore these processes, contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) were recorded in humans with electroencephalography (EEG) technique during a delayed matching-to-sample task, a working memory task involving presentations of two successive painful heat stimuli (S-1 and S-2) with different intensities separated by a 2-s interval (the memorization period). At the end of the task, the subject was required to discriminate the stimuli by indicating which (S-1 or S-2) induced more pain. A control task was used, in which no active discrimination was required between stimuli. All event-related potential (ERP) analysis was aligned to the onset of S-1. EEG activity exhibited two successive CHEPs: an N2-P2 complex (similar to 400 ms after onset of S-1) and an ultralate component (ULC, similar to 900 ms). The amplitude of the N2-P2 at vertex, but not the ULC, was significantly correlated with stimulus intensity in these two tasks, suggesting that the N2-P2 represents neural coding of pain intensity. A late negative component (LNC) in the frontal recording region was observed only in the memory task during a 500-ms period before onset of S-2. LNC amplitude differed between stimulus intensities and exhibited significant correlations with the N2-P2 complex. These indicate that the frontal LNC is involved in maintenance of intensity of pain in working memory. Furthermore, alpha-band oscillations observed in parietal recording regions during the late delay displayed significant power differences between tasks. This study provides in the temporal domain previously unidentified neural evidence showing the neural processes involved in working memory of painful stimuli.

Ear-EEG allows extraction of neural responses in challenging listening scenarios - a future technology for hearing aids?	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			SPEECH	Advances in brain-computer interface research have recently empowered the development of wearable sensors to record mobile electroencephalography (EEG) as an unobtrusive and easy-to-use alternative to conventional scalp EEG. One such mobile solution is to record EEG from the ear canal, which has been validated for auditory steady state responses and discrete event related potentials (ERPs). However, it is still under discussion where to place recording and reference electrodes to capture best responses to auditory stimuli. Furthermore, the technology has not yet been tested and validated for ecologically relevant auditory stimuli such as speech. In this study, Ear-EEG and conventional scalp EEG were recorded simultaneously in a discrete-tone as well as a continuous-speech design. The discrete stimuli were applied in a dichotic oddball paradigm, while continuous stimuli were presented diotically as two simultaneous talkers. Cross-correlation of stimulus envelope and Ear-EEG was assessed as a measure of ongoing neural tracking. The extracted ERPs from Ear-EEG revealed typical auditory components yet depended critically on the reference electrode chosen. Reliable neural-tracking responses were extracted from the Ear-EEG for both paradigms, albeit weaker in amplitude than from scalp EEG. In conclusion, this study shows the feasibility of extracting relevant neural features from ear-canal-recorded "Ear-EEG", which might augment future hearing technology.

Although a number of studies showed that source-level EEG features can potentially be applied to the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, most studies have used only sensor-level EEG features such as ERP peak amplitude and power spectrum for machine learning-based diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this study, we used both sensor-level and source-level features extracted from EEG signals recorded during an auditory oddball task for the classification of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. EEG signals were recorded from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. Our results demonstrated higher classification accuracy when source-level features were used together with sensor-level features, compared to when only sensor-level features were used. In addition, the selected sensor-level features were mostly found in the frontal area, and the selected source-level features were mostly extracted from the temporal area, which coincide well with the well-known pathological region of cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that our approach would be a promising tool for the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, while previous electroencephalography (EEG) research has demonstrated a reduction in the N400 response to words in a supportive context, it is often challenging to dissociate facilitation due to bottom-up spreading activation from facilitation due to top-down expectations. The goal of the current study was to specifically determine the cortical areas associated with facilitation due to top-down prediction, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings supplemented by EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a semantic priming paradigm. In order to modulate expectation processes while holding context constant, we manipulated the proportion of related pairs across 2 blocks (10 and 50% related). Event-related potential results demonstrated a larger N400 reduction when a related word was predicted, and MEG source localization of activity in this time-window (350-450 ms) localized the differential responses to left anterior temporal cortex. fMRI data from the same participants support the MEG localization, showing contextual facilitation in left anterior superior temporal gyrus for the high expectation block only. Together, these results provide strong evidence that facilitatory effects of lexical-semantic prediction on the electrophysiological response 350-450 ms postonset reflect modulation of activity in left anterior temporal cortex.

However, it is not clear whether we may obtain a more precise spatial localization of the focus of attention based on the EEG signals during central fixation. In this study, we used a modified Posner cueing task with an endogenous cue to determine the degree to which information in the EEG signal can be used to track visual spatial attention in presentation sequences lasting 200 ms. We used a machine learning classification method to evaluate how well EEG signals discriminate between four different locations of the focus of attention. We then used a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework to evaluate the decoding accuracy (DA). We found that ERP-based features from occipital and parietal regions showed a statistically significant valid prediction of the location of the focus of visuospatial attention (DA = 57%, p<.001, chance-level 25%). The mean distance between the predicted and the true focus of attention was 0.62 letter positions, which represented a mean error of 0.55 degrees of visual angle. In addition, ERP responses also successfully predicted whether spatial attention was allocated or not to a given location with an accuracy of 79% (p<.001). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for visuospatial attention decoding and future paths for research are proposed.

This event-related potential (ERP) study focused on the way these features of words are used to detect similarities between the distractor words that are glanced at and the target word, as well as to then reject the distractor words. The participants had to search for a target word that was either given literally or defined by a semantic clue among words presented sequentially. The distractor words included words that resembled the target and words that were semantically related to the target. The P2a component was the first component to be modulated by the visual and/or semantic similarity of distractors to the target word, and these modulations varied according to the task. The same held true for the later N300 and N400 components, which confirms that, depending on the task, distinct processing pathways were sensitized through attentional modulation. Hence, the process that matches what is perceived with the target acts during the first 200ms after word presentation, and both early detection and late rejection processes of words depend on the search task and on the representation of the target stored in memory.

Electroencephalogram was recorded while listeners detected repeating tonal complexes composed of a random set of pure tones within stimuli consisting of randomly varying tonal elements. The repeating pattern was perceived as a figure over the randomly changing background. It was found that detection performance improved both as the number of pure tones making up each repeated complex (figure coherence) increased, and as the number of repeated complexes (duration) increased - i.e., detection was easier when either the spectral or temporal structure of the figure was enhanced. Figure detection was accompanied by the elicitation of the object related negativity (ORN) and the P400 event-related potentials (ERPs), which have been previously shown to be evoked by the presence of two concurrent sounds. Both ERP components had generators within and outside of auditory cortex. The amplitudes of the ORN and the P400 increased with both figure coherence and figure duration. However, only the P400 amplitude correlated with detection performance. These results suggest that 1) the ORN and P400 reflect processes involved in detecting the emergence of a new auditory object in the presence of other concurrent auditory objects; 2) the ORN corresponds to the likelihood of the presence of two or more concurrent sound objects, whereas the P400 reflects the perceptual recognition of the presence of multiple auditory objects and/or preparation for reporting the detection of a target object.

The aim of this study was to validate a computational method using EEG covariance (or connectivity) matrices to detect a change in brain activity related to breathing. In 17 healthy subjects, EEG was recorded during resting unloaded breathing (RB), voluntary sniffs, and breathing against an inspiratory threshold load (ITL). EEG were analyzed by the specially developed covariance-based classifier, event-related potentials, and time-frequency (T-F) distributions. Nine subjects repeated the protocol. The classifier could accurately detect ITL and sniffs compared with the reference period of RB. For ITL, EEG-based detection was superior to airflow-based detection (P < 0.05). A coincident improvement in EEG-airflow correlation in ITL compared with RB (P < 0.05) confirmed that EEG detection relates to breathing. Premotor potential incidence was significantly higher before inspiration in sniffs and ITL compared with RB (P < 0.05), but T-F distributions revealed a significant difference between sniffs and RB only (P < 0.05). Intraclass correlation values ranged from poor (-0.2) to excellent (1.0). Thus, as for conventional event-related potential analysis, the covariance-based classifier can accurately predict a change in brain state related to a change in respiratory state, and given its capacity for near "real-time" detection, it is suitable to monitor the respiratory state in respiratory and critically ill patients in the development of a brain-ventilator interface.

Electrophysiological research on infants' basic-level and global-level categorization has mainly focused on general measures of visual attention, not on specific neural processes underlying the development and identification of visual categories. Our knowledge on categorization processes in the infant brain is mainly limited to faces as categories. I will call for the use of EEG-based techniques such as rapid repetition ERP paradigms and fast periodic stimulation that have only rarely been used with infants in order to gain a better understanding of the development of category representations in the infant brain.

In this study, we used EEG/ERP methods to examine two novel influences on neural and subjective responses to facial attractiveness: an observer's expectation and repetition. In each trial of our task, participants viewed either an ordinary or attractive face. To alter expectations, the faces were preceded by a peer-rating that ostensibly reflected the overall attractiveness value assigned to that face by other individuals. To examine the impact of repetition, trials were presented twice throughout the experimental session. Results showed that participants' expectations about a person's attractiveness level powerfully altered both the neural response (i.e. the late positive potential; LPP) and self-reported attractiveness ratings. Intriguingly, repetition enhanced both the LPP and self-reported attractiveness as well. Exploratory analyses further suggested that both observer expectation and repetitionmodulated early neural responses (i.e. the early posterior negativity; EPN) elicited by facial attractiveness. Collectively, these results highlight novel influences on a core social judgment that underlies individuals' affective lives.

Although moral stimuli are emotionally charged, the time course of interactions between emotions and moral judgments remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the interaction between emotional processes and moral cognition. The results revealed that when making moral judgments, the time course of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform was significantly different between high emotional arousal and low emotional arousal contexts. Different stages of processing were distinguished, showing distinctive interactions between emotional processes and moral reasoning. The precise time course of moral intuition and moral reasoning sheds new light on theoretical models of moral psychology. Specifically, the N1 component (interpreted as representing moral intuition) did not appear to be influenced by emotional arousal. However, the N2 component and late positive potential were strongly affected by emotional arousal; the slow wave was influenced by both emotional arousal and morality, suggesting distinct moral processing at different emotional arousal levels.

However, the limited usability of wet EEG electrodes as well as low accuracy for large numbers of users have so far prevented this new technology to become commonplace. In this study a novel EEG-based authentication system is presented, which is based on the rapid serial visual presentation paradigm and uses a knowledge-based approach for authentication. Twenty-nine subjects' data were recorded and analyzed with wet EEG electrodes as well as dry ones. A true acceptance rate of 100% can be reached for all subjects with an average required login time of 13.5 s for wet and 27 s for dry electrodes. Average false acceptance rates for the dry electrode setup were estimated to be 3.33 x 10(-5).

The induced effect of brain modulation was tested on the EEG (electroencephalography) and ERPs (event-related potentials) profile when subjects performed a task in which they had to respond if the object represented in the sequence was correctly or incorrectly used. It was shown that an increased negative peak deflection (N400) is observable in case of semantic anomalies. We attended a significant reduction of this ERPs deflections when tDCS was applied to frontal area. During the detection task, participants were asked to evaluate the semantic correctness of some motor sequences that manipulated simple objects. EEG were registered during the tDCS or no tDCS stimulation. Significant differences between the two conditions and a reduction of the peak amplitude were observed in case of tDCS stimulation.

Leveraging the physical characteristics of a user reduces the burden of setting and remembering complex passwords, while enabling stronger security. Multi-factor systems lend further credence to this model, increasing security via multiple passive data points. In recent years, brainwaves have been shown to be another feasible source for biometric authentication. Physically unique to an individual in certain circumstances, the signals can also be changed by the user at will, making them more robust than static physical characteristics. No paradigm is impervious however, and even well-established medical technologies have deficiencies. In this work, a system for biometric authentication via brainwaves is constructed with electroencephalography (EEG). The efficacy of EEG biometrics via existing consumer electronics is evaluated, and vulnerabilities of such a system are enumerated. Impersonation attacks are performed to expose the extent to which the system is vulnerable. Finally, a multimodal system combining EEG with additional factors is recommended and outlined.

By supporting an infant's attention to the target, JE promotes encoding of information. This process has not been studied in toddlers despite the fact that language and social interaction develop rapidly in this period. We asked whether JE modulates object discrimination in typically developing toddlers. In a pilot evaluation of a novel, naturalistic paradigm, toddlers (n=11) were introduced to toys by an examiner with or without JE. Toddlers then viewed images of the toys while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Analysis focused on the differential neural response to objects presented in the two conditions. EEG components of interest included frontal positive component (Pb), negative component (Nc), and positive slow wave. Toddlers discriminated between conditions with a larger Pb peak amplitude to stimuli presented with JE and a larger Nc mean amplitude to the stimuli presented without JE, reflecting greater familiarity with the toys presented socially. Our findings suggest that JE supports object learning in toddlers, and supports the potential utility of this novel paradigm in both the assessment and the potential to detect impairment in social learning among toddlers.

Short-term repetition effects were measured for probe objects as a function of whether a preceding prime object was shown as an intact image or coarsely scrambled (split into two halves) and whether or not it had been attended during the prime display. In line with previous behavioral experiments, priming effects were observed from both intact and split primes for attended objects, but only from intact (repeated same view) objects when they were unattended. These behavioral results were reflected in ERP waveforms at occipital temporal locations as more negative-going deflections for repeated items in the time window between 220 and 300 ms after probe onset (N250r). Attended intact images showed generally more enhanced repetition effects than split ones. Unattended images showed repetition effects only when presented in an intact configuration, and this finding was limited to the right-hemisphere electrodes. Repetition effects in earlier (before 200 ms) time windows were limited to attended conditions at occipito-temporal sites during the N1, a component linked to the encoding of object structure, while repetition effects at central locations during the same time window (P150) were found for attended and unattended probes but only when repeated in the same intact configuration. The data indicate that view-generalization is mediated by a combination of analytic (part-based) representations and automatic view-dependent representations.

Based on P300 signals - one type of event-related potential - enables brain-machine interface users to select desired letters by means of attention alone. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of P300 signals in enabling a single subject to realize novel information retrieval. In the recent collaborative EEG study of multiple subjects has enabled classification to detect attention in a markedly improved way. Here we propose emotional face retrieval using P300 signals of 20 subjects. As a result, the F-measure under the condition of a single subject was a standard deviation of 0.636 +/- 0.05 and an F-measure of 0.886 with multiple subjects. In short, emotional face retrieval classification is improved with collaborative P300 signals from multiple subjects. This technique could be applied to life logs, computer-supported cooperative work, and neuromarketing.

The purpose of this paper is to apply a new method called empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. EMD is an appropriate tool to deal with the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of EEG. In the previous studies on the same data set, some morphological, frequency, and wavelet features were extracted only from Pz channel, and used for the detection of guilty and innocent subjects. In this paper, an EMD-based feature extraction was done on EEG recorded signal. Features were extracted from all three recorded channels (Pz, Cz, and Fz) for synergistic incorporation of channel information. Finally, a genetic algorithm was utilized as a tool for efficient feature selection and overcoming the challenge of input space dimension increase. The classification accuracy of guilty and innocent subjects was 92.73%, which was better than other previously used methods.

J	Faehling, F; Plewnia, C				Faehling, Florian; Plewnia, Christian			Controlling the Emotional Bias: Performance, Late Positive Potentials, and the Effect of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; late positive potential; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); brain stimulation; negativity bias; working memory; EEG/ERP; neuromodulation	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; REAPPRAISAL; VARIABILITY; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION; INTERFERENCE; STATE	Cognitive control of emotional processing is essential for adaptive human behavior. Biased attention toward emotionally salient information is critically linked with affective disorders and is discussed as a promising treatment target. Anodal (activity enhancing) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase healthy and impaired cognitive control over emotional distraction and is therefore widely used for the investigation and experimental treatment of this disorder. In this study, event-related potential (ERP) were recorded parallel to tDCS to track its online effects. Healthy volunteers (n = 87) performed a delayed working memory paradigm with emotional salient and neutral distractors during stimulation with different intensities (sham, 0.5, 1, 1.5 mA). Measuring the late positive potential (LPP), an ERP that indexes attention allocation, we found that a valence-specific increase of the early portion of the LPP (eLPP, 250-500 ms) was associated with less emotional distraction in the sham group. Of note, stimulation with tDCS exerted an intensity related effect on this correlation. The later part of the LPP (ILPP, 500-1000 ms) was found to be correlated with reaction time, regardless of valence. General effect of tDCS on LPPs and task performance were not observed. These findings demonstrate that ERP recordings parallel to tDCS are feasible to investigate the neuronal underpinnings of stimulation effects on executive functions. Furthermore, they support the notion that the LPP induced by a distractive stimulus during a working memory task mirrors the additional allocation of neuronal resources with a specific sensitivity of the early LPP for highly arousing negative stimuli. Finally, together with the variable magnitude and direction of the emotional bias, the lack of systematic modulations of LPPs and behavior by tDCS further underlines the important influence of the individual brain activity patterns on stimulation effects both on the behavioral and neurophysiological level.

We evaluated the relationship between RT and the amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P3 in visual and auditory Go/No-go paradigms. No significant differences were observed in the latencies of N2 and P3 between visual and auditory paradigms. Significant correlations were observed between RT and the latency of P3 in the visual and auditory paradigms. In contrast, the amplitudes of N2 and P3 were significantly larger in the visual paradigm than in the auditory paradigm. A significant correlation was observed between RT and the amplitude of P3 only in the auditory paradigm. These results suggested that there were two neural networks for the response execution and inhibitory function, common and uncommon, that depended on the stimulus modality.

Stimulus sequence context differentially modulates inhibition-related theta and delta band activity in a go/no-go task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sequential effects; Response inhibition; Time-frequency; EEG; Theta; Delta	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-FREQUENCY COMPONENTS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; CLOSED-FORM PARAFAC; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; EXTERNALIZING PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PHASE SYNCHRONY; ERP COMPONENTS; COGNITIVE CONTROL	Recent work suggests that dissociable activity in theta and delta frequency bands underlies several common ERP components, including the no-go N2/P3 complex, which can better index separable functional processes than traditional time-domain measures. Reports have also demonstrated that neural activity can be affected by stimulus sequence context information (i.e., the number and type of preceding stimuli). Stemming from prior work demonstrating that theta and delta index separable processes during response inhibition, the current study assessed sequence context in a go/no-go paradigm in which the number of go stimuli preceding each no-go was selectively manipulated. Principal component analysis of time-frequency representations revealed differential modulation of evoked theta and delta related to sequence context, where delta increased robustly with additional preceding go stimuli, while theta did not. Findings are consistent with the view that theta indexes simpler initial salience-related processes, while delta indexes more varied and complex processes related to a variety of task parameters.

The Impact of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy on Event-Related Potentials in Patients with Tic Disorders or Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; tic disorders; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit disorder; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive psychophysiological therapy; event-related potentials; electrophysiology	SKIN PICKING DISORDER; LA-TOURETTE SYNDROME; VISUAL ODDBALL TASK; MATTER ABNORMALITIES; P300 ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN; TRICHOTILLOMANIA; ATTENTION; SENSORIMOTOR; AMPLITUDE	Context: Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of non voluntary contractions of functionally related groups of skeletal muscles in one or multiple body parts. Patients with body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) present frequent and repetitive behaviors, such as nail biting or hair pulling. TD and BFRB can be treated with a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that regulates the excessive amount of sensorimotor activation and muscular tension. Our CBT, which is called the cognitive psychophysiological (CoPs) model, targets motor execution and inhibition, and it was reported to modify brain activity in TD. However, psychophysiological effects of therapy are still poorly understood in TD and BFRB patients. Our goals were to compare the event -related potentials (ERP) of TD and BFRB patients to control participants and to investigate the effects of the CoPs therapy on the P200, N200, and P300 components during a motor and a non -motor oddball task. Method: Event -related potential components were compared in 26 TD patients, 27 BFRB patients, and 27 control participants. ERP were obtained from 63 EEG electrodes during two oddball tasks. In the non -motor task, participants had to count rare stimuli. In the motor task, participants had to respond with a left and right button press for rare and frequent stimuli, respectively. ERP measures were recorded before and after therapy in both patient groups. Results: CoPs therapy improved symptoms similarly in both clinical groups. Before therapy, TD and BFRB patients had reduced P300 oddball effect during the non -motor task, in comparison with controls participants. An increase in the P300 oddball effect was observed posttherapy. This increase was distributed over the whole cortex in BFRB patients, but localized in the parietal area in TD patients. Discussion: These results suggest a modification of neural processes following CoPs therapy in TD and BFRB patients.

J	Hsu, CH; Lee, CY; Liang, WK				Hsu, Chun-Hsien; Lee, Chia-Ying; Liang, Wei-Kuang			An improved method for measuring mismatch negativity using ensemble empirical mode decomposition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Event-related mode; Event-related potential; Hilbert-Huang transformation; Intrinsic mode function; Mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EFFECT SIZE; CHILDREN; STATISTICS; DYNAMICS; DESIGNS; PITCH; MMN	Background: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of event-related potentials (ERPs). Conventional approaches to measuring MMN include recording a large number of trials (e.g., 1000 trials per participant) and extracting signals within a low frequency band, e.g., between 2 Hz and 8 Hz. New Method: Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a method to decompose time series data into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Each IMF has a dominant frequency. Similar to ERP measurement, averaging IMF5 across trials allows measurement of event-related modes (ERMs). This paper demonstrates a protocol that adopts EEMD and Hilbert spectral analyses and uses ERMs to extract MMN-related activity based on electroencephalography data recorded from 18 participants in an MMN paradigm. The effect of deviants was demonstrated by manipulating changes in lexical tones. Results: The mean amplitudes of ERMs revealed a significant effect of lexical tone on MMN. Based on effect size statistics, a significant effect of lexical tone on MMN could be observed using ERM measurements over fewer trials (about 300 trials per participant) in a small sample size (five to six participants). Comparison with Existing Method(s): The EEMD method provided ERMs with remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios and yielded a strong effect size. Furthermore, the experimental requirements for recording MMN (i.e., the number of trials and the sample size) could be reduced while using the suggested analytic method. Conclusions: ERMs may be useful for applying the MMN paradigm in clinical populations and children. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study examined the impact of (1) a task-irrelevant unpredictable relative to predictable context and (2) individual differences in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) on the reward-related positivity (RewP), an event-related potential (ERP) response to monetary gains relative to losses. Specifically, 64 participants listened to predictable and unpredictable tone sequences while electroencephalography was recorded during a monetary gambling task. Participants also completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, which measures both cognitive distress (prospective IU) and behavioral inhibition (inhibitory IU) elicited by uncertainty, in addition to the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Results indicated that the RewP was reduced during the unpredictable relative to the predictable context. Greater self-reported anxiety elicited by the unpredictable context was associated with a decreased RewP, and a decreased RewP was associated with poorer lose-shift behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, the RewP mediated the relationship between self-reported anxiety elicited by the unpredictable context and lose-shift behavioral adjustment. The IU subscales demonstrated the opposite relationship with the RewP across both contexts-inhibitory IU was associated with an attenuated RewP and prospective IU was associated with an enhanced RewP. In contrast, anxiety, depression, stress, and worry symptomatology were not associated with the RewP. This is the first study to demonstrate that an unpredictable context and individual differences in the degree to which people cannot tolerate uncertainty impact an ERP measure of reward system functioning.

We used Electroencephalography (EEG) to develop a novel brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual strain. We present the first system that discriminates comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using EEG. In particular, we show that either changes in event-related potentials' (ERPs) amplitudes or changes in EEG oscillations power following stereoscopic objects presentation can be used to estimate visual comfort. Our system reacts within 1 s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average (up to 76%) and 74% on average when 7 consecutive variations are measured (up to 93%). Performances are stable (approximate to 62.5%) when a simplified signal processing is used to simulate online analyses or when the number of EEG channels is lessened. This study could lead to adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and viewing conditions. For example, it could be possible to match the stereoscopic effect with users' state by modifying the overlap of left and right images according to the classifier output.

Two groups of participants (an adolescent group and an adult group) were recruited to complete an emotional oddball task featuring on happy and one fearful condition. The measurement of event-related potential was carried out via electroencephalography and electrooculography recording, to detect visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) with regard to the automatic detection of changes in facial expressions between the two age groups. The current findings demonstrated that the adolescent group featured more negative vMMN amplitudes than the adult group in the fronto-central region during the 120-200 ms interval. During the time window of 370-450 ms, only the adult group showed better automatic processing on fearful faces than happy faces. The present study indicated that adolescent's posses stronger automatic detection of changes in emotional expression relative to adults, and sheds light on the neurodevelopment of automatic processes concerning social-emotional information.

These ERD/ERS activities are suggested to reflect various aspects of pain perception, including the representation, encoding, assessment, and integration of the nociceptive sensory inputs, as well as behavioral responses to pain, even the precise details of their roles remain unclear. Previous studies investigating the functional relevance of ERD/ERS activities in pain perception were normally done by assessing their latencies, frequencies, magnitudes, and scalp distributions, which would be then correlated with subjective pain perception or stimulus intensity. Nevertheless, these temporal, spectral, and spatial profiles of stimulus induced ERD/ERS could only partly reveal the dynamics of brain oscillatory activities. Indeed, additional parameters, including but not limited to, phase, neural generator, and cross frequency couplings, should be paid attention to comprehensively and systemically evaluate the dynamics of oscillatory activities associated with pain perception and behavior. This would be crucial in exploring the psychophysiological mechanisms of neural oscillation, and in understanding the neural functions of cortical oscillations involved in pain perception and behavior. Notably, some chronic pain (e.g., neurogenic pain and complex regional pain syndrome) patients are often associated with the occurrence of abnormal synchronized oscillatory brain activities, and selectively modulating cortical oscillatory activities has been showed to be a potential therapy strategy to relieve pain with the application of neurostimulation techniques, e.g., repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Thus, the investigation of the oscillatory activities proceeding from phenomenology to function, opens new perspectives to address questions in human pain psychophysiology and pathophysiology, thereby promoting the establishment of rational therapeutic strategy.

This study combined simultaneous eye tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure neural attention responses during exogenous cueing in overt attention shifts (with saccadic eye movements to a target) and compared these with covert attention shifts (responding manually while maintaining central fixation). EEG analysis of the period preceding the saccade latency showed similar occipital response amplitudes for overt and covert shifts, although response latencies differed. However, a frontal positivity was greater during covert attention shifts, possibly reflecting saccade inhibition to maintain fixation. The results show that combined EEG and eye tracking can be successfully used to study natural overt shifts of attention (applicable to non-verbal infants) and that requiring inhibition of saccades can lead to additional frontal responses. Such data can be used to refine current neural models of attention that have been mainly based on covert shifts.

At the experimental level, inconsistent findings suggest different effects of intensity on the amplitudes of the auditory N1 and P2. Our main goal was to analyze the intensity dependence of the auditory N1 and P2 while controlling for habituation effects. Methods: We examined the intensity dependence of both averaged and single-trial auditory N1 and P2 waves elicited in a repeated-stimulation protocol. Results: N1 and P2 revealed similar intensity dependence on both standard and filter denoised ERP, with a linear tendency for higher intensities to elicit higher absolute peak amplitudes. At the single-trial level, both waves covary irrespective of stimulus intensity and trial order. Conclusions: Our results suggest that stimulus intensity variation induces similar effects on both and N1 and P2 and partially contradict previous data that classified the P2 as a non-habituating component. Significance: Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the functional significance of the auditory P2 deflection.

In the electroencephalogram (EEG), emotional-neutral processing differences are typically reflected in the early posterior negativity (EPN, 200-300 ms) and the late positive potential (LPP, 400-700 ms). These components are also enlarged by task-driven visual attention, supporting the assumption that emotional content naturally drives attention. Still, the spatio-temporal dynamics of interactions between emotional stimulus content and task-driven attention remain to be specified. Here, we examine this issue in visual word processing. Participants attended to negative, neutral, or positive nouns while high-density EEG was recorded. Emotional content and top-down attention both amplified the EPN component in parallel. On the LPP, by contrast, emotion and attention interacted: Explicit attention to emotional words led to a substantially larger amplitude increase than did explicit attention to neutral words. Source analysis revealed early parallel effects of emotion and attention in bilateral visual cortex and a later interaction of both in right visual cortex. Distinct effects of attention were found in inferior, middle and superior frontal, paracentral, and parietal areas, as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results specify separate and shared mechanisms of emotion and attention at distinct processing stages. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3575-3587, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Because more substance abuse treatment while incarcerated is associated with better post-release outcomes, including a reduced risk of accidental overdose death, the stakes are high in developing novel predictors of substance abuse treatment completion in inmate populations. MethodsUsing electroencephalography (EEG), this study investigated stimulus-locked ERP components elicited by distractor stimuli in three tasks (VO-Distinct, VO-Repeated, Go/NoGo) as a predictor of treatment discontinuation in a sample of male and female prison inmates. We predicted that those who discontinued treatment early would exhibit a less positive P3a amplitude elicited by distractor stimuli. ResultsOur predictions regarding ERP components were partially supported. Those who discontinued treatment early exhibited a less positive P3a amplitude and a less positive PC4 in the VO-D task. In the VO-R task, however, those who discontinued treatment early exhibited a more negative N200 amplitude rather than the hypothesized less positive P3a amplitude. The discontinuation group also displayed less positive PC4 amplitude. Surprisingly, there were no time-domain or principle component differences among the groups in the Go/NoGo task. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models of the three tasks accurately classified individuals who discontinued treatment with the best model accurately classifying 75% of inmates. PCA techniques were more sensitive in differentiating groups than the classic time-domain windowed approach. ConclusionsOur pattern of findings are consistent with the context-updating theory of P300 and may help identify subtypes of ultrahigh-risk substance abusers who need specialized treatment programs.

Comparisons of the behavioral efficacy of NF and medication have produced inconsistent results. EEG measures can provide insight into treatment mechanisms, but have received little consideration. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), effects of NF were compared with methylphenidate (MPH), and physical activity (PA) in children with ADHD on event-related potential (ERP) indices of response inhibition, which are involved in ADHD psychopathology. Methods: Using a multicenter three way parallel group RCT design, 112 children with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association 1994) diagnosis of ADHD, between 7 and 13 years of age, were initially included. NF training consisted of 30 sessions of theta/beta training at Cz over a 10 week period. PA training was a semiactive control group, matched in frequency and duration. MPH was titrated using a double-blind placebo controlled procedure in 6 weeks, followed by a stable dose for 4 weeks. ERP measures of response inhibition, N2 and P3, were available for 81 children at pre- and postintervention (n=32 NF, n=25 MPH, n=24 PA). Results: Only the medication group showed a specific increase in P3 amplitude compared with NF (partial eta-squared [(2)(p) ]=0.121) and PA ((2)(p)=0.283), which was related to improved response inhibition. Source localization of medication effects on P3 amplitude indicated increased activation primarily in thalamic and striatal nuclei. Conclusions: This is the first study that simultaneously compared NF with stimulant treatment and a semiactive control group. Only stimulant treatment demonstrated specific improvements in brain function related to response inhibition. These results are in line with recent doubts on the efficacy and specificity of NF as treatment for ADHD. Clinical Trials Registration: Train Your Brain?

Neuronal generator patterns at scalp elicited by lateralized aversive pictures reveal consecutive stages of motivated attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potential (ERP); Current source density (CSD); Principal components analysis (PCA); Source localization; Late positive potential (LPP); Emotional lateralization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL CORTEX; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; VISUAL-CORTEX; HEALTHY-ADULTS; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; HEMIFIELD PRESENTATIONS; ELECTRICAL DISTANCE	Event-related potential (ERP) studies have provided evidence for an allocation of attentional resources to enhance perceptual processing of motivationally salient stimuli. Emotional modulation affects several consecutive components associated with stages of affective-cognitive processing, beginning as early as 100-200 ms after stimulus onset. In agreement with the notion that the right parietotemporal region is critically involved during the perception of arousing affective stimuli, some ERP studies have reported asymmetric emotional ERP effects. However, it is difficult to separate emotional from non-emotional effects because differences in stimulus content unrelated to affective salience or task demands may also be associated with lateralized function or promote cognitive processing. Other concerns pertain to the operational definition and statistical independence of ERP component measures, their dependence on an EEG reference, and spatial smearing due to volume conduction, all of which impede the identification of distinct scalp activation patterns associated with affective processing. Building on prior research using a visual half-field paradigm with highly controlled emotional stimuli (pictures of cosmetic surgery patients showing disordered [negative] or healed [neutral] facial areas before or after treatment), 72-channel ERPs recorded from 152 individuals (ages 13-68 years; 81 female) were transformed into reference-free current source density (CSD) waveforms and submitted to temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to identify their underlying neuronal generator patterns. Using both nonparametric randomization tests and repeated measures ANOVA, robust effects of emotional content were found over parietooccipital regions for CSD factors corresponding to N2 sink (212 ms peak latency), P3 source (385 ms) and a late centroparietal source (630 ms), all indicative of greater positivity for negative than neutral stimuli. For the N2 sink, emotional effects were right-lateralized and modulated by hemifield, with larger amplitude and asymmetry for left hemifield (right hemisphere) presentations. For all three factors, more positive amplitudes at parietooccipital sites were associated with increased ratings of negative valence and greater arousal. Distributed inverse solutions of the CSD-PCA-based emotional effects implicated a sequence of maximal activations in right occipitotemporal cortex, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral inferior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with hierarchical activations of the ventral visual pathway reflecting subsequent processing stages in response to motivationally salient stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that attention may be preferentially directed toward certain outcome-predicting cues. We studied this possibility by analyzing event-related potential (ERP) responses in humans during a probabilistic decision-making task. Participants viewed pairs of outcome-predicting visual cues and then chose to wager either a small (i.e., loss-minimizing) or large (i.e., gain-maximizing) amount of money. The cues were bilaterally presented, which allowed us to extract the relative neural responses to each cue by using a contralateral-versus-ipsilateral ERP contrast. We found an early lateralized ERP response, whose features matched the attention-shift-related N2pc component and whose amplitude scaled with the learned reward-predicting value of the cues as predicted by an attention-for-reward model. Consistently, we found a double dissociation involving the N2pc. Across participants, gain-maximization positively correlated with the N2pc amplitude to the most reliable gain-predicting cue, suggesting an attentional bias toward such cues. Conversely, loss-minimization was negatively correlated with the N2pc amplitude to the most reliable loss-predicting cue, suggesting an attentional avoidance toward such stimuli. These results indicate that learned stimulus-reward associations can influence rapid attention allocation, and that differences in this process are associated with individual differences in economic decision-making performance.

This sensitivity is more evident for stimuli integrated in complex sound contexts. This study tested whether increasing magnitudes of deviation (levels) entail increasing MMN amplitude (or decreasing latency), aiming to create a balanced version of the musical multi-feature paradigm towards measurement of extensive auditory discrimination profiles in auditory expertise or deficits. Methods: Using electroencephalography, we measured MMNs in healthy young adults to six types of sound feature change (pitch, timbre, location, intensity, slide and rhythm) at three different magnitudes of deviation, embedded in a music-sounding context. We also behaviourally assessed the individual musical aptitude using the Musical Ear Test (MET). Results: 16 of 18 sound feature changes elicited significant MMNs. For pitch, intensity, location, and slide, the MMN amplitude increased with increasing magnitude of feature change. We observed a ceiling effect for rhythm, and a floor effect for timbre. The slide MMN amplitude correlated positively with MET melody score and negatively with MET rhythm score. Conclusions: This novel paradigm provides an extensive, objective measure of auditory discrimination profile for different sound features embedded in a complex sound context. Significance: The paradigm can be adopted to study the neurophysiology of individuals with music processing difficulties or with special musical skills, and may be a useful tool for investigating development, plasticity, and deficits of auditory processing.

The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1) a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2) it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the system's practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors, namely, SBLaplace, for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification.

However, the performance of visual saccade-independent P300 BCIs is generally poor. To improve saccade-independent BCI performance, we propose a bimodal P300 BCI approach that simultaneously employs auditory and tactile stimuli. The proposed P300 BCI is a vision-independent system because no visual interaction is required of the user. Specifically, we designed a direction-congruent bimodal paradigm by randomly and simultaneously presenting auditory and tactile stimuli from the same direction. Furthermore, the channels and number of trials were tailored to each user to improve online performance. With 12 participants, the average online information transfer rate (ITR) of the bimodal approach improved by 45.43% and 51.05% over that attained, respectively, with the auditory and tactile approaches individually. Importantly, the average online ITR of the bimodal approach, including the break time between selections, reached 10.77 bits/min. These findings suggest that the proposed bimodal system holds promise as a practical visual saccade-independent P300 BCI.

Fundamental management focuses on early characterization of the extent of injury and optimizing recovery by preventing secondary damage during the days following the primary injury. Currently, bedside technology for measuring neurological function is mainly limited to using electroencephalography (EEG) for detection of seizures and encephalopathic features, and evoked potentials. We present a proof of concept study in patients with acute brain injury in the intensive care setting, featuring a bedside functional imaging set-up designed to map cortical brain activation patterns by combining high density EEG recordings, multi-modal sensory stimulation (auditory, visual, and somatosensory), and EEG source modeling. Use of source-modeling allows for examination of spatio-temporal activation patterns at the cortical region level as opposed to the traditional scalp potential maps. The application of this systemin both healthy and brain-injured participants is demonstrated with modality-specific source-reconstructed cortical activation patterns. By combining stimulation obtained with different modalities, most of the cortical surface can be monitored for changes in functional activation without having to physically transport the subject to an imaging suite. The results in patients in an intensive care setting with anatomically well-defined brain lesions suggest a topographic association between their injuries and activation patterns. Moreover, we report the reproducible application of a protocol examining a higher-level cortical processing with an auditory oddball paradigm involving presentation of the patient's own name. This study reports the first successful application of a bedside functional brain mapping tool in the intensive care setting. This application has the potential to provide clinicians with an additional dimension of information to manage critically-ill children and adults, and potentially patients not suited for magnetic resonance imaging technologies.

In previous studies, the N1 component of the ERP was shown to reflect print tuning but also to be sensitive to lexical effects. It remains unclear, however, whether these two aspects of orthographic processing occur at the same time or in different time windows during the lengthy N1 component. Moreover, it is unclear whether these processes develop late or occur already at early stages of literacy acquisition and whether this is similar for native languages and languages acquired later in life. To address these questions, 27 children were tested longitudinally, i.e. before (mean: 7.6 years) and after one year of classroom-based English instruction. Additionally, 22 adult speakers of English as a foreign language (mean: 25.1 years) were investigated. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a one-back task with native German words, English words, pseudowords and false-font strings. The event-related EEG analysis of early and late N1 phases revealed early effects related to print tuning and late effects related to lexical processing in the native, but not in the second language of adult readers. In the absence of lexicality effects in children, print tuning effects were found across both early and late N1 segments.

REPRESENTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS TRIAL BY TRIAL: COMPLEX AND FLEXIBLE ENCODING OF FEEDBACK VALENCE AND MAGNITUDE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perceptual decision-making; performance monitoring; outcome evaluation; event-related potential (ERP); feedback-related negativity (FRN); feedback-P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PREDICTION ERROR; OUTCOME EVALUATION	In the last decades it has been shown that two components of the event-related potentials (ERPs), the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300, reflect the evaluation of the outcomes of a given course of action. Within the reinforcement learning theory, the prevailing interpretation of the relationship between FRN and P300 is the classical "independent coding model". This model proposes that the FRN is only sensitive to feedback valence whereas the P300 is only sensitive to feedback magnitude. However, these predictions have recently been challenged and the question remains unsolved. The goal of the present study is to shed light on the effects of outcome valence and magnitude on the FRN and the feedback-P300. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded while participants performed a perceptual discrimination task with two levels of difficulty, in which they could receive large or small rewards and penalties. We used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, which allowed us to analyze the relationship between the outcomes and EEG on a trial-by-trial basis. The results reveal that both components, which are contingent on feedback presentation, are sensitive to outcome valence. Regarding magnitude, this only affects the feedback P300, and only in conjunction with difficulty. Finally, we found that task difficulty has the opposite effect on these components, both in their latencies and discriminability. Our results suggest that the FRN and the feedback-P300 in fact reflect different performance monitoring processes in a flexible way that depends on the behavioral context. (C) 2016 IBRO.

In addition, there is evidence that it takes them more time to overcome a distracting event. Here, the distracting effect of irregular switches in speaker location was studied in 22 younger and 22 older adults in a speech perception task. The participants responded to target words that were presented either from a frequent location (standard trials) or a rare location (deviant trials). Behavioral performance measures, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and EEG synchronization (intertrial coherence [ITC]) were analyzed. Behavioral performance was not only decreased in deviant trials, but also in subsequent standard trials, indicating an effect of so-called postdeviance distraction. The negative impact of the distracting event (i.e., the switch in speaker location) on the processing of subsequent (standard) trials was more pronounced in the older versus younger group. The EEG analyses revealed a decreased N2 amplitude and increased latencies in P2 and P3a in the older group, suggesting a reduced and delayed attentional control. Moreover, there were age-related changes in late (200-450 ms) theta ITCs: While the ITC of the young remained constant in trials following a deviant, the ITC of the old decreased, suggesting a decline in processing of stimuli following (task-irrelevant) switches in speaker location. This could contribute to age-related deficits in speech comprehension in spatially variable listening situations.

J	Hagemann, J; Straube, T; Schulz, C				Hagemann, Julian; Straube, Thomas; Schulz, Claudia			Too bad: Bias for angry faces in social anxiety interferes with identity processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Social anxiety disorder; Attentional bias; Hypervigilance; Emotional facial expression; Face learning; Event-related potentials; N170; N250/EPN; LPP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; OWN-RACE BIAS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL BIASES; NEURAL SYSTEM; ERP EVIDENCE; PHOBIA; AGE	The recognition of faces across incidences is a complex function of the human brain and a crucial ability for communication and daily interactions. This first study on ERP correlates of emotional face learning in social anxiety disorder (SAD) investigates whether the known attentional bias for threatening faces leads to a corresponding memory bias. Therefore, 21 patients with SAD and 21 healthy controls (HCs) learned faces with emotional facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) and were later asked to recognize these out of novel identities all presented with a neutral facial expression. EEG was recorded throughout. Behaviorally, the faces' emotional expression modulated later recognition in terms of accuracy, response times, signal detection parameters and ratings of valence, but with better performance for happy than angry faces in HC as well as in SAD. In the learning phase, attention- and memory-associated event related potentials (ERPs) P100, N170, P200, N250/EPN, and LPP indicated enhanced processing of angry faces, which was restricted to patients with SAD in N250/EPN and LPP. In the test phase, familiarity effects emerged in N250, FN400 and LPP. While N250 was affected by learned-angry faces, FN400 and LPP reflected image learning of neutral faces, which was restricted to SAD in LPP. We replicated the attentional bias to threatening faces, which was not restricted to early ERP components, but was prolonged to later stages of conscious processing, especially in SAD. In contrast to what had been expected, sustained hypervigilance to the emotional content seems to have impaired the processing of the facial identity, resulting in a happy face advantage at the behavioral level. This could be explained by prominent models assuming separate processing of facial emotion and identity. Hypervigilance in SAD might be a disadvantage in those studies focusing on other aspects of face processing than emotion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Disruption of visual input during this period results in amblyopia, which is associated with reduced activation of the striate and extrastriate cortices. It is well known that visual input converges with other sensory signals and exerts a significant influence on cortical processing in multiple association areas. Recent work in healthy adults has also shown that task-relevant visual input can modulate neural excitability at very early stages of information processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate visual-tactile interactions in adults with abnormal binocular vision due to amblyopia and strabismus. Results showed three main findings. First, in comparison to a visually normal control group, participants with abnormal vision had a significantly lower amplitude of the P50 somatosensory event related potential (ERP) when visual and tactile stimuli were presented concurrently. Second, the amplitude of the P100 somatosensory ERP was significantly greater in participants with abnormal vision. These results indicate that task relevant visual input does not significantly influence the excitability of the primary somatosensory cortex, instead, the excitability of the secondary somatosensory cortex is increased. Third, participants with abnormal vision had a higher amplitude of the P1 visual ERP when a tactile stimulus was presented concurrently. Importantly, these results were not modulated by viewing condition, which indicates that the impact of amblyopia on crossmodal interactions is not simply related to the reduced visual acuity as it was evident when viewing with the unaffected eye and binocularly. These results indicate that the consequences of abnormal visual experience on neurophysiological processing extend beyond the primary and secondary visual areas to other modality-specific areas.

Facial emotion memory in schizophrenia: From encoding to maintenance-related EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Event-related potential; Emotion; Memory; Theta; Attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EXTRASTRIATE VISUAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FACE PERCEPTION; AFFECT RECOGNITION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; FEARFUL FACES; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ANGRY FACES	Objective: Persons with schizophrenia exhibit deficits recognizing facial emotions, which may impact social functioning. Whether these deficits reflect aberrant sensory processing, an inability to maintain information in memory, or dysfunctional integration of these two functions remains unclear. Methods: A facial emotion memory paradigm was administered to 38 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 42 healthy controls (HC). P100, N170 and N250 ERP amplitudes were measured to assess sensory processing. Evoked theta power during the delay interval was quantified to assess memory maintenance. Results: The N170 ERP was larger to negative compared to neutral facial expressions in both groups, while SZ exhibited increased evoked theta power during the delay interval. Increased theta power was associated with worse behavioral performance in response to sad and fearful expressions for HC, but this relationship was only found in response to fearful expressions for SZ. Finally, only HC showed consistent correlations between N170 amplitude and theta power during the delay interval. Conclusions: Integration between measures of sensory processing and memory functioning may be affected in SZ. Significance: These findings may indicate that the oscillatory networks subserving emotion processing and sustained attention are intertwined, and comprise part of the social brain network that is affected in schizophrenia.

Social and nonsocial affective processing in schizophrenia - An ERP study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Social cognition; Emotion; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EMOTION PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; METAANALYSIS; DISGUST; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; ANHEDONIA; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Background: Despite social cognitive dysfunction that may be observed in patients with schizophrenia, the knowledge about social and nonsocial affective processing in schizophrenia is scant. The aim of this study was to examine neurophysiological and behavioural responses to neutral and negative stimuli with (faces, people) and without (animals, objects) social content in schizophrenia. Methods: Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 21 healthy controls (HC) completed a visual oddball paradigm with either negative or neutral pictures from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) as targets while EEG was recorded. Half of the stimuli within each category presented social content (faces, people). Results: Negative stimuli with social content produced lower N2 amplitude and higher mean LPP than any other type of stimuli in both groups. Despite differences in behavioural ratings and alterations in ERP processing of affective stimuli (lack of EPN differentiation, decreased P3 to neutral stimuli) SCZ were still able to respond to specific categories of stimuli similarly to HC.

Physicians currently rely on patient history and clinical assessments to identify changes in memory or functional cognitive ability as indications of MCI/dementia in conjunction with exclusionary tests. They are limited in these discrete assessments by their accuracy and infrequent occurrence. The episodic cognition assessment framework proposed will allow better ongoing information about the true well-being of the patient through assessment of memory and functional cognitive ability between appointments. The paper presents three emerging cognitive assessment techniques through the application of sensors, signal processing and data analytics: [i] Electroencephalogram ( EEG) /Event Related Potential (ERP) with Neuropsychological Behavioural Testing (NBT) that has the potential to provide a novel bio-marker for MCI/dementia; [ii] Driving and [iii] Computer game use as two Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). The latter are presented within the episodic assessment framework as both are complex functional cognitive tasks and provide rich insight into the patient's ability and changes in ability. The paper shows results of the measures possible from an instrumented word search game and for driving using location tracking sensors. It shows data for an example participant and how the framework would allow these results to be combined.

We not only study the basic mechanism of sustained attention, but also study how the disturbance affects the nervous system of sustained attention. In this paper, we introduce the research background and purpose of sustained attention, focus on the effect of visual disturbance stimulation. By designing the experiments (sustained attention task, SAT and distractor condition sustained attention task, dSAT), we obtain induced brain waves with or without visual disturbance and measure them, and we analyze human EEG information from which we extract ERP (Event Related Potential) component and conduct discriminatory analysis. Then we study the reaction mechanism of the brain. Using behavioral analysis, ERP time domain analysis and SSVEP (Steady State Visual Evoked Potential) time-frequency analysis technology, we compare the results of two kinds of experiments (SAT and dSAT) to explore the physiological mechanism of sustained attention with disturbance or not. It is found that disturbance reduces the amplitude of N2, extends the start latency of P300. A new idea and method of using SSVEP to predict the attention and behavior is proposed. This experiment has an important practical significance on the study of cognitive processes of thinking and operating mechanism of the brain, at the same time, has some social significance for considering the pros and cons of real life people being used to multi-task execution status.

For slow event-related components, such as the P3, this developmental change may be masked due to increased amplitude levels of ongoing delta and theta oscillations in adolescents. Methods: In a cross-sectional study design, EEG was measured in 51 participants between 13 and 24 years. A visual oddball paradigm was used to elicit the P3. Our analysis focused on fronto-parietal activations within the P3 time-window and the concurrent time-frequency characteristics in the delta (similar to 0.5-4 Hz) and theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) band. Results: The parietal P3 amplitude was similar across the investigated age range, while the amplitude at frontal regions increased with age. The pre-stimulus amplitudes of delta and theta oscillations declined with age, while post-stimulus amplitude enhancement and inter-trial phase coherence increased. These changes affected fronto-parietal electrode sites. Conclusions: The parietal P3 maximum seemed comparable for adolescents and young adults. Detailed analysis revealed that within the P3 time-window brain maturation during adolescence may lead to reduced spontaneous slow-wave oscillations, increased amplitude modulation and time precision of event-related oscillations, and altered P3 scalp topography. Significance: Time-frequency analyses may help to distinguish selective neurodevelopmental changes within the P3 time window. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Association of Common Polymorphisms in the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Alpha4 Subunit Gene with an Electrophysiological Endophenotype in a Large Population-Based Sample	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-STIMULI; RARE TARGET; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; RESPONSE SPEED; CHRNA4 GENE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Variation in genes coding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits affect cognitive processes and may contribute to the genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA4 gene that codes for the alpha4 subunit of alpha4/beta2-containing receptors have previously been implicated in aspects of (mostly visual) attention and smoking-related behavioral measures. Here we investigated the effects of six synonymous but functional CHRNA4 exon 5 SNPs on the N100 event-related potential (ERP), an electrophysiological endophenotype elicited by a standard auditory odd-ball. A total of N = 1,705 subjects randomly selected from the general population were studied with electroencephalography (EEG) as part of the German Multicenter Study on nicotine addiction. Two of the six variants, rs1044396 and neighboring rs1044397, were significantly associated with N100 amplitude. This effect was pronounced in females where we also observed an effect on reaction time. Sequencing of the complete exon 5 region in the population sample excluded the existence of additional/functional variants thatmay be responsible for the observed effects. This is the first large-scale population-based study investigation the effects of CHRNA4 SNPs on brain activitymeasures related to stimulus processing and attention. Our results provide further evidence that common synonymous CHRNA4 exon 5 SNPs affect cognitive processes and suggest that they also play a role in the auditory system. As N100 amplitude reduction is considered a schizophrenia-related endophenotype the SNPs studied here may also be associated with schizophrenia outcome measures.

Despite growing knowledge about the scene representation in these regions, much less is known about the temporal dynamics with which these representations emerge. We conducted two experiments aimed at identifying and characterizing the earliest markers of scene-specific processing. In the first experiment, human participants viewed images of scenes, faces, and everyday objects while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. We found that the first ERP component to evince a significantly stronger response to scenes than the other categories was the P2, peaking similar to 220 ms after stimulus onset. To establish that the P2 component reflects scene-specific processing, in the second experiment, we recorded ERPs while the participants viewed diverse real-world scenes spanning the following three global scene properties: spatial expanse (open/closed), relative distance (near/far), and naturalness (man-made/natural). We found that P2 amplitude was sensitive to these scene properties at both the categorical level, distinguishing between open and closed natural scenes, as well as at the single-image level, reflecting both computationally derived scene statistics and behavioral ratings of naturalness and spatial expanse. Together, these results establish the P2 as an ERP marker for scene processing, and demonstrate that scene-specific global information is available in the neural response as early as 220 ms.

This is normally obtained by first extracting features from the voltage amplitudes recorded via EEG at different channels and then feeding them into a classifier. In this paper we evaluate the relative benefits of using the first order temporal derivatives of the EEG signals, not the EEG signals themselves, as inputs to the BCI: an area that has not been thoroughly examined. Specifically, we compare the classification performance of features extracted from the first derivative, with those derived from the amplitude, as well as their combination using data from a P300-based BCI mouse. Features were selected based on the absolute difference of medians of the target and non-target classes. Classification was carried out by an ensemble of linear support vector machines which were optimised using the mutual information criterion. Comparisons were based on the area under the receiver operating characteristics. The Mann-Whitney one-tailed test was used to study significance. Results show that EEG amplitudes are outperformed by both the first derivative and the combined feature vector and that derivatives are better than the combined vector.

Traditional neurophysiological investigations of emotion typically feature the six basic emotions with happiness as the lone positive exemplar. Here we studied how event-related potentials (ERPs) might differentiate between two positive emotional expressions: happiness and pride, and if so, at what time interval. Furthermore, given divergent findings in the ERP literature with respect to viewing emotional expressions, we explicitly examined how task type modulates neurophysiological responses when the same stimuli are viewed. While a continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, 20 healthy participants completed two tasks: an implicit task where participants judged whether or not a face featured a brown spot (freckle), and an explicit task where they judged the face as portraying a "happy," "proud," or "neutral" expression. Behavioral performance exceeded 90% accuracy on both tasks. In the explicit task, participants responded faster and more accurately for Happy compared to Proud and Neutral expressions. Neurophysiologically, amplitudes for N170, VPP and P250 ERPs differentiated emotional from neutral expressions, but not from each other. In contrast, the late SPW component significantly differentiated Happy and Proud expressions from each other. Moreover, main effects of Task were found for the VPP, P250, LPP and SPW; additionally, Emotion X Task interactions were observed for P250 and SPW. Our data stress that task demands may magnify or diminish neural processing differences between emotion categories, which therefore cannot be disentangled with a single experimental paradigm. Additionally, some ERP differences may also reflect variations in categorization difficulty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previously we have found that a between-subjects manipulation of judgment instructions resulted in different manipulability-related memory biases in an incidental memory test. To better understand this effect we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants made judgments about images of objects that were either high or low in functional manipulability (e.g., hammer vs. ladder). Using a between-subjects design, participants judged whether they had seen the object recently (Personal Experience), or could manipulate the object using their hand (Functionality). We focused on the P300 and slow-wave event related potentials (ERPs) as reflections of attentional allocation. In both groups, we observed higher P300 and slow wave amplitudes for high-manipulability objects at electrodes Pz and C3. As P300 is thought to reflect bottom upattentional processes, this may suggest that the processing of high-manipulability objects recruited more attentional resources. Additionally, the P300 effect was greater in the Functionality group. A more complex pattern was observed at electrode C3 during slow wave: processing the high-manipulability objects in the Functionality instruction evoked a more positive slow wave than in the other three conditions, likely related to motor simulation processes. These data provide neural evidence that effects of manipulability on stimulus processing are further mediated by automatic vs. deliberate motor-related processing.

However, most of the ERP based lie detection systems focus on the features of ERPs from few channels. In this study, we designed a multi-channel ERP based brain computer interface (BCI) system for lie detection. Based on this, two new EEG feature selection approaches, bootstrapped geometric difference (BGD) and network analysis were proposed and applied to feature recognition and classification system. Unlike other methods, our approaches focus on the changes of EEGs from different brain regions and the correlation between them. For the test, we focus on visual and auditory stimuli, two groups of subjects went through the test and their EEGs were recorded. For all subjects, BGD of the P300 for all the scalp electrodes combined with SVM classifier showed the average rate of recognition accuracy was 84.4% and 82.2% for visual and auditory modality respectively. Statistical analysis of network features indicated the difference in the two groups were significant and the average accuracy rate reached 88.7% and 83.5% respectively, and the guilty group showed more obvious small-world property than innocent group. The results suggest the BGD and network analysis based approaches combined with SVM are efficient for ERP based expert and intelligent system for detection and evaluation of deception. The combination of these methods and other feature selection approaches can promote the development and application of ERP based lie detection system.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Whitmore, NW; Lin, SC				Whitmore, Nathan W.; Lin, Shih-Chieh			Unmasking local activity within local field potentials (LFPs) by removing distal electrical signals using independent component analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Movement artifact; Gamma oscillation; Basal forebrain; Event-related potential; 1/f power spectrum; Functional connectivity	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BLIND SEPARATION; EEG; STATISTICS; INTERFACE; ARTIFACTS; ELECTRODE; DYNAMICS; MUSCLES; ORIGIN	Local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly thought to reflect the aggregate dynamics in local neural circuits around recording electrodes. However, we show that when LFPs are recorded in awake behaving animals against a distal reference on the skull as commonly practiced, LFPs are significantly contaminated by non-local and non-neural sources arising from the reference electrode and from movement-related noise. In a data set with simultaneously recorded LFPs and electroencephalograms (EEGs) across multiple brain regions while rats perform an auditory oddball task, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify signals arising from electrical reference and from volume-conducted noise based on their distributed spatial pattern across multiple electrodes and distinct power spectral features. These sources of distal electrical signals collectively accounted for 23-77% of total variance in unprocessed LFPs, as well as most of the gamma oscillation responses to the target stimulus in EEGs. Gamma oscillation power was concentrated in volume-conducted noise and was tightly coupled with the onset of licking behavior, suggesting a likely origin of muscle activity associated with body movement or orofacial movement. The removal of distal signal contamination also selectively reduced correlations of LFP/EEG signals between distant brain regions but not within the same region. Finally, the removal of contamination from distal electrical signals preserved an event-related potential (ERP) response to auditory stimuli in the frontal cortex and also increased the coupling between the frontal ERP amplitude and neuronal activity in the basal forebrain, supporting the conclusion that removing distal electrical signals unmasked local activity within LFPs. Together, these results highlight the significant contamination of LFPs by distal electrical signals and caution against the straightforward interpretation of unprocessed LFPs. Our results provide a principled approach to identify and remove such contamination to unmask local LFPs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Horowitz-Kraus, T				Horowitz-Kraus, Tzipi			Improvement of the Error-detection Mechanism in Adults with Dyslexia Following Reading Acceleration Training	DYSLEXIA			English	Article						dyslexia; error-related negativity; correct-related negativity; error-detection mechanism; fluency; reading; training	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; SKILLED READERS; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; NEGATIVITY; CHILDREN; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	The error-detection mechanism aids in preventing error repetition during a given task. Electroencephalography demonstrates that error detection involves two event-related potential components: error-related and correct-response negativities (ERN and CRN, respectively). Dyslexia is characterized by slow, inaccurate reading. In particular, individuals with dyslexia have a less active error-detection mechanism during reading than typical readers. In the current study, we examined whether a reading training programme could improve the ability to recognize words automatically (lexical representations) in adults with dyslexia, thereby resulting in more efficient error detection during reading. Behavioural and electrophysiological measures were obtained using a lexical decision task before and after participants trained with the reading acceleration programme. ERN amplitudes were smaller in individuals with dyslexia than in typical readers before training but increased following training, as did behavioural reading scores. Differences between the pre-training and post-training ERN and CRN components were larger in individuals with dyslexia than in typical readers. Also, the error-detection mechanism as represented by the ERN/CRN complex might serve as a biomarker for dyslexia and be used to evaluate the effectiveness of reading intervention programmes.

Methods: We tested whether cortical sources of resting state EEG rhythms are abnormal in MS patients and differ between MS phenotypes. Resting state eyes-closed EEG activity was recorded in 36 RR, 23 SP, and 41 matched healthy subjects. EEG bands of interest were individually identified based on Transition frequency (TF), Individual alpha frequency (IAF), and Individual beta frequency (IBF). LORETA freeware estimated cortical EEG sources. Results: Widespread TF -4 Hz (delta) and IAF (alpha) cortical sources were abnormal in the MS sub-groups compared to the control group. Furthermore, TF -4 Hz sources in central, parietal, and limbic regions were higher in amplitude in the SP compared to the RR sub-group. Conclusion: Cortical sources of resting state EEG rhythms are abnormal in MS patients at group level and differ between RR and SP sub-groups. Significance: Future studies should test the utility of these EEG markers in the diagnosis and management of MS clinical phenotypes and in the therapy evaluation.

J	Siemann, J; Herrmann, M; Galashan, D				Siemann, Julia; Herrmann, Manfred; Galashan, Daniela			fMRI-constrained source analysis reveals early top-down modulations of interference processing using a flanker task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Early selection; Late selection; N200; ACC; Spatial attention; Source analysis; fMRI	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; NEURAL MECHANISMS; STRATEGIC CONTROL; ATTENTION; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION; TARGET	Usually, incongruent flanker stimuli provoke conflict processing whereas congruent flankers should facilitate task performance. Various behavioral studies reported improved or even absent conflict processing with correctly oriented selective attention. In the present study we attempted to reinvestigate these behavioral effects and to disentangle neuronal activity patterns underlying the attentional cueing effect taking advantage of a combination of the high temporal resolution of Electroencephalographic (EEG) and the spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data from 20 participants were acquired in different sessions per method. We expected the conflict-related N200 event-related potential (ERP) component and areas associated with flanker processing to show validity-specific modulations. Additionally, the spatio-temporal dynamics during cued flanker processing were examined using an fMRI-constrained source analysis approach. In the ERP data we found early differences in flanker processing between validity levels. An early centro-parietal relative positivity for incongruent stimuli occurred onlywith valid cueing during the N200 time window, while a subsequent fronto-central negativity was specific to invalidly cued interference processing. The source analysis additionally pointed to separate neural generators of these effects. Regional sources in visual areas were involved in conflict processing with valid cueing, while a regional source in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) seemed to contribute to the ERP differences with invalid cueing. Moreover, the ACC and precentral gyrus demonstrated an early and a late phase of congruency-related activity differences with invalid cueing. We discuss the first effect to reflect conflict detection and response activation while the latter more likely originated from conflict monitoring and control processes during response competition.

In particular, inter-trial reaction time variability has been the subject of considerable research. It has been claimed to be a strong biomarker of attention deficits, increases with frontal dysfunction, and predicts age-related cognitive decline. Thus, rather than being just a consequence of noise in the system, it appears to be under the control of a mechanism that breaks down under certain pathological conditions. Although the underlying mechanism is still an open question, consensual hypotheses are emerging regarding the neural correlates of reaction time inter-trial intra-individual variability. Sensory processing, in particular, has been shown to covary with reaction time, yet the spatio-temporal profile of the moment-to-moment variability in sensory processing is still poorly characterized. The goal of this study was to characterize the intra-individual variability in the time course of single-trial visual evoked potentials and its relationship with inter trial reaction time variability. For this, we chose to take advantage of the high temporal resolution of the electroencephalogram (EEG) acquired while participants were engaged in a 2-choice reaction time task. We studied the link between single trial event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction time using two different analyses: (1) time point by time point correlation analyses thereby identifying time windows of interest; and (2) correlation analyses between single trial measures of peak latency and amplitude and reaction time. To improve extraction of single trial [RP measures related with activation of the visual cortex, we used an independent component analysis (ICA) procedure. Our FRP analysis revealed a relationship between the N1 visual evoked potential and reaction time. The earliest time point presenting a significant correlation of its respective amplitude with reaction time occurred 175 ms after stimulus onset, just after the onset of the N1 peak. Interestingly, single trial N1 latency correlated significantly with reaction time, while N1 amplitude did not. In conclusion, our findings suggest that inter-trial variability in the timing of extrastriate visual processing contributes to reaction time variability.

One of the commonly faced problems in EEG recordings is the presence of artifacts that come from sources other than brain and contaminate the acquired signals significantly. Therefore, much research over the past 15 years has focused on identifying ways for handling such artifacts in the preprocessing stage. However, this is still an active area of research as no single existing artifact detection/removal method is complete or universal. This article presents an extensive review of the existing state-of-the-art artifact detection and removal methods from scalp EEG for all potential EEG-based applications and analyses the pros and cons of each method. First, a general overview of the different artifact types that are found in scalp EEG and their effect on particular applications are presented. In addition, the methods are compared based on their ability to remove certain types of artifacts and their suitability in relevant applications (only functional comparison is provided not performance evaluation of methods). Finally, the future direction and expected challenges of current research is discussed.

We proposed that operant conditioning of EEG in neurofeedback mode can be accompanied by changes in the relative power of EEG bands. However, the details on the change of the relative power of EEG bands during neurofeedback training course in autism are not yet well explored. In this study, we analyzed the EEG recordings of children diagnosed with autism and enrolled in a prefrontal neurofeedback treatment course. The protocol used in this training was aimed at increasing the ability to focus attention, and the procedure represented the wide band EEG amplitude suppression training along with upregulation of the relative power of gamma activity. Quantitative EEG analysis was completed for each session of neurofeedback using wavelet transform to determine the relative power of gamma and theta/beta ratio, and further to detect the statistical changes within and between sessions. We found a linear decrease of theta/beta ratio and a liner increase of relative power of gamma activity over 18 weekly sessions of neurofeedback in 18 high functioning children with autism. The study indicates that neurofeedback is an effective method for altering EEG characteristics associated with the autism spectrum disorder. Also, it provides information about specific changes of EEG activities and details the correlation between changes of EEG and neurofeedback indexes during the course of neurofeedback. This pilot study contributes to the development of more effective approaches to EEG data analysis during prefrontal neurofeedback training in autism.

Here we describe the properties of articulation-related artifacts and propose a novel correction procedure. Experiment 1 co-recorded ERPs and trajectories of the articulators with an electromagnetic articulograph from a single participant. The generalization of the findings from the single participant to standard picture naming was investigated in Experiment 2. Both experiments provided evidence that articulation-induced artifacts may start up to 300 ms or more prior to voice onset or voice key onset-depending on the specific measure; they are highly similar in topography across many different phoneme patterns and differ mainly in their time course and amplitude. ERPs were separated from articulation-related artifacts with residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). After obtaining the artifact-free ERPs, their correlations with the articulatory trajectories dropped near to zero. Artifact removal with independent component analysis was less successful; while correlations with the articulatory movements remained substantial, early components prior to voice onset were attenuated in reconstructed ERPs. These findings offer new insights into the nature of articulation artifacts; together with RIDE as method for artifact removal the present report offers a fresh perspective for ERP studies requiring overt articulation.

Infant Cries Rattle Adult Cognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASE SCRIPT KNOWLEDGE; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; TEMPORAL COURSE; ATTENTION; BRAIN; ERP; CONFLICT; MOTHERS	The attention-grabbing quality of the infant cry is well recognized, but how the emotional valence of infant vocal signals affects adult cognition and cortical activity has heretofore been unknown. We examined the effects of two contrasting infant vocalizations (cries vs. laughs) on adult performance on a Stroop task using a cross-modal distraction paradigm in which infant distractors were vocal and targets were visual. Infant vocalizations were presented before (Experiment 1) or during each Stroop trial (Experiment 2). To evaluate the influence of infant vocalizations on cognitive control, neural responses to the Stroop task were obtained by measuring electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in Experiment 1. Based on the previously demonstrated existence of negative arousal bias, we hypothesized that cry vocalizations would be more distracting and invoke greater conflict processing than laugh vocalizations. Similarly, we expected participants to have greater difficulty shifting attention from the vocal distractors to the target task after hearing cries vs. after hearing laughs. Behavioral results from both experiments showed a cry interference effect, in which task performance was slower with cry than with laugh distractors. Electrophysiology data further revealed that cries more than laughs reduced attention to the task (smaller P200) and increased conflict processing (larger N450), albeit differently for incongruent and congruent trials. Results from a correlation analysis showed that the amplitudes of P200 and N450 were inversely related, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between attention and conflict processing. The findings suggest that cognitive control processes contribute to an attention bias to infant signals, which is modulated in part by the valence of the infant vocalization and the demands of the cognitive task. The findings thus support the notion that infant cries elicit a negative arousal bias that is distracting; they also identify, for the first time, the neural dynamics underlying the unique influence that infant cries and laughs have on cognitive control.

J	Washizawa, Y				Washizawa, Yoshikazu			Discriminative Metric Learning on Extended Grassmann Manifold for Classification of Brain Signals	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						brain computer interface (BCI); event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD); common spatial patterns (CSP); Grass-mann manifold; Mahalanobis distance	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FILTERS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure the brain signal from spatially-distributed electrodes. In order to detect event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD), which are utilized for brain-computer/machine interfaces (BCI/BMI), spatial filtering techniques are often used. Common spatial potential (CSP) filtering and its extensions which are the spatial filtering methods have been widely used for BCIs. CSP transforms brain signals that have a spatial and temporal index into vectors via a covariance representation. However, the variance-covariance structure is essentially different from the vector space, and not all the information can be transformed into an element of the vector structure. Grassmannian embedding methods, therefore, have been proposed to utilize the variance-covariance structure of variational patterns. In this paper, we propose a metric learning method to classify the brain signal utilizing the covariance structure. We embed the brain signal in the extended Grassmann manifold, and classify it on the manifold using the proposed metric. Due to this embedding, the pattern structure is fully utilized for the classification. We conducted an experiment using an open benchmark dataset and found that the proposed method exhibited a better performance than CSP and its extensions.

Here we report an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm for detecting a hierarchy of auditory processes in a group of healthy individuals and patients with disorders of consciousness. Simple cortical responses to sounds were observed in all 16 patients; 7/16 (44%) patients exhibited markers of the differential processing of speech and noise; and 1 patient produced evidence of the semantic processing of speech (i.e. the N400 effect). In several patients, the level of auditory processing that was evident from ERPs was higher than the abilities that were evident from behavioural assessment, indicating a greater sensitivity of ERPs in some cases. However, there were no differences in auditory processing between VS and MCS patient groups, indicating a lack of diagnostic specificity for this paradigm. Reliably detecting semantic processing by means of the N400 effect in passively listening single-subjects is a challenge. Multiple assessment methods are needed in order to fully characterise the abilities of patients with disorders of consciousness. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Motor System Activation Predicts Goal Imitation in 7-Month-Old Infants	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						social cognition; imitation; infancy; neural mirroring	SELECTIVELY REPRODUCE; DORSAL PREMOTOR; OTHERS; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; OBJECT	The current study harnessed the variability in infants' neural and behavioral responses as a novel method for evaluating the potential relations between motor system activation and social behavior. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity as 7-month-old infants observed and responded to the actions of an experimenter. To determine whether motor system activation predicted subsequent imitation behavior, we assessed event-related desynchronization (ERD) at central sites during action observation as a function of subsequent behavior. Greater mu desynchronization over central sites was observed when infants subsequently reproduced the experimenter's goal than when they did not reproduce the goal and instead selected the nongoal object. We also found that mu desynchronization during action execution predicted the infants' later propensity to reproduce the experimenter's goal-directed behavior. These results provide the first evidence that motor system activation predicts the imitation of other individuals' goals during infancy.

Optimized FPGA based continuous wavelet transform	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						CWT; EEG; ERP; FPGA; Optimization	TIME-SERIES; COHERENCE; IMPLEMENTATION	A memory efficient field programmable gate array (FPGA) method is described that facilitates the processing of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) arithmetic operations. The CWT computations were performed in Fourier space and implemented on FPGA following several optimization schemes. First, the adapted wavelet function was stored in a lookup table instead of computing the equation each time. Second, the utilization of FPGA memory was highly optimized by only storing the nonzero values of the wavelet function. This reduces 89% of the memory storage and allows fitting the entire design into the FPGA. Third, the design decreases the number of multiplications and shortens the time to produce the CWT coefficients. The proposed design was tested using EEG data and demonstrated to be suitable for extracting features from the event related potentials.

Psychiatric classifications conceptualize ADs as distinct entities, with strong support from neuroscience fields. Yet, comorbidity and pharmacological response suggest a single "serotonin dysfunction" dimension. Whether AD is one or several disorders goes beyond academic quarrels, and the distinction has therapeutic relevance. Addressing the underlying dysfunctions should improve treatment response. By its own nature, neurophysiology can be the best tool to address dysfunctional processes. Purpose: To search for neurophysiological dysfunctions and differences among panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia-social-specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: A sample population of 192 unmedicated patients and 30 aged-matched controls partook in this study. Hypothesis-related neurophysiological variables were combined into ten independent factors: 1) dysrhythmic patterns, 2) delta, 3) theta, 4) alpha, 5) beta (whole-head absolute power z-scores), 6) event-related potential (ERP) combined latency, 7) ERP combined amplitude (z-scores), 8) magnitude, 9) site, and 10) site of hyperactive networks. Combining single variables into representative factors was necessary because, as in all real-life phenomena, the complexity of interactive processes cannot be addressed through single variables and the multiplicity of potentially implicated variables would demand an extremely large sample size for statistical analysis. Results: The nonparametric analysis correctly classified 81% of the sample. Dysrhythmic patterns, decreased delta, and increased beta differentiated AD from controls. Shorter ERP latencies were found in several individual patients, mostly from the OCD group. Hyperactivities were found at the right frontorbital-striatal network in OCD and at the panic circuit in PD. Conclusions: Our findings support diffuse cortical instability in AD in general, with individual differences in information processing deficits and regional hyperactivities in OCD and PD. Study limitations and the rationale behind the variable selection and combination strategy will be discussed before addressing the therapeutic implications of our findings.

VR/AR goggles) created a revolutionary multimedia genre that is seeking ever-broadening applications and novel natural human interfaces. Adding neuromonitoring and neurofeedback to this genre is expected to introduce a new dimension to user interaction with the cyber-world. This study presents the development of a Neuromonitoring VR/AR Goggle armed with electroencephalo- gram and electrooculogram sensors, programmable milli-Ampere current stimulators and wireless fog/cloud computing support. Beside of its potential use in mitigating cybersickness, this device may have potential applications in augmented cognition ranging from feedback-controlled perceptual training to on-line learning and virtual social interactions. A prototype of the device has been made from a Samsung Gear VR for S6. This study explains its technical design to ensure precision data sampling, synchronous event marking, real-time signal processing and big data cloud computing support. This study also demonstrates the effective-ness in measuring the event-related potentials during a visual oddball experiment.

Recently, subsequent memory effects (SMEs)-the statistical differences in electroencephalography (EEG) signals before or during learning between subsequently remembered and forgotten events D have been found. This finding indicates that EEG signals convey the information relevant to memory performance. In this paper, based on SMEs we propose a computational approach to predict memory performance of an event from EEG signals. We devise a convolutional neural network for EEG, called ConvEEGNN, to predict subsequently remembered and forgotten events from EEG recorded during memory process. With the ConvEEGNN, prediction of memory performance can be achieved by integrating two main stages: feature extraction and classification. To verify the proposed approach, we employ an auditory memory task to collect EEG signals from scalp electrodes. For ConvEEGNN, the average prediction accuracy was 72.07% by using EEG data from pre-stimulus and during-stimulus periods, outperforming other approaches. It was observed that signals from pre-stimulus period and those from during-stimulus period had comparable contributions to memory performance. Furthermore, the connection weights of ConvEEGNN network can reveal prominent channels, which are consistent with the distribution of SME studied previously.

This allows more accurate judgments of others' emotional states, which is crucial to appropriate social interactions. It is known that body expressions effectively convey emotional messages, although fewer studies have examined how this information is combined with the auditory cues. The present study used event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate the interaction between emotional body expressions and vocalizations. We also examined emotional congruency between auditory and visual information to determine how preceding visual context influences later auditory processing. Consistent with prior findings, a reduced N1 amplitude was observed in the audiovisual condition compared to an auditory only condition. While this component was not sensitive to the modality congruency, the P2 was sensitive to the emotionally incompatible audiovisual pairs. Further, the direction of these congruency effects was different in terms of facilitation or suppression based on the preceding contexts. Overall, the results indicate a functionally dissociated mechanism underlying two stages of emotional processing whereby N1 is involved in cross-modal processing, whereas P2 is related to assessing a unifying perceptual content. These data also indicate that emotion integration can be affected by the specific emotion that is presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of neural mechanisms spontaneously evoked by gaps of silence in familiar and newly learned songs	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Musical imagery; Familiarity; Learning; Event-related potentials; EEG	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; WORKING-MEMORY; MUSICAL IMAGERY; AUDITORY IMAGERY; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; ERP; INFORMATION; PITCH	The vast majority of people experience musical imagery, the sensation of reliving a song in absence of any external stimulation. Internal perception of a song can be deliberate and effortful, but also may occur involuntarily and spontaneously. Moreover, musical imagery is also involuntarily used for automatically completing missing parts of music or lyrics from a familiar song. The aim of our study was to explore the onset of musical imagery dynamics that leads to the automatic completion of missing lyrics. High-density electroencephalography was used to record the cerebral activity of twenty healthy volunteers while they were passively listening to unfamiliar songs, very familiar songs, and songs previously listened to for two weeks. Silent gaps inserted into these songs elicited a series of neural activations encompassing perceptual, attentional and cognitive mechanisms (range 100-500 ms). Familiarity and learning effects emerged as early as 100 ms and lasted 400 ms after silence occurred. Although participants reported more easily mentally imagining lyrics in familiar rather than passively learnt songs, the onset of neural mechanisms and the power spectrum underlying musical imagery were similar for both types of songs. This study offers new insights into the musical imagery dynamics evoked by gaps of silence and on the role of familiarity and learning processes in the generation of these dynamics. The automatic and effortless method presented here is a potentially useful tool to understand failure in the familiarity and learning processes of pathological populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Are the neural mechanisms underlying word- and phrase-level combinatorial processing overlapping or distinct? Here, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses were recorded simultaneously during silent reading of Finnish sentences. The experimental conditions included 1) well-formed grammatical sentences (correct condition), 2) sentences containing morphosyntactic violations (adjective noun number agreement violations), 3) morphological violations (incorrect stem allomorph and inflectional suffix combination), and 4) combined violations, containing both morphosyntactic and morphological violations. Signal space and source modeling results showed that morphosyntactic violations elicited a left anterior negativity effect, generated particularly in the left inferior frontal area. Morphological violations elicited a widespread negativity, resembling the N400. The neural sources of this negativity were localized most prominently to the right temporal cortical networks. Furthermore, all violations elicited P600 effects with similar widespread bilateral fronto-temporal neural generators that did not differ between morphosyntactic and morphological conditions. Our findings suggest at least partially distinct subnetworks in the fronto-temporal cortices for morphological and morphosyntactic parsing during the earlier stages of processes (similar to 400 ms post stimulus onset) and shared neural generators for the later processing stages.

The brain activity (optical imaging: functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS; and event-related potentials, ERPs, N200) was monitored when subjects observed interactive situations (human-human, HH; human-animal, HA) with a positive (cooperative), negative (uncooperative) or neutral (no emotional) content. In addition, cortical lateralization (more left or right prefrontal activity) and personality component (Behavioral Activation System, BAS; Behavioral Inhibition System, BIS) effects were explored. Both ERP and fNIRS showed significant brain activity increasing in response to positive and negative compared with neutral interactions for HH and HA. However, some differences were found between HH (more "negative valence" effect) and HA (more "positive valence" effect). Finally BAS and BIS were related respectively to more left (positive conditions) or right (negative conditions) hemispheric activity. These results supported the significance of affective behavior differentiating the species-specific and species-aspecific relationships.

Modifying temporal expectations: Changing cortical responsivity to delayed self-initiated sensations with training	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory attenuation; N1-suppression; Temporal expectation; Corollary discharge; Event-Related Potential (ERP)	COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SENSORY SUPPRESSION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SOUNDS; DEPENDENCE; COMPONENT; ERP; HALLUCINATIONS; ATTENUATION	The perceptual system makes a specific prediction regarding the timing of impending, self-initiated sensations to facilitate the attenuation of these sensations. The current study used electroencephalography to investigate whether temporal expectations can be modified with training. Participants underwent a button-press-for-tone task and evoked responses to the tones were measured. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive repeated exposure (training) to either immediate tones, or tones delayed by 100 ms. Pre-training, N1 amplitude to delayed tones was significantly larger compared to immediate tones. However, while training to the immediate tone maintained a significant difference in N1 amplitude between the immediate and delayed tones post-training, this difference was eliminated when trained to the delayed tone. This suggests that participants' neural expectations regarding the anticipated timing of self-generated sensations can be modified with behavioural training. This result has implications for alleviating the subnormal sensory attenuation which has been observed in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

P3b has been related to consciousness, encoding into memory, and updating of strategic schemata, among others, yet evidence has also been provided for its close relationship with deciding how to respond to the presented stimuli. P3b is large with rarely occurring stimuli and small with frequent ones. Here, we investigate the extent to which this oddball effect depends on selecting and executing responses. Participants pressed one of two keys in response to one of two letters, one of which was presented rarely and one frequently. Information about letter-key mapping was provided by a second stimulus. In different blocks, this mapping stimulus was either constant across trials or varied randomly, and either preceded or followed the letter. The oddball effect was reduced when responses were delayed (by waiting for the constant mapping stimulus following the letter) and was further reduced when responses could not be assigned to the letters (because letters were followed by varying mapping stimuli). This evidence suggests that P3b is closely related to decision processes, possibly reflecting reactivation of stimulus-response links.

Sequential processing in young and older adults in the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ageing; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task; Principal components analysis (PCA); Sequential processing schema	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; EEG; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE	Objective: We recently proposed a sequential processing schema for the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task, based on a principal components analysis (PCA) of event-related potentials (ERPs) from a university student sample. Here we sought to replicate the schema, and use it to explore processing in well-functioning older adults. Methods: We compared behavioural responding and ERPs of 20 independent-living older adults (M-age = 68.2 years) to data from a sex- and handedness-matched group of university students (M-age = 20.4 years). ERPs had substantial latency differences between the groups, and hence were subjected to separate group temporal PCAs. Results: Component latencies were systematically increased in the older group by some 26%, with no significant increase in RT or error rates. Despite some differences in their identified components, each group displayed differential component responsivity to Go versus NoGo; this was reduced in the older participants. Conclusion: The results support our processing schema, and provide insight into the processing stages in well-functioning older adults. Significance: Understanding the perceptual and cognitive processing stages in normal ageing is a prerequisite for research on mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This study may also provide a simple paradigm and schema suitable for further exploration of functionality in ageing. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

However, no studies have explored the neural correlates of this domain in clinical categories involving prodromal stages with different risk levels of conversion to AD. We assessed underlying electrophysiological modulations in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients in the MCI stages of familialADcarrying the mutation E280A of the presenilin-1 gene (MCI-FAD), and healthy controls. Moreover, we compared the behavioral performance and neural correlates of both patient groups. Participants completed a change-detection VSTM task assessing recognition of changes between shapes or shape-color bindings, presented in two consecutive arrays (i.e., study and test) while event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Changes always occurred in the test array and consisted of new features replacing studied features (shape-only) or features swapping across items (shape-color binding). Both MCI and MCI-FAD patients performed worse than controls in the shape-color binding condition. Early electrophysiological activity (100-250 ms) was significantly reduced in both clinical groups, particularly over fronto-central and parieto-occipital regions. However, shape-color binding performance and their reduced neural correlates were similar between MCI and MCI-FAD. Our results support the validity of the VSTM binding test and their neural correlates in the early detection of AD and highlight the importance of studies comparing samples at different risk for AD conversion. The combined analysis of behavioral and ERP data gleaned with the VSTM binding task can offer a valuable memory biomarker for AD.

The effectiveness of a single trial classification is an important step towards online classification of EEG signals. Signals are analyzed by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique, and the last decomposition is used in the feature extraction stage. We investigate different feature extraction methods in order to find out the best method which can be used with colors dataset. These methods are: Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP), Target mean, AutoRegressive and EMD residual. In addition, we propose a new feature selection algorithm, which focuses on selecting the best features by studying the behavior of EEG components that appear due to the introduced color. We introduced a comparison between the classification results of using all extracted features, the results of using the selected features by the proposed algorithm and the results of using the selected features by recursive feature elimination algorithm, which is used by similar study. The proposed algorithm is proved with all the investigated feature extraction methods as the classification accuracies are increased. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used in the classification process. We found that the execution time of using color's stimulus is only 0.23s, which is much less than the time which was required by any other stimulus such as imagery and spelling word presented in the previous researches. The best feature extraction method that gives the highest classification accuracy and can be used with real time BCI systems are Target Mean and EMD residual, as their accuracies are high and the computation time is very low.

It is changed in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The ability to measure and manipulate MMN-like responses in animal models, particularly rodents, would provide an enormous opportunity to learn more about the neurobiology underlying MMN. However, the MMN in humans is a very specific phenomenon: how do we decide which features we should focus on emulating in an animal model to achieve the highest level of translational validity? Here we discuss some of the key features of MMN in humans and summarise the success with which they have been translated into rodent models. Many studies from several different labs have successfully shown that the rat brain is capable of generating deviance detection responses that satisfy of the criteria for the human MMN.

Error-related brain activity dissociates hoarding disorder from obsessive-compulsive disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP); error monitoring; error-related negativity (ERN); hoarding; neurophysiological; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CLINICAL-FEATURES; DECISION-MAKING; TASK-DIFFICULTY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEGATIVITY; CONFLICT; SYMPTOMS; AGE	Background. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with an abnormally large error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological measure of error monitoring in response to performance errors, but it is unclear if hoarding disorder (HD) also shows this abnormality. This study aimed to determine whether the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying error monitoring are similarly compromised in HD and OCD. Method. We used a visual flanker task to assess ERN in response to performance errors in 14 individuals with HD, 27 with OCD, 10 with HD+OCD, and 45 healthy controls (HC). Age-corrected performance and ERN amplitudes were examined using analyses of variance and planned pairwise group comparisons. Results. A main effect of hoarding on ERN (p = 0.031) was observed, indicating ERN amplitudes were attenuated in HD relative to non-HD subjects. A group x age interaction effect on ERN was also evident. In HD-positive subjects, ERN amplitude deficits were significantly greater in younger individuals (r = -0.479, p = 0.018), whereas there were no significant ERN changes with increasing age in OCD and HC participants. Conclusions. The reduced ERN in HD relative to OCD and HC provides evidence that HD is neurobiologically distinct from OCD, and suggests that deficient error monitoring may be a core pathophysiological feature of HD. This effect was particularly prominent in younger HD participants, further suggesting that deficient error monitoring manifests most strongly early in the illness course and/or in individuals with a relatively early illness onset.

Though emotional signals are often conveyed by multiple modalities, how emotional changes in vocal and facial modalities integrate into a unified percept has yet to be directly investigated. To address this issue, we asked participants to detect emotional changes delivered by facial, vocal and facial-vocal expressions while behavioral responses and electroencephalogram were recorded. Behavioral results showed that bimodal emotional changes were detected with higher accuracy and shorter response latencies compared with each unimodal condition. Moreover, the detection of emotional change, regardless of modalities, was associated with enhanced amplitudes in the N2 and P3 component, as well as greater theta synchronization. More importantly, the P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization were larger for the bimodal emotional change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions. The superadditive responses in P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization were both positively correlated with the magnitude of the bimodal superadditivity in accuracy. These behavioral and electrophysiological data consistently illustrated an effect of audiovisual integration during the detection of emotional changes, which is most likely mediated by the P3 activity and theta oscillations in brain responses.

By using the brain signals, we can detect the attention. Based on event-related potential P300 signals, the brainmachine interface enables the users to select the desired letters only by means of attention. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of the P300 signals with single subject to realize a novel information retrieval. In recent years, the collaborative EEG of the multiple subjects has been studied, with which the classification performance to detect attention was remarkably improved. In this paper, we propose the emotional face retrieval with the P300 signals of the multiple subjects. The number of subjects in the multiple subjects condition was 12. As a result, the F-measure value in the single subject condition was 0.618 +/- 0.046 (standard deviation), and in the multiple subjects condition was 0.832. In conclusion, the classification performance of emotional face retrieval can be improved with collaborative P300 signals from multiple subjects. This technique might be applied to life log, computer supported cooperative work and neuromarketing in future.

Using Electrophysiological Measures to Assess the Consumer Acceptability of Smokeless Tobacco Products	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NICOTINE PATCH; EEG CHANGES; ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Adequate evaluation of novel tobacco products must include investigation of consumers' psychological response to such products. Traditionally, subjective scales of product liking have been used to assess consumer acceptability of tobacco products. However, subjective scales may miss cognitive changes that can only be captured by direct neurophysiological assessment. The present investigation explored the viability of using electroencephalography (EEG), in combination with traditional subjective measures, to assess consumer acceptability of five smokeless tobacco products. Given previous work linking product liking to arousal/attentional (executive function) enhancement, we focused on EEG measures of attention/arousal to objectively characterize cognitive changes associated with tobacco product use. During five separate laboratory visits, smokeless tobacco users used Verve discs, Ariva dissolvables, Skoal snuff, Camel snus, or Nicorette lozenges. The N2 and P3b event-related potential components elicited by an oddball task were used to index attentional changes before/after product usage. Additionally, resting state alpha band EEG activity was analyzed before/after product usage to index cortical arousal. Although analyses of the subjective results provided limited inference, analyses of the electrophysiological measures, particularly the alpha suppression measure, revealed robust differences between products. Skoal elicited significantly enhanced alpha suppression compared to all four other products tested. Additionally, alpha suppression was found to correlate positively with subjective measures of satisfaction and psychological reward, but was unrelated to perceived aversion. The present results provide evidence that electrophysiological measures can yield important insights into consumer acceptability of novel tobacco products and are a valuable complement to subjective measures. This study is the first to employ a combination of electrophysiological measures and traditional subjective assays in order to assess the consumer acceptability of smokeless tobacco products. The results highlight the importance of adopting a multidimensional/multi-method approach to studying the consumer acceptability of tobacco products.

The mirror neuron system (MNS) is a potential mechanism underlying simulation of facial expressions, with like neural processes activated both during observation and performance. Research with monkeys and adult humans supports this proposal, but so far there have been no investigations of facial MNS activity early in human development. The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore mu rhythm desynchronization, an index of MNS activity, in 30-month-old children as they observed videos of dynamic emotional and non-emotional facial expressions, as well as scrambled versions of the same videos. We found significant mu desynchronization in central regions during observation and execution of both emotional and non-emotional facial expressions, which was right-lateralized for emotional and bilateral for non-emotional expressions during observation. These findings support previous research suggesting movement simulation during observation of facial expressions, and are the first to provide evidence for sensorimotor activation during observation of facial expressions, consistent with a functioning facial MNS at an early stage of human development.

Auditory Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are useful for understanding early auditory development among infants, as it allows the collection of a relatively large amount of data in a short time. So far, studies that have investigated development in auditory ERPs in infancy have mainly used single sounds as stimuli. Yet in real life, infants must decode successive rather than single acoustic events. In the present study, we tested 4-, 8-, and 12-month-old infants' auditory ERPs to musical melodies comprising three piano notes, and examined ERPs to each individual note in the melody. Methods. Infants were presented with 360 repetitions of a three-note melody while EEG was recorded from 128 channels on the scalp through a Geodesic Sensor Net. For each infant, both latency and amplitude of auditory components P1 and N2 were measured from averaged ERPs for each individual note. Results. Analysis was restricted to response collected at frontal central site. For all three notes, there was an overall reduction in latency for both P1 and N2 over age. For P1, latency reduction was significant from 4 to 8 months, but not from 8 to 12 months. N2 latency, on the other hand, decreased significantly from 4 to 8 to 12 months. With regard to amplitude, no significant change was found for either P1 or N2. Nevertheless, the waveforms of the three age groups were qualitatively different: for the 4-month-olds, the P1-N2 deflection was attenuated for the second and the third notes; for the 8-month-olds, such attenuation was observed only for the middle note; for the 12-month-olds, the P1 and N2 peaks show relatively equivalent amplitude and peak width across all three notes. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that the infant brain is able to register successive acoustic events in a stream, and ERPs become better time-locked to each composite event over age. Younger infants may have difficulties in responding to late occurring events in a stream, and the onset response to the late events may overlap with the incomplete response to preceding events.

J	Jessen, S; Grossmann, T				Jessen, Sarah; Grossmann, Tobias			The developmental emergence of unconscious fear processing from eyes during infancy	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Subliminal processing; Infancy; Emotion; Fear; Eyes; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS; HUMAN AMYGDALA; EARLY FACE; 1ST YEAR; DISCRIMINATION; ATTENTION; GAZE; DISSOCIATION	From early in life, emotion detection plays an important role during social interactions. Recently, 7-month-old infants have been shown to process facial signs of fear in others without conscious perception and solely on the basis of their eyes. However, it is not known whether unconscious fear processing from eyes is present before 7 months of age or only emerges at around 7 months. To investigate this question, we measured 5-month-old infants' event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to subliminally presented fearful and non-fearful eyes and compared these with 7-month-old infants' ERP responses from a previous study. Our ERP results revealed that only 7-month-olds, but not 5-month-olds, distinguished between fearful and non-fearful eyes. Specifically, 7-month-olds' processing of fearful eyes was reflected in early visual processes over occipital cortex and later attentional processes over frontal cortex. This suggests that, in line with prior work on the conscious detection of fearful faces, the brain processes associated with the unconscious processing of fearful eyes develop between 5 and 7 months of age. More generally, these findings support the notion that emotion perception and the underlying brain processes undergo critical change during the first year of life. Therefore, the current data provide further evidence for viewing infancy as a formative period in human socioemotional functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Shen, XB; Wu, Q; Zhao, K; Fu, XL				Shen, Xunbing; Wu, Qi; Zhao, Ke; Fu, Xiaolan			Electrophysiological Evidence Reveals Differences between the Recognition of Microexpressions and Macroexpressions	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						microexpression; macroexpression; recognition; EEG/ERPs; ERSP; sLORETA	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN BRAIN; EMOTION; EEG; FACES; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS	Microexpressions are fleeting facial expressions that are important for judging people's true emotions. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of microexpressions (with duration of less than 200 ms) and macroexpressions (with duration of greater than 200 ms). We used an affective priming paradigm in which a picture of a facial expression is the prime and an emotional word is the target, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine neural activities associated with recognizing microexpressions and macroexpressions. The results showed that there were significant main effects of duration and valence for N170/vertex positive potential. The main effect of congruence for N400 is also significant. Further, sLORETA showed that the brain regions responsible for these significant differences included the inferior temporal gyrus and widespread regions of the frontal lobe. Furthermore, the results suggested that the left hemisphere was more involved than the right hemisphere in processing a microexpression. The main effect of duration for the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was significant, and the theta oscillations (4 to 8 Hz) increased in recognizing expressions with a duration of 40 ms compared with 300 ms. Thus, there are different EEG/ERPs neural mechanisms for recognizing microexpressions compared to recognizing macroexpressions.

Thus far, the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits are not well understood. Previous studies with unisensory stimulation have shown altered neural oscillations in SCZ. As such, altered oscillations could contribute to aberrant multisensory processing in this patient group. To test this assumption, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) study in 15 SCZ and 15 control participants in whom we examined neural oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) in the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI). In the SIFI multiple auditory stimuli that are presented alongside a single visual stimulus can induce the illusory percept of multiple visual stimuli. In SCZ and control participants we compared ERPs and neural oscillations between trials that induced an illusion and trials that did not induce an illusion. On the behavioral level, SCZ (55.7%) and control participants (55.4%) did not significantly differ in illusion rates. The analysis of ERPs revealed diminished amplitudes and altered multisensory processing in SCZ compared to controls around 135 ms after stimulus onset. Moreover, the analysis of neural oscillations revealed altered 2535 Hz power after 100 to 150 ms over occipital scalp for SCZ compared to controls. Our findings extend previous observations of aberrant neural oscillations in unisensory perception paradigms. They suggest that altered ERPs and altered occipital beta/gamma band power reflect aberrant multisensory processing in SCZ.

Methods: Resting state eyes-closed EEG data were recorded before and after 5 months of cART in 48 male HIV subjects, who were naive at the study start. The EEG data were also recorded in 59 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects as a control group. Frequency bands of interest included delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3, based on alpha frequency peak specific to each individual. They also included beta1 (13-20 Hz) and beta2 (20-30 Hz). Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) estimated EEG cortical source activity in frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Results: Before the therapy, the HIV group showed greater parietal delta source activity and lower spatially diffuse alpha source activity compared to the control group. Thus, the ratio of parietal delta and alpha3 source activity served as an EEGmarker. The z-score showed a statistically deviant EEG marker (EEG+) in 50% of the HIV individuals before therapy (p < 0.05). After 5 months of cART, delta source activity decreased, and alpha3 source activity increased in the HIV subjects with EEG+ (about 50% of them showed a normalized EEG marker). Conclusions: This procedure detected a deviant EEG marker before therapy and its post-therapy normalization in naive HIV single individuals. Significance: The parietal delta/alpha3 EEG marker may be used tomonitor cART effects on brain function in such individuals. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, an engaging, gamified ABMT mobile application, or "app," was utilized in 42 (21 females) trait-anxious adults. EEG was recorded during pre- and post-training threat bias assessment to generate scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting neurocognitive responses to threat. Following app play (ABMT versus placebo), subjective anxiety and stress responses (observed and self-reported) were measured. ABMT, versus placebo, resulted in improved behavioral performance during the stress task for females, and in potentiation of the N2 ERP to threat for males, suggesting increased attention control. Training groups did not differ in self-reported anxiety. ABMT also resulted in improved performance during the stress task among those evidencing specific pre-training ERP responses: decreased P1, suggesting less attention allocation, but potentiated N170, suggesting enhanced attention selection and discrimination. Differences in behavioral threat bias did not moderate training effects. Results suggest that efficient allocation of attention to threat combined with enhanced discrimination between threat and non-threat may facilitate stress-reduction effects of ABMT. Targeting neurocognitive responses to threat to personalize ABMT and develop more effective methods of treatment delivery, such as gamification, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrainment to music involves a large network of brain structures, and neural oscillations at beat-related frequencies can help elucidate how this network is connected. Here, we used EEG to investigate steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) during listening and tapping to drum clips with different rhythmic structures that were interrupted by silent breaks of 2-6 sec. This design allowed us to address the question of whether neural entrainment processes persist after the physical presence of musical rhythms and to link neural oscillations and event-related neural responses. During stimulus presentation, SSEPs were elicited in both tasks (listening and tapping). During silent breaks, SSEPs were only present in the tapping task. Notably, the amplitude of the N1 ERP component was more negative after longer silent breaks, and both N1 and SSEP results indicate that neural entrainment was increased when listening to drum rhythms compared with an isochronous metronome. Taken together, this suggests that neural entrainment to music is not solely driven by the physical input but involves endogenous timing processes. Our findings break ground for a tighter linkage between steady-state and transient evoked neural responses in rhythm processing. Beyond music perception, they further support the crucial role of entrained oscillatory activity in shaping sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in general.

Event-related Potentials During Target-response Tasks to Study Cognitive Processes of Upper Limb Use in Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 107; Unilateral Cerebral Palsy; Developmental Disregard; EEG; event-related potentials; target-response task; upper limb control	INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; DEVELOPMENTAL DISREGARD; VALIDITY	Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is a very common cause of disability in childhood. It is characterized by unilateral motor impairments that are frequently dominated in the upper limb. In addition to a reduced movement capacity of the affected upper limb, several children with unilateral CP show a reduced awareness of the remaining movement capacity of that limb. This phenomenon of disregarding the preserved capacity of the affected upper limb is regularly referred to as Developmental Disregard (DD). Different theories have been postulated to explain DD, each suggesting slightly different guidelines for therapy. Still, cognitive processes that might additionally contribute to DD in children with unilateral CP have never been directly studied. The current protocol was developed to study cognitive aspects involved in upper limb control in children with unilateral CP with and without DD. This was done by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from the ongoing EEG during target-response tasks asking for a hand-movement response. ERPs consist of several components, each of them associated with a well-defined cognitive process (e.g., the N1 with early attention processes, the N2 with cognitive control and the P3 with cognitive load and mental effort). Due to its excellent temporal resolution, the ERP technique enables to study several covert cognitive processes preceding overt motor responses and thus allows insight into the cognitive processes that might contribute to the phenomenon of DD.

Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we sought to find ERP components that are predictive of error correction performance during rhythmic movements. Method: Healthy right-handed participants were asked to synchronize their finger taps to a regular tone sequence (every 600ms), while EEG data were continuously recorded. Data from 15 participants were analyzed. Occasional irregularities were built into stimulus presentation timing: 90 ms before (advances: negative shift) or after (delays: positive shift) the expected time point. A tapping condition alternated with a listening condition in which identical stimulus sequence was presented but participants did not tap. Results: Behavioral error correction was observed immediately following a shift, with a degree of over-correction with positive shifts. Our stimulus-locked ERP data analysis revealed, 1) increased auditory N1 amplitude for the positive shift condition and decreased auditory N1 modulation for the negative shift condition; and 2) a second enhanced negativity (N2) in the tapping positive condition, compared with the tapping negative condition. In response-locked epochs, we observed a CNV (contingent negative variation)-like negativity with earlier latency in the tapping negative condition compared with the tapping positive condition. This CNV-like negativity peaked at around the onset of subsequent tapping, with the earlier the peak, the better the error correction performance with the negative shifts while the later the peak, the better the error correction performance with the positive shifts. Discussion: This study showed that the CNV-like negativity was associated with the error correction performance during our sensorimotor synchronization study. Auditory N1 and N2 were differentially involved in negative vs. positive error correction. However, we did not find evidence for their involvement in behavioral error correction. Overall, our study provides the basis from which further research on the role of the CNV in perceptual and motor timing can be developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we used electroencephalography to investigate how aging affects the temporal dynamics of neural adaptation in human auditory cortex. Younger (18-31 years) and older (51-70 years) normal hearing adults listened to tone sequences with varying onset-to-onset intervals. Our results show long-lasting neural adaptation such that the response to a particular tone is a nonlinear function of the extended temporal history of sound events. Most important, aging is associated with multiple changes in auditory cortex; older adults exhibit larger and less variable response magnitudes, a larger dynamic response range, and a reduced sensitivity to temporal context. Computational modeling suggests that reduced adaptation recovery times underlie these changes in the aging auditory cortex and that the extended temporal stimulation has less influence on the neural response to the current sound in older compared with younger individuals. Our human electroencephalography results critically narrow the gap to animal electrophysiology work suggesting a compensatory release from cortical inhibition accompanying hearing loss and aging.

Yet few studies have used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether socially anxious individuals display greater monitoring of their performance and attention to their errors. Similarly, only a few studies have used ERPs to examine how social anxiety is related to processing of performance feedback. Individuals with high (n = 26) and low (n = 28) levels of social anxiety completed a trial-and-error learning task. Self-focus was manipulated using false heart-rate feedback during a random subset of trials. Performance feedback was given using emotional and neutral faces in a positive context (correct = happy face; incorrect = neutral face) and negative context (correct = neutral face; incorrect = disgust face) in order to investigate biased interpretation and attention to feedback. Socially anxious subjects displayed enhanced amplitude of the ERN and CRN, suggesting greater response monitoring, and enhanced Pe amplitude, suggesting greater processing of errors relative to the low social anxiety group. No group differences were observed with respect to feedback processing. Before learning stimulus response mappings in the negative context, the FRN was larger for self-focus compared to standard trials and marginally larger for socially anxious subjects compared to controls. These findings support cognitive models and suggest avenues for future research.

Seventeen autistic children and age-matched typically developing (AMTD), between three to nine years old were evaluated. The diagnostic followed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DMS-IV) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was applied to classify the severity. Cytokine profile was evaluated in plasma using a sandwich type ELISA. Paraclinical events included electroencephalography (EEG) record. Statistical analysis was done to explore significant differences in cytokine profile between autism and AMTD groups and respect clinical and paraclinical parameters. Significant differences were found to IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 cytokines in individuals with autism compared with AMTD (p < 0.05). All autistic patients showed interictalepileptiform activity at EEG, however, only 37.5% suffered epilepsy. There was not a regional focalization of the abnormalities that were detectable with EEG in autistic patients with history of epilepsy. A higher IL-6 level was observed in patients without history of epilepsy with interictalepileptiform activity in the frontal brain region, p < 0.05. In conclusion, peripheral inflammatory markers might be useful as potential biomarkers to predict comorbidities in autism as well as reinforce and aid informed decision-making related to EEG findings in children with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Modern applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography rely heavily on the so-called wet electrodes (e.g. Ag/AgCl electrodes) which require gel application and skin preparation to operate properly. Recently, alternative 'dry' electrodes have been developed to increase ease of use, but they often suffer from higher electrode-skin impedance and signal instability. In the current paper, we have proposed a novel porous ceramic-based 'semi-dry' electrode. The key feature of the semi-dry electrodes is that their tips can slowly and continuously release a tiny amount of electrolyte liquid to the scalp, which provides an ionic conducting path for detecting neural signals. Approach. The performance of the proposed electrode was evaluated by simultaneous recording of the wet and semi-dry electrodes pairs in five classical BCI paradigms: eyes open/closed, the motor imagery BCI, the P300 speller, the N200 speller and the steady-state visually evoked potential-based BCI. Main results. The grand-averaged temporal cross-correlation was 0.95 +/- 0.07 across the subjects and the nine recording positions, and these cross-correlations were stable throughout the whole experimental protocol. In the spectral domain, the semi-dry/wet coherence was greater than 0.80 at all frequencies and greater than 0.90 at frequencies above 10 Hz, with the exception of a dip around 50 Hz (i.e. the powerline noise). More importantly, the BCI classification accuracies were also comparable between the two types of electrodes. Significance. Overall, these results indicate that the proposed semi-dry electrode can effectively capture the electrophysiological responses and is a feasible alternative to the conventional dry electrode in BCI applications.

Whether changes of high-frequency components of event-related responses are related to plasticity in neural recruitment during stabilization of sensory/cognitive mechanisms accompanying aging or are underlying pathological changes remains unknown. The effect of aging on beta (beta 1: 12.5-20; beta 2: 20.5-30 Hz) and gamma (gamma 1: 30.5-49; gamma 2: 52-69 Hz) band components of ERP was studied in an auditory discrimination task (low-frequency and high-frequency tone) at frontal, central, parietal and occipital cortical locations at short latency (post-stimulus interval 0-250 ms; putative sensory processing) and long latency (250-600 ms; putative cognitive) periods. Beta1 component of the short latency period of ERBRs was less affected by age. The betal activity of the long latency period was reduced by age and more widespread than in the short latency period. The aged difference in betal component spread into fronto-parietal regions and was more expressed after high-frequency than after low tone stimulation. Beta2 and gamma amplitudes were higher with progressive age during sensory processing. Reducing regional-process specificity with progressing age characterized tone-dependent beta2 changes during short latency (sensory), but not during long latency (cognitive) processing. Late latency (cognitive) beta2 and gamma activity diminished with age, except for the frontal high tone responses. With increasing age, gamma2 activity was more expressed over the frontal brain areas in high tone discrimination. We concluded that age influenced more the long latency (cognitive) processes than the short latency (sensory) ones.

J	Enke, M; Meyer, P; Flor, H				Enke, Martin; Meyer, Patric; Flor, Herta			From Memory to Attitude: The Neurocognitive Process beyond Euthanasia Acceptance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; OF-LIFE DECISIONS; AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION; IMPLICIT ATTITUDES; TRAIT ANXIETY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SOCIAL COGNITION; SELF-ESTEEM; BRAIN	Numerous questionnaire studies on attitudes towards euthanasia produced conflicting results, precluding any general conclusion. This might be due to the fact that human behavior can be influenced by automatically triggered attitudes, which represent ingrained associations in memory and cannot be assessed by standard questionnaires, but require indirect measures such as reaction times (RT) or electroencephalographic recording (EEG). Event related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG and RT during an affective priming task were assessed to investigate the impact of automatically triggered attitudes and were compared to results of an explicit questionnaire. Explicit attitudes were ambivalent. Reaction time data showed neither positive nor negative associations towards euthanasia. ERP analyses revealed an N400 priming effect with lower mean amplitudes when euthanasia was associated with negative words. The euthanasia-related modulation of the N400 component shows an integration of the euthanasia object in negatively valenced associative neural networks. The integration of all measures suggests a bottom-up process of attitude activation, where automatically triggered negative euthanasia-relevant associations can become more ambiguous with increasing time in order to regulate the bias arising from automatic processes. These data suggest that implicit measures may make an important contribution to the understanding of euthanasia-related attitudes.

This study examined the efficacy of Crocus in patients with amnesic and multi domain MCI (aMCImd). The participants included 17 patients on Crocus and 18 on a waiting list, who were examined with a short neuropsychological battery, MRI 3T, while some patients were examined via 256-channel electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) at baseline and after 12 months. The results showed that patients on Crocus had improved Mini-Mental State Examination scores (p = 0.015), while the control group deteriorated. Also, MRI, EEG, and ERP showed improvement in specific domains. This led us to conclude that Crocus is a good choice for management of aMCImd.

While the cortical dynamics and neuro-modulating influences affecting the transition from wakefulness to sleep is well researched, the assumption has been that individual slow waves, the hallmark of deep sleep, are spontaneously occurring cortical events. By creating event-related potentials from the NIRS recording, time-locked to the onset of thousands of individual slow waves, we show the onset of slow waves is phase-locked to an ongoing oscillation in the NIRS recording. This oscillation stems from the moment to moment fluctuations of light absorption caused by arterial pulsations driven by the heart beat. The same oscillating signal can be detected if the electrocardiogram is time-locked to the onset of the slow wave. The ongoing NIRS oscillation suggests that individual slow wave initiation is dependent on that signal, and not the other way round. However, the precise causal links remain speculative. We propose several potential mechanisms: that the heart-beat or arterial pulsation acts as a stimulus which evokes a down-state; local fluctuations in energy supply may lead to a network effect of hyperpolarization; that the arterial pulsations lead to corresponding changes in the cerebral-spinal-fluid which evokes the slow wave; or that a third neural generator, regulating heart rate and slow waves may be involved.

This phenomenon is thought to result from an efference copy of motor commands used to predict the sensory consequences of an action through a forward model. The present work examined whether attenuation also takes place for visual reafferent signals from the moving limb during voluntary reaching movements. To address this issue, EEG activity was recorded in a condition in which visual feedback of the hand was provided in real time and compared with a condition in which it was presented with a 150-ms delay, thus creating a mismatch between the predicted and actual visual consequences of the movement. Results revealed that the amplitude of the N1 component of the visual event-related potential evoked by hand visual feedback over the parietal cortex was significantly smaller when presented in real time compared with when it was delayed. These data suggest that the cortical processing of visual reafferent signals is attenuated when they are correctly predicted, likely as a result of a forward model.

Imaging studies revealed inconsistent results as to which brain regions are involved in altered performance monitoring in OCD. We investigated performance monitoring in OCD with simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to determine the neural source of the enhanced ERN. METHODS: Concurrent EEG and fMRI data were collected from 20 patients with OCD and 22 healthy control subjects during a flanker task. Independent component analysis was used separately on EEG and fMRI to segment the data functionally and focus on processes of interest. The ERN, hemodynamic responses following errors, and intraindividual correlation of the ERN and blood oxygen level-dependent activity were compared between groups. RESULTS: Patients with OCD showed significantly increased ERN amplitudes. Blood oxygen level-dependent activity in midcingulate cortex was not significantly different between groups. Increased activation of the right amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex following errors was observed in patients with OCD. Increased intraindividual correlation of the ERN and activity of the presupplementary motor area was found in patients with OCD compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Higher error-related activity was found in the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a stronger affective response toward errors in patients with OCD. Additionally, increased correlation of the ERN and presupplementary motor area may indicate stronger recruitment of proactive control in OCD.

While the role of the cortex in reactive balance has been widely explored, only few studies have addressed the cortical activations related to predictive balance control. The present study investigated the cortical activations related to the preparation and execution of anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) that precede a step. This study also examined whether the preparatory cortical activations related to a specific movement is dependent on the context of control (postural component vs. focal component). Ground reaction forces and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 14 healthy adults while they performed lateral weight shift and lateral stepping with and without initially preloading their weight to the stance leg. EEG analysis revealed that there were distinct movement-related potentials (MRPs) with concurrent event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu and beta rhythms prior to the onset of APA and also to the onset of foot-off during lateral stepping in the fronto-central cortical areas. Also, the MRPs and ERD prior to the onset of APA and onset of lateral weight shift were not significantly different suggesting the comparable cortical activations for the generation of postural and focal movements. The present study reveals the occurrence of cortical activation prior to the execution of an APA that precedes a step. Importantly, this cortical activity appears independent of the context of the movement. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Varghese, J. P.; Merino, D. M.; Beyer, K.

The subject counts silently every time when the Chinese character as the targeted stimulus is presented on the display. As a result, when the test data was of the subject A, the percentages of correct answers were 86.0% and 83.0% for the cases in which the character "blue" printed in red and the character "red" printed in blue were presented on the display as the targeted stimuli. On the other hand, the percentages of correct answers were obtained as 79.0% and 69.0% for the cases in which the character "red" printed in red and the character "blue" printed in blue were as the targeted stimuli.

Repeated as well as predicted stimuli trigger suppressed neuronal responses because they are associated with reduced prediction errors. However, many predictable events in our environment are not isolated but sequential, yet there is little empirical evidence documenting how suppressed neuronal responses reflecting reduced prediction errors change in the course of a predictable sequence of events. Here we conceived an auditory electroencephalography (EEG) experiment where prediction persists over series of four tones to allow for the delineation of the dynamics of the suppressed neuronal responses. It is possible that neuronal responses might decrease for the initial predictable stimuli and stay at the same level across the rest of the sequence, suggesting that they reflect the predictability of the stimuli in terms of mere probability. Alternatively, neuronal responses might decrease for the initial predictable stimuli and gradually recover across the rest of the sequence, suggesting that factors other than mere probability have to be considered in order to account for the way prediction is implemented in the brain. We found that initial presentation of the predictable stimuli was associated with suppression of the auditory N1. Further presentation of the predictable stimuli was associated with a rebound of the component's amplitude. Moreover, such pattern was independent of attention. The findings suggest that auditory N1 suppression reflecting reduced prediction errors is a transient phenomenon that can be modulated by multiple factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Twenty participants (10 females; ages 22-31) viewed avatar mouth images depicting grimaces, smiles and open mouth expressions that were presented with and without teeth. A continuous 256 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while subjects completed two tasks: an implicit task evaluating stimulus color and an explicit task evaluating mouth expression valence. Event related potential (ERP) peak amplitudes and latencies and area under the curve (AUC) were measured in individual subject averaged ERPs. Statistical testing revealed a main effect of the presence of Teeth for P100, N170, and vertex positive potential (VPP) amplitudes and for slow positive wave (SPW) AUC. Task by teeth interactions occurred for P250 amplitude, underscoring how explicit task demands can influence neural processing. Arousal ratings co-varied with teeth presence, suggesting that low-level visual features such as teeth may drive the saliency of emotional expressions, and lie at the core of differences in neural processing to different emotional expressions.

Such pre-saccadic attention shifts are usually studied in psychophysical dual task conditions, with a target-discrimination task before saccade onset. Here, we present a novel approach to investigate pre-saccadic attention shifts with the help of event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants executed one or two saccades to color-defined targets while ERPs and eye-movements were recorded. In single-target blocks participants executed a single saccade. In two-targets blocks participants made either a single saccade to one of the targets, or two successive saccades to both targets. Importantly, in two-targets blocks, targets could appear on the same or on opposite sides of the vertical midline. This allowed us to study contra-to-ipsilateral ERP differences (such as the N2pc or PCN) that reflect attention shifts to the targets, prior to saccade onset and during saccades. If pre-saccadic attention shifts to saccade target locations are necessary for saccade execution and if searched-for saccade targets capture attention, there should be enhanced attentional competition (1) between two targets compared to single targets; (2) between two opposite-sides targets compared to two same-side targets; and (3) in two saccades rather than one saccade conditions: More attentional competition was expected to delay saccade latency and to weaken pre-saccadic laterality effects in ERPs. Hypotheses were tested by means of temporally aligned ERPs that were simultaneously time-locked to stimulus onsets, saccade onsets, and saccade offsets. Predictions (1) and (2) were partly and fully confirmed, respectively, but no evidence was found for (3). We explain the implications of our results for the role of attention during saccade preparation, and we point out how temporally aligned ERPs compare to ICA-based electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact correction procedures and to psychophysical dual-task approaches.

Recollection is delayed under changed viewing conditions: A graded effect on the latency of the late posterior component	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Long-term memory; Dual-process models of recognition memory; EEG; ERP-component latency; Evoked potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; FEATURE BINDING; ERP EVIDENCE; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL; DISSOCIATION; ORIENTATION	Object recognition is a central human ability. In everyday life, the conditions under which objects have to be recognized are usually not perfect. Often, viewing conditions change in between two encounters with an object; typical are changes in illumination or in the object-observer distance. With such changes, object recognition sometimes feels slightly delayed. We examined this phenomenon empirically by measuring the latency of the well-established electrophysiological correlate of recollection, the late posterior component (LPC), in an object-recognition task. Although the cognitive processes underlying successful recognition are well examined, thus far the consequences of changed viewing conditions on the timing of these processes have not been investigated. The ERP technique is well suited for investigating this question, because it allows differentiating between processes contributing to recognition times (in particular, recollection from familiarity as indexed by the FN400 component) and measuring their time course with high temporal precision. In the present study, participants' task was to differentiate previously studied (old) objects from a set of new objects. Viewing conditions for old objects changed slightly, changed strongly, or remained identical between learning and test. We found that the latency of the LPC in response to an old object was delayed whenever viewing conditions changed. Moreover, this delay in LPC latency scaled with the size of the change. These effects were absent for the FN400. This is the first examination of effects of changes in viewing conditions on the latency of recollection and the first dissociation of FN400 and LPC latencies.

I Keep a Close Watch on This Heart of Mine: Increased Interoception in Insomnia	SLEEP			English	Article						insomnia disorder; interoception; heartbeat-evoked potential; event-related potential; high-density EEG; hyperarousal; resting state; salience network	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSOMNIA; PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION; COGNITIVE MODEL; SEVERITY INDEX; P300 AMPLITUDE; SLEEP QUALITY; BRAIN; ANXIETY	Study Objectives: Whereas both insomnia and altered interoception are core symptoms in affective disorders, their neural mechanisms remain insufficiently understood and have not previously been linked. Insomnia Disorder (ID) is characterized by sensory hypersensitivity during wakefulness and sleep. Previous studies on sensory processing in ID addressed external stimuli only, but not interoception. Interoceptive sensitivity can be studied quantitatively by measuring the cerebral cortical response to one's heartbeat (heartbeat-evoked potential, HEP). We here investigated whether insomnia is associated with increased interoceptive sensitivity as indexed by the HEP amplitude. Methods: Sixty-four participants aged 21-70 years were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl including 32 people suffering from ID and 32 age-and sex-matched controls without sleep complaints. HEPs were obtained from resting-state high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) recorded during evening wakeful rest in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions of 5-minute duration each. Significance of group differences in HEP amplitude and their topographical distribution over the scalp were assessed by means of cluster-based permutation tests. Results: In particular during EC, and to a lesser extent during EO, people with ID had a larger amplitude late HEP component than controls at frontal electrodes 376-500 ms after the R-wave peak. Source localization suggested increased neural activity time-locked to heartbeats in people with ID mainly in anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortices. Conclusions: People with insomnia show insufficient adaptation of their brain responses to the ever-present heartbeats. Abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in interoceptive awareness including the salience network may be of key importance to the pathophysiology of insomnia.

A reduction in visual short-term memory (vSTM) storage capacity was recently suggested as a potential neuro-cognitive endophenotype, i.e., a testable marker of an individual's liability for developing ADHD. This study aimed at identifying markers of the brain abnormalities underlying vSTM reductions in adult ADHD. We combined behavioral parameter-based assessment with electrophysiology in groups of adult ADHD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Amplitudes of ERP markers of vSTM storage capacity, the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the P3b, were analyzed according to (i) differences between individuals with higher vs. lower storage capacity K and (ii) differences between ADHD patients and control participants. We replicated the finding of reduced storage capacity in adult ADHD. Across groups, individuals with higher relative to lower storage capacity showed a larger CDA and P3b. We further found differences between the patient and control groups in the ERPs: The CDA amplitude was attenuated in an early time window for ADHD patients compared to control participants, and was negatively correlated with ADHD patients' symptom severity ratings. Furthermore, the P3b was larger in ADHD patients relative to control participants. These electrophysiological findings indicate altered brain mechanisms underlying visual storage capacity in ADHD, which are characterized by deficient encoding and maintenance, and increased recruitment of control processes. Accordingly, (quantifiable) ERP markers of vSTM in adult ADHD bear candidacy as neuro-cognitive endophenotypes of the disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Tsc1(+/-) and control mice underwent intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recording at postnatal ages (P) 8 to P33, with linear silicon probe implanted in the somatosensory cortex of one or both hemispheres for 8-24 h. Ictal events were classified visually by independent analyzers; distinct EEG patterns were related to age and analyzed to quantify field potential characteristics and signal dynamics between hemispheres. We collected retrospectively 20 infants with prenatally diagnosed TSC and EEG before seizure onset, and analyzed the electroclinical course of epilepsy, taking into account a first-line treatment by vigabatrin. Results: Spontaneous seizures were disclosed in 55% of Tsc1(+/-) mice at P9-18. Three ictal patterns were identified: from P9 to P12 "spike clusters" consisted of recurring large spikes without clinical correlate; "spasm-like" discharges dominated from P13 to P16 consisting of high amplitude large field potential superimposed with or followed by fast activity repeated every 2-10 s for at least 20 s, accompanied by rhythmic limb contractions; from P14 to P18 a "tonic-clonic like" pattern comprised rhythmic spikes of increasing amplitude with tonic-clonic movements. Early onset "spike clusters" were mainly unilateral, whereas "spasm-like" and "tonic-clonic like" patterns were bilateral. Interhemispheric propagation was significantly faster for "tonic-clonic like" than for "spasm-like" events. In infants diagnosed prenatally with TSC, clusters of sharp waves or spikes preceded the first seizure, and vigabatrin prevented the development of seizures. Patients treated after seizure onset developed spasms or focal seizures that were pharmacoresistant in 66.7% of cases. Significance: Tsc1(+/-) mice pups exhibit an age-dependent seizure pattern sequence mimicking early human TSC epilepsy features. Spike clusters before seizure onset in TSC should be considered as a first stage of epilepsy reinforcing the concept of preventive antiepileptic therapy.

In the present report we tested the hypothesis that the emotional modulation of the N170 may be driven by the perceived emotional arousal of the stimuli, rather than by specific emotional categories. Fifty-four participants viewed facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear and happiness, plus low arousal neutral faces. All emotional categories were matched in arousal, while stimuli within each category varied parametrically in this dimension. The modulation of the electrocortical activity on the N170 time-window was analyzed in the time domain and via time-frequency decomposition. The effects of emotion and arousal were analyzed separately. In the time domain N170 amplitudes co-varied parametrically with perceived arousal, regardless of emotional category. This modulation was linearly associated with the power of the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Moreover, fear was associated with a trend for increased N170 amplitudes, enhanced alpha power, and increased broad band inter-trial phase coherence. These results support the views that a) the activity in N170 time window is fundamentally modulated by perceived arousal, b) the modulation of the N170 may be the product of an increased evoked response, rather than the result of phase resetting processes, and c) facial expressions of fear retain some processing primacy, that may be related to their increased value as environmental cues.

Method: Thirty-eight children with DD and 25 TD children participated in a visual-auditory oddball paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by standard and deviant stimuli in an early (100-190 ms) and late (560-750 ms) time window were analysed. Results: In the early time window, ERPs elicited by the deviant stimulus were delayed and less left lateralized over fronto-temporal electrodes for children with DD compared to TD children. In the late time window, children with DD showed higher amplitudes extending more over right frontal electrodes. Longer latencies in the early time window and stronger right hemispheric activation in the late time window were associated with slower reading and naming speed. Additionally, stronger right hemispheric activation in the late time window correlated with poorer phonological awareness skills. Conclusions: Deficits in early stages of letter-sound processing influence later more explicit cognitive processes during letter-sound processing. Significance: Identifying the neurophysiological correlates of letter-sound processing and their relation to reading related skills provides insight into the degree of automaticity during letter-sound processing beyond behavioural measures of letter-sound-knowledge.

This study examined predictability effect on N400 in aphasic patients to determine if the properties of N400 are suited to indexing the severity of reading comprehension deficits. Patients with aphasia were divided into high and low ability groups based on scores on the reading comprehension subtest in the Chinese Concise Aphasia Test (CCAT). The two aphasia groups, a group of healthy elders who were age-matched to the aphasic participants, and a group of young adults, were requested to read sentences that either ended with highly predictable words or unexpected but plausible words, while undergoing electroencephalography (EEG). The young adult and healthy elderly groups exhibited the typical centro-parietal distributed effect of predictability on N400; however, healthy elders exhibited a reduced N400 effect in a delayed time window compared to the young adults. Compared with the elderly control, the high ability aphasia group exhibited a comparable N400 effect in a more restricted time window; by contrast, the low ability aphasia group exhibited a frontal distributed N400 in a much later time window (400-700 ms). These data suggest that the severity of reading comprehension deficits affects predictability effect on a set of N400 characteristics (i.e., amplitude, time window, and topographic distribution), which may be effective as ERP signatures in the evaluation of language recovery in aphasia.

Perception of hand movement by mirror reflection evokes brain activation in the motor cortex contralateral to a non-moving hand	CORTEX			English	Article						Mirror visual feedback; Visual perception; Motor cortex; Event related potential; Lateralized readiness potential	VISUAL FEEDBACK; REACTION-TIME; EXCITABILITY; PAIN; REHABILITATION; MODULATION; READINESS; THERAPY	We investigated whether perception of hand movement via mirror reflection evokes activation in the motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the non-moving hand (the M1 ipsilateral to the moving hand). Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 14 participants while they performed unimanual extension-flexion hand movements in direct view and mirror view conditions. We measured the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) as a marker of M1 activation in both conditions. Both the direct and mirror view conditions produced LRPs, with the mirror view conditions revealing clear activation in M1 contralateral to the non-moving hand (ipsilateral to the moving hand) during both flexion and extension phases. This unambiguous demonstration of M1 activation in association with a non-moving hand (which is visually-perceived as moving), suggests that perception of movement can directly lead to M1 activation.

We recorded multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy younger and older adults in a Go/NoGo task, and examined the aging effects on synchronous brain networks with graph theoretical analysis. We found that in both age groups, brain networks in theta, alpha or beta band for either response execution (Go) or response inhibition (NoGo) condition showed prominent small-world property. Furthermore, small-world property of brain networks showed significant differences between different task conditions. Further analyses of node degree suggested that frontal-central theta band phase synchrony was enhanced during response inhibition, whereas during response execution, increased phase synchrony was observed in beta band over central-parietal regions. More interestingly, these task-related modulations on brain networks were well preserved and even more robust in older adults compared with younger adults. Taken together, our findings not only suggest that response control involves synchronous brain networks in functionally-distinct frequency bands, but also indicate an increase in the recruitment of brain network resources due to normal aging.

Understanding the cerebral processes that are involved in such faking can be useful in detection and prevention of deception. Previous research shows that faking a brief implicit association test (BIAT) evokes a characteristic ERP response. It is not yet known whether temporarily available self-control resources moderate this response. We randomly assigned 22 participants (15 females, 24.23 +/- 2.91 years old) to a counterbalanced repeated-measurements design. Participants first completed a Brief-IAT (BIAT) on doping attitudes as a baseline measure and were then instructed to fake a negative doping attitude both when self-control resources were depleted and non-depleted. Cerebral activity during BIAT performance was assessed using high-density EEG. Results: Compared to the baseline BIAT, event-related potentials showed a first interaction at the parietal P1, while significant post hoc differences were found only at the later occurring late positive potential. Here, significantly decreased amplitudes were recorded for 'normal' faking, but not in the depletion condition. In source space, enhanced activity was found for 'normal' faking in the bilateral temporoparietal junction. Behaviorally, participants were successful in faking the BIAT successfully in both conditions. Conclusions: Results indicate that temporarily available self-control resources do not affect overt faking success on a BIAT. However, differences were found on an electrophysiological level. This indicates that while on a phenotypical level self-control resources play a negligible role in deliberate test faking the underlying cerebral processes are markedly different.

Participants read fully correct sentences, sentences containing a semantic violation and "sentences" in which the order of the words was randomized. At the target word level, fixations on semantically unrelated words elicited a lower-beta band (13-18 Hz) desynchronization. At the sentence level, gamma power (31-55 Hz) increased linearly for syntactically correct sentences, but not when the order of the words was randomized. In the 300-900 ms time window after sentence onsets, theta power (4-7 Hz) was greater for syntactically correct sentences as compared to sentences where no syntactic structure was preserved (random words condition). We interpret our results as conforming with a recently formulated predictive coding framework for oscillatory neural dynamics during sentence-level language comprehension. Additionally, we discuss how our results relate to previous findings with serial visual presentation vs. self-paced reading.

Acute effects of BZP, TFMPP and the combination of BZP and TFMPP in comparison to dexamphetamine on an auditory oddball task using electroencephalography: a single-dose study	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						BZP; TFMPP; Combination of BZP and TFMPP; Human ERP; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; H-3 NORADRENALINE RELEASE; SEROTONIN RELEASE; D-AMPHETAMINE; P300; 1-BENZYLPIPERAZINE; INHIBITION; DOPAMINE; DRUGS; MDMA	Piperazine-based designer drugs such as benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) have been marketed and sold as legal alternatives to dexamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) until 2008 in New Zealand. When administered in combination, BZP + TFMPP have been reported to produce drug-drug synergism in rodents by stimulating the release of dopamine and serotonin. This study was to evaluate the acute event-related potential effects of BZP, TFMPP or the combination of BZP + TFMPP compared with dexamphetamine in young healthy male adults. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of BZP, TFMPP, the combination of BZP + TFMPP, and dexamphetamine on the event-related potentials during an auditory oddball task. Healthy, right-handed males were given a single oral dose of either BZP (200 mg), TFMPP (60 mg), a combination of BZP + TFMPP (100/30 mg), dexamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (lactose) and tested both before and 120 min after drug administration. A single dose of either TMFPP (t = -2.29, p = 0.03) or dexamphetamine (t = -2.33, p = 0.02) significantly reduced the P300 amplitude. A similar trend was also found in BZP. In contrast, BZP and TFMPP in combination has no effect. Neither P300 latency nor the mean reaction time was affected by any of the drug treatments. In addition, neither the P100 nor the P200 component was significantly affected following any of the drug treatments. A single oral dose of BZP or TFMPP, but not the combination of BZP/TFMPP, affected auditory sensory-evoked P300 potential in a manner similar to dexamphetamine.

A study of the electro-haemodynamic coupling using simultaneously acquired intracranial EEG and fMRI data in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; BOLD; fMRI; Electro-haemodynamic coupling; Sharp wave	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BOLD FMRI; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FIRING PATTERNS; NEGATIVE BOLD; SHARP WAVES; SIGNAL; RESPONSES	In current fMRI studies designed to map BOLD changes related to interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), which are recorded on simultaneous EEG, the information contained in the morphology and field extent of the EEG events is exclusively used for their classification. Usually, a BOLD predictor based on IED onset times alone is constructed, effectively treating all events as identical. We used intracranial EEG (icEEG)-fMRI data simultaneously recorded in humans to investigate the effect of including any of the features: amplitude, width (duration), slope of the rising phase, energy (area under the curve), or spatial field extent (number of contacts over which the sharp wave was observed) of the fast wave of the IED (the sharp wave), into the BOLD model, to better understand the neurophysiological origin of sharp wave-related BOLD changes, in the immediate vicinity of the recording contacts. Among the features considered, the width was the only one found to explain a significant amount of additional variance, suggesting that the amplitude of the BOLD signal depends more on the duration of the underlying field potential (reflected in the sharp wave width) than on the degree of neuronal activity synchrony (reflected in the sharp wave amplitude), and, consequently, that including inter-event variations of the sharp wave width in the BOLD signal model may increase the sensitivity of forthcoming EEG-fMRI studies of epileptic activity.

By contrast, less attention has been paid to which processes uniquely contribute to each modality. The present study investigated the neuronal oscillations that enable a subject to process pain and touch as well as to evaluate the intensity of both modalities by means of Electroencephalography. Nineteen healthy subjects were asked to rate the intensity of each stimulus at single trial level. By computing Linear mixed effects models (LME) encoding of both modalities was explored by relating stimulus intensities to brain responses. While the intensity of single touch trials is encoded only by theta activity, pain perception is encoded by theta, alpha and gamma activity. Beta activity in the tactile domain shows an on/off like characteristic in response to touch which was not observed in the pain domain. Our results enhance recent findings pointing to the contribution of different neuronal oscillations to the processing of nociceptive and tactile stimuli.

An electrophysiological dissociation of craving and stimulus-dependent attentional capture in smokers	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Addiction; Attention; N2pc; EEG; Craving; Smoking	SMOKING-RELATED CUES; INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION THEORY; SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALCOHOL-RELATED STIMULI; VISUAL-SEARCH; CIGARETTE SMOKERS; DRUG-ABUSE; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; FOCUSED ATTENTION	It has been suggested that over the course of an addiction, addiction-related stimuli become highly salient in the environment, thereby capturing an addict's attention. To assess these effects neurally in smokers, and how they interact with craving, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in two sessions: one in which participants had just smoked (non-craving), and one in which they had abstained from smoking for 3 h (craving). In both sessions, participants performed a visual-search task in which two colored squares were presented to the left and right of fixation, with one color being the target to which they should shift attention and discriminate the locations of two missing corners. Task-irrelevant images, both smoking-related and non-smoking-related, were embedded in both squares, enabling the shift of spatial attention to the target to be examined as a function of the addiction-related image being present or absent in the target, the distractor, or both. Behaviorally, participants were slower to respond to targets containing a smoking-related image. Furthermore, when the target contained a smoking-related image, the neural responses indicated that attention had been shifted less strongly to the target; when the distractor contained a smoking-related image, the shift of attention to the contralateral target was stronger. These effects occurred independently of craving and suggest that participants were actively avoiding the smoking-related images. Together, these results provide an electrophysiological dissociation between addiction-related visual-stimulus processing and the neural activity associated with craving.

Objective and specific tracking of anhedonia via event-related potentials in individuals with cocaine use disorders	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Anhedonia; EEG; Event-related potentials; Reward positivity; Cocaine; Addiction	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SUBSTANCE-DEPENDENT SUBJECTS; DRUG-ADDICTION; FEEDBACK NEGATIVITY; NEUROIMAGING EVIDENCE; REWARD POSITIVITY; PREDICTION ERRORS; TRIPARTITE MODEL; DECISION-MAKING; MONETARY REWARD	Background: Hyposensitivity to non-drug reward, behaviorally manifested as anhedonia, is a hallmark of chronic substance use. Anhedonia is a transdiagnostic symptom underpinned by neurobiochemical disturbances in the reward circuit, yet an objective measure to assess anhedonia severity still eludes the field. We hypothesized that the Reward Positivity (RewP) component of the event-related potentials (ERPs) will specifically track anhedonia as the RewP is attributed to the same brain regions that are also implicated in anhedonia. Methods: Forty-six individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD) performed a gambling task predicting whether they would win or lose money on each trial, while ERP data was acquired. RewP in response to predicted win trials was extracted from the ERPs using the principal component analysis. State anhedonia and depression severity were assessed using the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA). Results: Although RewP amplitude correlated with both anhedonia and depression, only the RewP-anhedonia correlation survived a correction for depression severity. Further, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that anhedonia explained a significant amount of variance in the RewP amplitude, and this variance was significantly greater than that explained by demographics, severity and recency of drug use and even depression. Conclusions: These results show that RewP amplitude in response to rewarded trials tracks state anhedonia severity in iCUD. We argue that this association is perhaps driven by the activity in the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic reward pathway that may underlie anhedonia symptomology as well as modulate RewP amplitude.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are averaged amplitude fluctuations of the ongoing EEG activity that are time locked to specific sensory, motor or cognitive events, and as such can be used to study different brain processes with an excellent temporal resolution. Movement-related potentials (MRPs) are ERPs associated with processes of voluntary movement preparation and execution in different paradigms. In this review we concentrate on MRPs in PD. We review studies recording the Bereitschaftspotential, the Contingent Negative Variation, and the lateralized readiness potential in PD to highlight the contributions they have made to further understanding motor deficits in PD. Possible directions for future research are also discussed. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

David			Oscillatory activity in auditory cortex reflects the perceptual level of audio-tactile integration	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ASSOCIATION CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; SOUND; TOUCH; RESPONSES; CAPTURE; INPUT	Cross-modal interactions between sensory channels have been shown to depend on both the spatial disparity and the perceptual similarity between the presented stimuli. Here we investigate the behavioral and neural integration of auditory and tactile stimulus pairs at different levels of spatial disparity. Additionally, we modulated the amplitudes of both stimuli in either a coherent or non-coherent manner. We found that both auditory and tactile localization performance was biased towards the stimulus in the respective other modality. This bias linearly increases with stimulus disparity and is more pronounced for coherently modulated stimulus pairs. Analyses of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at temporal-cortical sources revealed enhanced event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as decreased alpha and beta power during bimodal as compared to unimodal stimulation. However, while the observed ERP differences are similar for all stimulus combinations, the extent of oscillatory desynchronization varies with stimulus disparity. Moreover, when both stimuli were subjectively perceived as originating from the same direction, the reduction in alpha and beta power was significantly stronger. These observations suggest that in the EEG the level of perceptual integration is mainly reflected by changes in ongoing oscillatory activity.

Early information processing contributions to object individuation revealed by perception of illusory figures	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						object individuation; selective attention; illusory contours; ERP; P1; N2pc	SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURAL MEASURES; IDENTIFICATION; CAPACITY; ENUMERATION; TRACKING; CAPTURE	To isolate multiple coherent objects from their surrounds, each object must be represented as a stable perceptual entity across both time and space. Recent theoretical and empirical work has proposed that this process of object individuation is a mid-level operation that emerges around 200-300 ms after stimulus onset. However, this hypothesis is based on paradigms that have potentially obscured earlier effects. Furthermore, no study to date has directly assessed whether object individuation occurs for task-irrelevant objects. In the present study we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the time course of individuation, for stimuli both within and outside the focus of attention, to assess the information processing stage at which object individuation arises for both types of objects. We developed a novel paradigm involving items defined by illusory contours, which allowed us to vary the number of to-be-individuated objects while holding the physical elements of the display constant (a design characteristic not present in earlier work). As early as 100 ms after stimulus onset, event-related potentials tracked the number of objects in the attended hemifield, but not those in the unattended hemifield. By contrast, both attended and unattended objects could be individuated at a later stage. Our findings challenge recent conceptualizations of the time course of object individuation and suggest that this process arises earlier for attended than unattended items, implying that voluntary spatial attention influences the time course of this operation.

J	Sikora, K; Roelofs, A; Hermans, D				Sikora, Katarzyna; Roelofs, Ardi; Hermans, Daan			Electrophysiology of executive control in spoken noun-phrase production: Dynamics of updating, inhibiting, and shifting	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						language production; executive control	WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; SWITCH COST; TIME-COURSE; DUAL-TASK; SELECTION; P300; SET; INTERFERENCE; POTENTIALS	Previous studies have provided evidence that updating, inhibiting, and shifting abilities underlying executive control determine response time (RT) in language production. However, little is known about their electrophysiological basis and dynamics. In the present electroencephalography study, we assessed noun-phrase production using picture description and a picture-word interference paradigm. We measured picture description RTs to assess length, distractor, and switch effects, which have been related to the updating, inhibiting, and shifting abilities. In addition, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Previous research has suggested that inhibiting and shifting are associated with anterior and posterior N200 subcomponents, respectively, and updating with the P300. We obtained length, distractor, and switch effects in the RTs, and an interaction between length and switch. There was a widely distributed switch effect in the N200, an interaction of length and midline site in the N200, and a length effect in the P300, whereas distractor did not yield any ERP modulation. Moreover, length and switch interacted in the posterior N200. We argue that these results provide electrophysiological evidence that inhibiting and shifting of task set occur before updating in phrase planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present investigation evaluates the relation between individual perceptual switching and the modulation of reversal-related ERP components. Methods: We used a bistable perception paradigm (Kornmeier and Bach, 2004), consisting of briefly flashed grid of nine Necker cubes, interspersed by a blank screen. The subject's task was to compare the previous stimulus with the latter one. The number of reversal perceptions was used as a measure of individual perceptual switching behaviour. Results: As in previously reported findings, Reversal Negativity (RN, 180-300 ms) and Late Positive Component (LPC, 350-600 ms) were identified in response to reversal perception. In terms of individual differences, higher reversals were associated with reduced negativity of the RN and enhanced positivity of the LPC. Conclusion: The timing of the present results supports the hypothesis that individual variability in perceptual reversal is associated with different neural activations at later stage of processing, when the neural representation of ambiguous figure must be internalized to produce an appropriate response/behaviour. Significance: Multistable perception can reveal crucial mechanisms underlying individual perceptual re-organization when inconsistent or incoherent stimuli come from the environment.

J	Liu-Shuang, J; Torfs, K; Rossion, B				Liu-Shuang, Joan; Torfs, Katrien; Rossion, Bruno			An objective electrophysiological marker of face individualisation impairment in acquired prosopagnosia with fast periodic visual stimulation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Prosopagnosia; Fast periodic visual stimulation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PERSONALLY FAMILIAR FACES; UNFAMILIAR FACES; HOLISTIC PERCEPTION; STEADY-STATE; MEMORY TEST; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; N170	One of the most striking pieces of evidence for a specialised face processing system in humans is acquired prosopagnosia, i.e. the inability to individualise faces following brain damage. However, a sensitive and objective non-behavioural marker for this deficit is difficult to provide with standard event related potentials (ERPs), such as the well-known face-related N170 component reported and investigated in-depth by our late distinguished colleague Shlomo Bentin. Here we demonstrate that fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) in electrophysiology can quantify face individualisation impairment in acquired prosopagnosia. In Experiment 1 (Liu-Shuang et al., 2014), identical faces were presented at a rate of 5.88 Hz (i.e., approximate to 6 images/s, SOA=170 ms, 1 fixation per image), with different faces appearing every 5th face (5.88 Hz/5=1.18 Hz). Responses of interest were identified at these predetermined frequencies (i.e., objectively) in the EEG frequency-domain data. A well-studied case of acquired prosopagnosia (PS) and a group of age-and gender-matched controls completed only 4 x 1-min stimulation sequences, with an orthogonal fixation cross task. Contrarily to controls, PS did not show face individualisation responses at 1.18 Hz, in line with her prosopagnosia. However, her response at 5.88 Hz, reflecting general visual processing, was within the normal range. In Experiment 2 (Rossion et al., 2015), we presented natural (i.e., unsegmented) images of objects at 5.88 Hz, with face images shown every 5th image (1.18 Hz). In accordance with her preserved ability to categorise a face as a face, and despite extensive brain lesions potentially affecting the overall EEG signal-to-noise ratio, PS showed 1.18 Hz face selective responses within the normal range. Collectively, these findings show that fast periodic visual stimulation provides objective and sensitive electrophysiological markers of preserved and impaired face processing abilities in the neuropsychological population.

J	Bourisly, AK				Bourisly, Ali K.			Effects of aging on P300 between late young-age and early middle-age adulthood: an electroencephalogram event-related potential study	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						aging; brain; electrophysiology; event-related potential; P300	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; STIMULI; DISEASE; EEG	The aim of this study was to identify age-related changes of P300 peak amplitude and P300 latency between closely separated nonsenile age groups (late young-aged adults and early middle-aged adults) and to investigate whether or not P300 has the potential to be used as a measure of cognitive aging even among nonsenile age groups. Twenty-eight adults (25-55 years old) completed an event-related potential oddball task. The elicitation of both P300 peak amplitude and P300 latency indicated age-related changes of P300. The results of the study showed that the P300 target peak amplitude was significantly larger in late young age compared with early middle age and that P300 target latency was also significantly delayed in early middle age compared with late young age. The results of this work contribute toward research efforts on a consensus on how aging affects event-related potential and/or P300. The main conclusions are that there exist significant age-related P300 changes even between closely separated, relatively younger, and nonsenile age groups, and that P300 has the potential to be used as a measure for cognitive aging even in nonsenile adults.

The goal of this study was to characterize these parameters of a new rat substrain showing several alterations related to schizophrenia. Methods: Male rats of the new substrain, developed by selective breeding after combined subchronic ketamine treatment and postweaning social isolation, and naive Wistar ones group-housed without any interventions were involved in the present study. At the age of 3 months, animals were implanted with cortical electroencephalography electrodes. Auditory evoked potentials during paired-click stimuli and power of oscillation in different frequency bands were determined with and without acute ketamine (20 mg/kg) treatment. Results: Regarding the auditory evoked potentials, the latency of P2 was delayed and the amplitude of N1 peak was lower in the new substrain. The new substrain showed increased power of oscillations in the theta, alpha and beta bands, while decreased power was detected in delta and gamma2 bands (52-70 Hz) compared with control animals. Acute ketamine treatment increased the gamma1 band (30-48 Hz) power in both groups, while it elicited significant changes only in the new substrain in the total power and in alpha, beta and gamma2 bands. Conclusions: The validation of the translational utility of this new rat substrain by electrophysiological investigations revealed that these rats show abnormalities that may model a part of the neurophysiological deficits observed in schizophrenia.

Recently, the passive and automatic extraction of additional information regarding the psychological state of users from neurophysiological signals has gained increased attention in the interdisciplinary field of affective computing. We investigated how well specific emotional reactions, induced by auditory stimuli, can be detected in EEG recordings. We introduce an auditory emotion induction paradigm based on the International Affective Digitized Sounds 2nd Edition (IADS-2) database also suitable for disabled individuals. Stimuli are grouped in three valence categories: unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant. Significant differences in time domain domain event-related potentials are found in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between unpleasant and neutral, as well as pleasant and neutral conditions over midline electrodes. Time domain data were classified in three binary classification problems using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We discuss three classification performance measures in the context of affective computing and outline some strategies for conducting and reporting affect classification studies.

One helpless way to avoid such artefacts is usually to directly discard the severely disturbed EEG segments. This study considers a more elegant way that tries to recover the disturbed segments from other undisturbed segments. The possible artefacts in EEG are treated as missing values. A Bayesian tensor factorization (BTF) based method is proposed to implement EEG completion for artefact removal. By specifying a sparsity-inducing hierarchical prior, the underlying low-rank tensor is discovered from incomplete EEG tensor with automatically inferred model parameters. The EEG missing values are effectively predicted with robustness to overfitting. Effectiveness of the BTF algorithm is demonstrated on EEG data recorded from seven subjects in a brain-computer interface paradigm based on event-related potentials.

However, the influence of attention manipulation on facial-vocal integration during emotional change perception is still elusive at this point. To address this issue, we asked participants to detect emotional changes conveyed by prosodies (vocal task) or facial expressions (facial task) while facial, vocal, and facial-vocal expressions were presented. At the same time, behavioral responses and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Behavioral results showed that bimodal emotional changes were detected with shorter response latencies compared to each unimodal condition, suggesting that bimodal emotional cues facilitated emotional change detection. Moreover, while the P3 amplitudes were larger for the bimodal change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions regardless of attention direction, the N1 amplitudes were larger for the bimodal emotional change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions under the attend-voice condition, but not under the attend-face condition. These findings suggest that selective attention modulates facial-vocal integration during emotional change perception in early sensory processing, but not in late cognitive processing stages.

Asynchronous Detection of Trials Onset from Raw EEG Signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Event-related potentials; brain-computer interface; brain area network; EEG teleservices; e-health	FUZZY SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AMBULATORY EEG; BRAIN; VIDEO; HOME; METHODOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; TELEMETRY; DISORDER	Clinical processing of event-related potentials (ERPs) requires a precise synchrony between the stimulation and the acquisition units that are guaranteed by means of a physical link between them. This precise synchrony is needed since temporal misalignments during trial averaging can lead to high deviations of peak times, thus causing error in diagnosis or inefficiency in classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Out of the laboratory, mobile EEG systems and BCI headsets are not provided with the physical link, thus being inadequate for acquisition of ERPs. In this study, we propose a method for the asynchronous detection of trials onset from raw EEG without physical links. We validate it with a BCI application based on the dichotic listening task. The user goal was to attend the cued auditory message and to report three keywords contained in it while ignoring the other message. The BCI goal was to detect the attended message from the analysis of auditory ERPs. The rate of successful onset detection in both synchronous (using the real onset) and asynchronous (blind detection of trial onset from raw EEG) was 73% with a synchronization error of less than 1 ms. The level of synchronization provided by this proposal would allow home-based acquisition of ERPs with low cost BCI headsets and any media player unit without physical links between them.

Ear-EEG could be implemented into hearing aids, and provide neurofeedback for e.g. objective hearing assessment through measurements of the auditory steady-state response. In cases where the objective is to measure a specific feature of an event-related potential, there will be a subject specific optimal reference configuration. This work presents a method for optimizing the reference configuration for steady-state type potentials. For given electrode positions, the method maximizes the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the first harmonic of the steady-state response. This is obtained by estimating a set of weights applied to the electrode signals. The method was validated on a dataset recorded from 12 subjects. The weights were estimated from one part of the dataset, and the validation was performed on another part of the dataset. For all subjects the proposed method demonstrated a robust SNR estimate, yielding on par or better SNR compared to other well-known methods.

Event-related fields evoked by vocal response inhibition: a comparison of younger and older adults	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Response inhibition; Speech; Magnetoencephalography; Event-related fields; Ageing and stop-signal task	STOP-SIGNAL PROBABILITY; ERP COMPONENTS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; P3 COMPONENT; MEG; POTENTIALS; SYSTEMS; TASKS; EEG; SIGNATURES	The current study examined event-related fields (ERFs) evoked by vocal response inhibition in a stimulus-selective stop-signal task. We compared inhibition-related ERFs across a younger and an older group of adults. Behavioural results revealed that stop-signal reaction times (RTs), go-RTs, ignore-stop RTs and failed stop RTs were longer in the older, relative to the younger group by 38, 123, 149 and 116 ms, respectively. The amplitude of the ERF M2 peak (approximately 200 ms after the stop signal) evoked on successful stop trials was larger compared to that evoked on both failed stop and ignore-stop trials. The M4 peak (approximately 450 ms after stop signal) was of larger amplitude in both successful and failed stops compared to ignore-stop trials. In the older group, the M2, M3 and M4 peaks were smaller in amplitude and peaked later in time (by 24, 50 and 76 ms, respectively). We demonstrate that vocal response inhibition-related ERFs exhibit a similar temporal evolution to those previously described for manual response inhibition: an early peak at 200 ms (i.e. M2) that differentiates successful from failed stopping, and a later peak (i.e. M4) that is consistent with a neural marker of response checking and error processing. Across groups, our data support a more general decline of stimulus processing speed with age.

Cognitive MMN and P300 in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A high density EEG-3D vector field tomography approach	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						MCI; AD; ERPs; Vector field tomography; High-density EEG; Brain imaging	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RARE TARGET; PROGRESSION; DEMENTIA; DECLINE; LATENCY; LOCALIZATION; POTENTIALS; BIOMARKERS; DIAGNOSIS	Precise preclinical detection of dementia for effective treatment and stage monitoring is of great importance. Miscellaneous types of biomarkers, e.g., biochemical, genetic, neuroimaging, and physiological, have been proposed to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD), the usual suspect behind manifested cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a neuropathology prior to AD that does not affect cognitive functions. Event related potential (ERP) methods constitute a non-invasive, inexpensive means of analysis and have been proposed as sensitive biomarkers of cognitive impairment; besides, various ERP components are strongly linked with working memory, attention, sensory processing and motor responses. In this study, an auditory oddball task is employed, to acquire high density electroencephalograhy recordings from healthy elderly controls, MCI and AD patients. The mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 ERP components are then extracted and their relationship with neurodegeneration is examined. Then, the neural activation at these components is reconstructed using the 3D vector field tomography (3D-VFT) inverse solution. The results reveal a decline of both ERPs amplitude, and a statistically significant prolongation of their latency as cognitive impairment advances. For the MMN, higher brain activation is usually localized in the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri in the controls. However, in AD, parietal sites exhibit strong activity. Stronger P300 generators are mostly found in the frontal lobe for the controls, but in AD they often shift to the temporal lobe. Reduction in inferior frontal source strength and the switch of the maximum intensity area to parietal and superior temporal sites suggest that these areas, especially the former, are of particular significance when neurodegenerative disorders are investigated. The modulation of MMN and P300 can serve to produce biomarkers of dementia and its progression, and brain imaging can further contribute to the diagnostic efficiency of ERPs.

Striatal Dopaminergic Innervation Regulates Subthalamic Beta-Oscillations and Cortical-Subcortical Coupling during Movements: Preliminary Evidence in Subjects with Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta oscillations; motor control; movement disorders; imaging; Parkinson's disease; subthalamic nucleus; coherence analysis	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SUPPRESSION; RECORDINGS; MODULATION	Activation of the basal ganglia has been shown during the preparation and execution of movement. However, the functional interaction of cortical and subcortical brain areas during movement and the relative contribution of dopaminergic striatal innervation remains unclear. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals in four patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) off dopaminergic medication during a multi-joint motor task performed with their dominant and non-dominant hand. Recordings were performed by means of a fully-implantable deep brain stimulation (DBS) device at 4 months after surgery. Three patients also performed a single-photon computed tomography (SPECT) with [I-123]N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane (FP-CIT) to assess striatal dopaminergic innervation. Unilateral movement execution led to event-related desynchronization (ERD) followed by a rebound after movement termination event-related synchronization (ERS) of oscillatory beta activity in the STN and primary sensorimotor cortex of both hemispheres. Dopamine deficiency directly influenced movement-related beta-modulation, with greater beta-suppression in the most dopamine-depleted hemisphere for both ipsi- and contralateral hand movements. Cortical-subcortical, but not interhemispheric subcortical coherencies were modulated by movement and influenced by striatal dopaminergic innervation, being stronger in the most dopamine-depleted hemisphere. The data are consistent with a role of dopamine in shielding subcortical structures from an excessive cortical entrapment and cross-hemispheric coupling, thus allowing fine-tuning of movement.

Since isolation of the stimulus is not always practical it is desirable to study P300 when the subjects are receiving stimuli in other senses besides sight. Thus this paper tested the subjects in a silent environment and adding affective noise as catalogued by the Affective Digitised Sound database. The resulting EEG recordings were analysed and found that isolated P300 features increased (p < 0.05), but features that related it to the neighbourhood decreased (p < 0.05) making it more difficult to identify in half of the subjects. A preliminary test points towards models derived of events elicited in noisy environments as a solution to the decrease of performance of classifiers.

J	Merkley, R; Shimi, A; Scerif, G				Merkley, Rebecca; Shimi, Andria; Scerif, Gaia			Electrophysiological markers of newly acquired symbolic numerical representations: the role of magnitude and ordinal information	ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION			English	Article						Order; Magnitude; ERPs; Symbol	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NUMBER REPRESENTATIONS; QUANTITY; HUMANS; ORDER; MECHANISMS; SYSTEM; ADULTS; SENSE; TIME	It is not yet understood how children acquire the meaning of numerical symbols and most existing research has focused on the role of approximate non-symbolic representations of number in this process (see Piazza, (Trends in Cognitive 14(12):542-551, 2010). However, numerical symbols necessitate an understanding of both order and magnitude, therefore order likely also plays a role in learning about number. Here, we used an artificial symbol-learning paradigm to contrast learning approximate numerical magnitude with learning numerical order. Thirty-two adult participants were randomly assigned to either the magnitude training group, in which they were trained to associate novel abstract symbols with non-symbolic numerical magnitudes, or the order training group, in which they were taught the ordinal sequence of the symbols, in analogy to the count sequence. Subsequently, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded while participants completed a magnitude comparison task with the newly learned symbols. Comparing these newly acquired symbols affected event related potentials (ERPs) in a way that resembled comparisons of real numerical symbols [e.g. Temple & Posner, (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95(13):7836-7841, 1998)]. Furthermore, these ERP effects did not differ across learning groups, suggesting that adults formed similar representations regardless of method of instruction. In turn, the current findings highlight the potential role of ordinal information in symbolic acquisition.

Many factors directly affect the sustained attention, especially distractor, which is the great challenge for keeping the attention. However, there has been less work focusing on the effects of distractor. In this work, a novel experimental paradigm is proposed with the manipulation of demands on cognitive control, and then based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, Event related potential (ERP) analysis was used to measure neural activity to explore the neural mechanism of distractor affecting the sustained attention. By comparing ERP features in the distraction condition to the condition without distraction, it can be shown that distractor reduces the amplitude of N2 component, which would be in accordance with the delay and increased amplitude in the P300 component, which reflect that evaluation and classification in distraction condition need a longer period of time and more mental efforts to process or categorize the target stimuli. The findings suggest that distractor affects sustained attention by impairing the ability to process, detect and categorize a stimulus as being a target, and distraction increases the difficulty of the task, evaluation and classification in distraction condition need a longer period of time and more mental efforts.

Sustained attention abnormalities in breast cancer survivors with cognitive deficits post chemotherapy: An electrophysiological study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sustained attention; Mind wandering; Adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast cancer; Cognitive deficits; P300 ERP; Rest EEG	ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; RESTING EEG; DEFAULT NETWORK; WANDERING MIND; FIRST-EPISODE; BRAIN; TASK; IMPAIRMENT; FLUCTUATIONS; EXPERIENCE	Objective: Many breast cancer survivors (BCS) report cognitive problems following chemotherapy, yet controversy remains concerning which cognitive domains are affected. This study investigated a domain crucial to daily function: the ability to maintain attention over time. Methods: We examined whether BCS who self-reported cognitive problems up to 3 years following cancer treatment (n = 19) performed differently from healthy controls (HC, n = 12) in a task that required sustained attention. Participants performed a target detection task while periodically being asked to report their attentional state. Electroencephalogram was recorded during this task and at rest. Results: BCS were less likely to maintain sustained attention during the task compared to HC. Further, the P3 event-related potential component elicited by visual targets during the task was smaller in BCS relative to HC. BCS also displayed greater neural activity at rest. Conclusions: BCS demonstrated an abnormal pattern of sustained attention and resource allocation compared to HC, suggesting that attentional deficits can be objectively observed in breast cancer survivors who self-report concentration problems. Significance: These data underscore the value of EEG combined with a less traditional measure of sustained attention, or attentional states, as objective laboratory tools that are sensitive to subjective complaints of chemotherapy-related attentional impairments.

Evolutionary origins of non-adjacent sequence processing in primate brain potentials2	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NONADJACENT DEPENDENCIES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; LANGUAGE; MACAQUE; ACTIVATION; STREAMS; AREAS; MODEL	There is considerable interest in understanding the ontogeny and phylogeny of the human language system, yet, neurobiological work at the interface of both fields is absent. Syntactic processes in language build on sensory processing and sequencing capabilities on the side of the receiver. While we better understand language-related ontogenetic changes in the human brain, it remains a mystery how neurobiological processes at specific human development stages compare with those in phylogenetically closely related species. To address this knowledge gap, we measured EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) in two macaque monkeys using a paradigm developed to evaluate human infant and adult brain potentials associated with the processing of non-adjacent ordering relationships in sequences of syllable triplets. Frequent standard triplet sequences were interspersed with infrequent voice pitch or non-adjacent rule deviants. Monkey ERPs show early pitch and rule deviant mismatch responses that are strikingly similar to those previously reported in human infants. This stands in contrast to adults' later ERP responses for rule deviants. The results reveal how non-adjacent sequence ordering relationships are processed in the primate brain and provide evidence for evolutionarily conserved neurophysiological effects, some of which are remarkably like those seen at an early human developmental stage.

Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data was collected from 48 young adults when performing a Posner task. Higher aerobic fitness is related to faster reaction times (RTs) along with greater P3 amplitude and shorter P3 latency in the valid trials, after controlling for age and body mass index. Moreover, RTs were selectively related to P3 amplitude rather than P3 latency. Specifically, the bootstrap-based mediation model indicates that P3 amplitude mediates the relationship between fitness level and attention performance. Possible explanations regarding the relationships among aerobic fitness, cognitive performance, and brain potentials are discussed.

This new methodology is based on the novel synergy of Local Global Graph (LG graph) to characterize define the structural features of the EEG topography as a global descriptor for robust comparison of dominant topographies (microstates) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the topographic sequence in a unique way. In particular, the LG graph descriptor defines similarity and distance measures that can be successfully used for the difficult comparison of the extracted LG graphs in the presence of noise. In addition, hidden states represent periods of stationary distribution of topographies that constitute the equivalent of the microstates in the model. The transitions between the different microstates and the formed syntactic patterns can reveal differences in the processing of the input stimulus between different pathologies. We train the HMM model to learn the transitions between the different microstates and express the syntactic patterns that appear in the single trials in a compact and efficient way. We applied this methodology in single trials consisting of normal subjects and patients with Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (PMCI) to discriminate these two groups. The classification results show that this approach is capable to efficiently discriminate between control and Progressive MCI single trials. Results indicate that HMMs provide physiologically meaningful results that can be used in the syntactic analysis of Event Related Potentials.

The stability of reduced ERN/Pe in psychosis, however, is unknown. In a previous cross-sectional report, reduced ERN was associated with negative symptom severity and reduced Pe with a diagnosis of schizophrenia versus other psychosis. Here, we test the stability of impaired error processing over a four-year follow-up and relationships with subdimensions of negative symptoms. The ERN and Pe were recorded from individuals with psychotic disorders twice: 79 individuals were assessed 15 years after first hospitalization, and 69 were assessed at 19 years; 59 (26 with schizophrenia, 33 with other psychotic disorders) had data at both assessments. At 19 years the Pe was blunted in schizophrenia. The ERN and Pe exhibited temporal stability over the four years (r = 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Reduced ERN and Pe correlated with the negative symptom subdimensions of inexpressivity and avolition, respectively, and not with psychotic or disorganized symptoms. Moreover, 15-year ERN predicted an increase in inexpressivity by year 19. No evidence was found for the reverse: negative symptoms did not predict change in ERN/Pe. Similar to non-clinical samples, the ERN and Pe show impressive four-year stability in late-phase psychosis. The ERN and Pe are promising neural measures for capturing individual differences in psychotic disorders, particularly with regard to negative symptomatology. They may prove to be useful clinically for forecasting illness course and as treatment targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Empowerment by neuromodulation protocols may then act as useful tools to contrast physiological cognitive decline and potential pathological development. Moving from evidences on the primary role of prefrontal neural structures and prefrontal executive functions in the ageing process, we devised and tested a novel neuromodulation empowerment protocol using a non-invasive brain stimulation technique (tDCS). The integrated comparison of psychometric and electrophysiological (event-related potentials - ERP) outcome measures between the experimental and control groups pointed out that the former presented better performances at tests on executive functions and enhanced electrophysiological responses associated to attention control (N200). Such effects seem to be partially maintained even at a follow-up assessment, and that suggests interesting practical implications for the inclusion of neuromodulation techniques in prevention and early intervention projects.

Developmental differences in beta and theta power during sentence processing	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Language; ERP; Development	LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; SPHERICAL SPLINES; EEG; COMPREHENSION; CHILDREN; TIME; CONTEXT; WORDS; BRAIN; INCONGRUITY	Although very young children process ongoing language quickly and effortlessly, research indicates that they continue to improve and mature in their language skills through adolescence. This prolonged development may be related to differing engagement of semantic and syntactic processes. This study used event related potentials and time frequency analysis of EEG to identify developmental differences in neural engagement as children (ages 10-12) and adults performed an auditory verb agreement grammaticality judgment task. Adults and children revealed very few differences in comprehending grammatically correct sentences. When identifying grammatical errors, however, adults displayed widely distributed beta and theta power decreases that were significantly less pronounced in children. Adults also demonstrated a significant P600 effect, while children exhibited an apparent N400 effect. Thus, when identifying subtle grammatical errors in real time, adults display greater neural activation that is traditionally associated with syntactic processing whereas children exhibit greater activity more commonly associated with semantic processing. These findings support previous claims that the cognitive and neural underpinnings of syntactic processing are still developing in adolescence, and add to them by more clearly identifying developmental changes in the neural oscillations underlying grammatical processing. 2016 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose a family of methods whereby the EEG is decomposed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a novel approach for the selection of BCG-related independent components (ICs) is used (PROJection onto Independent Components, PROJIC). Three ICA-based strategies for BCG artifact correction are then explored: 1) BCG-related ICs are removed from the back-reconstruction of the EEG (PROJIC); and 2-3) BCG-related ICs are corrected for the artifact occurrences using an Optimal Basis Set (OBS) or Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS) framework, before back-projecting all ICs onto EEG space (PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, respectively). A novel evaluation pipeline is also proposed to assess the methods performance, which takes into account not only artifact but also physiological signal removal, allowing for a flexible weighting of the importance given to physiological signal preservation. This evaluation is used for the group-level parameter optimization of each algorithm on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquired using two different setups at 3 T and 7 T. Comparison with state-of-the-art BCG correction methods showed that PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS outperformed the others when priority was given to artifact removal or physiological signal preservation, respectively, while both PROJIC-AAS and AAS were in general the best choices for intermediate trade-offs. The impact of the BCG correction on the quality of event-related potentials (ERPs) of interest was assessed in terms of the relative reduction of the standard error (SE) across trials: 26/66%, 32/62% and 18/61% were achieved by, respectively, PROJIC, PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, for data collected at 3 T/7 T. Although more significant improvements were achieved at 7 T, the results were qualitatively comparable for both setups, which indicate the wide applicability of the proposed methodologies and recommendations.

While regular dopamine treatment can help restore motor function, dopamine also influences cognitive portions of the action system. Previous studies have demonstrated that dopamine medication boosts action-effect associations, which are crucial for the discovery of new voluntary actions. In the present study, we investigated whether neural processes involved in the discovery of new actions are altered in PD participants on regular dopamine treatment, compared to healthy age-matched controls. We recorded brain electroencephalography (EEG) activity while PD patients and age matched controls performed action discovery (AD) and action control tasks. We found that the novelty P3, a component normally present when there is uncertainty about the occurrence of the sensory effect, was enhanced in PD patients. However, AD was maintained in PD patients, and the novelty P3 demonstrated normal learning-related reductions. Crucially, we found that in PD patients the causal association between an action and its resulting sensory outcome did not modulate the amplitude of the feedback correct-related positivity (fCRP), an EEG component sensitive to the association between an action and its resulting effect. Collectively, these preliminary results suggest that the formation of long-term action-outcome representations may be maintained in PD patients on regular dopamine treatment, but the initial experience of action-effect association may be affected.

Richard			Conflict in the kitchen: Contextual modulation of responsiveness to affordances	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Affordances; Perception-action coupling; Embodied cognition; EEG; Action readiness	PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; COGNITION; OBJECTS; HAND	Recently, human behavior has been considered the product of continuous interactions between perception, cognition and action in which "affordances" (action possibilities the environment has to offer) play an important role. Converging evidence suggests that multiple action possibilities simultaneously compete for further processing, while external and internal factors (e.g., incoming sensory information, predictions) bias this competition. In the present study we used a stop-task to investigate whether context is able to modulate the strength of the responsiveness to affordances. We therefore placed participants in an actual kitchen and workshop during electroencephalographic recordings. A faster response to context congruent objects demonstrated that the direct surrounding is able to affect responsiveness to affordances. In addition, when responses needed to be withheld, context congruent objects evoked greater response conflict as indicated by an enhanced N2 Event Related Potential (ERP) component.

Multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 younger (mean = 24.65-year-old, 10 male) and 20 middle-aged participants (mean = 46.40-year-old, 10 male) during performance of a Sternberg task. EEG power and coherence measures were analyzed in different frequency bands. Significant interactions emerged between age and gender in memory performance and concomitant EEG parameters, suggesting that the aging process differentially influences men and women. Middle-aged women showed a lower short-term memory performance compared to young women, which was accompanied by decreasing delta and theta power and increasing brain connectivity with age in women. In contrast, men showed no age-related decline in short-term memory performance and no changes in EEG parameters. These results provide first evidence of age-related alterations in EEG activity underlying memory processes, which were already evident in the middle years of life in women but not in men.

In particular, spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC are used to disclose blockwise causal flow among different brain areas in various frequencies. In this paper, we demonstrate that: 1) BGC in time domain may not necessarily disclose true causality and 2) due to the use of the transfer function or its inverse matrix and partial information of the multivariate linear regression model, both of spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC have shortcomings and/or limitations, which may inevitably lead to misinterpretation. We then, in time and frequency domains, develop two new multivariate blockwise causality methods for the linear regression model called blockwise new causality (BNC) and spectral BNC, respectively. By several examples, we confirm that BNC measures are more reasonable and sensitive to reflect true causality or trend of true causality than BGC or conditional BGC. Finally, for electroencephalograph data from an epilepsy patient, we analyze event-related potential causality and demonstrate that both of the BGC and BNC methods show significant causality flow in frequency domain, but the spectral BNC method yields satisfactory and convincing results, which are consistent with an event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral BGC method is shown to generate misleading results. Thus, we deeply believe that our new blockwise causality definitions as well as our previous NC definitions may have wide applications to reflect true causality among two blocks of time series or two univariate time series in economics, neuroscience, and engineering.

This study aimed to characterize functional connectivity in the healthy human newborn, and to identify the changes in connectivity related to vigilance states and to maturation during the early postnatal weeks. We recorded active and quiet sleep of 38 sleeping newborn babies using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) at 2 neonatal time points. Functional connectivity between brain areas was quantified with 3 different metrics: phase-phase correlations, amplitude-amplitude correlations (AACs), and phase-amplitude correlations. All functional connectivity measures changed significantly between vigilance states and matured rapidly after normal birth. The observed changes were frequency-specific, most salient in AAC coupling, and their development was compatible with the known development of structural cortico-cortical connectivity. The present findings support the view that emerging functional connectivity exhibits fundamental differences between sleep states months before the onset of genuine EEG signatures of sleep states. Moreover, our findings also support the idea that early cortical events entail different mechanisms of functional coupling needed to provide endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

Participants moved a virtual object from an initial position to a target position in the virtual environment. A large cylinder obscured part of the motion between the origin and the target. The position of the emerging object under the cylinder is disturbed, and hence unexpected, for part of the scenarios. This disturbance is perceived as an error. We examined the EEG signals locked to the error. Our results show a consistent disturbance-locked potential with an early negative peak followed by a positive peak. Peak-to-peak amplitude increased with the disturbance magnitude. Source estimation at the time of the negative and positive peaks revealed a strong activity in the vicinity of Brodmann area (BA) 7, known to be involved in hapto-visual integration and in the neural computation of dynamic motor errors. These results demonstrate the presence of haptic-disturbance-related brain activity under conditions of continuous motion. Results further suggest a feedback signal for error detection and correction in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) in applications such as telesurgery, manipulation of remote objects and rehabilitation.

Despite this hypothesis, many rest state paradigms do not act directly upon the rest state and therefore cannot confirm hypotheses about its mechanisms. To address this challenge, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to study brain's relaxation toward rest following a transient perturbation. Specifically, TMS targeted either the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), i.e. part of the Default Mode Network (DMN) or the superior parietal lobule (SPL), involved in the Dorsal Attention Network. TMS was triggered by a given brain state, namely an increase in occipital alpha rhythm power. Following the initial TMS-Evoked Potential, TMS at MPFC enhances the induced occipital alpha rhythm, called Event Related Synchronisation, with a longer transient lifetime than TMS at SPL, and a higher amplitude. Our findings show a strong coupling between MPFC and the occipital alpha power. Although the rest state is organized around a core of resting state networks, the DMN functionally takes a special role among these resting state networks.

This ability from the interaction between goal-directed and stimulus driven attentional control is termed contingent reorienting. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated activations of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (DANs) which exhibit right hemisphere dominance, but the temporal dynamics of the attentional networks still remain unclear. The present study used event-related potential (ERP) to index the locus of spatial attention and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to acquire the time-frequency information during contingent reorienting. The ERP results showed contingent reorienting induced significant N2pc on both hemispheres. In contrast, our time-frequency analysis found further that, unlike the N2pc, theta oscillation during contingent reorienting differed between hemispheres and experimental sessions. The inter-trial coherence (ITC) of the theta oscillation demonstrated that the two sides of the attentional networks became phase-locked to contingent reorienting at different stages. The left attentional networks were associated with contingent reorienting in the first experimental session whereas the bilateral attentional networks play a more important role in this process in the subsequent session. This phase-locked information suggests a dynamic temporal evolution of the involvement of different attentional networks in contingent reorienting and a potential role of the left ventral network in the first session.

However, existing research manipulated the sole presence/absence of conflict, but not its exact level. Here, by using a modified color-word task that allowed multiple correct responses for target colors, as well as multiple incorrect responses for distractor words, we manipulated the level of conflict among activated responses (and not only its presence). We expected that a larger number of activated incorrect responses (i.e., a presumably higher conflict) would entail more pronounced conflict-related potentials. Indeed, two components of the N450 wave, parietal negativity and medial frontal negativity, were more negatively deflected when conflict was higher, than when it was lower, visibly responding to the level of conflict. Slow potential weakly responded to the sheer presence of conflict, but not to its level. These results can be plausibly explained by the conflict monitoring theory with a modified conflict evaluation formula, whereas they are at odds with several alternative theories of cognitive control.

To date, it is not clear whether inhibitory control is a single process or whether it is composed of different processes. Further, whether these processes are separate or clustered in childhood is under debate. In this study, we investigated the existence and development of two hypothesized component processes of inhibitory control-interference suppression and response inhibition-using a single task and event related potential components. Twenty 8-year-old children and seventeen adults performed a spatially cued Go/Nogo task while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography. Mean N2 amplitudes confirmed the expected pattern for response inhibition with both the children and the adults showing more negative N2 for Nogo vs. Go trials. The interference suppression N2 effect was only present in adults and appeared as a more negative N2 in response to Go trials with a congruent cue than Go trials with an incongruent cue. Contrary to previous findings, there was no evidence that the interference suppression N2 effect was later occurring than the response inhibition N2 effect. Overall, response inhibition was present in both the children and the adults whereas interference suppression was only present in the adults. These results provide evidence of distinct maturational processes for both component processes of inhibitory control, with interference suppression probably continuing to develop into late childhood.

The extent to which we empathize with others in pain is influenced by numerous factors. Being highly social species, humans face social stress on a regular basis, which undoubtedly affects how we react to our environment. It is not yet known how social stress may modulate our neural mechanisms when we empathize with others in painful circumstances, and its effects on empathic behavior are still unclear. For this reason, we recorded the electroencephalography (EEG) of healthy men and women, half of which were previously exposed to psychosocial stress, while they observed photographs of hands in painful and neutral situations. At the behavioral level, stress induced higher unpleasantness ratings to painful stimuli, and lower ratings to neutral pictures, independent of sex. At the neurophysiological level, we found that early (N110 over fronto-central sites) event-related potentials (ERPs) were not affected by stress, while late (P3 over centro-parietal regions) components showed a sex-dependent differential effect of stress. Correlation analyses further indicated a strong association between N110 with trait markers of empathy in all participants, while P3 was associated with the change in cortisol in stressed males. Our findings suggest that sex-dependent effects of social stress on the neural responses to empathy for pain give rise to comparable behaviors in men and women in the paradigm we employed, implying that each sex may engage in distinct mechanisms to cope with stress. Moreover, stress seems to modulate late neural mechanisms of empathy but not our early perception. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Age-related differences in EEG beta activity during an assessment of ankle proprioception	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/S); Slow passive movement; Response time; Proprioception; Aging; Electroencephalography	POSTURAL-CONTROL; MOTOR CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; REACTION-TIME; MOVEMENT; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; HUMANS	The aim of this work was to compare cortical beta oscillatory activity between young (YA) and older (OA) adults during the assessment of ankle proprioception. We analyzed the response time (RT) to kinesthetic perception and beta event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) in response to passive ankle movement applied at a slow speed, 0.5 degrees/s. The relationship between ERD/ERS and RT was investigated by classifying the signals into fast-, medium-, and slow-RT. The results showed a temporal relationship between beta oscillation changes and RT for both groups, i.e., earlier ERD and ERS were obtained for trials with faster response time. ERD was larger and delayed in OA compared to the YA, and beta ERS was present only for OA. These findings suggest that a less efficient proprioceptive signaling reaching the brain of OA requires a higher level of brain processing and hence the differences in ERD potentials between YA and OA. Furthermore, the occurrence of ERS in OA might represent a compensatory strategy of active cortical resetting for adequate sensorimotor behavior due to the age-related reduced peripheral input and neuromuscular impairments. Altered balance between excitatory and inhibitory intracortical activity in older adults presumably explains the changes in beta oscillations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characterizing these covert abilities is crucial for diagnosis, prognosis, and medical ethics. This multimodal study investigates the relationship between electroencephalographic evidence for perceptual/cognitive preservation and both overt and covert markers of awareness. MethodsFourteen patients with severe brain injuries were evaluated with an electroencephalographic vibrotactile attention task designed to identify a hierarchy of residual somatosensory and cognitive abilities: (1) somatosensory steady-state evoked responses, (2) bottom-up attention orienting (P3a event-related potential), and (3) top-down attention (P3b event-related potential). Each patient was also assessed with a clinical behavioral scale and 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments of covert command following. ResultsSix patients produced only sensory responses, with no evidence of cognitive event-related potentials. A further 8 patients demonstrated reliable bottom-up attention-orienting responses (P3a). No patient showed evidence of top-down attention (P3b). Only those patients who followed commands, whether overtly with behavior or covertly with functional neuroimaging, also demonstrated event-related potential evidence of attentional orienting. InterpretationSomatosensory attention-orienting event-related potentials differentiated patients who could follow commands from those who could not. Crucially, this differentiation was irrespective of whether command following was evident through overt external behavior, or through covert functional neuroimaging methods. Bedside electroencephalographic methods may corroborate more expensive and challenging methods such as functional neuroimaging, and thereby assist in the accurate diagnosis of awareness.

J	Burra, N; Kerzel, D; George, N				Burra, Nicolas; Kerzel, Dirk; George, Nathalie			Early Left Parietal Activity Elicited by Direct Gaze: A High-Density EEG Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE CONTACT; FEARFUL FACES; VISUAL-CORTEX; AVERTED GAZE; TIME-COURSE; AFFECTIVE BLINDSIGHT; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TARGET SELECTION	Gaze is one of the most important cues for human communication and social interaction. Inparticular, gaze contact is the most primary form of social contact and it is thought to capture attention. A very early-differentiated brain response to direct versus averted gaze has been hypothesized. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to test this hypothesis. Topographical analysis allowed us to uncover a very early topographic modulation (40-80 ms) of event-related responses to faces with direct as compared to averted gaze. This modulation was obtained only in the condition where intact broadband faces-as opposed to high-pass or low-pas filtered faces-were presented. Source estimation indicated that this early modulation involved the posterior parietal region, encompassing the left precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. This supports the idea that it reflected an early orienting response to direct versus averted gaze. Accordingly, in a follow-up behavioural experiment, we found faster response times to the direct gaze than to the averted gaze broadband faces. In addition, classical evoked potential analysis showed that the N170 peak amplitude was larger for averted gaze than for direct gaze. Taken together, these results suggest that direct gaze may be detected at a very early processing stage, involving a parallel route to the ventral occipito-temporal route of face perceptual analysis.

It consists of at least two very basic senses: a sense of agency and a sense of ownership. Disturbances seem to provide a basic deficit in many psychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to manipulate those qualities separately in 28 patients with schizophrenia (14 auditory hallucinators and 14 non-hallucinators) and 28 healthy controls (HC) and to investigate the effects on the topographies and the power of the event-related potential (ERP). We performed a 76-channel EEG while the participants performed the task as in our previous paper. We computed ERPs and difference maps for the conditions and compared the amount of agency and ownership between the HC and the patients. Furthermore, we compared the global field power and the topographies of these effects. Our data showed effects of agency and ownership in the healthy controls and the hallucinator group and to a lesser degree in the non-hallucinator group. We found a reduction of the N100 during the presence of agency, and a bilateral temporal negativity related to the presence of ownership. For the agency effects, we found significant differences between HC and the patients. Contrary to the expectations, our findings were more pronounced in non-hallucinators, suggesting a more profoundly disturbed sense of agency compared to hallucinators. A contemporary increase of global field power in both patient groups indicates a compensatory recruitment of other mechanisms not normally associated with the processing of agency and ownership.

The process of categorizing and perceiving edible species as distant from humans has been extensively studied on the level of deliberate judgments of animals and humans. In the present study we wanted to determine whether information about the edibility of an artificially created species can affect one of the most automatic processes in humanity ascription: face perception. We focused on early perceptual stages of face processing as manifested in EEG signals by N170 Event Related Potentials. In an experimental study participants were assigned into two conditions, in which they were presented a series of human-animal morphed images. In one of the conditions participants were informed that the images present an edible species. Additionally, we measured participant judgments of the animals' capacity to suffer. Animal faces, which were perceived as non-edible, elicited larger N170 amplitudes than edible animal faces, suggesting that people recognize faces of non-edible animals as a face to a greater extent than edible ones. Importantly, this effect was significant only for those participants who perceived animals' capacity to suffer as relatively low. We discuss the obtained effects as a primary evidence for the very basic and automatic character of the "meat paradox", visible already in the initial stages of face perception.

Electroencephalographic findings in patients with major depressive disorder during cognitive or emotional tasks: a systematic review	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PSIQUIATRIA			English	Review						Mood disorders; unipolar; emotion; neuroanatomy; memory; cognitive neuroscience	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; AFFECTIVE STYLE; PERSPECTIVES; MODEL; ERP	Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition characterized by multiple symptoms that cause great distress. Uncovering the brain areas involved in MDD is essential for improving therapeutic strategies and predicting response to interventions. This systematic review discusses recent findings regarding cortical alterations in depressed patients during emotional or cognitive tasks, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: A search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases was carried out using the keywords EEG and depression, confined to article title. Results: The studies identified reveal the frontal cortex as an important brain structure involved in the complex neural processes associated with MDD. Findings point to disorganization of right-hemisphere activity and deficient cognitive processing in MDD. Depressed individuals tend to ruminate on negative information and respond with a pattern of relatively higher right frontal activity to emotional stimuli associated with withdrawal and isolation. Conclusion: Patients with MDD may have altered dynamic patterns of activity in several neuroanatomical structures, especially in prefrontal and limbic areas involved in affective regulation. Identification of these alterations might help predict the response of patients to different interventions more effectively and thus maximize the effects both of pharmacotherapeutic and of psychotherapeutic strategies.

However, results derived independently from these two techniques are not entirely consistent, raising questions about the relationship between hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses in the study of touch and pain processing in the newborn. To address this, we have recorded NIRS and EEG responses simultaneously for the first time in the human infant following noxious (time-locked clinically required heel lances) and innocuous tactile cutaneous stimulation in 30 newborn infants. The results show that both techniques can be used to record quantifiable and distinct innocuous and noxious evoked activity at a group level in the newborn cortex. Noxious stimulation elicits a peak hemodynamic response that is 10-fold larger than that elicited by an innocuous stimulus (HbO(2): 2.0 vs 0.3 mu M) and a distinct nociceptive-specific N3P3 waveform in electrophysiological recordings. However, a novel single-trial analysis revealed that hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses do not always co-occur at an individual level, although when they do (64% of noxious test occasions), they are significantly correlated in magnitude. These data show that, while hemodynamic and electrophysiological touch and pain brain activity in newborn infants are comparable in group analyses, important individual differences remain. These data indicate that integrated and multimodal brain monitoring is required to understand central touch and pain processing in the newborn.

Fear of Missing Out scale (FOMOs), Social Media Engagement Questionnaire (SMEQ), and Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) were administered to twenty-six healthy participants. Afterward, EEG activity was acquired during a visual task showing exclusion and inclusion social images. Event Related Potentials (ERP) and sLoreta analyses were performed. In the ERP analyses the main effect of condition was found in temporo-parietal and frontal montages. sLoreta analyses showed a greater intensity of the left secondary somatosensory cortex (BA7) in inclusion compared with exclusion condition and a greater intensity of left temporal-parietal junction (BA41, BA42, BA43) and left prefrontal cortex (BA47) in exclusion versus inclusion condition. Moreover, the main finding of correlations analyses was that the FOMOs score was positively correlated with ASQ-need for approval and with right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) only during inclusion condition. Findings sustain that fear of missing out is associated to a greater sensitivity towards social inclusive experiences rather than social exclusion and with need of belong. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wenzel, MA; Almeida, I; Blankertz, B				Wenzel, Markus A.; Almeida, Ines; Blankertz, Benjamin			Is Neural Activity Detected by ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces Task Specific?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-SEARCH; P300; P3A; MEG	Objective Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that are based on event-related potentials (ERPs) can estimate to which stimulus a user pays particular attention. In typical BCIs, the user silently counts the selected stimulus (which is repeatedly presented among other stimuli) in order to focus the attention. The stimulus of interest is then inferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Detecting attention allocation implicitly could be also beneficial for human-computer interaction (HCI), because it would allow software to adapt to the user's interest. However, a counting task would be inappropriate for the envisaged implicit application in HCI. Therefore, the question was addressed if the detectable neural activity is specific for silent counting, or if it can be evoked also by other tasks that direct the attention to certain stimuli. Approach Thirteen people performed a silent counting, an arithmetic and a memory task. The tasks required the subjects to pay particular attention to target stimuli of a random color. The stimulus presentation was the same in all three tasks, which allowed a direct comparison of the experimental conditions. Results Classifiers that were trained to detect the targets in one task, according to patterns present in the EEG signal, could detect targets in all other tasks (irrespective of some task-related differences in the EEG). Significance The neural activity detected by the classifiers is not strictly task specific but can be generalized over tasks and is presumably a result of the attention allocation or of the augmented workload. The results may hold promise for the transfer of classification algorithms from BCI research to implicit relevance detection in HCI.

The role of the EEG is to help physicians for establishing an accurate diagnosis. In neurology, a main diagnostic application of EEGs is in the case of epilepsy, as epileptic activity can create clear abnormalities on a standard EEG study (Abou-Khalil and Misulis 2006). EEG is also used as a first-line method for diagnosing many neurological disorders, such as dementias, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumours, strokes, Parkinson's disease, migraine, neuroinfections, sleep disorders and traumatic disorders of the nervous system, such as brain trauma and autism. Furthermore, EEG can also be used in the diagnosis of coma, encephalopathies and brain deaths. EEG has become very popular in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. EEG and its derivatives, event-related potentials (ERPs), are used extensively in neuroscience, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and psycho physiological research. ERPs refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli.

EEG data were recorded with an array of 128-channel sensors. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were analysed. VEP results showed a significant improvement in full-term infants' latencies with age for forwards and reversed optic flow but not random visual motion. Full-term infants at 12 months significantly differentiated between the motion conditions, with the shortest latency observed for forwards optic flow and the longest latency for random visual motion, while preterm infants did not improve their latencies with age, nor were they able to differentiate between the motion conditions at 12 months. Differences in induced activities were also observed where comparisons between TSEs of the motion conditions and a static non-flow pattern showed desynchronised theta-band activity in both full-term and preterm infants, with synchronised alpha-beta band activity observed only in the full-term infants at 12 months. Full-term infants at 12 months with a substantial amount of self-produced locomotor experience and neural maturation coupled with faster oscillating cell assemblies, rely on the perception of structured optic flow to move around efficiently in the environment. The poorer responses in the preterm infants could be related to impairment of the dorsal visual stream specialized in the processing of visual motion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In these closed-loop applications, a brain switch detects the motor intention from brain signals, e.g., scalp EEG, and triggers a neuroprosthetic device, either to deliver sensory feedback or to mimic real movements, thus re-establishing the compromised sensory motor control loop and promoting neural plasticity. In this context, single trial detection of motor intention with short latency is a prerequisite. The performance of the event detection from EEG recordings is mainly determined by three factors: the type of motor imagery (e.g., repetitive, ballistic), the frequency band (or signal modality) used for discrimination (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential), and the processing technique (e.g., time-series analysis, sub-band power estimation). In this study, we investigated single trial EEG traces during movement imagination on healthy individuals, and provided a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a short-latency brain switch when varying these three factors. The morphological investigation showed a cross-subject consistency of a prolonged negative phase in MRCP, and a delayed beta rebound in sensory-motor rhythms during repetitive tasks. The detection performance had the greatest accuracy when using ballistic MRCP with time-series analysis. In this case, the true positive rate (TPR) was similar to 70% for a detection latency of similar to 200 ms. The results presented here are of practical relevance for designing BCI systems for motor function rehabilitation.

To date, there is no evidence that alpha asymmetries can be observed in response to brief affective-motivational stimuli, as typically presented in event-related designs. As we argue, frontal alpha asymmetry might indeed be elicited by brief events if they are salient enough. In an event-related design, we used erotic pictures, i.e., highly salient incentives to elicit approach motivation, and contrasted them with pictures of dressed attractive women. As expected, we found significant alpha asymmetries for erotic pictures as compared to control pictures. Our findings suggest that the highly reactive reward system can lead to immediate, phasic changes in frontal alpha asymmetries. We discuss the findings with respect to the notion that high salience of erotic pictures derives from their potential of satisfying an individuals' need by mere visual inspection, which is not the case for pictures showing other types of motivational stimuli such as food.

A functional classification of medial frontal negativity ERPs: Theta oscillations and single subject effects	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Medial frontal cortex; Theta; Performance monitoring; Independent component analysis; Robust estimation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIDLINE THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; BRAIN DYNAMICS; EEG DYNAMICS	Theta oscillations in the EEG have been linked to several ERPs that are elicited during performance-monitoring tasks, including the error-related negativity (ERN), no-go N2, and the feedback-related negativity (FRN). We used a novel paradigm to isolate independent components (ICs) in single subjects' (n=27) EEG accounting for a medial frontal negativity (MFN) to response cue stimuli that signal a potential change in future response demands. Medial frontal projecting ICs that were sensitive to these response cues also described the ERNs, no-go N2s, and, to a lesser extent, the FRNs, that were elicited in letter flanker, go/no-go, and time-estimation tasks, respectively. In addition, percentile bootstrap tests using trimmed means indicated that the medial frontal ICs show an increase in theta activity during the ERN, no-go N2, and FRN across tasks and within individuals. Our results provide an important validation of previous studies by showing that increases in medial frontal theta to cognitively challenging events in multiple paradigms is a reliable effect within individuals and can be elicited by basic stimulus cues that signal the potential need to adjust response control. Thus, medial frontal theta reflects a neural response common to all MFN paradigms and characterizes the general process of controlling attention without the need to induce error commission, inhibited responses, or to present negative feedback.

The majority of studies examining the neural basis of face recognition have confounded these stages by comparing brain responses evoked by novel and perceptually familiar famous faces. Here, we recorded EEG in two tasks in which subjects viewed two sets of faces that were equally perceptually familiar, but which had differing levels of associated person-knowledge. Our results dissociated the effects of person-knowledge from perceptual familiarity. Faces with associated biographical information elicited a larger similar to 600 ms centroparietal positivity in both a passive viewing task in which subjects viewed faces without explicitly responding, and an active question-answering task in which subjects indicated whether or not they knew particular facts about the faces. In the question task only, person-knowledge was associated with a negative ERP difference over right posterior scalp over the 170450 ms interval which appeared again at long latency (>900 ms).

We recorded EEG while participants performed a speeded Go/No-Go task in which they signaled error commission. Visibility of the effector was manipulated, while IA was measured with a heartbeat perception task. The late Pe was larger for aware than unaware errors. The ERN was also found to be modulated by error awareness, but only when the hand was visible, suggesting that its sensitivity to error awareness depends on the availability of visual sensory feedback. Only when the response hand was visible, the late Pe amplitude to aware errors correlated with IA, suggesting that sensory feedback and IA synergistically contribute to the emergence of error awareness. These findings underscore the idea that several sources of information accumulate in time following action execution in order to enable errors to break through and reach awareness.

Using electrical neuroimaging methods, we investigated how inhibitory control training regimens can be designed to enhance frontal top-down inhibition processes. We trained participants with a Go/NoGo task in which the stimulus-response mapping rules were systematically varied. This task parameter has indeed be hypothesized to determine the extent to which top-down frontal inhibition processes are involved and thus ultimately reinforced during the training. The effects of training on inhibitory control were assessed by analyzing the event-related potentials (ERPs) measured during the Go/NoGo task with a data-driven time- and electrode-wise 2 x 2 ANOVA with factors Session (beginning; end of the training) and Stimuli (Go; NoGo). To localize the sources of the ERP effects in the brain, the same statistical design was applied to distributed electrical source estimations averaged over the periods of ERP modulations. The training improved inhibitory control performance. Electrophysiologically, we found a significant Session x Stimulus interaction at 300-400 ms post-stimulus onset over centro-occipital electrodes. Statistical parametric mapping on the brain source estimations revealed an interaction within right inferior frontal cortices driven by a decrease in response strength to NoGo but not to Go trials in this region. Our collective results demonstrate that frontal top-down inhibition processes can be enhanced with specifically designed inhibitory control training regimens.

Accounting for microsaccadic artifacts in the EEG using independent component analysis and beamforming	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Oscillation; time frequency analyses; Visual processes	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION	Neuronal activity in the gamma-band range was long considered a marker of object representation. However, scalp-recorded EEG activity in this range is contaminated by a miniature saccade-related muscle artifact. Independent component analysis (ICA) has been proposed as a method of removal of such artifacts. Alternatively, beamforming, a source analysis method in which potential sources of activity across the whole brain are scanned independently through the use of adaptive spatial filters, offers a promising method of accounting for the artifact without relying on its explicit removal. We present here the application of ICA-based correction to a previously published dataset. Then, using beamforming, we examine the effect of ICA correction on the scalp-recorded EEG signal and the extent to which genuine activity is recoverable before and after ICA correction. We find that beamforming attributes much of the scalp-recorded gamma-band signal before correction to deep frontal sources, likely the eye muscles, which generate the artifact related to each miniature saccade. Beamforming confirms that what is removed by ICA is predominantly this artifactual signal, and that what remains after correction plausibly originates in the visual cortex. Thus, beamforming allows researchers to confirm whether their removal procedures successfully removed the artifact. Our results demonstrate that ICA-based correction brings about general improvements in signal-to-noise ratio suggesting it should be used along with, rather than be replaced by, beamforming.

In the current study, I modified a redundancy-gain paradigm to investigate these issues. A set of features was presented in a two-object memory display, followed by a single object probe. Participants judged whether the probe contained any features of the memory display, regardless of its location. Response time distributions revealed feature coactivation only when both features of a single object in the memory display appeared together in the probe, regardless of the response time benefit from the probe and memory objects sharing the same location. This finding suggests that a shared location is necessary in the formation of bound representations but unnecessary in their maintenance. Electroencephalography data showed that amplitude modulations reflecting location-unbound feature coactivation were different from those reflecting the location-sharing benefit, consistent with the behavioral finding that feature-location binding is unnecessary in the maintenance of color-shape binding.

We report an experimental investigation to detect noninvasive electrophysiological response induced by low-intensity tFUS in an in vivo animal model and perform electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) of tFUS-induced brain activity from noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. Methods: A single-element ultrasound transducer was used to generate low-intensity tFUS (I-spta < 1 mW/cm(2)) and induce brain activation at multiple selected sites in an in vivo rat model. Up to 16 scalp electrodes were used to record tFUS-induced EEG. Event-related potentials were analyzed in time, frequency, and spatial domains. Current source distributions were estimated by ESI to reconstruct spatiotemporal distributions of brain activation induced by tFUS. Results: Neuronal activation was observed following low-intensity tFUS, as correlated to tFUS intensity and sonication duration. ESI revealed initial focal activation in cortical area corresponding to tFUS stimulation site and the activation propagating to surrounding areas over time. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasively recording brain electrophysiological response in vivo following low-intensity tFUS stimulation, and the feasibility of imaging spatiotemporal distributions of brain activation as induced by tFUS in vivo. Significance: The present approach may lead to a new means of imaging brain activity using tFUS perturbation and a closed-loop ESI-guided tFUS neuromodulation modality.

EEG data were acquired through a 19-channel wireless system from eight adults under two conditions - in a constrained position and involving head-body movements. The movement EEG data was pre-processed using an artifact reduction algorithm and both datasets were processed to extract neurophysiological features - ERP components and from functional connectivity measures. The functional connectivity measures were processed using a brain connectivity toolbox and gray level co-occurrence matrices to generate a total of 463 features. The feature set was split into: training dataset comprising of constrained and movement EEG data and test dataset comprising of only movement EEG data. A retrospective cross-validation approach was run on the training dataset in conjunction with two classifiers (LDA and SVM) and the ranked feature set, to select the best features using a sequential forward selection algorithm. The best features were further used to prospectively classify the three emotions in the test dataset. Our results show that we can successfully classify the emotions using LDA with an accuracy of 89% and using top 17 ranked features.

Auditory discrimination predicts linguistic outcome in Italian infants with and without familial risk for language learning impairment	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Language acquisition; Infants; Auditory discrimination; Language learning impairment; EEG/ERPs; Cross-cultural	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; GENETIC INFLUENCES; BRAIN RESPONSES; SOUND DURATION; CHILDREN; SPEECH; MATURATION	Infants' ability to discriminate between auditory stimuli presented in rapid succession and differing in fundamental frequency (Rapid Auditory Processing [RAP] abilities) has been shown to be anomalous in infants at familial risk for Language Learning Impairment (LLI) and to predict later language outcomes. This study represents the first attempt to investigate RAP in Italian infants at risk for LLI (FH+), examining two critical acoustic features: frequency and duration, both embedded in a rapidly-presented acoustic environment. RAP skills of 24 FH+ and 32 control (FH) Italian 6-month-old infants were characterized via EEG/ERP using a multi-feature oddball paradigm. Outcome measures of expressive vocabulary were collected at 20 months. Group differences favoring FH-infants were identified: in FH+ infants, the latency of the N2(*) peak was delayed and the mean amplitude of the positive mismatch response was reduced, primarily for frequency discrimination and within the right hemisphere. Moreover, both EEG measures were correlated with language scores at 20 months. Results indicate that RAP abilities are atypical in Italian infants with a first-degree relative affected by LLI and that this impacts later linguistic skills. These findings provide a compelling cross-linguistic comparison with previous research on American infants, supporting the biological unity hypothesis of LLI. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Auditory M50 Sensory Gating Deficit and Superior Temporal Gyrus Pathology in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder	COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Article; Book Chapter							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEUROCIRCUITRY MODELS; COMBAT VETERANS; WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTION; EEG; DYSFUNCTION; ASYMMETRY; PERFORMANCE	Neurocognitive dysfunction has been well established in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the neurobiological underpinnings of this dysfunction are not well understood. A rich line of PTSD research has investigated changes in auditory information processing of non-traumatic (neutral) stimuli through analysis of evoked responses. A number of previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies in PTSD have found impaired sensory gating of the P50 auditory potential using a paired click (500 ms) paradigm. However, since the P50 signal is best measured in the midline (electrode Cz), the hemispheric and neuronal (source space) etiologies of this deficit in PTSD are not well understood. We utilized magnetoencephalography to measure gating of the 50 ms evoked field (M50), which is equivalent to P50, in a group of seven Vietnam veterans with PTSD with combat-related PTSD and ten normal controls. Using MEG and magnetic source imaging, we found that M50 is localized to the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Furthermore, M50 gating was impaired in PTSD patients, but only in the right hemisphere and right M50 amplitude correlated with PTSD symptomatology. Using a regression model, we also found that thinner right hemisphere STG cortical thickness predicted sensory gating deficits. Our work suggests that abnormalities in early abnormal information processing in PTSD, particularly filtering of redundant stimuli, are explained by structural changes in the right temporal lobe (STG). There is growing literature documenting cortical thinning in PTSD patients involving mainly the frontal and temporal lobes; other groups have found specific changes in the STG. We discuss our findings in light of other evidence of abnormal hemispheric lateralization and temporal lobe dysfunction in PTSD.

A directed forgetting (DF) procedure was used during the recording of EEG to answer the question whether is it possible to forget a face that has been encoded within a particular emotional context. A face-scene phase in which a neutral face was showed in a neutral or emotional scene (positive, negative) was followed by the voluntary memory cue (cue phase) indicating whether the face had to-be remember or to-be forgotten (TBR and TBF). Memory for faces was then assessed with an old/new recognition task. Behaviorally, we found that it is harder to suppress faces-in-positive-scenes compared to faces-in-negative and neutral-scenes. The temporal information obtained by the ERPs showed: 1) during the face-scene phase, the Late Positive Potential (LPP), which indexes motivated emotional attention, was larger for faces-in-negative scenes compared to faces-in-neutral-scenes. 2) Remarkably, during the cue phase, ERPs were significantly modulated by the emotional contexts. Faces-in-neutral scenes showed an ERP pattern that has been typically associated to DF effect whereas faces-in-positive-scenes elicited the reverse ERP pattern. Faces-in-negative scenes did not show differences in the DF-related neural activities but larger N1 amplitude for TBF vs. TBR faces may index early attentional deployment. These results support the hypothesis that the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the contexts (through attentional broadening and narrowing mechanisms, respectively) may modulate the effectiveness of intentional memory suppression for neutral information.

The neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying changes in sensory reactivity are not well understood. Based on the idea that neurodevelopmental changes in somatosensory processing and/or changes in sensory adaptation might underlie developmental differences in somatosensory reactivity, high-density electroencephalography was used to examine how the nervous system responds and adapts to repeated vibrotactile stimulation over childhood. Participants aged 6-18 yr old were presented with 50-ms vibrotactile stimuli to the right wrist over the median nerve at 5 blocked interstimulus intervals (ranging from similar to 7 to similar to 1 stimulus per second). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) revealed three major phases of activation within the first 200 ms, with scalp topographies suggestive of neural generators in contralateral somatosensory cortex. Although overall SEPs were highly similar for younger, middle, and older age groups (6.1-9.8, 10.0-12.9, and 13.0-17.8 yr old), there were significant age-related amplitude differences in initial and later phases of the SEP. In contrast, robust adaptation effects for fast vs. slow presentation rates were observed that did not differ as a function of age. A greater amplitude response in the later portion of the SEP was observed for the youngest group and may be related to developmental changes in responsivity to somatosensory stimuli. These data suggest the protracted development of the somatosensory system over childhood, whereas adaptation, as assayed in this study, is largely in place by similar to 7 yr of age.

However, artifacts in EEG data introduced by theMR scanner still remain a major obstacle. This study, employing commonly used artifact correction steps, shows that head motion, one overlooked major source of artifacts in EEG-fMRI data, can cause plausible EEG effects and EEG-BOLD correlations. Specifically, low-frequency EEG (<20 Hz) is strongly correlated with in-scanner movement. Accordingly, minor head motion (<0.2 mm) induces spurious effects in a twofold manner: Small differences in task-correlated motion elicit spurious low-frequency effects, and, as motion concurrently influences fMRI data, EEG-BOLD correlations closely match motion-fMRI correlations. We demonstrate these effects in a memory encoding experiment showing that obtained theta power (similar to 3-7 Hz) effects and channel-level theta-BOLD correlations reflect motion in the scanner. These findings highlight an important caveat that needs to be addressed by future EEG-fMRI studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This timing information is critical in that spoken language almost always occurs in the context of joint speech (i.e., conversations) where effective communication requires the precise timing of speaker turn-taking a core aspect of prosody. Here, we used event-related potentials to characterize neural activity elicited by conversation stimuli within a large, unselected adult sample (N = 115). We focused on two stages of speech perception: inter-speaker gaps and speaker responses. We found activation in two known speech perception networks, with functional and neuroanatomical specificity: silence during inter-speaker gaps primarily activated the posterior pathway involving the supramarginal gyrus and premotor cortex, whereas hearing speaker responses primarily activated the anterior pathway involving the superior temporal gyrus. These data provide the first direct evidence that the posterior pathway is uniquely involved in monitoring speaker turn-taking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Behavioral and EEG Evidence for Auditory Memory Suppression	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						think/no-think; EEG; forgetting; auditory memory; directed forgetting; memory suppression	THINK/NO-THINK PARADIGM; UNWANTED MEMORIES; TERM-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; RECOGNITION; RETRIEVAL; BRAIN; MECHANISMS; SIGNATURES	The neural basis of motivated forgetting using the Think/No-Think (TNT) paradigm is receiving increased attention with a particular focus on the mechanisms that enable memory suppression. However, most TNT studies have been limited to the visual domain. To assess whether and to what extent direct memory suppression extends across sensory modalities, we examined behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of auditory TNT in healthy young adults by adapting the TNT paradigm to the auditory modality. Behaviorally, suppression of memory strength was indexed by prolonged response time (RTs) during the retrieval of subsequently remembered No-Think words. We examined task-related EEG activity of both attempted memory retrieval and inhibition of a previously learned target word during the presentation of its paired associate. Event-related EEG responses revealed two main findings: (1) a centralized Think > No-Think positivity during auditory word presentation (from approximately 0-500 ms); and (2) a sustained Think positivity over parietal electrodes beginning at approximately 600 ms reflecting the memory retrieval effect which was significantly reduced for No-Think words. In addition, word-locked theta (4-8 Hz) power was initially greater for No-Think compared to Think during auditory word presentation over fronto-central electrodes. This was followed by a posterior theta increase indexing successful memory retrieval in the Think condition. The observed event-related potential pattern and theta power analysis are similar to that reported in visual TNT studies and support a modality non-specific mechanism for memory inhibition. The EEG data also provide evidence supporting differing roles and time courses of frontal and parietal regions in the flexible control of auditory memory.

The brain activity is observed via Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the Electroencephalography (EEG) generated in response to a stimulus. ERPs were collected while subjects were viewing images with positive or negative emotional content. Building inter-subject discrimination models is a challenging problem due to the high ERPs variability between individuals. We propose to solve this problem with the aid of the Echo State Networks (ESN) as a general framework for extracting the most relevant discriminative features between multiple subjects. The original feature vector is mapped into the reservoir feature space defined by the number of the reservoir equilibrium states. The dominant features are extracted iteratively from low dimensional combinations of reservoir states. The relevance of the new feature space was validated by experiments with standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. From one side this proof of concept application enhances the usability context of the reservoir computing for high dimensional static data representations by low-dimensional feature transformation as functions of the reservoir states. From other side, the proposed solution for emotion valence detection across subjects is suitable for brain studies as a complement to statistical methods. This problem is important because such decision making systems constitute "virtual sensors'' of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications.

With the continuous and dedicated efforts by many researchers, application of BCI technology has not only proved significant for disabled but also for healthy individuals. Here we have discussed about one such well known BCI paradigm i.e. P300 speller. The conventional P300 speller is actually based on detecting P300 signal through EEG recordings, which is supposed to occur when the subject sees targeted character or task. In this paper, we have discussed about the ensemble machine learning approach to detect the P300. Our main objective is to discuss the significance of ensemble techniques to classify and predict Event Related Potential (ERP). We have used two such well known ensemble techniques; Random Forest (RF) and Ensemble Support Vector Machines (ESVM). Finally we obtained ceiling level classification accuracy with minimum number of trials. These proposed techniques attest the viability for possible BCI applications using simple ERPs.

Here we examine whether the processing of individual words in silent reading is similarly impacted by rhythmic properties of the surrounding context. We recorded participants' EEG as they read lists of either three trochaic or iambic disyllabic words followed by a target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the preceding metric pattern. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) to targets were modulated by an interaction between metrical structure (iambic vs. trochaic) and congruence: for iambs, more positive ERPs were observed in the incongruent than congruent condition 250-400 ms and 400-600 ms post-stimulus, whereas no reliable impact of congruence was found for trochees. We suggest that when iambs are in an incongruent context, i.e., preceded by trochees, the context contains the metrical structure that is more typical in participants' native language which facilitates processing relative to when they are presented in a congruent context, containing the less typical, i.e., iambic, metrical structure. The results provide evidence that comprehenders are sensitive to the prosodic properties of the context even in silent reading, such that this sensitivity impacts lexico-semantic processing of individual words.

To address this issue, we used event-related potentials (ERP) methodology to probe the multisensory integration of face and non-semantic sounds in schizophrenia. EEG was recorded from 18 schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects in three conditions: neutral faces (visual condition-VIS); neutral non-semantic sounds (auditory condition-AUD); neutral faces presented simultaneously with neutral non-semantic sounds (audiovisual condition-AUDVIS). When compared with HC, the schizophrenia group showed less negative N170 to both face and face-voice stimuli; later P270 peak latency in the multimodal condition of face-voice relative to unimodal condition of face (the reverse was true in HC); reduced P400 amplitude and earlier P400 peak latency in the face but not in the voice-face condition. Thus, the analysis of ERP components suggests that deficits in the encoding of facial information extend to multimodal face-voice stimuli and that delays exist in feature extraction from multimodal face-voice stimuli in schizophrenia. In contrast, categorization processes seem to benefit from the presentation of simultaneous face-voice information. Timepoint by timepoint tests of multimodal integration did not suggest impairment in the initial stages of processing in schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Currently, only hospital centers perform similar analyses through fixed and wired electroencephalography (EEG) inspection. The solution proposed here works wirelessly and improves its accuracy learning by performances of the subject playing a game/test. The system is based on spatio-temporal detection and characterization of a specific brain potential named P300. It includes: i) a wearable wireless EEG device; ii) a gateway (tablet or smartphone) processing gathered data, also providing the test/game to the user. Given the above hardware settings, a new algorithm, named tuned-Residue Iteration Decomposition (t-RIDE), provides spatiotemporal features of P300s and a semantic-based reasoner allows taking into account factors which could modify the test if performed in non-standard conditions. The system has been adopted with 12 subjects involved in three different cognitive tasks with increasing difficulty. Fast diagnosis of cognitive deficits is reached, including mild and heavy impairments cases: t-RIDE processing is performed in 1.95s (after 79 iterations for convergence) whereas semantic matchmaking routine requires 2.5ms in the worst case. A case study for an Alzheimer injured patient is reported to corroborate and clarify the proposed approach.

Several types of fatigue are discussed, comprising sleep-related fatigue, active task-related fatigue (as a consequence of workload in demanding driving situations) as well as passive task-related fatigue (as related to monotonous driving situations). The present study investigated actual states of fatigue in a monotonous driving situation, using EEG measures and a long-lasting driving simulation experiment, in which drivers had to keep the vehicle on track by compensating crosswind of different strength. Performance data and electrophysiological correlates of mental fatigue (EEG Alpha and Theta power, Inter Trial Coherence (ITC), and auditory event-related potentials to short sound stimuli) were analyzed. Driving errors and driving lane variability increased with time on task and with increasing crosswind. The posterior Alpha and Theta power also increased with time on task, but decreased with stronger crosswind. The Pia to sound stimuli decreased with time on task when the crosswind was weak, but remained stable when the crosswind was strong. The analysis of ITC revealed less frontal Alpha and Theta band synchronization with time on task, but no effect of crosswind. The results suggest that Alpha power in monotonous driving situations reflects boredom or attentional withdrawal due to monotony rather than the decline of processing abilities as a consequence of high mental effort. A more valid indicator of declining mental resources with increasing time on task seems to be provided by brain oscillatory synchronization measures and event-related activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet most of these studies test metaphor in isolation while in natural conversation metaphors do not come out of the blue but embedded in linguistic and extra-linguistic context. This study aimed at assessing the role of context in the metaphor comprehension process. We recorded EEG activity while participants were presented with metaphors and equivalent literal expressions in a minimal context (Experiment 1) and in a supportive context where the word expressing the ground between the metaphor's topic and vehicle was made explicit (Experiment 2). The N400 effect was visible only in minimal context, whereas the P600 was visible both in the absence and in the presence of contextual cues. These findings suggest that the N400 observed for metaphor is related to contextual aspects, possibly indexing contextual expectations on upcoming words that guide lexical access and retrieval, while the P600 seems to reflect truly pragmatic interpretative processes needed to make sense of a metaphor and derive the speaker's meaning, also in the presence of contextual cues. In sum, previous information in the linguistic context biases toward a metaphorical interpretation but does not suppress interpretative pragmatic mechanisms to establish the intended meaning.

P300) is a most prominent component of event-related EEG potentials recorded during task performance. There has been long-standing debate about whether the process reflected by P3 is tactical or strategic, i.e., required for making the present response or constituting some overarching process. Here, we used residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) to delineate P3 subcomponents time-locked to responses and tested for the temporal relations between P3 components and response times (RTs). Data were obtained in oddball tasks (i.e., tasks presenting two stimuli, one rarely and one frequently) with rare and frequent go, no-go, or choice responses (CRs). As usual, rare-go P3s were large at Pz and rare no-go P3s at FCz. Notably, P3s evoked with rare CRs were large at either site, probably comprising both go and no-go P3. Throughout, with frequent and rare responses, P3 latencies coincided with RTs. RIDE decomposed P3 complexes into a large CPz-focused C-P3 and an earlier Pz-focused response-locked R-P3. R-P3 had an additional large fronto-central focus with rare CRs, modeling the no-go-P3 part, suggesting that the process reflected by no-go P3 is tightly time-locked to making the alternative response. R-P3 coincided with the fast RTs to frequent stimuli and C-P3 coincided with the slower RTs to rare stimuli. Thus, the process reflected by C-P3 might be required for responding to rare events, but not to frequent ones. We argue that these results are nevertheless compatible with a tactical role of P3 because responses may not be contingent on stimulus analysis with frequent stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

There is a recent trend to detect more than one of these signals in one system to create a hybrid BCI. However, in this case, EEG data were always divided into groups and analyzed by the separate processing procedures. As a result, the interactive effects were ignored when different types of BCI tasks were executed simultaneously. In this work, we propose an improved tensor based multiclass multimodal scheme especially for hybrid BCI, in which EEG signals are denoted as multiway tensors, a nonredundant rank-one tensor decomposition model is proposed to obtain nonredundant tensor components, a weighted fisher criterion is designed to select multimodal discriminative patterns without ignoring the interactive effects, and support vector machine (SVM) is extended to multiclass classification. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can not only identify the different changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations induced by different types of tasks but also capture the interactive effects of simultaneous tasks properly. Therefore, it has great potential use for hybrid BCI.

While research suggests that both sources of conflicting information may interact in their modulation of controlled behavior, it has remained unclear which cognitive sub-processes involved in controlled behavior are affected by this interaction; i.e., at which processing level subliminally and consciously induced response conflicts interact in modulating controlled behavior. Moreover, we investigated whether this interaction of subliminally and consciously induced response conflicts was due to a nexus between the two types of conflict like a common cognitive process or factor. For this, n = 38 healthy young subjects completed a paradigm which combines subliminal primes and consciously perceived flankers while an electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. We show that the interaction of subliminal and conscious sources of conflict is not restricted to the response selection level (N2) but can already be shown at the earliest stages of perceptual and attentional processing (P1). While the degree of early attentional processing of subliminal information seems to depend on the absence of consciously perceived response conflicts, conflicts during the stage of response selection may be either reduced or enhanced by subliminal priming. Moreover, the results showed that even though the two different sources of conflict interact at the response selection level, they clearly originate from two distinct processes that interact before they detrimentally affect cognitive control.

ERP evidence of preserved early memory function in term infants with neonatal encephalopathy following therapeutic hypothermia	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							AUDITORY RECOGNITION MEMORY; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; DIABETIC MOTHERS; PRETERM INFANTS; BIRTH ASPHYXIA; HUMAN BRAIN; AGE; CHILDREN; BORN	BACKGROUND: Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) carries high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) reduces this risk, particularly for moderate encephalopathy (ME). Nevertheless, these infants often have subtle functional deficits, including abnormal memory function. Detection of deficits at the earliest possible time-point would allow for intervention during a period of maximal brain plasticity. METHODS: Recognition memory function in 22 infants with NE treated with TH was compared to 23 healthy controls using event-related potentials (ERPs) at 2 wk of age. ERPs were recorded to mother's voice alternating with a stranger's voice to assess attentional responses (P2), novelty detection (slow wave), and discrimination between familiar and novel (difference wave). Development was tested at 12 mo using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). RESULTS:The NE group showed similar ERP components and BSID-III scores to controls. However, infants with NE showed discrimination at midline leads (P = 0.01), whereas controls showed discrimination in the left hemisphere (P = 0.05). Normal MRI (P = 0.05) and seizure-free electroencephalogram (EEG) (P = 0.04) correlated positively with outcomes. CONCLUSION: Infants with NE have preserved recognition memory function after TH. The spatially different recognition memory processing after early brain injury may represent compensatory changes in the brain circuitry and reflect a benefit of TH.

Here, we investigate how such phoneme clusters that potentially serve as sublexical markers of affect can influence language processing. We registered the EEG signal during a lexical decision task with a novel manipulation of the words' putative sublexical affective potential: the means of valence and arousal values for single phoneme clusters, each computed as a function of respective values of words from the database these phoneme clusters occur in. Our experimental manipulations also investigate potential contributions of formal salience to the sublexical affective potential: Typically, negative high-arousing phonological segments based on our calculations tend to be less frequent and more structurally complex than neutral ones. We thus constructed two experimental sets, one involving this natural confound, while controlling for it in the other. A negative high-arousing sublexical affective potential in the strictly controlled stimulus set yielded an early posterior negativity (EPN), in similar ways as an independent manipulation of lexical affective content did. When other potentially salient formal features at the sublexical level were not controlled for, the effect of the sublexical affective potential was strengthened and prolonged (250-650 ms), presumably because formal salience helps making specific phoneme clusters efficient sublexical markers of negative high arousing affective meaning. These neurophysiological data support the assumption that the organization of a language's vocabulary involves systematic sound-to-meaning correspondences at the phonemic level that influence the way we process language.

However, the quantitative differences in ERD values and affected frequency bands associated with the lower limb have not been discussed. The goal of this paper was to quantitatively compare the ERD patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb. 64-channel EEG signals were recorded to investigate the brain oscillatory patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb in twelve healthy subjects. And passive movement and FES-induced movement were also performed in a hemiplegic stroke patient. For healthy subjects, FES-induced movement presented significantly higher characteristic frequency of central beta ERD while there was no significant difference in ERD values compared with active or passive movement. Meanwhile, beta ERD values of FES-induced movement were significantly correlated with those of active movement, and spatial distribution of beta ERD pattern for FES-induced movement was more correlated with that for active movement. In addition, the stroke patient presented central ERD patterns during FES-induced movement, while no ERD with similar frequencies could be found during passive movement. This work implies that the EEG oscillatory pattern under FES-induced movement tends more towards active movement instead of passive movement. The quantification of ERD patterns could be expected as a potential technique to evaluate the brain response during FES-induced movement.

Past event-related potential (ERP) research investigating processing of affective stimuli in schizophrenia was done mainly with facial expressions and revealed impaired facial emotion recognition in patients relative to control subjects. Experimentations involving fMRI with this group of patients, showed alteration of limbic and frontal regions in response to emotional unpleasant images, compared to neutral stimuli during a memory task. Other studies have also noted an increase in brain activity when the activation of the stimuli was high compared to low arousal stimuli. This may indicate a different sensitivity threshold to emotional arousal and emotional valence involving frontal pathways in these patients. But very few studies attempted to separate the contributions of emotional valence and arousal within an episodic memory protocol with ERP, in that population. Goal The aim of the current research is to investigate brain electro-cortical activity in schizophrenia in response to emotional images during an episodic memory task. Method ERP components were analyzed in 16 schizophrenic and 17 control participants matched for age, sex and intelligence. ERPs were obtained from 56 EEG electrodes. The tasks consisted in a classical episodic memory task that presented 100 repeated old and 100 new photographic images divided into four categories (unpleasant-high arousal, unpleasant-low arousal, pleasant-high arousal and pleasant-low arousal) selected from the International Affective Picture System. The N200, P300 and late positive component (LPC) mean amplitude, were analyzed using repeated-measure analyses of variance (MANOVA). Results Patients with schizophrenia and control subjects gave comparable subjective evaluations of arousal and valence. However, the frontal N200 and the P300 both showed an interaction of the group x memory x valence x hemisphere (F [1.32]= 8.36; p < .01). Thus, this complex interaction denotes an increase of the episodic memory effect in the right hemisphere in response to unpleasant stimuli, with schizophrenic patients. With respect to the control group, there is also an increase of this memory effect in the right hemisphere, but in response to pleasant stimuli. The schizophrenic patients presented a smaller LPC memory effect, especially at the frontal region. More specifically, the frontal LPC was reduced, and the clinical group was less reactive to the emotional arousal content, compared to the control group. Discussion Altogether, our results revealed that while the subjective evaluation of emotional pictures is equivalent across groups, cerebral differences are present in schizophrenic patients during emotional recognition. N200 and P300 results in the frontal region suggest impaired selective attention and episodic memory to unpleasant stimuli in patients, while later processes related to conscious recollection parietal LPC) are not affected with patients affected with schizophrenia. Conclusion This finding provides further support for the notion of a possible discrepancy between the subjective experience and the physiological expression of emotions in schizophrenia patients. Those results could open the door to new clinical research investigations in psychiatry, particularly in the comprehension of a relationship between frontal cortex vulnerability and episodic memory often present in psychosis.

Denial of drug abuse and drug craving are two important factors that make the diagnosis and treatment extremely challenging. Here, we present a novel and rapid noninvasive method with potential application for differentiation and monitoring methamphetamine abuse. Methods: Visual stimuli comprised a series of images with neutral and methamphetamine-related content. A total of 10 methamphetamine abusers and 10 age-gender matched controls participated in the experiments. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded and compared using a time window analysis method. The ERPs were divided into 19 time windows of 100 ms with 50 ms overlaps. The area of positive sections below each window was calculated to measure the differences between the two groups. Results: Significant differences between two groups were observed from 250 to 500 ms (P300) in response to methamphetamine-related visual stimuli and 600 to 800 ms in response to neutral stimuli. Conclusion: This study presented a novel and noninvasive method based on neural correlates to discriminate healthy individuals from methamphetamine drug abusers. This method can be employed in treatment and monitoring of the methamphetamine abuse.

Studies on meditation techniques using a behavioral measurement of the Attention Network Test (ANT) have shown enhanced attention control, but neural features remain unknown. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral data from twenty long-term meditators were examined, compared to data obtained from twenty matched controls. Results showed that meditators made fewer error responses than controls, especially during the incongruent target condition, suggesting higher accuracy in executive attention control among meditators. The P3 amplitude in the parietal area remained constant in the congruent and incongruent target conditions among meditators, indicating a higher parietal P3 amplitude during the incongruent target condition relative to matched controls. The findings that meditators exhibited fewer error responses on the ANT and a lack of parietal P3 modulation irrespective of reaction time are discussed in the context of attentional resource allocation.

Interictal epileptiform bursts, which are more prevalent than seizures, may provide complementary information to aid in epilepsy evaluation. In this study, we leverage a long-term iEEG dataset from canines with naturally occurring epilepsy to investigate interictal bursts and their electrographic relationship to seizures. Methods: Four dogs were included in this study, each monitored previously with continuous iEEG for periods of 475.7, 329.9, 45.8, and 451.8 days, respectively, for a total of > 11,000 h. Seizures and bursts were detected and validated by two board- certified epileptologists. A published Bayesian model was applied to analyze the dynamics of interictal epileptic bursts on EEG and compare them to seizures. Results: In three dogs, bursts were stereotyped and found to be statistically similar to periods before or near seizure onsets. Seizures from one dog during status epilepticus were markedly different from other seizures in terms of burst similarity. Significance: Shorter epileptic bursts explored in this work have the potential to yield significant information about the distribution of epileptic events. In our data, bursts are at least an order of magnitude more prevalent than seizures and occur much more regularly. Our finding that bursts often display pronounced similarity to seizure onsets suggests that they contain relevant information about the epileptic networks from which they arise and may aide in the clinical evaluation of epilepsy in patients.

The acute effects of yoga on cognitive measures for women with premenstrual syndrome	DEUTSCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR AKUPUNKTUR			English	Article								Objectives: Recently, yoga classes specifically for women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have increased, but there is little research about the efficacy of these classes. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of yoga exercise on women with PMS and to evaluate the immediate change of attention performance after yoga classes. Methods: This study examined the attention task results of women with PMS. Eleven women with PMS and 9 women without PMS were recruited. The PMS group took the tests before and immediately after the yoga class both in the luteal and follicular phase of one menstrual cycle, while the control group took the tests only twice: once in the luteal phase and once in the follicular phase. Both groups were required to finish resting electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive task of the 2-back task with EEG recording. Results: The alpha brain wave percentage was higher immediately after yoga exercise in the PMS group. This suggests that the participants felt more relaxed or were in a more peaceful mental condition after yoga exercise. In the 2-back task, the PMS group needed a longer reaction time to respond to the target stimulus in the luteal phase and performed better with higher accuracy and shorter reaction time after yoga exercise. The event-related potentials of the EEG recording displayed a significant variability at the P3 amplitude throughout the menstrual cycle in the PMS group, but the P3 amplitude was unchanged throughout the menstrual cycle in the control group.

AV associations were indexed by early and late event related potentials (ERPs) and by oscillatory power and phase locking. Different AV experience was produced via a context manipulation. Participants were presented with valid (the conventional pairing) and invalid AV speech items in either a 'reliable' context (80% AVvalid items) or an 'unreliable' context (80% AVinvalid items). The results showed that for the reliable context, there was N1 facilitation for AV compared to auditory only speech. This N1 facilitation was not affected by AV validity. Later ERPs showed a difference in amplitude between valid and invalid AV speech and there was significant enhancement of power for valid versus invalid AV speech. These response patterns did not change over the context manipulation, suggesting that the internal models of AV speech were not updated by experience. The results also showed that the facilitation of N1 responses did not vary as a function of the salience of visual speech (as previously reported); in post-hoc analyses, it appeared instead that N1 facilitation varied according to the relative time of the acoustic onset, suggesting for AV events N1 may be more sensitive to the relationship of AV timing than form.

J	Chmielewski, WX; Beste, C				Chmielewski, Witold X.; Beste, Christian			Perceptual conflict during sensorimotor integration processes - a neurophysiological study in response inhibition	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; INTERFERENCE; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; COMPONENTS; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY	A multitude of sensory inputs needs to be processed during sensorimotor integration. A crucial factor for detecting relevant information is its complexity, since information content can be conflicting at a perceptual level. This may be central to executive control processes, such as response inhibition. This EEG study aims to investigate the system neurophysiological mechanisms behind effects of perceptual conflict on response inhibition. We systematically modulated perceptual conflict by integrating a Global-local task with a Go/Nogo paradigm. The results show that conflicting perceptual information, in comparison to non-conflicting perceptual information, impairs response inhibition performance. This effect was evident regardless of whether the relevant information for response inhibition is displayed on the global, or local perceptual level. The neurophysiological data suggests that early perceptual/attentional processing stages do not underlie these modulations. Rather, processes at the response selection level (P3), play a role in changed response inhibition performance. This conflict-related impairment of inhibitory processes is associated with activation differences in (inferior) parietal areas (BA7 and BA40) and not as commonly found in the medial prefrontal areas. This suggests that various functional neuroanatomical structures may mediate response inhibition and that the functional neuroanatomical structures involved depend on the complexity of sensory integration processes.

Functional brain imaging studies can reveal mechanisms of cognitive impairment in CSVD, although findings are mixed. Methods: A systematic review integrating findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in CSVD is involved. Results: CSVD damages long-range white matter tracts connecting nodes within distributed brain networks. It also disrupts frontosubcortical circuits and cholinergic fiber tracts mediating attentional processes. These changes, illustrated within a model of network dynamics, synergistically relate to neurodegenerative pathology contributing to dementia. Discussion: The effects of CSVD on attention and executive functioning are best understood within a network model of cognition as revealed by functional neuroimaging. Analysis of network function in CSVD can improve characterization of disease severity and treatment effects, and it can inform theoretical models of brain function.

Efficient mental workload estimation using task-independent EEG features	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						mental workload; EEG; spatial filtering; classification; time-on-task	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; LOAD; ATTENTION; SENSITIVITY; SYSTEMS	Objective. Mental workload is frequently estimated by EEG -based mental state monitoring systems. Usually, these systems use spectral markers and event -related potentials (ERPs). To our knowledge, no study has directly compared their performance for mental workload assessment, nor evaluated the stability in time of these markers and of the performance of the associated mental workload estimators. This study proposes a comparison of two processing chains, one based on the power in five frequency bands, and one based on ERPs, both including a spatial filtering step (respectively CSP and CCA), an FLDA classification and a 10 -fold cross validation. Approach. To get closer to a real life implementation, spectral markers were extracted from a short window (i.e. towards reactive systems) that did not include any motor activity and the analyzed ERPs were elicited by a task -independent probe that required a reflex -like answer (i.e. close to the ones required by dead man's vigilance devices). The data were acquired from 20 participants who performed a Sternberg memory task for 90 min (i.e. 2/6 digits to memorize) inside which a simple detection task was inserted. The results were compared both when the testing was performed at the beginning and end of the session. Main results. Both chains performed significantly better than random; however the one based on the spectral markers had a low performance (60%) and was not stable in time. Conversely, the ERP-based chain gave very high results (91%) and was stable in time. Significance. This study demonstrates that an efficient and stable in time workload estimation can be achieved using task -independent spatially filtered ERPs elicited in a minimally intrusive manner.	[Roy, R.

They are crucially linked to prefrontal cortex function as well as to other cortical and subcortical brain functions, which are maturing throughout childhood at different rates. Recent behavioral research suggested that children's EFs were related to parenting quality and child attachment security, but the neural correlates of these associations are unknown. With this study we tested in 4- to 6-year-old healthy children (N = 27) how emotional availability (EA) of the mother-child-interaction was associated with behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition (a core EF) in a Go/Nogo task, using event-related potential recordings (ERPs), and with behavioral performance in a Delay of Gratification (DoG) and a Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders task (HTKS). Our data showed that the Go/Nogo task modulated children's ERP components resembling adult electrophysiological indices of response inhibition- the N2 and P3/LPC ERPs-, but the children's N2 and P3/LPC ERPs showed longer latencies. Higher maternal autonomy fostering behavior and greater child responsiveness were significantly associated with smaller children's N2 Go/Nogo effects at fronto-central and parietal sites and with greater Go/Nogo effects in the N2 time window at occipital sites, over and above children's age and intelligence. Additionally, greater maternal sensitivity and a higher dyadic EA quality of the mother-child-interaction went along with greater occipital Go/Nogo effects in the N2 time window, but this effect clearly diminished when we controlled for children's age and intelligence. Higher maternal autonomy-support was also positively associated with better HTKS performance, and higher dyadic EA quality went along with higher HTKS and DoG scores. However, no significant associations were found between EA variables and the behavioral response inhibition measures of the Go/Nogo task. Our results suggest that parenting qualities modulate the functionality of neural circuits involved in response inhibition, an important component of EFs. This finding, thus, indicates that parent-child interactions shape the neurocognitive development underlying EFs.

The perceptual and cognitive functions underlying this component are subject to ongoing debate. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the link between the CNV and behavioral performance is non-linear and changes depending on the cognitive context. We suggest that the CNV reflects a common core preparatory process related to brain system optimization, and other cognitive processes that depend on the specific timing task employed.

In addition, it was investigated whether these differences can be observed at the behavioural level via spontaneous facial muscle activity. Emotional content of the stimuli did not affect early P1 activity. Emotional faces elicited enhanced amplitudes of the face-sensitive N170 component, while its counterpart, the scene-related N100, was not sensitive to emotional content of scenes. At 220-280 ms, the early posterior negativity (EPN) was enhanced only slightly for fearful as compared to neutral or happy faces. However, its amplitudes were significantly enhanced during processing of scenes with positive content, particularly over the right hemisphere. Scenes of positive content also elicited enhanced spontaneous zygomatic activity from 500-750 ms onwards, while happy faces elicited no such changes. Contrastingly, both fearful faces and negative scenes elicited enhanced spontaneous corrugator activity at 500-750 ms after stimulus onset. However, relative to baseline EMG changes occurred earlier for faces (250 ms) than for scenes (500 ms) whereas for scenes activity changes were more pronounced over the whole viewing period. Taking into account all effects, the data suggests that emotional facial expressions evoke faster attentional orienting, but weaker affective neural activity and emotional behavioural responses compared to emotional scenes.

Here, we combined immersive virtual reality and EEG recording to explore whether embodying the errors of an avatar by seeing it from a first-person perspective may activate the error monitoring system in the brain of an onlooker. We asked healthy participants to observe, from a first-or third-person perspective, an avatar performing a correct or an incorrect reach-to-grasp movement toward one of two virtual mugs placed on a table. At the end of each trial, participants reported verbally how much they embodied the avatar's arm. Ratings were maximal in first-person perspective, indicating that immersive virtual reality can be a powerful tool to induce embodiment of an artificial agent, even through mere visual perception and in the absence of any cross-modal boosting. Observation of erroneous grasping from a first-person perspective enhanced error-related negativity and medial frontal theta power in the trials where human onlookers embodied the virtual character, hinting at the tight link between early, automatic coding of error detection and sense of embodiment. Error positivity was similar in 1PP and 3PP, suggesting that conscious coding of errors is similar for self and other. Thus, embodiment plays an important role in activating specific components of the action monitoring system when others' errors are coded as if they are one's own errors.

Sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects refer to decreased poorer strategy effects (i.e., poorer performance when the cued strategy is not the best) on current problem following poorer strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects. More specifically, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i.e., between 200- and 550 ms and between 850- and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these modulations were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.

A multi-resolution approach to localize neural sources of P300 event-related brain potential	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						P300; Source localization; Spatial filter	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CORRELATED SOURCES; VISUAL TARGET; TIME-COURSE; BEAMFORMER; RESOLUTION; EEG; PERFORMANCE; STIMULI	Background and objective: P300 is probably the most well-known component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Using an oddball paradigm, a P300 component can be identified, that is, elicited by the target stimuli recognition. Since P300 is associated with attention and memory operations of the brain, investigation of this component can improve our understanding of these mechanisms. The present study is aimed at identifying the P300 generators in 30 healthy subjects aged 18-30 years using time-reduction region-suppression linearly constrained minimum variance (TR-LCMV) beamformer. Methods: In our study, TR-LCMV beamformer with multi-resolution approach is proposed, coarse-resolution space to find the approximated coherent source locations, fine-resolution space to estimate covariance matrix for dimension reduction of determined regions, and normal-resolution space to localize the P300 generators in the brain. Results: Our results over simulated and real data showed that this approach is a suitable tool to the analysis of ERP fields with localizing superior and inferior frontal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus as the most prominent sources of P300. The result of P300 localization was finally compared with the other localization methods and it is demonstrated that enhanced performance is achieved. Conclusions: Our results showed that the P300 originates from a widespread neuronal network in the brain and not from a specific region. Our finding over simulated and real data demonstrated the ability of the TR-LCMV algorithm for P300 source localization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neurophysiological and behavioral correlates of cognitive control during low and moderate intensity exercise	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Acute exercise; Cognitive control; ERPs; EEG; P3; N2	CONFLICT ADAPTATION; AEROBIC EXERCISE; P300 COMPONENT; ERP; PERFORMANCE; ACCURACY; INDEXES; STRESS; CORTEX; LIMITS	The aim of this study was to examine neurophysiological and behavioral correlates of cognitive control elicited by a modified flanker task while exercising at low and moderate intensities. A secondary aim was to examine cognitive control processes at several time points during an acute bout of exercise to determine whether cognition is selectively influenced by the duration of exercise. Twenty-seven healthy participants completed a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task while exercising on a cycle ergometer at 40% and 60% VO2 peak and during a no-exercise seated control across three separate days. During task performance, continuous EEG was collected to assess neurocognitive function using the N2 and P3 event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Neurocognitive performance was assessed at 5, 15, and 25 min time points during steady-state exercise. Regardless of intensity, behavioral findings revealed impaired accuracy during both exercise conditions for the flanker task trials that require greater cognitive control. However, faster reaction times were found during moderate-intensity exercise. Neuroelectric measures revealed increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during both exercise conditions relative to rest. Together, these findings suggest divergent effects of exercise on behavioral performance measures accompanied by an upregulation of cognitive control during aerobic exercise. These impairments are discussed in terms of dual-task paradigms and the transient hypofrontality theory. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Basic neuroscience research has shown that reward is a multistage process, yet it is unclear how specific stages relate to individual differences in reward sensitivity. The current study utilized event-related potentials elicited during a monetary incentive task to parse sub-stages within anticipatory and consummatory reward processing. Effects of depressive symptoms and trait impulsivity were examined at each sub-stage (N = 92). Reward anticipation modulated neural activity across three sub-stages: cue detection (cue-P3), approach behavior (contingent negative variation, CNV), and outcome anticipation (stimulus preceding negativity). Reward delivery modulated activity across two sub-stages: initial evaluation (reward positivity, RewP), and allocation of attention (feedback-P3). Sensation seeking predicted faster reaction times, as well as cue-P3 and RewP amplitudes. Depression and lack of premeditation interacted to predict CNV and RewP amplitudes. Results demonstrate that individual differences in reward functioning are stage-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is particularly critical for low density EEG arrays employed in several clinical and research applications because the missing channel represents a large portion of the underlying cortical activity and adversely affects further data analysis and, potentially, diagnosis. For the same reasons, it is also critical for dry EEG applications when a disrupting contact is present. We present an approach for reconstructing a missing or poor EEG signal by combining signals from neighboring electrodes according to their distance from the electrode corresponding to the reconstructed signal. We used EEG data recorded from humans performing a cognitive task, omitted one channel at a time (to assess any spatial dependencies of our proposed approach), and reconstructed the omitted signal from the rest of the signals. Signals were reconstructed using Euclidean distance, great circle distance, and ellipsoid geodesic length and compared to reference (omitted) signals by means of inspection and normalized mean square error. Pilot results indicated that the ellipsoid geodesic length gave the best signal reconstruction as it provided event related potential and scalp map estimates closest to the reference and the smallest average (across all omitted channels) normalized mean square error (NMSE) values.

An ERP/sLORETA Study Investigating Implicit Processing of Self- vs. Other-Related Movement Sounds Using the Passive Oddball Paradigm	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						finger snapping sounds; EEG; N2a/MMN; P3; source localization	LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CORTICAL MIDLINE STRUCTURES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AUDITORY-EVOKED RESPONSE; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY	So far, neurophysiological studies have investigated implicit and explicit self-related processing particularly for self-related stimuli such as the own face or name. The present study extends previous research to the implicit processing of self-related movement sounds and explores their spatio-temporal dynamics. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed while participants (N = 12 healthy subjects) listened passively to previously recorded self- and other-related finger snapping sounds, presented either as deviants or standards during an oddball paradigm. Passive listening to low (500 Hz) and high (1000 Hz) pure tones served as additional control. For self- vs. other-related finger snapping sounds, analysis of ERPs revealed significant differences in the time windows of the N2a/MMN and P3. An subsequent source localization analysis with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed increased cortical activation in distinct motor areas such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the N2a/mismatch negativity (MMN) as well as the P3 time window during processing of self-and other-related finger snapping sounds. In contrast, brain regions associated with self-related processing [e.g., right anterior/posterior cingulate cortex (ACC/PPC)] as well as the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) showed increased activation particularly during processing of self- vs. other-related finger snapping sounds in the time windows of the N2a/MMN (ACC/PCC) or the P3 (IPL). None of these brain regions showed enhanced activation while listening passively to low (500 Hz) and high (1000 Hz) pure tones. Taken together, the current results indicate (1) a specific role of motor regions such as SMA during auditory processing of movement-related information, regardless of whether this information is self- or other-related, (2) activation of neural sources such as the ACC/PCC and the IPL during implicit processing of self-related movement stimuli, and (3) their differential temporal activation during deviance (N2a/MMN-ACC/PCC) and target detection (P3-IPL) of self- vs. other-related movement sounds.

For the perception of such structures, the detection of each boundary is crucial. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.

The influence of visual information on auditory processing in individuals with congenital amusia: An ERP study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Congenital amusia; Audiovisual; ERP; Multisensory; Music perception	MONTREAL BATTERY; PITCH DISCRIMINATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; TONE-DEAFNESS; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; INTEGRATION; COMPONENT; MEMORY; RECOGNITION	While most normal hearing individuals can readily use prosodic information in spoken language to interpret the moods and feelings of conversational partners, people with congenital amusia report that they often rely more on facial expressions and gestures, a strategy that may compensate for deficits in auditory processing. In this investigation, we used EEG to examine the extent to which individuals with congenital amusia draw upon visual information when making auditory or audio-visual judgments. Event-related potentials (ERP) were elicited by a change in pitch (up or down) between two sequential tones paired with a change in spatial position (up or down) between two visually presented dots. The change in dot position was either congruent or incongruent with the change in pitch. Participants were asked to judge (1) the direction of pitch change while ignoring the visual information (AV implicit task), and (2) whether the auditory and visual changes were congruent (AV explicit task). In the AV implicit task, amusic participants performed significantly worse in the incongruent condition than control participants. ERPs showed an enhanced N2-P3 response to incongruent AV pairings for control participants, but not for amusic participants. However when participants were explicitly directed to detect AV congruency, both groups exhibited enhanced N2-P3 responses to incongruent AV pairings. These findings indicate that amusics are capable of extracting information from both modalities in an AV task, but are biased to rely on visual information when it is available, presumably because they have learned that auditory information is unreliable. We conclude that amusic individuals implicitly draw upon visual information when judging auditory information, even though they have the capacity to explicitly recognize conflicts between these two sensory channels.

This paper proposes a method for spatially smoothing xDAWN spatial filters to give a robustness against small sample problem. The proposed method gives a subspace constraint to the parameter space of the spatial filters.

We used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to study the contributions of brain source activities to scalp ERPs across the different phases of two event-based PM-tasks: (1) holding intentions during a delay (monitoring) (2) detecting the correct context to perform the delayed intention (cue detection) and (3) carrying out the action (realisation of delayed intentions). Results showed that monitoring for both perceptual and conceptual PM-tasks was characterised by an enhanced early occipital negativity (N200). In addition the conceptual PM-task showed a long-lasting effect of monitoring significant around 700 ms. Perceptual PM-task cues elicited an N300 enhancement associated with cue detection, whereas a midline N400-like response was evoked by conceptual PM-task cues. The Prospective Positivity associated with realisation of delayed intentions was observed in both conceptual and perceptual tasks. A common frontal-midline brain source contributed to the Prospective Positivity in both tasks and a strong contribution from parieto-frontal brain sources was observed only for the perceptually cued PM-task. These findings support the idea that: (1) The enhanced N200 can be understood as a neural correlate of a 'retrieval mode' for perceptual and conceptual PM-tasks, and additional strategic monitoring is implemented according the nature of the PM task; (2) ERP5 associated with cue detection are specific to the nature of the PM cues; (3) Prospective Positivity reflects a general PM process, but the specific brain sources contributing to it depend upon the nature of the PM task.

The classic way to exchange information between human and computer is based on such peripheral devices as a keyboard, mouse, and other control tools, for example Kinect. Other, nowadays more unreliable methods of human-computer communication are voice commands. This way of sending information seems appropriate for people who, for various reasons such as disability, are unable to perform movements required to direct operation of computer devices. However, there are people who, in addition to problems with movement, are burdened with the difficulties with pronunciation or are silent. An alternative method that enables communication of such people with the outside world seems to be a brain-computer interface (BCI). Electroencephalography (EEG) amplifiers and special electrodes placed on the surface of the human head are used for the construction of such interfaces. Previous studies have shown that these devices are useful in human-computer communication. BCI interfaces, beyond its application in human-computer communication, are also appreciated in the entertainment industry, for example to control the computer game character. Design and construction of brain-computer interfaces, however, requires consideration of a number of aspects that will be presented in this article. The paper present the research and teaching laboratory created at the Institute of Computer Science of Lublin University of Technology. The laboratory is dedicated to the design of brain-computer interfaces and has been created to conduct research work and student projects carried out using three BCI paradigms: steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), P300 evoked potential and motor imagery based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS).

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired during a visual oddball task in 14 patients with depressive disorder and 19 healthy controls. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were analyzed using event-related phase coherence (ERPCOH) to obtain the functional network. Alteration of the phase synchronization index (PSI) of the functional network was investigated. Patients with depression showed a decreased number of significant electrode pairs in delta phase synchronization, and an increased number of significant electrode pairs in theta, alpha and beta phase synchronization, compared with controls. Patients with depression showed lower target-dependent PSI increment in the frontal-parietal/temporal/occipital electrode pairs in delta-phase synchronization than healthy participants. However, patients with depression showed higher target-dependent PSI increments in theta band in the prefrontal/frontal and frontal-temporal electrode pairs, higher PSI increments in alpha band in the prefrontal pairs and higher increments of beta PSI in the central and right frontal-parietal pairs than controls. It implied that the decrease in delta PSI activity in major depression may indicate impairment of the connection between the frontal and parietal/temporal/occipital regions. The increase in theta, alpha and beta PSI in the frontal/prefrontal sites might reflect the compensatory mechanism to maintain normal cognitive performance. These findings may provide a foundation for a new approach to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies for depression.

Event-Related Functional Network Identification: Application to EEG Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Classification; connectivity; electroencephalographic (EEG); phase locking value (PLV); reactive band; threshold	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; BAND IDENTIFICATION; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Recent works on brain functional analysis have accentuated the importance of distributed functional networks and synchronized activity between networks in mediating cognitive functions. The network perspective is important to relate mechanisms of brain functions and the basis for classifying brain states. In this work, the network patterns related to neural tasks based on synchronization measure phase-locking value (PLV) in an electroencephalogram (EEG) are analyzed. Based on network dissimilarities between the rest and motor imagery tasks, important nodes and channel pairs corresponding to motor tasks are identified. A framework is developed to identify these most reactive channel pairs that form the subject-specific functional network. The identified functional network corresponding to tasks demonstrate significant PLV variation in line with the experiment protocol. With the selection of subject-specific reactive band, these channel pairs provide even higher variation corresponding to tasks. To demonstrate the potential of the developed framework to brain-computer interface, identified network patterns are employed as features for classification of tasks. Analysis performed with the two classes (left-hand and right-hand motor imagery EEG data) showed that the proposed approach yielded better classification results compared to earlier band-power based approaches for single trial analysis.

Event-related potentials demonstrate deficits in acoustic segmentation in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Auditory perception; Negative symptoms; EEG; N2; Sustained potential	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; INHIBITORY NEURONS; SEQUENTIAL SOUNDS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; N2 COMPONENT; IMPLICIT; ORGANIZATION; IMPAIRMENTS; PERCEPTION; VIOLATIONS	Segmentation of the acoustic environment into discrete percepts is an important facet of auditory scene analysis (ASA). Segmentation of auditory stimuli into perceptually meaningful and localizable groups is central to ASA in everyday situations; for example, separation of discrete words from continuous sentences when processing language. This is particularly relevant to schizophrenia, where deficits in perceptual organization have been linked to symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Here we examined event-related potentials in response to grouped tones to elucidate schizophrenia-related differences in acoustic segmentation. We report for the first time in healthy subjects a sustained potential that begins with group initiation and ends with the last tone of the group. These potentials were reduced in schizophrenia, with the greatest differences in responses to first and final tones. Importantly, reductions in sustained potentials in schizophrenia patients were associated with greater negative symptoms and deficits in IQ, working memory, learning, and social cognition. These results suggest deficits in auditory pattern segmentation in schizophrenia may compound deficits in many higher-order facets of the disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated different brain activities related to errors. Meanwhile, the recognition of error-related brain activity as one aspect of performance monitoring has been reported for potential applications in clinical neuroscience and brain-machine interface, where single-trial analysis and classification would provide novel insights on dynamic brain responses to errors. However, procedures of selecting features, as well as procedures of single-trial classification, are not fully investigated for optimal performance. In the present study, we investigated the performance of different configurations of feature extractions in both temporal and frequency domains, for discriminating response errors in a color-word matching Stroop task. Motivated by our previous investigations, we evaluated both temporal and frequency features with component signals, which were obtained from EEG signals via an independent component analysis (ICA). Five component signals (independent components, ICs), originated from the frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital areas, were included in detecting error-related brain activity from single-trial EEG data. The results showed that better performance can be achieved by optimizing time window and frequency range of selected features, sampling scheme of feature-related data, and training of classifiers. However, a simple combination of features from multiple component signals can only slightly improve the detection performance of errors in single-trial data as compared to the frontal IC only. More importantly, it is indicated that four ICs other than the frontal one also carry similar discriminative information about errors in both temporal and frequency domains. The fact suggests flexible means in detecting errors from EEG beyond the frontal brain areas, which might be very valuable in practical applications such that the frontal area is not accessible.

The objective of the study was to investigate the functional mechanisms of attention deficits in adult ADHD by examining the electrophysiological activities associated with bottom-up attentional cueing (temporal and spatial orienting of attention) and top-down control (conflict resolution). Continuous EEG was recorded in 21 adult ADHD patients (40.05 +/- 9.5 years) and 20 healthy adults (25.5 +/- 4 years) during performance of the Attention Network Test (ANT). We examined the cue and target-related P1, N1 and P3 components as well as the contingent negative variation (CNV) developing between cue and target. Oscillatory responses were analyzed in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-19 Hz) frequency bands. ADHD patients performed similarly to controls but showed reduced P3 amplitude, larger early CNV decrementing over time, reduced preparatory activation in both alpha and beta bands, as well as flattened target-related posterior alpha and beta responses. As compared to controls, the inverted CNV pattern suggested peculiar preparatory processing in ADHD patients. The singular pattern of target-related beta response indicated increased inhibitory processes in the case of easier task resolution and more generally, the lack of association between conflict resolution speed and beta activity supported alternative executive processing in ADHD patients. Overall, the reduced activation of the functional networks devoted to bottom-up and top-down attention suggests that adult ADHD patients engage reduced cortical resources in this composite task, compatible with the cortical hypoarousal model.

However, it remains unknown whether this ability extends when viewing conditions become more difficult, and whether differences in early perceptual abilities modulate masking sensitivity. To address these issues, participants enumerated a variable number of target elements among distracters in two electroencephalography experiments. Either one (Experiment 1) or all targets (Experiment 2) were masked through object-substitution. Results showed that an event-related potential measure of selective individuation, the N2pc component, was modulated by target numerosity in both masked and unmasked trials, suggesting that multiple object individuation can operate in conditions of limited visibility. However, this effect was present mainly for participants with low masking effects, who overall showed more pronounced N2pc modulations as a function of target numerosity. Finally, oscillatory activity analyses revealed that early segmentation mechanisms, as reflected by lateralized gamma synchronization, were more active in participants with low sensitivity to masking, suggesting that individual variation in early perceptual functions is associated with susceptibility to masking such that more efficient segmentation and individuation mechanisms reduce the effects of masking. These findings cast doubt on the claim that effectively masked stimuli can be individuated.

Pasco			Psychosocial Intervention Is Associated with Altered Emotion Processing: An Event-Related Potential Study in At-Risk Adolescents	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AFFECTIVE PICTURE PERCEPTION; ONSET CONDUCT DISORDER; AFFECTIVE MODULATION; JUVENILE-OFFENDERS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL RESPONSES; STARTLE REFLEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; P3 AMPLITUDE; ERP ANALYSIS	Emotion processing is vital for healthy adolescent development, and impaired emotional responses are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders. However, it is unclear whether observed differences between psychiatric populations and healthy controls reflect modifiable variations in functioning (and thus could be sensitive to changes resulting from intervention) or stable, non-modifiable, individual differences. The current study therefore investigated whether the Late Positive Potential (LPP; a neural index of emotion processing) can be used as a marker of therapeutic change following psycho-social intervention. At-risk male adolescents who had received less than four months intervention (minimalintervention, N = 32) or more than nine months intervention (extended-intervention, N = 32) passively viewed emotional images whilst neural activity was recorded using electroencephalography. Significant differences in emotion processing, indicated by the LPP, were found between the two groups: the LPP did not differ according to valence in the minimal-intervention group, whereas the extended-intervention participants showed emotion processing in line with low risk populations (enhanced LPP for unpleasant images versus other images). Further, an inverse relationship between emotional reactivity (measured via the LPP) and antisocial behaviour was observed in minimal-intervention participants only. The data therefore provide preliminary cross-sectional evidence that abnormal neural responses to emotional information may be normalised following psychosocial intervention. Importantly, this study uniquely suggests that, in future randomised control trials, the LPP may be a useful biomarker to measure development and therapeutic change.

CELLULAR AND CIRCUIT MODELS OF INCREASED RESTING-STATE NETWORK GAMMA ACTIVITY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; schizophrenia; gamma	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; DEVELOPMENTAL DISRUPTION MODEL; WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ANIMAL-MODEL; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a disorder characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (blunted affect, alogia, reduced sociability, and anhedonia), as well as persistent cognitive deficits (memory, concentration, and learning). While the biology underlying subjective experiences is difficult to study, abnormalities in electroencephalographic (EEG) measures offer a means to dissect potential circuit and cellular changes in brain function. EEG is indispensable for studying cerebral information processing due to the introduction of techniques for the decomposition of event-related activity into its frequency components. Specifically, brain activity in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) is thought to underlie cognitive function and may be used as an endophenotype to aid in diagnosis and treatment of SCZ. In this review we address evidence indicating that there is increased resting-state gamma power in SCZ. We address how modeling this aspect of the illness in animals may help treatment development as well as providing insights into the etiology of SCZ. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental data used here were taken from seven different electrodes. The work has been done in three stages, normalization of the signals, extracting the features by Cubic Spline Technique (CST) and classification using Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The simulation results showed that five types of EEG signals were classified with an average accuracy for seven electrodes that is 94.3% when training 70% of the features while with an average accuracy of 92.84% when training 50% of the features.

J.; Szumska, Izabela; Fajkowska, Malgorzata			Two Sides of the Same Coin: ERP and Wavelet Analyses of Visual Potentials Evoked and Induced by Task-Relevant Faces	ADVANCES IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERPs; Wavelet analyses; Evoked power; Induced power; Phase Reset model; Evoked model	ALPHA-PHASE; POWER SPECTRA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; EEG; GENERATION; COMPONENTS; INDEX	New analysis techniques of the electroencephalogram (EEG) such as wavelet analysis open the possibility to address questions that may largely improve our understanding of the EEG and clarify its relation with related potentials (ERPs). Three issues were addressed. 1) To what extent can early ERP components be described as transient evoked oscillations in specific frequency bands? 2) Total EEG power (TP) after a stimulus consists of pre-stimulus baseline power (BP), evoked power (EP), and induced power (IP), but what are their respective contributions? 3) The Phase Reset model proposes that BP predicts EP, while the evoked model holds that BP is unrelated to EP; which model is the most valid one? EEG results on NoGo trials for 123 individuals that took part in an experiment with emotional facial expressions were examined by computing ERPs and by performing wavelet analyses on the raw EEG and on ERPs. After performing several multiple regression analyses, we obtained the following answers. First, the P1, N1, and P2 components can by and large be described as transient oscillations in the alpha and theta bands. Secondly, it appears possible to estimate the separate contributions of EP, BP, and IP to TP, and importantly, the contribution of IP is mostly larger than that of EP. Finally, no strong support was obtained for either the Phase Reset or the Evoked model. Recent models are discussed that may better explain the relation between raw EEG and ERPs.

This fluctuation has been proposed to result from variations in estradiol levels. The current study used EEG to investigated whether the cycle-related fluctuation in RSVP target identification FCA relates to changes in early, stimulus-driven, bottom-up or in later, top down-driven aspects of FCA. While the former would be expected to become evident in the early visual evoked potentials (VEPs) P1 or N1, the latter would be evident in later event-related potentials (ERPs) such as N2pc or P3. Women performed a dual-stream RSVP task once during the menstrual phase and once during the follicular phase. Estradiol levels were determined from saliva samples. In contrast to previous findings, FCA in RSVP target identification was not affected by cycle phase. However, the impairment in second-target identification when targets where closely spaced was generally smaller during the menstrual phase than during the follicular phase. This effect was matched by shorter peak latencies of P1 VEPs for the menstrual phase, and by a reduction in the latency of the second-target P3 ERP for closely spaced relative to widely spaced target pairs, again for the menstrual phase. Results suggest that in a dual-stream RSVP setup, target identification, early stage stimulus processing, and target consolidation are affected by cycle phase, but that the asymmetry of these effects does not differ between menstrual and follicular phase. The observed cycle-related modulations in neurophysiology and behavior could relate to the effects of estradiol on the locus ceruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, which is known to play a major role in arousal, attention and stress response.

Studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) are the main tool in any real time examination of information processing in miliseconds. Based on the available data, and our own research, we suggest that QEEG and ERPs abnormalities may result in a better understanding of the mechanism by which the symptoms of these disturbances overlap with each other. Case study: The patient, a 57-year-old man, retired Polish Army lieutenant colonel, who had seen active service twice in Lebanon, was diagnosed with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, in accordance with the DSM 5 criteria. MR neuroimaging research showed cerebral-subcortical structural dystrophy. The neuropsychological tests confirmed an increasing degree of disturbance within cognitive and emotional processes as well as behavioural disturbances. Through the appliance of QEEG methodology as well as the potentials connected with the event (ERPs) it appeared that: (1) rare low-voltage rapid EEG occured; (2) increased activity in the subcortical areas, (3) weakened activity in the cerebral areas. The patient completely lost cognitive and emotional control which meant that he was unable to function in everyday life. Conclusions: The conducting of ERPs on the patient made it possible to understand the brain mechanisms lying at the basis of the overlapping symptoms of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The appearance of a low-voltage, rapid EEG could possible be a factor enhancing the development of PTSD, particularly in patients who have experienced Mild Traumatic Brain Injury. The results obtained show the need to exclude low-voltage EEG in soldiers despatched to see service in regions of armed conflict.

The results verified the presence of statistical learning, which was diminished in children with hearing impairments (HIs), and elucidated possible perceptual mediators of speech production. Design: Perception and production of the syllables /ba/, /da/, /ta/, and /na/ were recorded in 13 children with normal hearing and 13 children with HI. Perception was assessed physiologically through event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded by EEG in a multifeature mismatch negativity paradigm and behaviorally through a discrimination task. Temporal and spectral features of the ERPs during speech perception were analyzed, and speech production was quantitatively evaluated using speech motor maximum performance tasks. Results: Proximal to stimulus onset, children with HI displayed a difference in map topography, indicating diminished statistical learning. In later ERP components, children with HI exhibited reduced amplitudes in the N2 and early parts of the late disciminative negativity components specifically, which are associated with temporal and spectral control mechanisms. Abnormalities of speech perception were only subtly reflected in speech production, as the lone difference found in speech production studies was a mild delay in regulating speech intensity. Conclusions: In addition to previously reported deficits of sound-feature discriminations, the present study results reflect diminished statistical learning in children with HI, which plays an early and important, but so far neglected, role in phonological processing. Furthermore, the lack of corresponding behavioral abnormalities in speech production implies that impaired perceptual capacities do not necessarily translate into productive deficits.

In progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) polygraphy with simultaneous EMG-EEG recordings is a crucial tool for defining the characteristic of myoclonic jerks their topography over different muscles (namely antagonists), their time course and relationship with vigilance muscle activation and stimulations. Moreover on polygraphic recordings it is possible to detect EEG activities associated to myoclonic jerks and define their time relationship with myoclonus thus differentiating cortical types of myoclonus from subcorticallly generated ones. Tanks to the back averaging technique non obvious time-locked EEG potentials can be detected on polygraphy, furthermore in stimulus sensitive myoclonus the analysis can include the potential evoked by the somatosensory stimulus (SEP). The polygraphic recording also gives information on muscle activity suppression occurring after jerk or as pure negative myoclonus. Besides the time domain analysis, techniques based on frequency analysis have been developed to evaluate EEG-EMG coherence. The neurophysiological techniques provide investigators and clinicians with an invaluable information to define the type of myoclonus and its generating circuitry thus substantially contributing in the diagnosis and management of PMEs.

Emotion regulation during the encoding of emotional stimuli: Effects on subsequent memory	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotional memory; Recognition; Emotion regulation; Reappraisal; Event-related potentials; School-age girls	ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; REAPPRAISAL; CHILDRENS; AMYGDALA; CONSOLIDATION; POTENTIALS; UNPLEASANT; MODULATE; PLEASANT	In the adult literature, emotional arousal is regarded as a source of the enhancing effect of emotion on subsequent memory. Here, we used behavioral and electrophysiological methods to examine the role of emotional arousal on subsequent memory in school-age children. Furthermore, we implemented a reappraisal instruction to manipulate (down-regulate) emotional arousal at encoding to examine the relation between emotional arousal and subsequent memory. Participants (8-year-old girls) viewed emotional scenes as electrophysiological (EEG) data were recorded and participated in a memory task 1 to 5 days later where EEG and behavioral responses were recorded; participants provided subjective ratings of the scenes after the memory task. The reappraisal instruction successfully reduced emotional arousal responses to negative stimuli but not positive stimuli. Similarly, recognition performance in both event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavior was impaired for reappraised negative stimuli but not positive stimuli. The findings indicate that ERPs are sensitive to the reappraisal of negative stimuli in children as young as 8 years. Furthermore, the findings suggest an interaction of emotion and memory during the school years, implicating the explanatory role of emotional arousal at encoding on subsequent memory performance in female children as young as 8 years.

The proposed transfer approach is not limited to be applied to the same type of event-related potential. We show that a classifier trained to detect a certain brain pattern can be used successfully to detect another brain pattern, which is expected to be similar to the first one. In particular a classifier is transferred between two different types of error-related potentials (ErrPs) within the same subject. The classifier trained on observation ErrPs is used to detect interaction ErrPs, since twice as much training data is collected for observation ErrPs compared to interaction ErrPs during the same calibration time. Our results show that the proposed transfer approach is feasible and outperforms another approach, in which a classifier is transferred between different subjects but the same type of ErrP is used to train and test the classifier. The proposed approach is a promising way to handle few training data and to reduce calibration time in ErrP-based brain-computer interfaces.

J	Stothart, G; Maynard, O; Lavis, R; Munafo, M				Stothart, George; Maynard, Olivia; Lavis, Rosie; Munafo, Marcus			Neural correlates of cigarette health warning avoidance among smokers	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Tobacco; Smoking; Health warnings; vMMN; LPP	VISUAL MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN REACTIVITY; COMPONENTS; CUES	Background: Eye-tracking technology has indicated that daily smokers actively avoid pictorial cigarette package health warnings. Avoidance may be due to a pre-cognitive perceptual bias or a higher order cognitive bias, such as reduced emotional processing. Using electroencephalography (EEG), this study aimed to identify the temporal point at which smokers' responses to health warnings begin to differ. Method: Non-smokers (n = 20) and daily smokers (n = 20) viewed pictorial cigarette package health warnings and neutral control stimuli. These elicited Event Related Potentials reflecting early perceptual processing (visual P1), pre-attentive change detection (visual Mismatch Negativity), selective attentional orientation (P3) and a measure of emotional processing, the Late Positive Potential (LPP). Results: There was no evidence for a difference in P1 responses between smokers and non-smokers. There was no difference in vMMN and P3 amplitude but some evidence for a delay in vMMN latency amongst smokers. There was strong evidence for delayed and reduced LPP to health warning stimuli amongst smokers compared to non-smokers. Conclusion: We find no evidence for an early perceptual bias in smokers' visual perception of health warnings but strong evidence that smokers are less sensitive to the emotional content of cigarette health warnings. Future health warning development should focus on increasing the emotional salience of pictorial health warning content amongst smokers. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Respectively, these theories claim that the medial frontal response reflects (i) the absolute deviation between the value of an outcome and its expected value (i.e. an absolute prediction error); (ii) the deviation between actual and expected outcomes, with a specific sensitivity to outcomes that are worse than expected (i.e. a negative prediction error); (iii) a binary evaluation in terms of good and bad outcomes. In the current electroencephalography study, participants were presented with cues that induced specific predictions for the values of trial outcomes (a gain or loss of points). The actual outcomes occasionally deviated from the predicted values, producing prediction errors with parametrically varying size. Analysis of the medial frontal theta activity in response to the outcomes demonstrated a specific sensitivity to the occurrence of a loss of points when a gain had been predicted. However, the absolute deviation with respect to the predicted value did not modulate the theta response. This finding is consistent with the idea that outcome monitoring activity measured over medial frontal cortex is sensitive to the binary distinction between good and bad outcomes.	[Janssen, Denise J.

We hypothesized that delta EROs were affected by age-related changes, which could be reflected in a visual oddball paradigm. Method: The study included two groups of subjects, 17 younger healthy elderly (mean age: 63.1 +/- 2.8 years) and 17 gender- and education-matched older healthy elderly (mean age: 79.6 +/- 5.2 years), who performed a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was recorded from F-3, F-z, F-4, C-3, C-z, C-4, P-3, P-z, P-4, O-1, O-z and O-2 locations. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of delta (0.5-3 Hz) target ERO responses during the post-stimulus 0-800 ms time window were measured. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze four locations (frontal, central, parietal, occipital), at three sagittal (left, midline, right) sites. Independent t-tests were applied for post-hoc analyses. Results: The older healthy elderly group had 16-25% lower values for the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes of delta ERO compared with the younger healthy elderly group over frontal (p < 0.003), central (p < 0.0001) and parietal (p < 0.007) locations [F-3.95 = 4396, p = 0.015] Furthermore, there was a moderate negative correlation between age and C-z peak-to-peak amplitude of target delta responses [r = -0.401, p < 0.02], indicating the notion that peak-to-peak amplitude of C-z decreases as age increases. Conclusion: In the present study younger healthy elderly showed significantly higher event-related delta responses than older healthy elderly at frontal, central and parietal locations. Moreover, delta ERO responses decreased in accordance with age. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the nexus between cognitive subprocesses, behavior, and electrophysiological processes remains associative in nature. We therefore investigated whether neurophysiological correlates of inhibition subprocesses merely correlate with behavioral performance or actually provide information expedient to the prediction of behavior on a single-subject level. Tackling this question, we used different data-driven classification approaches in a sample of n = 262 healthy young subjects who completed a standard Go/Nogo task while an EEG was recorded. On the basis of median-split response inhibition performance, subjects were classified as "accurate/slow" and "less accurate/fast." Even though these behavioral group differences were associated with significant amplitude variations in classical electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition (i.e., N2 and P3), they were not predictive for group membership on a single-subject level. Instead, amplitude differences in the Go-P2 originating in the precuneus (BA7) were shown to predict group membership on a single-subject level with up to 64% accuracy. These findings strongly suggest that the behavioral outcome of response inhibition greatly depends on the amount of cognitive resources allocated to early stages of stimulus-response activation during responding. This suggests that research should focus more on early processing steps during responding when trying to understand the origin of interindividual differences in response inhibition processes.

Expectations about person identity modulate the face-sensitive N170	CORTEX			English	Article						Faces; Face identity; N170; Predictive coding; EEG	HUMAN BRAIN; ERP EVIDENCE; FAMILIARITY; ADAPTATION; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; SPEED	Identifying familiar faces is a fundamentally important aspect of social perception that requires the ability to assign very different (ambient) images of a face to a common identity. The current consensus is that the brain processes face identity at approximately 250-300 msec following stimulus onset, as indexed by the N250 event related potential. However, using two experiments we show compelling evidence that where experimental paradigms induce expectations about person identity, changes in famous face identity are in fact detected at an earlier latency corresponding to the face-sensitive N170. In Experiment 1, using a rapid periodic stimulation paradigm presenting highly variable ambient images, we demonstrate robust effects of low frequency, periodic face-identity changes in N170 amplitude. In Experiment 2, we added infrequent aperiodic identity changes to show that the N170 was larger to both infrequent periodic and infrequent aperiodic identity changes than to high frequency identities. Our use of ambient stimulus images makes it unlikely that these effects are due to adaptation of low-level stimulus features. In line with current ideas about predictive coding, we therefore suggest that when expectations about the identity of a face exist, the visual system is capable of detecting identity mismatches at a latency consistent with the N170.

Many studies explored the respective properties and neural signatures of each of these processes. However, very few experiments were conceived to explore their interaction. In the present work we used an auditory target detection task during which both temporal attention on the one side, and spatial attention and motor response preparation on the other side could be explicitly cued. Both cueing effects speeded response times, and showed strictly additive effects. Target ERP analysis revealed modulations of N1 and P3 responses by these two forms of cueing. Cue-target interval analysis revealed two main effects paralleling behavior. First, a typical contingent negative variation (CNV), induced by the cue and resolved immediately after target onset, was found larger for temporal attention cueing than for spatial and motor response cueing. Second, a posterior and late cue-P3 complex showed the reverse profile. Analyses of lateralized readiness potentials (LRP) revealed both patterns of motor response inhibition and activation. Taken together these results help to clarify and disentangle the respective effects of temporal attention on the one hand, and of the combination of spatial attention and motor response preparation on the other hand on brain activity and behavior.

Surprise disrupts cognition via a fronto-basal ganglia suppressive mechanism	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; STOP-SIGNAL INHIBITION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN	Surprising events markedly affect behaviour and cognition, yet the underlying mechanism is unclear. Surprise recruits a brain mechanism that globally suppresses motor activity, ostensibly via the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia. Here, we tested whether this suppressive mechanism extends beyond skeletomotor suppression and also affects cognition (here, verbal working memory, WM). We recorded scalp-EEG (electrophysiology) in healthy participants and STN local field potentials in Parkinson's patients during a task in which surprise disrupted WM. For scalp-EEG, surprising events engage the same independent neural signal component that indexes action stopping in a stop-signal task. Importantly, the degree of this recruitment mediates surprise-related WM decrements. Intracranially, STN activity is also increased post surprise, especially when WM is interrupted. These results suggest that surprise interrupts cognition via the same fronto-basal ganglia mechanism that interrupts action. This motivates a new neural theory of how cognition is interrupted, and how distraction arises after surprising events.

It is a common trait found in many clinical populations and describes approximately 20% of the general population. Little is known about its underlying mechanisms, however. Objectives: Here we present findings from three studies designed to expose differences in electrophysiological measures between noise-sensitive and noise-resistant individuals. Method: Noise sensitivity was estimated using self-report measures, while electrophysiological indices included both cardiac (heart rate, heart rate variability) and electroencephalographic (event-related potential) measures. All three studies were designed with reference to preexisting theoretical frameworks. Results: Significant differences in heart rate change and heart rate variability indices between noise-sensitive and noise-resistant groups were found. Further, the noise-sensitive group exhibited less sensory gating than the noise-resistant group. Conclusions: While the findings from all three studies were not definitive in indicating a likely biological mechanism underlying noise sensitivity, they do suggest that electrophysiological investigation of noise sensitivity is viable and has potential to inform clinical research into a relatively understudied symptom.

Although the behavioral aspects of this phenomenon were reported on extensively, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms mediating this disinhibition are unclear. To close this gap, we used both behavioral and neurophysiological measures (event-related potentials, ERPs) to investigate which subprocesses of response inhibition are altered under the influence of high-dose alcohol intoxication. Using a within-subject design, we asked young healthy participants (n=27) to complete a GO/NOGO task once sober and once intoxicated (approximately 1.2 parts per thousand). During intoxication, high-dose alcohol effects were highest in a condition where the participants could not rely on automated stimulus-response mapping processes during response inhibition. In this context, the NOGO-P3 (ERP), that likely depends on dopaminergic signaling within mesocorticolimbic pathways and is thought to reflect motor inhibition and/or the evaluation of inhibitory processes, was altered in the intoxicated state. In contrast to this, the N2 component, which largely depends on nigrostriatal dopamine pathways and is thought to reflect inhibition on a pre-motor level, was not altered. Based on these results, we demonstrate that alcohol-induced changes of dopaminergic neurotransmission do not exert a global effect on response inhibition. Instead, changes are highly subprocess-specific and seem to mainly target mesocorticolimbic pathways that contribute to motor inhibition and the evaluation of such.

A novel electroencephalography-based tool for objective assessment of network dynamics activated by nociceptive stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							SUBJECTIVE PAIN PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; HEAT; COMPONENTS; CORTEX; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	BackgroundPain perception is typically assessed using subjective measures; an objective measure of the response to pain would be valuable. In this study, Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel multivariate pattern analysis and scoring algorithm, was applied to event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by cortical responses to brief heat stimuli. Objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of BNA as a quantitative and qualitative measure of cortical response to pain. MethodsContact Heat Evoked Potentials (CHEPs) data were collected from 17 healthy, right-handed volunteers (10M, 7F) using 5 different temperatures (35, 41, 46, 49 and 52 degrees C). A set of spatio-temporal activity patterns common to all the subjects in the group (Reference Brain Network Model; RBNM) was generated using the BNA algorithm, based on evoked responses at 52 degrees C. ResultsFrame by frame unfolding' of the brain network across timeshowed qualitative differences between responses to painful and non-painful stimuli. Brain network activation scores were shown to be a better indicator of the individual's sensitivity to pain when compared to subjective pain ratings. Additionally, BNA scores correlated significantly with temperature, demonstrated good test-retest reliability, as well as a high degree of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in correctly categorizing subjects who reported stimuli as painful. ConclusionsThese results may provide evidence that the multivariate analysis performed with BNA may be useful as a quantitative, temporally sensitive tool for assessment of pain perception.

Thus, the development of new symptomatic drugs remains essential. However the dramatic increase in costs associated with drug development together with the poor number of emerging drugs highlights how crucial it is to accelerate the findings aiming to bringing new drugs to market. In this respect, optimization of the development process by integrating, at early stage, reliable biomarkers able to predict clinical benefit in phase III clinical trials may help. The improvement of certain techniques such as imaging and electrophysiological methods has led to a more accurate assessment of the brain's physiological impact of pharmacological treatments used to alleviate symptoms in AD patients. This review aims to gather the main findings from clinical studies where the effect of anti-dementia drugs were assessed in healthy volunteers and AD patients through one or several such biomarkers (electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)). Overall, evidence presented in this review suggests that various biomarkers associated with key impairments observed in AD were sensitive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) medication and memantine with a good correlation with enhancement of cognitive performance. In most of the reviewed studies, only one kind of biomarker was used. Among these, deficits in quantitative EEG profile, P300 latency, and regional brain activity measured by either functional MRI (fMRI) during face encoding and working memory task or by PET/SPECT have been shown to be reversed by anti-dementia drugs. It is therefore suggested that a single biomarker approach would be limited and not be sufficiently predictive to extensively assess the potential of a new symptomatic drug. Hence, it appears that a combination approach with the use of a panel of biomarkers rather than a single biomarker may be more appropriate to establish a good correlation between the disease and therapeutic intervention.

J	Niefind, F; Dimigen, O				Niefind, Florian; Dimigen, Olaf			Dissociating parafoveal preview benefit and parafovea-on-fovea effects during reading: A combined eye tracking and EEG study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Eye tracking; Eye-fixation related potentials; Delayed parafovea-on-fovea effect; Preview benefit; Boundary technique	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; E-Z READER; TIME-COURSE; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT CONTROL; FIXATION; FREQUENCY; FAMILIARITY; REPETITION	During reading, the parafoveal processing of an upcoming word n+1 can influence word recognition in two ways: It can affect fixation behavior during the preceding fixation on word n (parafovea-on-fovea effect, POF), and it can facilitate subsequent foveal processing once word n+1 is fixated (preview benefit). While preview benefits are established, evidence for POF effects is mixed. Recently, it has been suggested that POF effects exist, but have a delayed impact on saccade planning and thus coincide with preview benefits measured on word n+1. We combined eye movement and EEG recordings to investigate and separate neural correlates of POF and preview benefit effects. Participants read lists of nouns either in a boundary paradigm or the RSVP-with-flankers paradigm, while we recorded fixation- or event-related potentials (FRPs/ERPs), respectively. The validity and lexical frequency of the word shown as preview for the upcoming word n+1 were orthogonally manipulated. Analyses focused on the first fixation on word n+1. Preview validity (correct vs. incorrect preview) strongly modulated fixation times and electrophysiological N1 amplitudes, replicating previous findings. Importantly, gaze durations and FRPs measured on word n+1 were also affected by the frequency of the word shown as preview, with low-frequency previews eliciting a sustained, N400-like centroparietal negativity. Results support the idea that POF effects exist but affect word recognition with a delay. Lastly, once word n+1 was fixated, its frequency also modulated N1 amplitudes in ERPs and FRPs. Taken together, we separated immediate and delayed effects of parafoveal processing on brain correlates of word recognition.

Categorizing visual objects using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of subject along with paying attention to pictures, is properly possible. The aim of this paper is to analyze the mental signal in order to show the differences in cognitive patterns during paying attention to sets of different pictures. For this purpose, EEG signals which were recorded from 45 people were used. Brain signals are recorded over the on head using 8 active electrodes and based on standard 10-20. After the pre-processing, ERP signals were extracted into two classes according to attention to the human face and fruit images. Firstly, 4 types of features has been extracted from N170, P200, N200 and P300 components: (1) time features, (2) non-linear features, (3) statistical features and (4) frequency features. Then dimension of Properties were reduced by using different algorithms. New and innovative work in this paper is using various algorithms for reducing feature dimension such as t-test, t-SNE and kernel t-SNE and comparing their results with each other. Classification of 2 classes were done in order to recognize the differences using SVM and KNN classifiers. Secondly we reexamined this process by using combined features from multiple ERP components and obtained best result in this condition by tSNE and SVM classifier with 85.5% accuracy.

One of the major drawbacks in EEG brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is the need for subject-specific training of the classifier. By removing the need for a supervised calibration phase, new users could potentially explore a BCI faster. In this work we aim to remove this subject-specific calibration phase and allow direct classification. Approach. We explore canonical polyadic decompositions and block term decompositions of the EEG. These methods exploit structure in higher dimensional data arrays called tensors. The BCI tensors are constructed by concatenating ERP templates from other subjects to a target and non-target trial and the inherent structure guides a decomposition that allows accurate classification. We illustrate the new method on data from a three-class auditory oddball paradigm. Main results. The presented approach leads to a fast and intuitive classification with accuracies competitive with a supervised and cross-validated LDA approach. Significance. The described methods are a promising new way of classifying BCI data with a forthright link to the original P300 ERP signal over the conventional and widely used supervised approaches.

Methods: AEPs were recorded in 18 healthy participants. Stimulation consisted of trains with eight tones. The 6th stimulus of each train was a frequency deviant. The N100 amplitude to the 1st stimulus of the train was quantified in each trial. Trials with initially strong N100 responses and with initially weak N100 responses were averaged separately. Results: For the total trial sample, the N100 and P200 amplitudes decreased from the 1st to the 2nd stimulus of the train but not thereafter. Trials with an initially strong N100 response were qualified by likewise larger N100 amplitudes to the 2nd stimulus, as compared to trials with initially weak N100 responses, and were characterized by a pronounced N100 amplitude decrease from standards to deviants. Conclusion: Our findings are difficult to reconcile with the view that the response decrement of AEP components after stimulus repetition is modulated by sensitization and habituation, as no evidence for either of these two processes could be obtained. Significance: The study provides further evidence against habituation as underlying mechanism for the AEP decrement after stimulus repetition.

NFB using an auditory stimulus as reinforcer has proven to be a useful tool to treat LD children by positively reinforcing decreases of the theta/alpha ratio. The aim of the present study was to optimize the NFB procedure by comparing the efficacy of visual (with eyes open) versus auditory (with eyes closed) reinforcers. Twenty LD children with an abnormally high theta/alpha ratio were randomly assigned to the Auditory or the Visual group, where a 500 Hz tone or a visual stimulus (a white square), respectively, was used as a positive reinforcer when the value of the theta/alpha ratio was reduced. Both groups had signs consistent with EEG maturation, but only the Auditory Group showed behavioral/cognitive improvements. In conclusion, the auditory reinforcer was more efficacious in reducing the theta/alpha ratio, and it improved the cognitive abilities more than the visual reinforcer.

Many hospital outbreaks involving MDR transmitted through environmental contamination have been reported. Bedside high-density EEG allow for dynamic cognitive evaluation in brain-injured patients and is used more and more frequently in clinical practice to evaluate brain function and predict outcome in severely neurologically impaired patients. Unfortunately, the material used for this procedure is not entirely disposable. Method: We performed a systematic analysis of MDR bacterial contamination in patients contaminated in our ICU using specific bacteriological methods. Results: We report a proven case of cross-contamination of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, and a possible case of cross-contamination of a carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain. Conclusion: Cross-contamination of MDR bacteria is possible through high-density EEG material. However, appropriate procedures can decrease this risk. (C) 2016 British Epilepsy Association.

Effect of Anodal-tDCS on Event-Related Potentials: A Controlled Study	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION; MEMORY; ENHANCEMENT; PERFORMANCE; IMAGERY; SAFETY; P300	We aim to measure the postintervention effects of A-tDCS (anodal-tDCS) on brain potentials commonly used in BCI applications, namely, Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD), Event-Related Synchronization (ERS), and P300. Ten subjects were given sham and 1.5mA A-tDCS for 15 minutes on two separate experiments in a double-blind, randomized order. Postintervention EEG was recorded while subjects were asked to perform a spelling task based on the "oddball paradigm" while P300 power was measured. Additionally, ERD and ERS were measured while subjects performed mental motor imagery tasks. ANOVA results showed that the absolute P300 power exhibited a statistically significant difference between sham and A-tDCS when measured over channel Pz (p = 0.0002). However, the difference in ERD and ERS power was found to be statistically insignificant, in controversion of the the mainstay of the litrature on the subject. The outcomes confirm the possible postintervention effect of tDCS on the P300 response. Heightening P300 response using A-tDCS may help improve the accuracy of P300 spellers for neurologically impaired subjects. Additionally, it may help the development of neurorehabilitation methods targeting the parietal lobe.

Hence, the present study aimed to explore the Latency-Intensity (L-I) function, i.e., how the latency and amplitude change as a function of intensity using speech stimuli. MATERIALS and METHODS: Speech-evoked ALLR was obtained from 15 normal-hearing individuals. The syllable/ta/was used to record ALLR with an intensity of 30, 50, 70, and 90 dBSPL. Electroencephalography (EEG) from five channels was recorded and analyzed offline. RESULTS: The overall results revealed that there is an influence of intensity on P1 and N1 latencies in a nonlinear fashion. The latency change is consistent at lower intensities than at moderate and high intensities. The amplitude changes did not reach significance, though a decrease with a reduction in intensity was obvious. CONCLUSION: There is a significant effect of intensity on the latency and amplitude of ALLR in speech stimulus. However, this effect may vary for different speech stimuli.

Methods: We studied the gradient of EMG-free EEG spectra to quantitatively inform the choice of threshold. Then, pre-existing EEG from 3 disparate experimental groups was examined before and after applying the heuristic to validate that the heuristic preserved neurogenic activity (Berger effect, auditory odd ball, visual and auditory steady state responses). Results: (1) ICA-based EMG removal diminished EMG contamination up to approximately 50 Hz, (2) residual EMG contamination using automatic selection was similar to manual selection, and (3) task-induced cortical activity remained, was enhanced, or was revealed using the ICA-based methodology. Conclusion: This study further validates ICA as a powerful technique for separating and removing myogenic signals from EEG. Automatic processing based on spectral gradients to exclude EMG-containing components is a conceptually simple and valid technique. Significance: This study strengthens ICA as a technique to remove EMG contamination from EEG whilst preserving neurogenic activity to 50 Hz.

J	De Venuto, D; Annese, VF; Mezzina, G				De Venuto, Daniela; Annese, Valerio Francesco; Mezzina, Giovanni			Remote Neuro-Cognitive Impairment Sensing Based on P300 Spatio-Temporal Monitoring	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Mobile health-care; P300; t-RIDE; EEG; ERP	RESPONSES; SYSTEM	A novel mobile healthcare solution for remotely monitoring neuro-cognitive efficiency is here presented. The method is based on the spatio-temporal characterization of a specific event-related potential, called P300, induced in our brain by a target stimulus. P300 analysis is used as a biomarker: the amplitude and latency of the signal are quality indexes of the brain activity. Up to now, the P300 characterization has been performed in hospital through EEG analysis and it has not been experimented an algorithm that can work remotely and learn from the subject performance. The proposed m-health service allows remote EEG monitoring of P300 through a "plug and play" system based on the video game reaction of the subject under test. The signal processing is achieved by tuned residue iteration decomposition (t-RIDE). The methodology has been tested on the parietal-cortex area (Pz, Fz, and Cz) of 12 subjects involved in three different cognitive tasks with increasing difficulty. For the set of considered subjects, a P300 deviation has been detected: the amplitude ranges around 2.8-8 mu V and latency around 300-410 ms. To demonstrate the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm respect the state of the art, a comparison between t-RIDE, RIDE, independent component analysis (ICA) approaches, and grand average method is here reported. t-RIDE and ICA analyses report the same results (0.1% deviation) using the same data set (game with a detection of 40 targets). Nevertheless, t-RIDE is 1.6 times faster than ICA since converges in 79 iterations (i.e., t-RIDE: 1.95s against ICA: 3.1s). Furthermore, t-RIDE reaches 80% of accuracy after only 13 targets (task time can be reduced to 65s); differently from ICA, t-RIDE can be performed even on a single channel. The procedure shows fast diagnosis capability in cognitive deficit, including mild and heavy cognitive impairment.

This ability is essential for adaptive behaviour, and it is also a requirement for accurate performance in daily life. It has been suggested that there are two main inhibitory functions related to behaviour, as inhibition is observed to affect behaviour at different time intervals. Proactive inhibition permits the subject to control his behavioural response over time by creating a response tendency, while reactive inhibition is considered to be a process that usually inhibits an already initiated response. In this context, it has been established that inhibitory function is implemented by specific fronto-basal-ganglia circuits. In the present study, we investigated the role of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) in response inhibition by combining into a single task the Go-NoGo task and the Stop-Signal task. Concurrently, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the IFC and recorded electroencephalography (EEG). Thus, we obtained online EEG measurements of the tDCS-induced modifications in the IFC together with the participant's performance in a response inhibition task. We found that applying bilateral tDCS on the IFC (right anodal/left cathodal) significantly increased proactive inhibition, although the behavioural parameters indicative of reactive inhibition were unaffected by the stimulation. Finally, the inhibitory-P3 component reflected a similar modulation under both inhibitory conditions induced by the stimulation. Our data indicates that an online tDCS-ERP approach is achievable, but that a tDCS bilateral montage may not be the most efficient one for modulating the rIFC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Memory can be divided into two categories, i.e., long term memory and short term memory (STM). STM or working memory (WM) stores information for a short span of time and it is used for information manipulations and fast response activities. WM is generally involved in the higher cognitive functions of the brain. Different studies have been carried out by researchers to understand the WM process. Most of these studies were based on neuroimaging modalities like fMRI, EEG, MEG etc., which use standalone processes. Each neuroimaging modality has some pros and cons. For example, EEG gives high temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. On the other hand, the fMRI results have a high spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution. For a more in depth understanding and insight of what is happening inside the human brain during the WM process or during cognitive tasks, high spatial as well as high temporal resolution is desirable. Over the past decade, researchers have been working to combine different modalities to achieve a high spatial and temporal resolution at the same time. Developments of MRI compatible EEG equipment in recent times have enabled researchers to combine EEG-fMRI successfully. The research publications in simultaneous EEG-fMRI have been increasing tremendously. This review is focused on the WM research involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquisition and analysis. We have covered the simultaneous EEG-fMRI application in WM and data processing. Also, it adds to potential fusion methods which can be used for simultaneous EEG-fMRI for WM and cognitive tasks.

Mindfulness Training for Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; attention; mindfulness; MRI scans; P300 event-related potentials; subjective cognitive decline	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; OF-THE-LITERATURE; SELF-REPORT; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; ATTENTION REGULATION; MEMORY COMPLAINTS; MEDITATION; IMPAIRMENT; REHABILITATION; P300	Introduction: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in older adults is a condition with a complex phenomenology and diverse etiologies including (but not limited to) mood, personality, and health concerns, as well as biomarkers of preclinical Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid-beta deposition and gray matter volume loss. Approximately 60% of affected persons are estimated to decline to Alzheimer's dementia. Regardless of etiology, persons with SCD may be optimal targets for early intervention. Objective: To ascertain the feasibility and impact of mindfulness training (MT) as an early intervention in persons with SCD. Methods: Using a single-blind, randomized controlled trial design, older adults with (n =14) and without (n = 22) SCD were randomized to either MT or a control condition of psychoeducation (PE) on cognitive aging. EEG/ERP (specifically, the P3 component), structural MRI, and self-report measures of psychological functioning were obtained within 4 weeks prior to and within 2 weeks following intervention. Results: MT resulted in decreased reaction time intra-individual variability for all participants, with a selective increase in the P3 event-related component for those with SCD. Compared with PE, MT also resulted in an increase in percent volume brain change in structural MRI. Finally, all SCD participants reported a decrease in cognitive complaints and increase in memory self-efficacy following intervention. Discussion: Results suggest that MT is a feasible early intervention in persons with SCD. Longer-term follow-up with larger sample sizes will determine whether MT can slow the rate of decline in persons who may be at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.

Most of the studies demonstrate decreased connectivity in cortical regions, excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and atypical processing of language in people with ASD. It is argued that difficulties in semantic integration are connected to selective insensitivity to language, which is manifested in atypical N400 ERP component. In the article we analyze the data suggesting a strong relationship between ASD and epilepsy and argue that the comorbidity is more prevalent among individuals who have cognitive dysfunction. The EEG profile of people with ASD suggests U-shaped alterations with excess in high-and low-frequency EEG bands. We critically analyze the "broken mirror" hypothesis of ASD and demonstrate findings which challenge this theory.	[Zhukova, M.

High Working Memory Load Impairs Language Processing during a Simulated Piloting Task: An ERP and Pupillometry Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental workload evaluation; electroencephalography/event-related potential (EEG/ERPs); pupil size; neuroergonomics; human factors; selective attention; attentional orienting	INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AUDITORY DISTRACTION; PUPILLARY RESPONSE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; VISUAL-SEARCH; N-BACK; NOVELTY; PERFORMANCE	Given the important amount of visual and auditory linguistic information that pilots have to process, operating an aircraft generates a high working-memory load (WML). In this context, the ability to focus attention on relevant information and to remain responsive to concurrent stimuli might be altered. Consequently, understanding the effects of WML on the processing of both linguistic targets and distractors is of particular interest in the study of pilot performance. In the present work, participants performed a simplified piloting task in which they had to follow one of three colored aircraft, according to specific written instructions (i.e., the written word for the color corresponding to the color of one of the aircraft) and to ignore either congruent or incongruent concurrent auditory distractors (i.e., a spoken name of color). The WML was manipulated with an n-back sub-task. Participants were instructed to apply the current written instruction in the low WML condition, and the 2-back written instruction in the high WML condition. Electrophysiological results revealed a major effect of WML at behavioral (i.e., decline of piloting performance), electrophysiological, and autonomic levels (i.e., greater pupil diameter). Increased WML consumed resources that could not be allocated to the processing of the linguistic stimuli, as indexed by lower P300/P600 amplitudes. Also, significantly, lower P600 responses were measured in incongruent vs. congruent trials in the low WML condition, showing a higher difficulty reorienting attention toward the written instruction, but this effect was canceled in the high WML condition. This suppression of interference in the high load condition is in line with the engagement/distraction trade-off model. We propose that P300/P600 components could be reliable indicators of WML and that they allow an estimation of its impact on the processing of linguistic stimuli.

However, little is known about the effect of the preparation interval on the repetition processes in task-switching. To examine this effect we utilized a cued task-switching paradigm with long sequences of repeated trials. Response-stimulus intervals (RSI) and cue-stimulus intervals (CSI) were manipulated in short and long conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral data were recorded. We found that with increasing repetitions, RTs were faster in the short CSI conditions, while P3 amplitudes decreased in the LS (long RSI and short CSI) conditions. Positive correlations between RT benefit and P3 activation decrease (repeat 1 repeat 5), and between the slope of the RT and P3 regression lines were observed only in the LS condition. Our findings suggest that differential preparation intervals modulate repetition processes in task switching.

Reward anticipation and trait anhedonia: An electrophysiological investigation in subjects with schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Event-related potentials; P3; Reward anticipation; Anhedonia; Avolition	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT SYNDROME; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; NEURAL RESPONSE; P300 AMPLITUDE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; COMPONENTS; SCALE; EEG	Objective: Investigate impairment of reward anticipation in subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ) and its association with negative symptom dimensions and hedonic experience. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, in thirty SCZ and twenty-three matched healthy controls (HC), during a "Monetary Incentive Delay" task in which reward and loss cues (incentive cues of positive and negative value) of different magnitude, as well as neutral cues were presented. Assessments: anticipatory and consummatory pleasure, trait anhedonia and motivation in all subjects; avolition and expressive deficit in SCZ. Results: SCZ had lower motivation but comparable hedonic experience with respect to HC. In HC, during reward anticipation, the early P3 was larger for large magnitude incentives, irrespective of their valence, while the late P3 was larger for large reward. In SCZ, early P3 did not discriminate the incentive magnitude and the late P3 was larger for large loss. Early P3 amplitude for large magnitude incentives was inversely related to trait social anhedonia but not to negative symptoms dimensions. Conclusions: SCZ are unable to integrate the incentive magnitude and reward value of future events in the context of their ongoing task. P3 abnormalities are associated with trait anhedonia, but not with negative symptoms dimensions. Significance: In line with recent studies, our findings indicate that anhedonia and avolition are partially independent constructs. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants had to read aloud the names of single letters, and event-related potentials (ERPs) for six pairs of visually dissimilar upper- and lowercase letters were recorded. Assuming that the end product of processing is the same for upper- and lowercase letters sharing the same vocal response, ERPs were compared backward, starting from the onset of articulatory responses, and the first significant divergence was observed 120 ms before response onset. Given that naming responses were produced at around 414 ms, on average, these results suggest that letter processing is influenced by visual information until 294 ms after stimulus onset. This therefore provides new empirical evidence regarding the time course and interactive nature of visual letter perception processes.

A correlation study between P300 and fatigue rating pick, minimum amplitude, latency and period) during virtual wheelchair navigation. For this purpose, an experimental environment was set up based on customizable environmental parameters (luminosity, number of obstacles ands was conducted. Finally, the best correlated features supplied three classification algorithms which are MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron), Linear Discriminate Analysis and Support Vector Machine. The results showed that the maximum feature over visual and temporal regions as well as period feature over frontal, fronto-central and visual regions were correlated with mental fatigue levels. In the other hand, minimum amplitude and latency features didn't show any correlation. Among classification techniques, MLP showed the best performance although the differences between classification techniques are minimal. Those findings can help us in order to design suitable mental fatigue based wheelchair control.

"Cerebellar contribution to visuo-attentional alpha rhythm: insights from weightlessness"	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTEX; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; LOCALIZATION	Human brain adaptation in weightlessness follows the necessity to reshape the dynamic integration of the neural information acquired in the new environment. This basic aspect was here studied by the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics where oscillatory modulations were measured during a visuo-attentional state preceding a visuo-motor docking task. Astronauts in microgravity conducted the experiment in free-floating aboard the International Space Station, before the space flight and afterwards. We observed stronger power decrease (similar to ERD: event related desynchronization) of the similar to 10 Hz oscillation from the occipital-parietal (alpha ERD) to the central areas (mu ERD). Inverse source modelling of the stronger alpha ERD revealed a shift from the posterior cingulate cortex (BA31, from the default mode network) on Earth to the precentral cortex (BA4, primary motor cortex) in weightlessness. We also observed significant contribution of the vestibular network (BA40, BA32, and BA39) and cerebellum (lobule V, VI). We suggest that due to the high demands for the continuous readjustment of an appropriate body posture in free-floating, this visuo-attentional state required more contribution from the motor cortex. The cerebellum and the vestibular network involvement in weightlessness might support the correction signals processing necessary for postural stabilization, and the increased demand to integrate incongruent vestibular information.

Event-related potentials reflecting smoking cue reactivity and cognitive control as predictors of smoking relapse and resumption	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Smoking; Event-related potentials; Smoking cue reactivity; Inhibitory control; Error processing; Smoking cessation; Relapse; Addiction; Substance use	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; FAGERSTROM TEST; CONFLICT; CORTEX; FMRI	Given that most attempts to quit smoking fail, it is critical to increase knowledge about the mechanisms involved in smoking relapse and resumption (i.e., the increase in smoking over time after a quit attempt). Neurocognitive measures, such as event-related potentials (ERPs), may provide novel insights into smoking relapse and resumption. The objective of the present study is to investigate the association between smoking relapse and resumption and ERPs reflecting smoking cue reactivity (i.e., P300, LPP), inhibitory control (i.e., N2, P3), and error processing (i.e., error-related negativity (ERN), Pe). Seventy-two smokers viewed smoking and neutral pictures and performed a Go-NoGo and an Eriksen Flanker task, while ERPs were measured using electroencephalography. All smokers started a quit attempt in the week following the laboratory visit. Smoking behavior after the quit attempt was measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Both relapse (i.e., 7-day point prevalence at 12 weeks) and smoking resumption (i.e., the number of cigarettes a day at 4, 8, and 12 weeks) were used as outcome measures. Logistic regression analyses showed that smaller P3 amplitudes, reflecting brain activation associated with inhibitory control, are related to an increased relapse risk. Latent growth curve analyses showed that reduced post-error slowing, the main behavioral measure reflecting error processing, is associated with stronger smoking resumption. ERPs reflecting smoking cue reactivity were unrelated to smoking relapse or resumption. The finding that smaller inhibitory control-related P3 amplitudes are associated with increased relapse risks suggests that strategies to increase inhibitory control in smokers are worth further investigation in the search for more effective smoking cessation interventions.

However, the majority of existing studies focused only on ERP experimental paradigms while only a few analyzed time-related changes of EEG a power patterns during the time unlocked creation of ideas. Here, we designed an experimental paradigm where the participants were asked to generate alternative uses of everyday objects (AU task). For the control task, we adopted an Object Characteristics (OC) task, for which participants were asked to list typical characteristics or properties of an object. We estimated relative power spectrum, global efficiency from brain networks constructed with the imaginary part of coherence and phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) as potential biomarkers of creativity. Both relative power spectrum and nodal global efficiency failed to reach significant level by comparing AU with OC. In contrast, statistically significant differences between AU and OC were detected with PAC estimated within sensors in frequency pairs theta-gamma and alpha 2-gamma. Our results can be the ground for both detecting and designing a connectomic biomarker of creativity.

Normal Brain Response to Propofol in Advance of Recovery from Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state (UWS/VS); propofol; anesthesia; event-related potentials (ERPs); functional connectivity	COMPLEX SOUND SEQUENCES; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; PHASE-LAG INDEX; VEGETATIVE STATE; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; NEURAL DETECTION; STATISTICAL REGULARITIES; BEDSIDE DETECTION; CONNECTIVITY; ABSENCE	Up to 40% of individuals with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) actually might be conscious. Recent attempts to detect covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive patients via neurophysiological patterns are limited by the need to compare data from brain-injured patients to healthy controls. In this report, we pilot an alternative within-subject approach by using propofol to perturb the brain state of a patient diagnosed with UWS. An auditory stimulation series was presented to the patient before, during, and after exposure to propofol while high-density electroencephalograph (BEG) was recorded. Baseline analysis revealed residual markers in the continuous EEG and event related potentials (ERPs) that have been associated with conscious processing. However, these markers were significantly distorted by the patient's pathology, challenging the interpretation of their functional significance. Upon exposure to propofol, changes in EEG characteristics were similar to what is seen in healthy individuals and ERPs associated with conscious processing disappeared. At the 1-month follow up, the patient had regained consciousness. We offer three alternative explanations for these results: (1) the patient was covertly consciousness, and was anesthetized by propofol administration; (2) the patient was unconscious, and the observed EEG changes were a propofol-specific phenomenon; and (3) the patient was unconscious, but his brain networks responded normally in a way that heralded the possibility of recovery. These alternatives will be tested in a larger study, and raise the intriguing possibility of using a general anesthetic as a probe of brain states in behaviorally unresponsive patients.

Delayed Copying of Unfamiliar Contour Shapes: Analysis of Potentials Related to Stimuli	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						working memory; internal representation; contour shapes; motor sequences; high-density EEG; ERP; cortical sources	REPRESENTATIONS; EEG; BRAIN	The high-density EEG was recorded and ERPs related to showing unfamiliar contour shapes and delivering imperative signal (a short sound) were estimated in the task requiring delayed motor reproduction of these shapes. A total of 22 right-handed adults participated in the experiment. They performed 5 blocks of trials corresponding to 5 different delays (T = 0, 500, 1000, 2000 x 4000 ms) between the imperative signal relative to the end of the contour trajectory presentation. An ERP analysis showed that, unlike ERPs related to the contour shape presentation, those related to the imperative signal delivery do change with growing delay T. A subsequent analysis of cortical sources of the ERPs related to the imperative stimulus showed corresponding pronounced grows of reactivity of orbito-frontal cortex of the right hemisphere and a symmetrical bilateral grows of reactivity of dorsal parts of the sensorimotor cortex. The reported findings are discussed in the framework of the proposal according to which the internal representation of a trajectory undergoes a transition from a sensory-specific format towards more abstract neither sensory- nor motor-specific format.

The present study investigated how well self-report is reflected by cognitive-neurophysiological and actigraph measures, which we have previously shown to discriminate between ADHD persisters, remitters and controls using parent-report (Cheung et al., 2015; Brit J Psychiat http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.114.145185). Method: Parent- and self-reported ADHD symptoms and impairment, together with cognitive, electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency, event-related potential (ERP) and actigraph measures were obtained from 108 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD and 167 controls. Results: Participants reported lower levels of ADHD symptoms and impairments than parents (p < 0.05) and the ADHD persistence rate based on self-report was low at 44%, compared to the persistence rate of 79% previously reported based on parent-report. Regression analyses showed that the objective measures distinguished poorly between ADHD persistent and remittent groups based on self-report, in contrast to findings based on parent-report (Cheung et al., 2015), although the measures differentiated well between ADHD persisters and controls. Correlation analyses revealed that self-reported impairment significantly correlated with fewer of the objective measures, despite parent- and self-reported symptoms showing similar correlations with the measures. Conclusions: The findings show that self-reported ADHD outcome is not as well reflected by cognitive-neurophysiological and movement correlates as we previously found for parent-reported ADHD.

The Deutsch "high-low" word illusion might trigger attentional responses mimicking those under AVHs. Methods: We therefore have invited 16 patients with first-episode, paranoid schizophrenia, and 16 age-and gender-matched healthy volunteers to undergo the "oddball" event-related potentials elicited by the illusion. The clinical characteristics of patients were measured with the positive and negative symptom scale. Results: Besides the longer reaction time to the illusion, the standard P2 latency was shortened, the N2 latency was prolonged, and both N1 and P3 amplitudes were reduced in patients. The P3 source analyses showed the activated bilateral temporal lobes, parietal lobe and cingulate cortex in both groups, left inferior temporal gyrus in controls, and left postcentral gyrus in schizophrenia. Moreover, the N1 amplitude was positively correlated with the paranoid score in patients. Conclusions: Our results were in line with previous neurophysiological and neuroimaging reports of hallucination or auditory processing in schizophrenia, and illustrated a whole process of cerebral information processing from N1 to P3, indicating this illusion had triggered a dynamic cerebral response similar to that of the AVHs had engaged.

We tested whether gamblers and ADHD patients exhibit similar reward-related brain activity in response to feedback in a gambling task. A series of brain electrical responses can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the stimulus-locked event-related potentials (ERP), when participants in a gambling task are given feedback regardless of winning or losing the previous bet. Here, we used a simplified computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess differences in reinforcement-driven choice adaptation between unmedicated ADHD patients with or without problem gambling traits and contrasted with a sex- and age-matched control group. EEG was recorded from the participants while they were engaged in the task which contained two choice options with different net payouts and win/loss probabilities. Learning trend which shows the ability to acquire and use knowledge of the reward outcomes to obtain a positive financial outcome was not observed in ADHD gamblers versus nongamblers. Induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) power over frontal cortex was significantly higher in gamblers versus nongamblers in all different high-risk/low-risk win/lose conditions. Whereas induced low alpha (9-11 Hz) power at frontal electrodes could only differentiate high-risk lose between gamblers and nongamblers but not the other three conditions between the two groups. The results indicate that ADHD nongamblers do not share with problem gamblers underlying deficits in reward learning. These pilot data highlight the need for studies of ADHD in gambling to elucidate how motivational states are represented during feedback processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current study examined the degree to which neural response to social and nonsocial feedback is modulated by autistic versus psychopathic traits in a sample of typically developing adults (N = 31, 11 males, 18-52 years). Event-related potentials were recorded whilst participants completed a behavioral task and received feedback on task performance. Both autistic and psychopathic traits were associated with alterations in the neural correlates of feedback processing. Sensitivity to specific forms of feedback (social, nonsocial, positively valenced, negatively valenced) differed between the two traits. Autistic traits were associated with decreased sensitivity to social feedback. In contrast, the antisocial domain of psychopathic traits was associated with an overall decrease in sensitivity to feedback, and the interpersonal manipulation domain was associated with preserved processing of positively valenced feedback. Results suggest distinct alterations within specific mechanisms of feedback processing may underlie similar difficulties in social behavior.

In this study, we investigated whether a minimal group paradigm assigning individuals to arbitrary group categories is powerful enough to induce changes in behavioural, psychophysiological and event-related potential correlates of performance monitoring. Following arbitrary group assignment based on ostensible task performance and a group identification task, 22 volunteers performed a flanker-task during both in-group and out-group contexts, while electroencephalography was performed. More errors were committed in the out-group compared with the in-group context. Error-related negativity amplitudes were larger for in-group compared with out-group errors. However, subsequent processing reflected in late Pe amplitudes and stimulus-driven conflict reflected in N2 amplitudes were not affected by the group context. Heart rate deceleration (during both correct and incorrect trials) tended to be more pronounced during the out-group compared with the in-group context. This surprising observation was corroborated by subjective ratings of performance satisfaction, in which participants reported higher satisfaction with their out-group performance. This study identified specific stimulus evaluation processes to be affected by a minimal group manipulation and demonstrated thereby transient top-down effects of a social context manipulation on performance monitoring.

A typical example of this phenomenon is the attentional blink, where participants show a robust deficit in reporting the second of two targets (T2) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream. Previous electroencephalographical (EEG) studies showed that neural correlates of correct T2 report are not limited to the RSVP period, but extend before visual stimulation begins. In particular, reduced oscillatory neural activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) before the onset of the RSVP has been linked to lower T2 accuracy. We therefore examined whether auditory rhythmic stimuli presented at a rate of 10 Hz (within the alpha band) could increase oscillatory alpha-band activity and improve T2 performance in the attentional blink time window. Behaviourally, the auditory rhythmic stimulation worked to enhance T2 accuracy. This enhanced perception was associated with increases in the posterior T2-evoked N2 component of the event-related potentials and this effect was observed selectively at lag 3. Frontal and posterior oscillatory alpha-band activity was also enhanced during auditory stimulation in the pre-RSVP period and positively correlated with T2 accuracy. These findings suggest that ongoing fluctuations can be shaped by sensorial events to improve the allocation of attention in time. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

In contrast to previous research, we observed this effect using a paradigm in which participants could not predict the emotional or the neutral content of the pictures before their onset. These effects were obtained alongside significant behavioural effects of superior recognition memory for emotional compared with neutral items. These findings suggest that the preferential encoding of emotional events in memory is determined by fluctuations in the availability of processing resources just before event onset. This explanation argues in favour of mediational models of emotional memory, which contend that emotional information is preferentially encoded because it mobilizes a greater amount of processing resources than neutral information.

We examined whether cognitive and neurophysiological impairments on a performance-monitoring task distinguish between ADHD persisters and remitters. METHODS: On average 6 years after initial assessment, 110 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 remitters) and 169 age-matched control participants were compared on cognitive-performance measures and event-related potentials of conflict monitoring (N2) and error processing (error-related negativity and positivity) from an arrow flanker task with low-conflict and high-conflict conditions. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and functional impairment measures using a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. RESULTS: ADHD persisters were impaired compared with controls on all cognitive-performance and event-related potential measures (all p < .05). ADHD remitters differed from persisters and were indistinguishable from control participants on the number of congruent (low-conflict) errors, reaction time variability, error-related negativity, and error-related positivity (all p <= .05). Remitters did not differ significantly from the other groups on incongruent (high-conflict) errors, mean reaction time, and N2. In dimensional analyses on all participants with childhood ADHD, ADHD symptoms and functional impairment at follow-up were significantly correlated with congruent errors, reaction time variability, and error-related positivity (r = .19-.23, p <= .05). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and neurophysiological measures of attention-vigilance and error detection distinguished ADHD remitters from persisters. These results extend our previous findings with other tasks and indicate that such measures are markers of remission and candidates for the development of nonpharmacological interventions.

EEG evidence for a cognitive evaluation of perceptual constructs	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ambiguous figures; Necker cube; Multistable perception; EEG; ERPs; Bayesian inference	P300; ACCUMULATION; STIMULI; MEMORY; SIGNAL	Environmental information available to our senses is incomplete and to varying degrees ambiguous. It has to be disambiguated in order to construct stable and reliable percepts. Ambiguous figures are artificial examples where perception is maximally unstable and alternates between possible interpretations. Tiny low-level changes can disambiguate an ambiguous figure and thus stabilize percepts. The present study compares ERPs evoked by ambiguous stimuli and disambiguated stimulus variants across three visual categories: geometry (Necker cube), motion (stroboscopic alternative motion stimulus, SAM) and semantics (Boring's old/young woman). We found that (a) disambiguated stimulus variants cause stable percepts and evoke two huge positive ERP excursions (Cohen's effect sizes 1-2), (b) the amplitudes of these ERP effects are inversely related to the degree of stimulus ambiguity, and (c) this pattern of results is consistent across all three tested visual categories. This generality across visual categories points to mechanisms at a very abstract (cognitive) level of processing. We discuss our results in the context of a high-level Bayesian inference unit that evaluates the reliability of perceptual processing results, given a priori incomplete, ambiguous sensory information. The ERP components may reflect the outcome of this reliability estimation.

On the whole, findings across substances (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, nicotine, opiates, gambling, and gaming) demonstrate impairments in the differentiation of monetary incentives and the inhibition of prepotent responses. Furthermore, exaggerated resources devoted to drug cues and attenuated processing of other types of pleasant emotional stimuli predict greater probability of future drug use. However, drug use recency, frequency, sensitivity, and insight all appear to be moderators of these effects. We argue that more longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the time course of reward processing as a function of development and chronicity.

This research has revealed that different types of electrophysiological processes in the human brain can be modified by conditioning: sensory evoked potentials, sensory induced gamma-band activity, periods of frequency-specific waves (alpha and beta waves, the sensorimotor rhythm and the mu-rhythm) and slow cortical potentials. Conditioning of these processes has been studied in experiments that either use operant conditioning or repeated contingent pairings of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (classical conditioning). In operant conditioning, the appearance of a specific brain process is paired with an external stimulus (neurofeedback) and the feedback enables subjects to obtain varying degrees of control of the CNS-process. Such acquired self-regulation of brain activity has found practical uses for instance in the amelioration of epileptic seizures, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It has also provided communicative means of assistance for tetraplegic patients through the use of brain computer interfaces. Both extra and intracortically recorded signals have been coupled with contingent external feedback. It is the aim for this review to summarize essential results on all types of electromagnetic brain processes that have been modified by classical or operant conditioning. The results are organized according to type of conditioned EEG-process, type of conditioning, and sensory modalities of the conditioning stimuli. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Banon, JA; Rothman, J				Aleman Banon, Jose; Rothman, Jason			The role of morphological markedness in the processing of number and gender agreement in Spanish: an event-related potential investigation	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						P600; markedness; agreement; number and gender	BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; GRAMMATICAL GENDER; SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; SUBJECT; ERP; COMPLEXITY; PREDICTION; DISCOURSE	Current morphological theory assumes that feature values, such as masculine and feminine or singular and plural, are asymmetrically represented. That is, one member of the opposition (e.g. feminine for gender, plural for number) is assumed to be marked, and the other one, unmarked. The present study examines how these asymmetries impact agreement resolution in Spanish. Agreement was manipulated between a noun acting as head of a relative clause and an adjective located inside the relative clause (e.g. catedral que parecia inmensa cathedral that looked huge). Half of the nouns were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine (unmarked). Half of the nouns were used in the plural (marked) and the other half, in the singular (unmarked). Twenty-seven Spanish native speakers read 240 sentences while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography and performed a grammaticality judgment. Results showed that both number and gender violations elicited a central-posterior P600, a component associated with syntactic repair, and a late anterior negativity, argued to reflect working memory costs. Only the P600 was affected by markedness. It started earlier for violations where the mismatching feature was marked. Moreover, it was larger for errors where the mismatching feature was marked, although this amplitude modulation only emerged for number, possibly due to differences in how number and gender cues were realized (i.e. both masculine and feminine showed overt inflection, but singular was uninflected relative to plural). These results suggest that the parser is sensitive to markedness asymmetries in the course of online processing.

Previous studies have shown the relation between event-related EEG and sensory-cognitive representation and revealed that categorization of presented object can be successfully recognized using recorded EEG signals when subjects view objects. Here, EEG signals in conjunction with a multivariate pattern recognition technique were used for investigating the possibility to identify conceptual representation based on the presentation of 12 semantic categories of objects (5 exemplars per category). Using multivariate stimulus decoding methods, surprisingly, we demonstrate that how objects are discriminated from phase pattern of EEG signals across the time in low-frequency band (1-4 Hz), but not from power of oscillatory brain signals in the same frequency band. In contrast, discrimination accuracy from the power of EEG signals has significantly higher than the performance from phase of EEG signal in the high-frequency band (20-30 Hz). Moreover, our results indicate that how the accuracy of prediction changes between various areas of brain continuously across the time. In particular, we find that, during the object categorization task, the inter-trial phase coherence in low-frequency band is significantly higher than other frequency in various regions of interests. This measure is associated with decoding pattern across the time. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying conceptual representation can be mediated by the phase of oscillatory neural activity.

They can facilitate selectivity or disrupt it. This EEG study was designed to examine the reciprocal relations between stress, load and attention. Two groups of subjects, one that performed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and a control group, were asked to respond to a target letter under low and high perceptual load in the absence or presence of a distractor. In the control group, the distractor increased response times (RTs) for high and low load. In the TSST group, distractor increased RTs under low load only. ERPs showed that distractor's presentation attenuated early visual P1 component and shortened its latency. In the TSST group, distractor reduced P1 component under high load but did not affect its latency. Source localization demonstrated reduced activation in V1 in response to distractors presence in the P1 time window for the TSST group compared to the control group. A behavioral replication revealed that in the TSST group distractors were less perceived under high load. Taken together, our results show that stress and perceptual load affect selectivity through the early stages of visual processing and might increase selectivity in a manner that would block conscious perception of irrelevant stimuli.

A Permutation Test for Unbalanced Paired Comparisons of Global Field Power	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Statistical test; Oddball paradigm; Data imbalance; Electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DIFFERENCE; AVERAGE; WAVE	Global field power is a valuable summary of multi-channel electroencephalography data. However, global field power is biased by the noise typical of electroencephalography experiments, so comparisons of global field power on data with unequal noise are invalid. Here, we demonstrate the relationship between the number of trials that contribute to a global field power measure and the expected value of that global field power measure. We also introduce a statistical testing procedure that can be used for multi-subject, repeated-measures (also called within-subjects) comparisons of global field power when the number of trials per condition is unequal across conditions. Simulations demonstrate the effect of unequal trial numbers on global field power comparisons and show the validity of the proposed test in contrast to conventional approaches. Finally, the proposed test and two alternative tests are applied to data collected in a rapid serial visual presentation target detection experiment. The results show that the proposed test finds global field power differences in the classical P3 range; the other tests find differences in that range but also at other times including at times before stimulus onset. These results are interpreted as showing that the proposed test is valid and sensitive to real within-subject differences in global field power in multi-subject unbalanced data.

Neural correlates of chasing perception in 9-month-old infants	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						P400; Animacy perception; Chasing	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACES; RECOGNITION; STIMULI; MOTION; SPECIALIZATION; ACTIVATION; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION	We investigated the neural correlates of chasing perception in infancy to determine whether animated interactions are processed as social events. By using EEG and an ERP design with animations of simple geometric shapes, we examined whether the positive posterior (P400) component, previously found in response to social stimuli, as well as the attention related negative fronto-central component (Nc), differs when infants observed a chaser versus a non-chaser. In Study 1, the chaser was compared to an inanimate object. In Study 2, the chaser was compared to an animate but not chasing agent (randomly moving agent). Results demonstrate no difference in the Nc component, but statistically higher P400 amplitude when the chasing agent was compared to either an inanimate object or a random object. We also find a difference in the N290 component in both studies and in the P200 component in Study 2, when the chasing agent is compared to the randomly moving agent. The present studies demonstrate for the first time that infants' process correlated motion such as chasing as a social interaction. The perception of the chasing agent elicits stronger time-locked responses, denoting a link between motion perception and social cognition. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It has been reported that rhinal and hippocampal EEG measures reflecting the stability of phases across trials are better suited to distinguish subsequently remembered from forgotten trials than event-related potentials or amplitude-based measures. Theoretical models suggest that the phase of EEG oscillations reflects neural excitability and influences cellular plasticity. However, while previous studies have shown that the stability of phase values across trials is indeed a relevant predictor of subsequent memory performance, the effect of absolute single-trial phase values has been little explored. Here, we reanalyzed intracranial EEG recordings from the mediotemporal lobe of 27 epilepsy patients performing a continuous word recognition paradigm. Two-class classification using a support vector machine was performed to predict subsequently remembered vs. forgotten trials based on individually selected frequencies and time points. We demonstrate that it is possible to successfully predict single-trial memory formation in the majority of patients (23 out of 27) based on only three single-trial phase values given by a rhinal phase, a hippocampal phase, and a rhinal-hippocampal phase difference. Overall classification accuracy across all subjects was 69.2% choosing frequencies from the range between 0.5 and 50 Hz and time points from the interval between -0.5 s and 2 s. For 19 patients, above chance prediction of subsequent memory was possible even when choosing only time points from the prestimulus interval (overall accuracy: 65.2%). Furthermore, prediction accuracies based on single-trial phase surpassed those based on single-trial power. Our results confirm the functional relevance of mediotemporal EEG phase for long-term memory operations and suggest that phase information may be utilized for memory enhancement applications based on deep brain stimulation.

Commentary on: "How inappropriate high-pass filters can produce artefacts and incorrect conclusions in ERP studies of language and cognition"	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Editorial Material						Baseline correction; High-pass filter; ERP; ERF; EEG; MEG	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA	Tanner et al. (2015. Psychophysiology, 52(8), 1009. doi: 10.1111/psyp.12437) convincingly demonstrate how a late deflection like the N400 or the P600 is reflected into both earlier and later latencies by the application of high-pass filters with cutoff frequencies higher than 0.1 Hz. It nicely underlines the importance of test-wise application of filters with different parameters to electrophysiological data to identify such unwanted filter effects. In general, we agree with their approach and conclusions, particularly with the notions that the application of a high-pass filter is reasonable if it improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal of interest, and that low frequency signals may carry important information. However, we disagree in two aspects: First, the test data of Tanner et al. are not optimally suited to demonstrate the benefits of high-pass filtering as they are only minimally contaminated by low frequency noise, and second, the standard baseline correction for particular applications in M/EEG data analysis should be replaced with high-pass filtering as recommended by Widmann et al.

These researches are based on studying the brain behavior after color stimulus, and finding a way to classify its signals offline without considering the real time. Moving to the next step, we present a single trial classification model for EEG signals evoked by RGB colors stimuli, which is not presented in previous studies. In this research, EEG signals were recorded from 7 subjects through BCI2000 toolbox. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique was used at the signal analysis stage. Various feature extraction methods were investigated to find the best and reliable set, including Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP), Target mean with Feast Fourier Transform (FFT), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), Auto Regressive model (AR) and EMD residual. A new feature selection method was created based on the peak's time of EEG signal when red and blue colors stimuli are presented. The ERP image was used to find out the peak's time, which was around 300 ms for the red color and around 450 ms for the blue color. The classification was performed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, LIBSVM toolbox being used for that purpose. The EMD residual was found to be the most reliable method that gives the highest classification accuracy with an average of 88.5% and with an execution time of only 14 seconds.

J	Teichert, T				Teichert, Tobias			Tonal frequency affects amplitude but not topography of rhesus monkey cranial EEG components	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Rhesus monkey; Cranial EEG; Auditory evoked potentials; Pitch; N1; Schizophrenia	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; REPRESENTATION; SUBDIVISIONS	The rhesus monkey is an important model of human auditory function in general and auditory deficits in neuro-psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia in particular. Several rhesus monkey studies have described homologs of clinically relevant auditory evoked potentials such as pitch-based mismatch negativity, a fronto-central negativity that can be observed when a series of regularly repeating sounds is disrupted by a sound of different tonal frequency. As a result it is well known how differences of tonal frequency are represented in rhesus monkey EEG. However, to date there is no study that systematically quantified how absolute tonal frequency itself is represented. In particular, it is not known if frequency affects rhesus monkey EEG component amplitude and topography in the same way as previously shown for humans. A better understanding of the effect of frequency may strengthen inter-species homology and will provide a more solid foundation on which to build the interpretation of frequency MMN in the rhesus monkey. Using arrays of up to 32 cranial EEG electrodes in 4 rhesus macaques we identified 8 distinct auditory evoked components including the N85, a fronto-central negativity that is the presumed homolog of the human N1. In line with human data, the amplitudes of most components including the N85 peaked around 1000 Hz and were strongly attenuated above similar to 1750 Hz. Component topography, however, remained largely unaffected by frequency. This latter finding may be consistent with the known absence of certain anatomical structures in the rhesus monkey that are believed to cause the changes in topography in the human by inducing a rotation of generator orientation as a function of tonal frequency. Overall, the findings are consistent with the assumption of a homolog representation of tonal frequency in human and rhesus monkey EEG. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The early components of visual evoked related potential (ERP) reflect exogenous (sensory) inputs and can be explained by connections from the lower to higher layers (forward connections). The ERP components after 200 ms reflect endogenous activity and require the inclusion of both forward and backward connections in the model. Our results complement the work of other authors who showed earlier using DCM that the backward connections occur at the late latencies in auditory oddball experiment.	[Sharaev, M.

Therefore, there is a need for determining the possible success of robotic interventions on selected patients, which in turn determine the necessity for new investigating instruments supporting the treatment decision-making process and customization. The objective of the work presented in this preliminary study was to verify that fully robot assistance would not affect the physiological oscillatory cortical activity related to a functional movement in healthy subjects. Further, the clinical results following the robotic treatment of a chronic stroke patient, who positively reacted to the robotic intervention, were analyzed and discussed. First results show that there is no difference in EEG activation pattern between assisted and no-assisted movement in healthy subjects. Even more importantly, the patient's pretreatment EEG activation pattern in no-assisted movement was completely altered, while it recovered to a quasi-physiological one in robot-assisted movement. The functional improvement following treatment was large. Using pretreatment EEG recording during robot-assisted movement might be a valid approach to assess the potential ability of the patient for recovering.

While recognition of social information and emotion processing are impaired in schizophrenia, no previous study analyzed induced and evoked beta oscillations in patients with schizophrenia during emotion processing. Twenty-eight subjects with schizophrenia and twenty-seven healthy controls subjects were enrolled in the study. The two study groups did not differ in age, gender and education. Participants viewed positive, neutral and negative scenes selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while 128-channel EEG was recorded. A significantly weaker low beta ERD was detected in patients relative to controls for the negative stimulus condition in the right parieto-occipital and temporal regions. Patients with decreased beta ERD showed more prominent negative symptoms and more severe deficits in psychosocial functioning. Only in the control group stronger beta ERD was detected for the negative stimuli relative to positive and neutral stimuli in the same regions. Our major finding is that impaired emotion processing in schizophrenia is reflected in decreased low beta ERD and in the diminished differences between low beta ERD to negative and non-negative emotional stimuli. Furthermore, it was found that patients with decreased beta ERD show more prominent negative symptoms and more severe deficits in psychosocial functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

J. & Chauvel, P. (2002) Epileptic fast activity can be explained by a model of impaired GABAergic dendritic inhibition. Eur. J. Neurosci., 15, 1499.] to explain several different types of electroencephalographic activities. We could find three principal types of steady states when the system parameters change slowly: (i) the model produce a constant output when it is under a state of stable equilibrium point with a constant input. If a small perturbation is introduced (e.g., noisy input), the output changes into noise without oscillatory components, which is related to the normal background activity or low-voltage rapid activity, (ii) Hopf bifurcations lead to stable limit cycles, which we call Hopf cycles. The model generates a rhythmic oscillating output when it is under a state of Hopf cycles, which is related to slow rhythmic activity or slow quasi-sinusoidal activity, (iii) global bifurcations lead to homoclinic limit cycles that appear suddenly at high amplitude, which we call spike cycles. In general, the spike cycles are not harmonic but they have a spike-like appearance (anharmonic oscillation). The model produces a spike-like output when it is under a state of spike cycles, which is related to the sustained discharge of spikes. Finally, the bifurcation analysis demonstrates the influence of the interaction between the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic gains on the dynamics.

A major advance is now possible thanks to the application of pattern classifiers to time-resolved recordings of brain activity [ electro-encephalography (EEG), magneto-encephalography (MEG), or intracranial recordings]. The method determines precisely when a specific mental content becomes explicitly represented in brain activity. Most importantly, the ability of these pattern classifiers to generalize across time and experimental conditions sheds light on the temporal organization of information-processing stages. To illustrate these ideas, we show how the decoding of MEG and EEG recordings can be used to track the fate of conscious and unconscious brain processes during simple masking and auditory novelty tasks. The experimental results yield converging results, suggesting that conscious perception is associated with the late formation of a distributed and stable neural assembly that encodes the content of subjective perception.

For examining visual/audio synesthesia, the effect of smelling and tasting an online product, this study first developed design elements of digital video advertising: rational/emotional appeals and fast/slow tempo. Moreover, it strives to investigate empirically the effects of various online advertisement contexts on consumer emotion, attitude, and behavioral intention. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) in a scenario-based laboratory experiments. Data collected from 166 customers provide strong support for the research model. Through EEG and SEM analyses, in rational advertisings, consumers' olfactory was triggered and both arousal and pleasure of the emotions affected the attitudes; in emotional advertisings, not only olfactory but gustatory were triggered and only pleasure affected the attitudes. By understanding online advertising design and synesthesia, insights from the findings can benefit designers and marketers in implementing more effective marketing strategies.

We review the recent EEG findings in healthy older individuals (age range: 65-75 years approximately) on perceptual, attentional and memory mechanisms-reflected in the N1, N2pc and contralateral delayed activity (CDA) components of the EEG, respectively-during the execution of a variety of cognitive tasks requiring simultaneous processing of multiple elements. The findings point to multiple loci of neural changes in multi-object analysis, and suggest the involvement of early perceptual mechanisms, attentive individuation and working memory (WM) operations in the neural and cognitive modification due to aging. However, the findings do not simply reflect early impairments with a cascade effect over subsequent stages of stimulus processing, but in fact highlight interesting dissociations between the effects occurring at the various stages of stimulus processing. Finally, the results on older adults indicate the occurrence of neural overactivation in association to good levels of performance in easy perceptual contexts, thus providing some hints on the existence of compensatory phenomena that are associated with the functioning of early perceptual mechanisms.

Numerous biomarkers have been developed that can help in making an early diagnosis. The P300 is an event-related potential that may be abnormal in Alzheimer's disease. Given the possible association between P300 amplitude and Alzheimer's disease and the need for biomarkers in early Alzheimer's disease, the main purpose of this meta-analysis and meta-regression was to characterize P300 amplitude in probable Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy controls. Using online search engines, we identified peer-reviewed articles containing amplitude measures for the P300 in response to a visual or auditory oddball stimulus in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and in a healthy control group and pooled effect sizes for differences in P300 amplitude between Alzheimer's disease and control groups to obtain summary effect sizes. We also used meta-regression to determine whether age, sex, educational attainment, or dementia severity affected the association between P300 amplitude and Alzheimer's disease. Twenty articles containing a total of 646 subjects met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The overall effect size from all electrode locations was 1.079 (95% confidence interval = 0.745-1.412, P < .001). The pooled effect sizes for the Cz, Fz, and Pz locations were 1.226 (P < .001), 0.724 (P = .0007), and 1.430 (P < .001), respectively. Meta-regression showed an association between amplitude and educational attainment, but no association between amplitude and age, sex, and dementia severity. In conclusion, P300 amplitude is smaller in subjects with Alzheimer's disease than in healthy controls.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) can be used as a natural control method for such technologies. BMI provides a continuous association between the brain activity and peripheral stimulation, with the potential to induce plastic changes in the nervous system. Paraplegic patients, and especially the ones with incomplete injuries, constitute a potential target population to be rehabilitated with brain-controlled robotic systems, as they may improve their gait function after the reinforcement of their spared intact neural pathways. This paper proposes a closed-loop BMI system to control an ambulatory exoskeleton without any weight or balance support for gait rehabilitation of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The integrated system was validated with three healthy subjects, and its viability in a clinical scenario was tested with four SCI patients. Using a cue-guided paradigm, the electroencephalographic signals of the subjects were used to decode their gait intention and to trigger the movements of the exoskeleton. We designed a protocol with a special emphasis on safety, as patients with poor balance were required to stand and walk. We continuously monitored their fatigue and exertion level, and conducted usability and user-satisfaction tests after the experiments. The results show that, for the three healthy subjects, 84.44 +/- 14.56% of the trials were correctly decoded. Three out of four patients performed at least one successful BMI session, with an average performance of 77.6 1 +/- 14.72%. The shared control strategy implemented (i.e., the exoskeleton could only move during specific periods of time) was effective in preventing unexpected movements during periods in which patients were asked to relax. On average, 55.22 +/- 16.69% and 40.45 +/- 16.98% of the trials (for healthy subjects and patients, respectively) would have suffered from unexpected activations (i.e., false positives) without the proposed control strategy. All the patients showed low exertion and fatigue levels during the performance of the experiments. This paper constitutes a proof-of-concept study to validate the feasibility of a BMI to control an ambulatory exoskeleton by patients with incomplete paraplegia (i.e., patients with good prognosis for gait rehabilitation).

Methods: Our meta-analysis included previous studies that used ketamine in order to induce psychotic experiences in healthy participants and that recorded the MMN either by electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography. Results: The analysis revealed systematic MMN amplitude decreases and, with a lower effect size, latency increases after ketamine administration. However, the observed amplitude and latency effects did not vary between duration and frequency deviants. Conclusion: Across studies, there is no evidence that ketamine effects on the MMN are larger for duration than frequency deviants. Significance: Our findings tentatively suggest that, in addition to an NMDA receptor hypofunction, other factors might contribute to the sometimes observed pattern of impaired MMN responses to duration deviants, but unimpaired MMN responses to frequency deviants in schizophrenia.

There is longstanding interest in using EEG measurements to inform transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) but adoption is lacking because users need a simple and adaptable recipe. The conventional approach is to use anatomical head-models for both source localization (the EEG inverse problem) and current flow modeling (the tES forward model), but this approach is computationally demanding, requires an anatomical MRI, and strict assumptions about the target brain regions. We evaluate techniques whereby tES dose is derived from EEG without the need for an anatomical head model, target assumptions, difficult case-by-case conjecture, or many stimulation electrodes. Approach. We developed a simple two-step approach to EEG-guided tES that based on the topography of the EEG: (1) selects locations to be used for stimulation; (2) determines current applied to each electrode. Each step is performed based solely on the EEG with no need for head models or source localization. Cortical dipoles represent idealized brain targets. EEG-guided tES strategies are verified using a finite element method simulation of the EEG generated by a dipole, oriented either tangential or radial to the scalp surface, and then simulating the tES-generated electric field produced by each model-free technique. These model-free approaches are compared to a 'gold standard' numerically optimized dose of tES that assumes perfect understanding of the dipole location and head anatomy. We vary the number of electrodes from a few to over three hundred, with focality or intensity as optimization criterion. Main results. Model-free approaches evaluated include (1) voltage-to-voltage, (2) voltage-to-current; (3) Laplacian; and two Ad-Hoc techniques (4) dipole sink-to-sink; and (5) sink to concentric. Our results demonstrate that simple ad hoc approaches can achieve reasonable targeting for the case of a cortical dipole, remarkably with only 2-8 electrodes and no need for a model of the head. Significance. Our approach is verified directly only for a theoretically localized source, but may be potentially applied to an arbitrary EEG topography. For its simplicity and linearity, our recipe for model-free EEG guided tES lends itself to broad adoption and can be applied to static (tDCS), time-variant (e.g., tACS, tRNS, tPCS), or closed-loop tES.

One process that has been suggested to be an important aspect of flexible task switching is the inhibition of a recently performed task. This is called backward inhibition. Several studies suggest that task switching performance can be enhanced by rewards. However, it is less clear in how far backward inhibition mechanisms are also affected by rewards, especially when it comes to the neuronal mechanisms underlying reward-related modulations of backward inhibition. We therefore investigated this using a system neurophysiological approach combining EEG recordings with source localization techniques. We demonstrate that rewards reduce the strength of backward inhibition processes. The neurophysiological data shows that these reward-related effects emerge from response and/or conflict monitoring processes within medial frontal cortical structures. Upstream processes of perceptual gating and attentional selection, as well as downstream processes of context updating and stimulus-response mapping are not modulated by reward, even though they also play a role in backward inhibition effects.

This study presents a direct comparison of a classical EEG cap setup with a new around-the-ear electrode array (cEEGrid) to gain a better understanding of the potential of ear-centered EEG. Approach. Concurrent EEG was recorded from a classical scalp EEG cap and two cEEGrids that were placed around the left and the right ear. Twenty participants performed a spatial auditory attention task in which three sound streams were presented simultaneously. The sound streams were three seconds long and differed in the direction of origin (front, left, right) and the number of beats (3, 4, 5 respectively), as well as the timbre and pitch. The participants had to attend to either the left or the right sound stream. Main results. We found clear attention modulated ERP effects reflecting the attended sound stream for both electrode setups, which agreed in morphology and effect size. A single-trial template matching classification showed that the direction of attention could be decoded significantly above chance (50%) for at least 16 out of 20 participants for both systems. The comparably high classification results of the single trial analysis underline the quality of the signal recorded with the cEEGrids. Significance. These findings are further evidence for the feasibility of around the-ear EEG recordings and demonstrate that well described ERPs can be measured. We conclude that concealed behind-the-ear EEG recordings can be an alternative to classical cap EEG acquisition for auditory attention monitoring.

Studying auditory verbal hallucinations using the RDoC framework	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						RDoC; Agency; Auditory verbal hallucinations; EEG; ERP; N1	COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTEX; SYMPTOMS; INITIATION; RESPONSES; TALKING; SOUNDS; BRAIN	In this paper, I explain why I adopted a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach to study the neurobiology of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), or voices. I explain that the RDoC construct of agency fits well with AVH phenomenology. To the extent that voices sound nonself, voice hearers lack a sense of agency over the voices. Using a vocalization paradigm like those used with nonhuman primates to study mechanisms subserving the sense of agency, we find that the auditory N1 ERP is suppressed during vocalization, that EEG synchrony preceding speech onset is related to N1 suppression, and that both are reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Reduced cortical suppression is also seen across multiple psychotic disorders and in clinically high-risk youth, but it is not related to AVH. The motor activity preceding talking and connectivity between frontal and temporal lobes during talking have both proved sensitive to AVH, suggesting neural activity and connectivity associated with intentions to act may be a better way to study agency and predictions based on agency.

We applied a novel analytic approach to analyze EEG activity from college-going students while they completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a well-established risk-taking propensity assessment. By modeling outcome-processing-related changes in the P200 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) sequentially within each BART trial as a function of pump order as an index of increasing risk, our results suggest that analyzing the BART in a progressive fashion may provide valuable new insights into the temporal neurophysiological dynamics of risk taking. Our results showed that a P200, localized to the left caudate nucleus, and an FRN, localized to the left dACC, were positively correlated with the level of risk taking and reward. Furthermore, consistent with our hypotheses, the rate of change in the FRN was higher among college students with greater self-reported resistance to peer influence.

Children, who are unable to perceive auditory phoneme discrimination, cannot develop phonemic representations. Therefore, the early identification of these deficits and application of effective therapeutic approaches is a necessity. We need to assess appropriately word or sound discrimination in normal populations using an objective passive task such as mismatch negativity (MMN). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate MMN responses using speech stimuli (words) in 6-7 year-old normal Persian-speaking children. Methods: Ten right-handed Persian-speaking children with normal visual and auditory acuity, aged from 6 to 7 years, participated in the study. Recording of electroencephalography (EEG) was done by 64 A g/AgCI electrodes. A new auditory paradigm was used with three deviant stimuli (/gam/, /jam/, and/tam/) which differed in the first consonant from a repeated standard word (/dam/). A total of 1500 stimuli, 750 standards and 750 deviants (250 each deviant), were presented by Cogent 2000 running in MATLAB software using two loud speakers. Results: MMN peaked over the fronto-central sites at around 380-424 ms after the onset of the stimulus. The comparison of the MMN amplitudes elicited by three deviants revealed a significant "initial phoneme type" effect in Fz and Cz (p < 0.05). This negativity was found to be larger for manner and voicing deviants compared with that of the place of articulation (p < 0.001) on midline scalps. The comparison of the MMN latencies revealed no significant main effect of all variables (p > 0.05). Also, the results revealed that only the MMN amplitude for the/gam/deviant correlated with the percentage of correct responses (R = -0.86, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The current study showed that words can elicit MMN responses in similar to 200 ms after the onset of changes. We can objectively evaluate children's neural speech sound discrimination using the developed paradigm in a natural word context. This paradigm can be useful objectively for investigating distinctive features of sounds and phonological discrimination development in normal children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the connectivity and correlations between different brain regions have not been well investigated. This paper mainly explores the functional brain network during auditory oddball task. The results show that there are more connections between EEG electrodes during target stimuli than non-target stimuli. In addition, the brain network has significant difference in the left and right channel selective attention tasks. Additionally, the contralateral electrodes play crucial rule in selective attention for the right or left ear.

These responses are heritable traits, and potential endophenotypes for clinical phenotypes. These stimuli also cause responses in oscillatory activity, both evoked responses phase-locked to stimulus presentation and phase-independent induced responses. Here, we investigate whether phase-locked and phase-independent oscillatory responses are heritable traits. Oscillatory responses were examined in EEG recordings from 213 twin pairs (91 monozygotic and 122 dizygotic twins) performing a visual oddball task. After group Independent Component Analysis (group-ICA) and time-frequency decomposition, individual differences in evoked and induced oscillatory responses were compared between MZ and DZ twin pairs. Induced (phase-independent) oscillatory responses consistently showed the highest heritability (24-55%) compared to evoked (phase-locked) oscillatory responses and spectral energy, which revealed lower heritability at 1-35.6% and 4.5-32.3%, respectively. Since the phase-independent induced response encodes functional aspects of the brain response to target stimuli different from evoked responses, we conclude that the modulation of ongoing oscillatory activity may serve as an additional endophenotype for behavioral phenotypes and psychiatric genetics.

They consist of brief discrete deflections embedded in background electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) activity, which often has larger amplitude. Background EEG cancelation is a major part of VEPs analysis algorithms often realized by coherent averaging or other methods requiring large minimal amount of registered sweeps. In some cases, especially for pediatric patients, or in poor patient compliance cases, long procedure duration and fatigue might cause impaired attention and non-steady target fixation, affecting the quality of recorded VEPs. The possibility to reconstruct VEPs in every single sweep from limited size ensembles opens new diagnostic possibilities and shortens the registration procedure improving its quality. A proposed method is based on truncated expansion (Karhunen-Loeve transform) of VEP signals applying generalized universal basis functions (eigenvectors of covariation matrix) calculated from learning set of sweeps, i.e. an ensemble of collected typical recordings. It realizes the possibility to reconstruct a signal from every single sweep even in limited size ensembles of registered sweeps. Application of adaptively time-shifted basis functions enables optimal reconstruction of the signal with latency shift or jitter.

Several approaches; including ERP, time-frequency analysis and, more recently, regression and stimulus reconstruction approaches; have been suggested for solving this problem. In this work, we study the problem of correlating of EEG signals to different sets of sound sources with the goal of identifying the single source to which the listener is attending. Here, we propose a method for finding the number of parameters needed in a regression model to avoid overlearning, which is necessary for determining the attended sound source with high confidence in order to solve the cocktail party problem.

Recent studies have reported that trace conditioning can occur in humans in reduced levels of consciousness by showing a transfer of the unconditioned autonomic response to the CS+ in healthy sleeping individuals and in vegetative state patients. However, no previous studies have investigated the neural underpinning of trace conditioning in the absence of consciousness in humans. In the present study, we recorded the EEG activity of 29 post-anoxic comatose patients while presenting a trace conditioning paradigm using neutral tones as CS+ and alerting sounds as UCS. Most patients received therapeutic hypothermia and all were deeply unconscious according to standardized clinical scales. After repeated presentation of the CS+ and UCS couple, learning was assessed by measuring the EEG activity during the period where the UCS is omitted after CS+ presentation. Specifically we assessed the 'reactivation' of the neural response to UCS omission by applying a decoding algorithm derived from the statistical model of the EEG activity in response to the UCS presentation. The same procedure was used in a group of 12 awake healthy controls. We found a reactivation of the UCS response in absence of stimulation in eight patients (five under therapeutic hypothermia) and four healthy controls. Additionally, the reactivation effect was temporally specific within trials since it manifested primarily at the specific latency of UCS presentation and significantly less before or after this period. Our results show for the first time that trace conditioning may manifest as a reactivation of the EEG activity related to the UCS and even in the absence of consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The evidence has shown that visually guided motor imagery (MI) can modulate sensorimotor electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans, but how to design and implement efficient visual guidance during MI in order to produce better event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns is still unclear. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of using object-oriented movements in a virtual environment as visual guidance on the modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms generated by hand MI. To improve the classification accuracy on MI, we further propose an algorithm to automatically extract subject-specific optimal frequency and time bands for the discrimination of ERD patterns produced by left and right hand MI. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of object-directed scenarios is much better than that of non-object-directed scenarios (76.87% vs. 69.66%). The result of the t-test measuring the difference between them is statistically significant (p = 0.0207). When compared to algorithms based on fixed frequency and time bands, contralateral dominant ERD patterns can be enhanced by using the subject-specific optimal frequency and the time bands obtained by our proposed algorithm. These findings have the potential to improve the efficacy and robustness of MI-based BCI applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neuroimaging research has shown that somatosensory mechanisms are activated when adults observe another person or object being touched. In this study, we measured event-related potentials from 4- to 5-year-old children to investigate the development of the neural correlates of the observation of human and object touch. Participants were presented with video clips of an arm or a cylindrical object being touched. Touch versus non-touch effects were observed in the amplitudes of the LSW component (600-700ms) measured from electrodes over somatosensory region. Additionally, human versus non-human stimulus effects were reflected in the amplitudes of the parietal-central N100 component, as well as in the latencies of the N170 component recorded from parietal-occipital electrodes in children, as in adults in a previous study using this same paradigm. These findings provide evidence that relatively mature tactile mirroring mechanisms are activated during the observation of touch in children, and further suggest the possibility that these mechanisms are not particularly slow in their development relative to other aspects of social cognition.

However, it is largely unclear how dysfunctions on these various levels of cortical processing contribute to alterations of stimulus-specific information representation. To test this, we used a well-established sequential frequency comparison paradigm, in which sensory encoding of vibrotactile stimuli can be assessed via frequency-specific steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) over primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Further, we investigated the maintenance of frequency information in working memory (WM) in terms of parametric power modulations of induced beta-band EEG oscillations. In the present study schizophrenic patients showed significantly less pronounced SSEPs during vibrotactile stimulation than healthy controls. In particular, inter-trial phase coherence was reduced. While maintaining vibrotactile frequencies in WM, patients showed a significantly weaker prefrontal beta-power modulation compared to healthy controls. Crucially, patients exhibited no general disturbances in attention, as inferred from a behavioral test and from alpha-band event-related synchronization. Together, our results provide novel evidence that patients with schizophrenia show altered neural correlates of stimulus-specific sensory encoding and WM maintenance, suggesting an early somatosensory impairment as well as alterations in the formation of abstract representations of task-relevant stimulus information.

Altogether, 15 of 22 patients could control the BCI system with an accuracy significantly above the chance level. The bit-rate of the traditional assistive technology proved superior, even though an equivalent bit-rate could be achieved using personalized parameters for the BCI. Fatigue was found to be the primary limitation factor, which was particularly true for patients and during the use of the BCI. A classifier based on Riemannian geometry was found to contribute significantly to the accuracy of the BCI system. This study demonstrates that the communication of patients with severe motor impairments can be effectively restored using an adequately designed BCI system.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been frequently used in rehabilitation therapy to improve neural recovery such as stroke and spinal cord injury. Stimulus, acting on sensorimotor neural system components, resulted in the increased cortical excitability which accompanied with motor performance improvement. Stimulus information conveyed by sensory system included below four elementary attributes: modality, location, intensity, and timing. But, few works has been reported about effect of the stimulation intensity change speed (SICS). In this paper, we studied the effects of SICS by event-related desynchronization (ERD) or event-related synchronization (ERS) and EEG source analysis by exact low resolution brain electric tomography (eLORETA). The results suggested that brain function areas were sensitive to SICS. Using fast SICS could evoked more significant cortical excitability than the slow one. We demonstrated the availability of an efficient NMES method, additionally implied the rehabilitation potential of cortical excitability enhancement in sensorimotor cortex for motor dysfunction.

LDAs popularity derives from its simplicity and its competitive classification performance, which has been reported for various types of neuroimaging data. Yet the standard LDA approach proves less than optimal for binary classification problems when additional label information (i.e. subclass labels) is present. Subclass labels allow to model structure in the data, which can be used to facilitate the classification task. In this paper, we illustrate how neuroimaging data exhibit subclass labels that may contain valuable information. We also show that the standard LDA classifier is unable to exploit subclass labels. We introduce a novel method that allows subclass labels to be incorporated efficiently into the classifier. The novel method, which we call Relevance Subclass LDA (RSLDA), computes an individual classification hyperplane for each subclass. It is based on regularized estimators of the subclass mean and uses other subclasses as regularization targets. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of our method on data drawn from two different neuroimaging modalities: (I) EEG data from brain-computer interfacing with event-related potentials, and (II) fMRI data in response to different levels of visual motion. We show that RSLDA outperforms the standard LDA approach for both types of datasets. These findings illustrate the benefits of exploiting subclass structure in neuroimaging data. Finally, we show that our classifier also outputs regularization profiles, enabling researchers to interpret the subclass structure in a meaningful way. RSLDA therefore yields increased classification accuracy as well as a better interpretation of neuroimaging data. Since both results are highly favorable, we suggest to apply RSLDA for various classification problems within neuroimaging and beyond. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, knowledge on the neurophysiology and functional neuroanatomy on response inhibition is biased because studies usually employ experimental paradigms (e.g., sustained attention to response task, SART) in which behavior is susceptible to impulsive errors. Here, we investigate whether there are differences in neurophysiological mechanisms and networks depending on the response mode that predominates behavior in a response inhibition task. We do so comparing a SART with a traditionally formatted task paradigm. We use EEG-beamforming in two tasks inducing opposite response modes during action selection. We focus on theta frequency modulations, since these are implicated in cognitive control processes. The results show that a response mode that is susceptible to impulsive errors (response mode used in the SART) is associated with stronger theta band activity in the left temporo-parietal junction. The results suggest that the response modes applied during response inhibition differ in the encoding of surprise signals, or related processes of attentional sampling. Response modes during response inhibition seem to differ in processes necessary to update task representations relevant to behavioral control.

Sources: Comprehensive, non-systematic review of the literature on studies about individual differences in facial emotion processing by newborns and infants over the first year of life. Summary of the findings: Maternal stress related to depression and anxiety has been associated to atypical emotional processing and attentional behaviors in the offspring. Recent neurophysiological studies using electroencephalogram and event-related potentials have begun to shed light on the possible mechanisms underlying such behaviors. Conclusions: Infants of depressed and/or anxious mothers have increased risk for several adverse outcomes across the lifespan. Further neurobehavioral investigations and the promotion of clinical and developmental research integration might eventually contribute to refining screening tools, improving treatment, and enabling primary prevention interventions for children at risk.

J	Abou Zeid, E; Sereshkeh, AR; Chau, T				Abou Zeid, Elias; Sereshkeh, Alborz Rezazadeh; Chau, Tom			A pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering for predicting the laterality of self-initiated fine movements from single trial readiness potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						spatio-temporal filtering; laterality; fine movement; self-initiated; single trial; readiness potential	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI COMPETITION 2003; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; HAND	Objective. In recent years, the readiness potential (RP), a type of pre-movement neural activity, has been investigated for asynchronous electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Since the RP is attenuated for involuntary movements, a BCI driven by RP alone could facilitate intentional control amid a plethora of unintentional movements. Previous studies have attempted single trial classification of RP via spatial and temporal filtering methods, or by combining the RP with event-related desynchronization. However, RP feature extraction remains challenging due to the slow non-oscillatory nature of the potential, its variability among participants and the inherent noise in EEG signals. Here, we propose a participant-specific, individually optimized pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering (PSTF) to improve RP feature extraction for laterality prediction. Approach. PSTF applies band-pass filtering on RP signals, followed by Fisher criterion spatial filtering to maximize class separation, and finally temporal window averaging for feature dimension reduction. Optimal parameters are simultaneously found by cross-validation for each participant. Using EEG data from 14 participants performing self-initiated left or right key presses as well as two benchmark BCI datasets, we compared the performance of PSTF to two popular methods: common spatial subspace decomposition, and adaptive spatio-temporal filtering. Main results. On the BCI benchmark data sets, PSTF performed comparably to both existing methods. With the key press EEG data, PSTF extracted more discriminative features, thereby leading to more accurate (74.99% average accuracy) predictions of RP laterality than that achievable with existing methods. Significance. Naturalistic and volitional interaction with the world is an important capacity that is lost with traditional system-paced BCIs. We demonstrated a significant improvement in fine movement laterality prediction from RP features alone. Our work supports further study of RP-based BCI for intuitive asynchronous control of the environment, such as augmentative communication or wheelchair navigation.

The corresponding EEG inverse problem is an ill-posed one that has infinitely many solutions. This is due to the fact that the number of EEG sensors is usually much smaller than that of the potential dipole locations, as well as noise contamination in the recorded signals. To obtain a unique solution, regularizations can be incorporated to impose additional constraints on the solution. An appropriate choice of regularization is critically important for the reconstruction accuracy of a brain image. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparsity and SMOOthness enhanced brain TomograpHy (s-SMOOTH) method to improve the reconstruction accuracy by integrating two recently proposed regularization techniques: Total Generalized Variation (TGV) regularization and l(1-2) regularization. TGV is able to preserve the source edge and recover the spatial distribution of the source intensity with high accuracy. Compared to the relevant total variation (TV) regularization, TGV enhances the smoothness of the image and reduces staircasing artifacts. The traditional TGV defined on a 2D image has been widely used in the image processing field. In order to handle 3D EEG source images, we propose a voxel-based Total Generalized Variation (vTGV) regularization that extends the definition of second-order TGV from 2D planar images to 3D irregular surfaces such as cortex surface. In addition, the l(1-2) regularization is utilized to promote sparsity on the current density itself. We demonstrate that l(1-2) regularization is able to enhance sparsity and accelerate computations than l(1) regularization. The proposed model is solved by an efficient and robust algorithm based on the difference of convex functions algorithm (DCA) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical experiments using synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of total reconstruction accuracy, localization accuracy and focalization degree. The application to the source localization of event-related potential data further demonstrates the performance of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

However, the majority of this work has focused on specific temporal landmarks, such as N170 and N250 components, derived through univariate analyses of EEG data. Here, we take on a broader evaluation of ERP signals related to individual face recognition as we attempt to move beyond the leading theoretical and methodological framework through the application of pattern analysis to ERP data. Specifically, we investigate the spatiotemporal profile of identity recognition across variation in emotional expression. To this end, we apply pattern classification to ERP signals both in time, for any single electrode, and in space, across multiple electrodes. Our results confirm the significance of traditional ERP components in face processing. At the same time though, they support the idea that the temporal profile of face recognition is incompletely described by such components. First, we show that signals associated with different facial identities can be discriminated from each other outside the scope of these components, as early as 70 ms following stimulus presentation. Next, electrodes associated with traditional ERP components as well as, critically, those not associated with such components are shown to contribute information to stimulus discriminability. And last, the levels of ERP-based pattern discrimination are found to correlate with recognition accuracy across subjects confirming the relevance of these methods for bridging brain and behavior data. Altogether, the current results shed new light on the fine-grained time course of neural face processing and showcase the value of novel methods for pattern analysis to investigating fundamental aspects of visual recognition.

EEG source reconstruction was performed with exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA). We investigated FC between 84 Brodmann areas using lagged phase synchronization (LPS) in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). We further computed the network degree, clustering coefficient and efficiency. Compared to controls, patients displayed higher theta and alpha to and lower beta LPS values. In these frequency bands, patients were also characterized by less well ordered brain networks exhibiting higher global degrees and efficiencies and lower clustering coefficients. In the band, patients exhibited reduced functional segregation and integration due to loss of both local and long-distance functional connections. These findings suggest that benign epileptic brain networks might be functionally disrupted due to their altered functional organization especially in the alpha and beta frequency bands.

It may be possible to avoid these limitations by using electroencephalography. The present study explored this possibility using the N400. Method: Eleven adults with typical hearing heard highconstraint sentences with congruent and incongruent terminal words in the presence of speech-shaped noise. Participants ignored all auditory stimulation and watched a video. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was varied around each participant's behavioral threshold during electroencephalography recording. Speech was also heard in quiet. Results: The amplitude of the N400 effect exhibited a nonlinear relationship with SNR. In the presence of background noise, amplitude decreased from high (+ 4 dB) to low (+ 1 dB) SNR but increased dramatically at threshold before decreasing again at subthreshold SNR (-2 dB). Conclusions: The SNR of speech in noise modulates the amplitude of the N400 effect to semantic anomalies in a nonlinear fashion. These results are the first to demonstrate modulation of the passively evoked N400 by SNR in speech-shaped noise and represent a first step toward the end goal of developing an N400-based physiological metric for speech-in-noise testing.

In these individuals, sensory processing differs between their two ears, while cognitive abilities are the same irrespectively of the sensory input. To better understand perceptualcognitive factors modulating speech intelligibility with a CI, this electroencephalography study examined the centralauditory processing of words, the cognitive abilities, and the speech intelligibility in 10 postlingually single-sided deaf CI users. We found lower hit rates and prolonged response times for word classification during an oddball task for the CI ear when compared with the NH ear. Also, event-related potentials reflecting sensory (N1) and higher-order processing (N2/N4) were prolonged for word classification (targets versus nontargets) with the CI ear compared with the NH ear. Our results suggest that speech processing via the CI ear and the NH ear differs both at sensory (N1) and cognitive (N2/N4) processing stages, thereby affecting the behavioral performance for speech discrimination. These results provide objective evidence for cognition to be a key factor for speech perception under adverse listening conditions, such as the degraded speech signal provided from the CI.

Testing the Limits of Skill Transfer for Scrabble Experts in Behavior and Brain	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Scrabble; expertise; far transfer; fMRI; ERP	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; TERM WORKING-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; COMPETITIVE SCRABBLE; NEUROIMAGING DATA; NEURAL BASIS; ABILITIES; TASK	We investigated transfer of the skills developed by competitive Scrabble players. Previous studies reported superior performance for Scrabble experts on the lexical decision task (LDT), suggesting near transfer of Scrabble skills. Here we investigated the potential for far transfer to a symbol decision task (SDT); in particular, transfer of enhanced long-term working memory for vertically presented stimuli. Our behavioral results showed no evidence for far transfer. Despite years of intensive practice, Scrabble experts were no faster and no more accurate than controls in the SDT. However, our fMRI and EEG data from the SDT suggest that the neural repertoire that Scrabble experts develop supports task performance even outside of the practiced domain, in a non-linguistic context. The regions engaged during the SDT were different across groups: controls engaged temporal-frontal regions, whereas Scrabble experts engaged posterior visual and temporal-parietal regions. In Scrabble experts, activity related to Scrabble skill (anagramming scores) included regions associated with visual-spatial processing and long-term working memory, and overlapped with regions previously shown to be associated with Scrabble expertise in the near transfer task (LDT). Analysis of source waveforms within these regions showed that participants with higher anagramming scores had larger P300 amplitudes, potentially reflecting greater working memory capacity, or less variability in the participants who performed the task more efficiently. Thus, the neuroimaging results provide evidence of brain transfer in the absence of behavioral transfer, providing new clues about the consequences of long-term training associated with competitive Scrabble expertise.

Patients with schizophrenia (ScZ) often experience a loss of coherent perception and hence, they might also show dysfunctional multisensory processing. In this high-density electroencephalography study, we investigated the neural signatures of the McGurk illusion, as a phenomenon of speech-specific multisensory processing. In the McGurk illusion lip movements are paired with incongruent auditory syllables, which can induce a fused percept. In ScZ patients and healthy controls we compared neural oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) to congruent audiovisual speech stimuli and McGurk illusion trials, where a visual /ga/ and an auditory /pa/ was often perceived as /ka/. There were no significant group differences in illusion rates. The EEG data analysis revealed larger short latency ERPs to McGurk illusion compared with congruent trials in controls. The reversed effect pattern was found in ScZ patients, indicating an early audiovisual processing deficit. Moreover, we observed stronger suppression of medio-central alpha-band power (810 Hz, 550-700 ms) in response to McGurk illusion compared with control trials in the control group. Again, the reversed pattern was found in SCZ patients. Moreover, within groups, alpha-band suppression was negatively correlated with the McGurk illusion rate in ScZ patients, while the correlation tended to be positive in controls. The topography of alpha-band effects indicated an involvement of auditory and/or frontal structures. Our study suggests that short latency ERPs and long latency alpha-band oscillations reflect abnormal multisensory processing of the McGurk illusion in ScZ.

Conversely, neural responses to a predicted event are typically reduced relative to those from an unpredicted one (prediction suppression). What remains to be established is what happens with attended and predicted events. To examine the interaction between attention and prediction, we combined two robust paradigms developed for studying attention and prediction effects on ERPs into an orthogonal design. Participants were presented with sounds in attended or unattended intervals with onsets that were either predicted by a moving visual cue or unpredicted (no cue was provided). We demonstrated an N1 enhancement effect for attended sounds and an N1 suppression effect for predicted sounds; furthermore, an interaction between these effects was found that emerged early in the N1 (50-95 msec), indicating that attention enhancement only occurred when the sound was unpredicted. This pattern of results can be explained by the precision of the predictive cue that reduces the need for attention selection in the attended and predicted condition.

See vol.10,pg.515,2016)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Retracted Publication						face; mortality; intuition; EEG; reading	FACES; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; TOOLBOX; HEALTH; AGE	Recent studies have shown that characteristics of the face contain a wealth of information about health, age and chronic clinical conditions. Such studies involve objective measurement of facial features correlated with historical health information. But some individuals also claim to be adept at gauging mortality based on a glance at a person's photograph. To test this claim, we invited 12 such individuals to see if they could determine if a person was alive or dead based solely on a brief examination of facial photographs. All photos used in the experiment were transformed into a uniform gray scale and then counterbalanced across eight categories: gender, age, gaze direction, glasses, head position, smile, hair color, and image resolution. Participants examined 404 photographs displayed on a computer monitor, one photo at a time, each shown for a maximum of 8 s. Half of the individuals in the photos were deceased, and half were alive at the time the experiment was conducted. Participants were asked to press a button if they thought the person in a photo was living or deceased. Overall mean accuracy on this task was 53.8%, where 50% was expected by chance (p < 0.004, two-tail). Statistically significant accuracy was independently obtained in 5 of the 12 participants. We also collected 32-channel electrophysiological recordings and observed a robust difference between images of deceased individuals correctly vs. incorrectly classified in the early event related potential (ERP) at 100 ms post-stimulus onset. Our results support claims of individuals who report that some as-yet unknown features of the face predict mortality. The results are also compatible with claims about clairvoyance warrants further investigation.

The Guilty Knowledge Test is used to determine if certain information is stored in the brain by detecting the P300 wave. In this paper, an improved Guilty Knowledge Test has been conducted on 14 subjects. Although a variety of feature extraction and classification algorithms for detecting the P300 have been used thus far, this paper introduces the use of deep learning techniques for the Guilty Knowledge Test. Two deep learning techniques; Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Autoencoders, have been compared. The input to these classifiers was the filtered EEG signal without any feature extraction.

Intentional actions are essential to reach individual goals. In previous empirical studies, internally guided actions were predominantly related to functional responses in frontal and parietal areas. The aim of the present study was to distinguish event-related potentials and oscillatory responses of intentional actions and externally guided actions. In addition, we compared neurobiological findings of the decision which action to perform with those referring to the decision whether or not to perform an action. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects participated in adapted go/nogo paradigms, including a voluntary selection condition allowing participants to (1) freely decide whether to press the response button or (2) to decide whether they wanted to press the response button with the right index finger or the left index finger. Results: The reaction times were increased when participants freely decided whether and how they wanted to respond compared to the go condition. Intentional processes were associated with a fronto-centrally located N2 and P3 potential. N2 and P3 amplitudes were increased during intentional actions compared to instructed responses (go). In addition, increased activity in the alpha-, beta- and gamma-frequency range was shown during voluntary behavior rather than during externally guided responses. Conclusion: These results may indicate that an additional cognitive process is needed for intentional actions compared to instructed behavior. However, the neural responses were comparatively independent of the kind of decision that was made (1) decision which action to perform; (2) decision whether or not to perform an action). Significance: The study demonstrates the importance of fronto-central alpha-, beta-, and gamma oscillations for voluntary behavior.

The identification of learning styles using subjective evidence from VARK questionnaires (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is read/write, and K is kinesthetic) combined with objective evidence from visual event-related potential (vERP) studies has never been investigated. It is questionable whether picture superiority effects exist in V learners and R learners. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether vERP could show the relationship between vERP components and VARK learning styles and to identify the existence of picture superiority effects in V learners and R learners. Thirty medical students (15 V learners and 15 R learners) performed recognition tasks with vERP and an intermediate-term memory (ITM) test. The results of within-group comparisons showed that pictures elicited larger P200 amplitudes than words at the occipital 2 site (P < 0.05) in V learners and at the occipital 1 and 2 sites (P < 0.05) in R learners. The between-groups comparison showed that P200 amplitudes elicited by pictures in V learners were larger than those of R learners at the parietal 4 site (P < 0.05). The ITM test result showed that a picture set showed distinctively more correct responses than that of a word set for both V learners (P < 0.001) and R learners (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the result indicated that the P200 amplitude at the parietal 4 site could be used to objectively distinguish V learners from R learners. A lateralization existed to the right brain (occipital 2 site) in V learners. The ITM test demonstrated the existence of picture superiority effects in both learners. The results revealed the first objective electrophysiological evidence partially supporting the validity of the subjective psychological VARK questionnaire study.

Behavioral evidence suggests, however, that some scene information is extracted even when attention is directed elsewhere. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of this ability by examining how attention affects electrophysiological markers of scene perception. In two electro-encephalography (EEG) experiments, human subjects categorized real-world scenes as manmade or natural (full attention condition) or performed tasks on unrelated stimuli in the center or periphery of the scenes (reduced attention conditions). Scene processing was examined in two ways: traditional trial averaging was used to assess the presence of a categorical manmade/natural distinction in event-related potentials, whereas single-trial analyses assessed whether EEG activity was modulated by scene statistics that are diagnostic of naturalness of individual scenes. The results indicated that evoked activity up to 250 ms was unaffected by reduced attention, showing intact categorical differences between manmade and natural scenes and strong modulations of single-trial activity by scene statistics in all conditions. Thus initial processing of both categorical and individual scene information remained intact with reduced attention. Importantly, however, attention did have profound effects on later evoked activity; full attention on the scene resulted in prolonged manmade/natural differences, increased neural sensitivity to scene statistics, and enhanced scene memory. These results show that initial processing of real-world scene information is intact with diminished attention but that the depth of processing of this information does depend on attention.

One-year-old fear memories rapidly activate human fusiform gyrus	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fear conditioning; extinction; microstate; face processing	BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ANXIETY DISORDERS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EXTINCTION; FACES; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; STIMULI; NEUROSCIENCE; MODULATION	Fast threat detection is crucial for survival. In line with such evolutionary pressure, threat-signaling fear-conditioned faces have been found to rapidly (<80 ms) activate visual brain regions including the fusiform gyrus on the conditioning day. Whether remotely fear conditioned stimuli (CS) evoke similar early processing enhancements is unknown. Here, 16 participants who underwent a differential face fear-conditioning and extinction procedure on day 1 were presented the initial CS 24 h after conditioning (Recent Recall Test) as well as 9-17 months later (Remote Recall Test) while EEG was recorded. Using a data-driven segmentation procedure of CS evoked event-related potentials, five distinct microstates were identified for both the recent and the remote memory test. To probe intracranial activity, EEG activity within each microstate was localized using low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA). In both the recent (41-55 and 150-191 ms) and remote (45-90 ms) recall tests, fear conditioned faces potentiated rapid activation in proximity of fusiform gyrus, even in participants unaware of the contingencies. These findings suggest that rapid processing enhancements of conditioned faces persist over time.

Failures in predicting events might contribute to hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia (SZ). When a stimulus violates prediction, neural activity that reflects prediction error (PE) processing is found. While PE processing deficits have been reported in unisensory paradigms, it is unknown whether SZ patients (SZP) show altered crossmodal PE processing. We measured high-density electroencephalography and applied source estimation approaches to investigate crossmodal PE processing generated by audiovisual speech. In SZP and healthy control participants (HC), we used an established paradigm in which high- and low-predictive visual syllables were paired with congruent or incongruent auditory syllables. We examined crossmodal PE processing in SZP and HC by comparing differences in event-related potentials and neural oscillations between incongruent and congruent high-and low-predictive audiovisual syllables. In both groups event-related potentials between 206 and 250 ms were larger in high-compared with low-predictive syllables, suggesting intact audiovisual incongruence detection in the auditory cortex of SZP. The analysis of oscillatory responses revealed theta-band (4-7 Hz) power enhancement in high-compared with low-predictive syllables between 230 and 370 ms in the frontal cortex of HC but not SZP. Thus aberrant frontal theta-band oscillations reflect crossmodal PE processing deficits in SZ. The present study suggests a top-down multisensory processing deficit and highlights the role of dysfunctional frontal oscillations for the SZ psychopathology.

Modification of Brain Oscillations via Rhythmic Light Stimulation Provides Evidence for Entrainment but Not for Superposition of Event-Related Responses	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; visual flicker; individual alpha frequency; Arnold tongue; intermittency; parietal cortex; steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP); superposition	EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MECHANISM; TRANSIENT; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	The functional relevance of brain oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) has been repeatedly investigated through the use of rhythmic visual stimulation. The underlying mechanism of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) measured in EEG during rhythmic stimulation, however, is not known. There are two hypotheses on the origin of SSVEPs: entrainment of brain oscillations and superposition of event related responses (ERPs). The entrainment but not the superposition hypothesis justifies rhythmic visual stimulation as a means to manipulate brain oscillations, because superposition assumes a linear summation of single responses, independent from ongoing brain oscillations. Here, we stimulated participants with a rhythmic flickering light of different frequencies and intensities. We measured entrainment by comparing the phase coupling of brain oscillations stimulated by rhythmic visual flicker with the oscillations induced by arrhythmic jittered stimulation, varying the time, stimulation frequency, and intensity conditions. In line with a theoretical concept of entrainment (the so called Arnold tongue), we found the phase coupling to be more pronounced with increasing stimulation intensity as well as at stimulation frequencies closer to each participant's intrinsic frequency. Only inside the Arnold tongue did the conditions significantly differ from the jittered stimulation. Furthermore, even in a single sequence of an SSVEP, we found non-linear features (intermittency of phase locking) that contradict the linear summation of single responses, as assumed by the superposition hypothesis. Our findings provide unequivocal evidence that visual rhythmic stimulation entrains brain oscillations, thus validating the approach of rhythmic stimulation as a manipulation of brain oscillations.

Alterations in High-Frequency Neuronal Oscillations in a Cynomolgus Macaque Test of Sustained Attention Following NMDA Receptor Antagonism	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; KETAMINE; SYNCHRONIZATION	A growing body of evidence indicates that neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) are disturbed in schizophrenic patients during cognitive processes and may represent an endophenotype of the disease. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been used experimentally to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms including cognitive deficits in animals and humans. Here we characterized neuronal oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) in Cynomolgus macaques fully trained to perform a continuous performance test (CPT) in the presence and absence of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Macaques (n = 8) were trained to touch 'target' stimuli and ignore 'distractor' stimuli presented randomly on a touchscreen. Subsequently, all subjects were implanted with epidural EEG electrodes over frontal (FC) and parietal cortices (PC) and later tested under vehicle (saline, i.m.) or acute PCP (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) conditions. Compared with vehicle treatment, PCP produced a significant dose-dependent decrease in CPT performance accuracy and increased reaction times. Furthermore, PCP elevated the amplitudes of 'low' (30-50 Hz) and 'high' (51-80 Hz) gamma oscillations in FC and PC around target presentations for all correct responses. The CPT accuracy was inversely correlated with the gamma band amplitude in the presence of PCP. Additionally, PCP delayed the N100 peak latency in FC, and prolonged and suppressed the cognitively relevant P300 component of mean ERPs in FC and PC, respectively. The NMDA receptor antagonist-induced alteration in neuronal oscillations and ERPs may contribute to the observed cognitive deficits in macaques, and enhance our understanding of EEG recordings as a translatable biomarker.

Neuroimaging methods can provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms of decision making, which enhance the ability of enterprises to effectively design their products. Hence event related potentials (ERPs) were applied to explore the brain activity evoked by variety of product forms when users made preference among them. Smartphone product forms were displayed with equiprobability randomly. Participants were asked to click the left mouse button when they preferred one product form, else the right button for nonpreferred. The brain signals of each participant were recorded by Curry 7.0. Finally, brain signals were processed by using Curry 7.0 SBA and SPSS 18.0 software. The results showed that preferred product forms evoked enhanced N2, P2 and P3. Moreover, there were significant correlation between ERPs and behavioural data, participants devoted more attention and had faster responding time to preferred products than to nonpreferred. These results indicate that the differences of ERPs can be used to evaluate user preference. Relevance to industry: The integration of customer preferences is nowadays a challenge in new product development. Hence a thorough research on the inherent mechanism of preference formation can provide an accurate measurement method of user's perception. The differences of brain signals evoked by product forms can also provide technical support for product designers, which in turn can meet with user experience. Moreover, the results can be taken as evaluating indicators of product design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this manuscript, we show how a method for integrating three data modalities within a single framework provides (1) more detailed descriptions of cognitive processes and (2) more accurate predictions of unobserved data than less integrative methods. Specifically, we show how combining either EEG and fMRI with a behavioral model can perform substantially better than a behavioral-data-only model in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. We then show how a trivariate model - a model including EEG, fMRI, and behavioral data - outperforms bivariate models in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. Together, these results suggest that within an appropriate modeling framework, more data can be used to better constrain cognitive theory, and to generate more accurate predictions for behavioral and neural data.

The research of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of different frequencies on its functioning have been carried out for years. This paper presents the results of the scientific literature review on the EMF influence on the functioning of the human nervous system with a particular emphasis on the recent studies of the modern wireless communication and data transmission systems. In the majority of the analyzed areas the published research results do not show EMF effects on the nervous system, except for the influence of GSM telephony signal on resting EEG and EEG during patients' sleep and the influence of radiofrequency EMF on the cardiovascular regulation. In other analyzed areas (EMF impact on sleep, the evoked potentials and cognitive processes), there are no consistent results supporting any influence of electromagnetic fields. Neurophysiological studies of the effect of radio- and microwaves on the brain functions in humans are still considered inconclusive. This is among others due to, different exposure conditions, a large number of variables tested, deficiencies in repeatability of research and statistical uncertainties. However, methodological guidelines are already available giving a chance of unifying research that definitely needs to be continued in order to identify biophysical mechanisms of interaction between EMFs and the nervous system. One of the EMF research aspects, on which more and more attention is paid, are inter-individual differences.

A normal control group (n = 14) was also examined. Two EEG examinations were achieved in each group: before and after first-time CPAP therapy. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was implemented towards localizing the generators of EEG activity in separate frequency bands. Prior to CPAP treatment, as a common direction of change, analysis with LORETA demonstrated increased activity in comparison with the patient and control groups. In the moderate group, significant changes were detected in the alpha2 band in the posterior cingulate cortex as well as in the beta1 band in the right posterior parietal cortex and the left supramarginal gyrus. In the severe group, significant changes were found in theta and alpha1 bands in the posterior cingulate cortex. Following CPAP treatment, these significant differences vanished in the severe group. In the moderate group, significantly decreased activity was seen in the beta3 band in the right fusiform gyrus. These findings potentially suggest a normalizing effect of CPAP therapy on EEG background activity in both groups of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients. Compensatory alterations of brain electrical activity in regions associated with influencing successful memory retrieval, emotional perception, default mode network, anorexia and fear network caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia could possibly be reversed with the use of CPAP therapy.

The goal of this paper was to investigate whether determiner selection follows serially after lexical selection, or whether there is cascading. If there is cascading, the additional goal was to determine whether the selection of the correct determiner involves a competitive process. A go-nogo picture-word interference task was therefore performed in which gender congruency and categorical relation between distractor and target was manipulated and EEG was recorded. The ERP analysis showed that categorical relatedness helped determiner selection on gender congruent trials, but hindered on incongruent trials. This indicates that lexical selection and determiner selection overlap in time, and suggest that determiner selection is a competitive process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A behavioral and neurophysiological investigation into the principles behind the classification of visual emotional stimuli	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; Semantic content; Categorization; Intracerebral EEG; Cluster analysis	AFFECTIVE-PICTURE-SYSTEM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; PRELIMINARY VALIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; APPRAISAL PROCESSES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; NEURAL RESPONSE; IAPS PICTURES; HUMAN BRAIN	Two experiments were performed to investigate the principles by which emotional stimuli are classified on the dimensions of valence and arousal. In Experiment 1, a large sample of healthy participants rated emotional stimuli according to both broad dimensions. Hierarchical cluster analyses performed on these ratings revealed that stimuli were clustered according to their semantic content at the beginning of the agglomerative process. Example semantic themes include food, violence, nudes, death, and objects. Importantly, this pattern occurred in a parallel fashion for ratings on both dimensions. In Experiment 2, we investigated if the same semantic clusters were differentiated at the neurophysiological level. Intracerebral EEG was recorded from 18 patients with intractable epilepsy who viewed the same set of stimuli. Not only did electrocortical responses differentiate between these data-defined semantic clusters, they converged with the behavioral measurements to highlight the importance of categories associated with survival and reproduction. These findings provide strong evidence that the semantic content of affective material influences their classification along the broad dimensions of valence and arousal, and this principle of categorization exerts an effect on the evoked emotional response. Future studies should consider data-driven techniques rather than normative ratings to identify more specific, semantically related emotional images.

A fronto-striatal network is involved in these processes. Between-subject differences in the intra-individual variability have been suggested to constitute a key to pathological processes underlying impulse control disorders. Single-trial EEG/ fMRI analysis allows to increase sensitivity for interindividual differences by incorporating intra-individual variability. Thirty-eight healthy subjects performed a visual Go/Nogo task during simultaneous EEG/ fMRI. Of 38 healthy subjects, 21 subjects reliably showed Nogo-related ICs ( Nogo-IC-positive) while 17 subjects ( Nogo-IC-negative) did not. Comparing both groups revealed differences on various levels: On trait level, Nogo-IC-negative subjects scored higher on questionnaires regarding attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; on a behavioral level, they displayed slower response times ( RT) and higher intra-individual RT variability while both groups did not differ in their inhibitory performance. On the neurophysiological level, Nogo-IC-negative subjects showed a hyperactivation of left inferior frontal cortex/insula and left putamen as well as significantly reduced P3 amplitudes. Thus, a data-driven approach for IC classification and the resulting presence or absence of early Nogo-specific ICs as criterion for group selection revealed group differences at behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This may indicate electrophysiological phenotypes characterized by inter-individual variations of neural and behavioral correlates of impulse control. We demonstrated that the inter-individual difference in an electrophysiological correlate of response inhibition is correlated with distinct, potentially compensatory neural activity. This may suggest the existence of electrophysiologically dissociable phenotypes of behavioral and neural motor response inhibition with the Nogo-IC-positive phenotype possibly providing protection against impulsivity-related dysfunction.

The objective of this study is to analyze the information processing changes in BP (Bipolar Patients) (euthymia, depression and mania) during the oddball paradigm, focusing on the P300 component, an electric potential of the cerebral cortex generated in response to external sensorial stimuli, which involves more complex neurophysiological processes related to stimulus interpretation. Twenty-eight bipolar disorder patients (BP) (17 women and 11 men with average age of 32.5, SD: 9.5) and eleven healthy controls (HC) (7 women and 4 men with average age of 29.78, SD: 6.89) were enrolled in this study. The bipolar patients were divided into 3 major groups (i.e., euthymic, depressive and maniac) according to the score on the Clinical Global Impression - Bipolar Version (CGI-BP). The subjects performed the oddball paradigm simultaneously to the EEG record. EEG data were also recorded before and after the execution of the task. A one-way ANOVA was applied to compare the P300 component among the groups. After observing P300 and the subcomponents P3a and P3b, a similarity of amplitude and latency between euthymic and depressive patients was observed, as well as small amplitude in the pre-frontal cortex and reduced P3a response. This can be evidence of impaired information processing, cognitive flexibility, working memory, executive functions and ability to shift the attention and processing to the target and away from distracting stimuli in BD. Such neuropsychological impairments are related to different BD symptoms, which should be known and considered, in order to develop effective clinical treatment strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Longitudinal Associations Between Preschool Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Symptoms and Neural Reactivity to Monetary Reward During Preadolescence	JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BIPOLAR DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSION; YOUTH; CHILDHOOD; CIRCUITRY; CHILDREN; IRRITABILITY; SENSITIVITY; POSITIVITY; RESPONSES	Objective: Reward-processing abnormalities are thought to be a key feature of various psychiatric disorders and may also play a role in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), a new diagnosis in DSM-5. In the current study, we used event-related potentials (ERP) sensitive to monetary gains (i.e., the reward positivity [RewP]) and losses (i.e., the N200) to examine associations between symptoms of DMDD during early childhood and later reward processing during preadolescence. Methods: To assess early emerging DMDD symptoms in a large longitudinal community sample (n=373) of 3-year old children, we administered a diagnostic interview, Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) with parents. At a later assessment, approximate to 6 years later, children completed a monetary reward task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Children's lifetime history of psychopathology was also assessed at that time using Kiddie-Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) with the child and parent. Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that age 3 DMDD symptoms predicted an enhanced RewP to monetary rewards in preadolescence. This association is independent of demographics and lifetime history of symptoms of depression, any anxiety disorder, attention-deficit disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder Conclusions: Early manifestations of DMDD in children as young as 3 years old predicted enhanced reward processing later in development. These findings add to the growing corpus of literature on the pathophysiology of DMDD, and underscore the predictive validity of preschool DMDD on a neural level.

The marker indexes a comprehensive model of visual processing, and if it is apparent in physicians, it could be used to investigate the development and training of their visual expertise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a neural marker of visual expertise-the enhanced N170 event-related potential-is apparent in the EEGs of physicians as they interpret diagnostic images. We conducted a controlled trial with 10 cardiologists and 9 pulmonologists. Each participant completed 520 trials of a standard visual processing task involving the rapid evaluation of EKGs and CXRs-indicating-lung-disease. Ostensibly, each participant is expert with one type of image and competent with the other. We collected behavioral data on the participants' expertise with EKGs and CXRs and electrophysiological data on the magnitude, latency, and scalp location of their N170 ERPs as they interpreted the two types of images. Cardiologists demonstrated significantly more expertise with EKGs than CXRs, and this was reflected in an increased amplitude of their N170 ERPs while reading EKGs compared to CXRs. Pulmonologists demonstrated equal expertise with both types of images, and this was reflected in equal N170 ERP amplitudes for EKGs and CXRs. The results suggest provisionally that visual expertise has a similar substrate in medical practice as it does in other domains that have been studied extensively. This provides support for applying a sophisticated body of literature to questions about training and assessment of visual expertise among physicians.

Performance predictors of brain-computer interfaces in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cognition; personalized medicine; augmentative and alternative communication	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; MOTOR IMAGERY; ALS; COMMUNICATION; ATTENTION; PEOPLE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOTIVATION; DIAGNOSIS	Objective. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may benefit from brain-computer interfaces (BCI), but the utility of such devices likely will have to account for the functional, cognitive, and behavioral heterogeneity of this neurodegenerative disorder. Approach. In this study, a heterogeneous group of patients with ALS participated in a study on BCI based on the P300 event related potential and motor-imagery. Results. The presence of cognitive impairment in these patients significantly reduced the quality of the control signals required to use these communication systems, subsequently impairing performance, regardless of progression of physical symptoms. Loss in performance among the cognitively impaired was accompanied by a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of task-relevant EEG band power. There was also evidence that behavioral dysfunction negatively affects P300 speller performance. Finally, older participants achieved better performance on the P300 system than the motor-imagery system, indicating a preference of BCI paradigm with age. Significance. These findings highlight the importance of considering the heterogeneity of disease when designing BCI augmentative and alternative communication devices for clinical applications.

Assessing Human Mirror Activity With EEG Mu Rhythm: A Meta-Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						mu rhythm; mirror neurons; EEG; action execution; action observation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURON SYSTEM; PUBLICATION BIAS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT	A fundamental issue in cognitive neuroscience is how the brain encodes others' actions and intentions. In recent years, a potential advance in our knowledge on this issue is the discovery of mirror neurons in the motor cortex of the nonhuman primate. These neurons fire to both execution and observation of specific types of actions. Researchers use this evidence to fuel investigations of a human mirror system, suggesting a common neural code for perceptual and motor processes. Among the methods used for inferring mirror system activity in humans are changes in a particular frequency band in the electroencephalogram (EEG) called the mu rhythm. Mu frequency appears to decrease in amplitude (reflecting cortical activity) during both action execution and action observation. The current meta-analysis reviewed 85 studies (1,707 participants) of mu that infer human mirror system activity. Results demonstrated significant effect sizes for mu during execution (Cohen's d = 0.46, N = 701) as well as observation of action (Cohen's d = 0.31, N = 1,508), confirming a mirroring property in the EEG. A number of moderators were examined to determine the specificity of these effects. We frame these meta-analytic findings within the current discussion about the development and functions of a human mirror system, and conclude that changes in EEG mu activity provide a valid means for the study of human neural mirroring. Suggestions for improving the experimental and methodological approaches in using mu to study the human mirror system are offered.

J	Warnain, Y; Gabrielli, F; Coello, Y				Warnain, Yannic; Gabrielli, Francois; Coello, Yann			EEG mu rhythm in virtual reality reveals that motor coding of visual objects in peripersonal space is task dependent	CORTEX			English	Article						Vision; EEG; Reachability; Peripersonal space; mu rhythm	TOOL-USE; FMRI REVEALS; PERCEPTION; DISTANCE; MODULATION; MOVEMENT; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; REACHABILITY; POTENTIALS	Previous fMRI studies have shown that the visual perception of manipulable objects spontaneously involves the sensorimotor system, especially when the objects are located in peripersonal space. However, it has also been suggested that the motor coding of manipulable objects perceived in peripersonal space depends on an anticipation to interact with them. The present study aims at clarifying this issue by analyzing healthy adults' EEG activity on the centro-parietal region while perceptually judging intrinsic (prototypical or distorted shape) or extrinsic (reachable or not reachable location) properties of visual objects. In both the object identification and reachability judgment tasks, time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals was performed across the first 1000 ms following object presentation for trials on which no post-stimulus response was required (90% of the trials). Event-Related-(De)Synchronization (ERD/S) of mu rhythm was computed using the 150 ms pre-stimulus period as baseline. In the Teachability judgment task, EEG analysis showed a desynchronization of mu rhythm starting 300 ms after object presentation, but only when the objects were presented with a prototypical shape in peripersonal space. For those objects, desynchronization of mu rhythm diminished progressively from peripersonal to extrapersonal space. By contrast, no such gradient was observed in the object identification task. On the whole, these data indicate that motor coding of visual objects expressed in the mu rhythm depends on an object's shape and location in space, but also on the goal of the perceptual task.

The features are extracted from motor imagery (MI) EEGs. Utilizing BP (Bereitschafts potential) feature as the master feature can detect the no-control (NC) / intentional control (IC) states in an asynchronous BCI system. EEG rhythm energy ratio is extracted as the slave feature based on event related synchronization and de-synchronization (ERS/ERD) phenomenon to identify the binary intention. Using the EEGs of imagination of the left/right hand movement, an asynchronous BCI experimental system protocol based on master-slave features is presented. The performance is evaluated by testing, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed system.

However, recent research has shown that the sleeping brain is not completely disconnected from its environment. How neural activity constrains the ability to process sensory information while asleep is yet unclear. Here, we instructed human volunteers to classify words with lateralized hand responses while falling asleep. Using an electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) marker of motor preparation, we show how responsiveness is modulated across sleep. These modulations are tracked using classic event-related potential analyses complemented by Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc), a measure shown to track arousal in sleep and anesthesia. Neural activity related to the semantic content of stimuli was conserved in light non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, these processes were suppressed in deep NREM sleep and, importantly, also in REM sleep, despite the recovery of wake-like neural activity in the latter. In NREM sleep, sensory activations were counterbalanced by evoked down states, which, when present, blocked further processing of external information. In addition, responsiveness markers correlated positively with baseline complexity, which could be related to modulation in sleep depth. In REM sleep, however, this relationship was reversed. We therefore propose that, in REM sleep, endogenously generated processes compete with the processing of external input. Sleep can thus be seen as a self-regulated process in which external information can be processed in lighter stages but suppressed in deeper stages. Last, our results suggest drastically different gating mechanisms in NREM and REM sleep.

Some of them may not directly correlate with awareness but with post-perceptual processes, such as reporting one's awareness of the stimulus. We dissociated potential electrophysiological correlates of visual awareness from those occurring during response selection and thus co-occurring with post-perceptual processing. The participants performed two GO-NOGO conditions. In the aware-GO condition they responded with a key press when they were aware of the stimulus and withheld responding when they were unaware of it. In the unaware-GO condition they withheld responding when they were aware and responded when they were not aware of the stimulus. Thus, event-related potentials could be measured to aware and unaware trials when responding was required and when not required. The results revealed that the N200 amplitude (180-280ms) over the occipital and posterior temporal cortex was enhanced in aware trials as compared with trials without awareness. This effect (visual awareness negativity, VAN) did not depend on responding. The amplitude of P3 (350-450ms) also was enhanced in aware trials as compared with unaware trials. In addition, the amplitudes in the P3 time window depended on responding: they were greater when awareness was mapped to GO-response than when not, suggesting that P3 reflects post-perceptual processing, that is, it occurs after awareness has emerged. These findings support theories of visual awareness that assume a relatively early onset of visual awareness before P3.

The Effect of a Prospected Reward on Semantic Processing An N400 EEG Study	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE-JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						N400 cloze effect; ERP; reward; learning; semantic processing	INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; MEMORY FORMATION; MONETARY REWARD; ACHIEVEMENT; ACTIVATION; STUDENTS; ANTICIPATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; SENTENCES; MIDBRAIN	Promised rewards are often used in education to stimulate learning behaviour. The present study tested whether a reward prospect affects semantic processing and recall of learned materials. Thirty-nine females participated in an electroencephalogram (EEG) task measuring semantic processing using the N400 effect. After that, they completed a cued recall test of the task materials. Before the EEG task, half of the participants (n = 20) were told that financial compensation would increase with each correct answer (reward prospect condition). The other half (n = 19) were told that financial compensation was fixed (control condition). Participants in the reward prospect condition showed an N400 effect that was more spread over the (left) frontal areas, and showed better recall than participants in the control condition. An achievement-related reward prospect alters semantic processing and improves retention of learned material. Whether improved retention benefits learning in longer term needs further study.

This is reflected in the oscillatory theta response and can be investigated by visual illusions. Ambiguous stimuli elicit illusory perceptual switches while the stimulus remains unchanged. Methods: Theta responses elicited by an ambiguous and unambiguous control stimulus were measured using the EEG during time periods of perceptual switching and perceptual stability (non-switching). Results: For the ambiguous task, theta activity increased during perceptual switching in healthy controls only. For the unambiguous task, the switching-related increase of theta activity was larger in controls than in patients. This reduced modulation of the theta response seems not to be related to a general decrease of theta activity in patients. Conclusions: These findings may be related to disturbances in the spatio-temporal integration of neural activity in patients. Reporting ambiguous and unambiguous perceptual switches seems to be more demanding for patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls. Significance: This is one of the first studies on the neurophysiologic correlates of illusory perception in schizophrenia. Focussing on the relation between different brain states (such as switching and non-switching) might integrate different findings about altered theta oscillations in schizophrenia.

In contrast to the perceptual segregation of two concurrent sounds, the perception of three simultaneous sound objects has not yet been studied systematically. We conducted two experiments in which participants were presented with complex sounds containing sound segregation cues (mistuning, onset asynchrony, differences in frequency or amplitude modulation or in sound location), which were set up to promote the perceptual organization of the tonal elements into one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 1, listeners indicated whether they heard one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 2, participants watched a silent subtitled movie while EEG was recorded to extract the object-related negativity (ORN) component of the event-related potential. Listeners predominantly reported hearing two sounds when the segregation promoting manipulations were applied to the same tonal element. When two different tonal elements received manipulations promoting them to be heard as separate auditory objects, participants reported hearing two and three concurrent sounds objects with equal probability. The ORN was elicited in most conditions; sounds that included the amplitude- or the frequency -modulation cue generated the smallest ORN amplitudes. Manipulating two different tonal elements yielded numerically and often significantly smaller ORNs than the sum of the ORNs elicited when the same cues were applied on a single tonal element. These results suggest that ORN reflects the presence of multiple concurrent sounds, but not their number. The ORN results are compatible with the horse-race principle of combining different cues of concurrent sound segregation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Elucidating the neural bases of selective attention remains a key challenge for neuroscience and represents an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, knowledge about the cognitive and neural mechanisms of attention is essential for developing and refining brain-machine interfaces, and for advancing methods for training and education. We will discuss how functional imaging methods have helped us to understand fundamental aspects of attention: How attention is controlled, focused on relevant inputs, and reoriented, and how this control results in the selection of relevant information. Work from our groups and from others will be reviewed. We will focus on fMRI methods, but where appropriate will include related discussion of electromagnetic recording methods used in conjunction with fMRI, including simultaneous EEG/fMRI methods.

The Discovery of Processing Stages: Extension of Sternberg's Method	PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						associative recognition; computational modeling; reaction time; hidden semi-Markov models; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION; PARIETAL CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MENTAL PROCESSES; DECISION-MAKING; EPISODIC MEMORY; MARKOV-MODELS	We introduce a method for measuring the number and durations of processing stages from the electroencephalographic signal and apply it to the study of associative recognition. Using an extension of past research that combines multivariate pattern analysis with hidden semi-Markov models, the approach identifies on a trial-by-trial basis where brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) are added to the ongoing electroencephalographic signal. We propose that these bumps mark the onset of critical cognitive stages in processing. The results of the analysis can be used to guide the development of detailed process models. Applied to the associative recognition task, the hidden semi-Markov models multivariate pattern analysis method indicates that the effects of associative strength and probe type are localized to a memory retrieval stage and a decision stage. This is in line with a previously developed the adaptive control of thought-rational process model, called ACT-R, of the task. As a test of the generalization of our method we also apply it to a data set on the Sternberg working memory task collected by Jacobs, Hwang, Curran, and Kahana (2006). The analysis generalizes robustly, and localizes the typical set size effect in a late comparison/decision stage. In addition to providing information about the number and durations of stages in associative recognition, our analysis sheds light on the event-related potential components implicated in the study of recognition memory.

To increase living standard of them, a thought controlled robot or robotic arm can be of great importance for their better communication to external world. This paper proposes a novel approach towards electroencephalogram based random order control of a robot manipulator. Here steady state visual evoked potential has been used to select the desired robot link and motor imagery signal has been used to control the motion of robot link. Left and Right hand motor imagery signal has been used in this purpose. Event related error potential is used for feedback purpose and to correct the positional error of link created by motor imagery. The robot link here is realigned by experimental offset. Power spectral density, common spatial pattern and moving average, have been used as feature extractor and support vector machine with linear kernel function has been used as the classifier. At first, the subject has been trained in offline experiment and then online session performance has been evaluated.

Using a novel combined EEG-lesion approach in patients with chronic left hemisphere lesions and healthy controls, Obrig et al. disentangle contributions of universal and language-specific constraints. They show that different processing steps recruit separable brain regions.The phonological structure of speech supports the highly automatic mapping of sound to meaning. While it is uncontroversial that phonotactic knowledge acts upon lexical access, it is unclear at what stage these combinatorial rules, governing phonological well-formedness in a given language, shape speech comprehension. Moreover few studies have investigated the neuronal network affording this important step in speech comprehension. Therefore we asked 70 participants-half of whom suffered from a chronic left hemispheric lesion-to listen to 252 different monosyllabic pseudowords. The material models universal preferences of phonotactic well-formedness by including naturally spoken pseudowords and digitally reversed exemplars. The latter partially violate phonological structure of all human speech and are rich in universally dispreferred phoneme sequences while preserving basic auditory parameters. Language-specific constraints were modelled in that half of the naturally spoken pseudowords complied with the phonotactics of the native language of the monolingual participants (German) while the other half did not. To ensure universal well-formedness and naturalness, the latter stimuli comply with Slovak phonotactics and all stimuli were produced by an early bilingual speaker. To maximally attenuate lexico-semantic influences, transparent pseudowords were avoided and participants had to detect immediate repetitions, a task orthogonal to the contrasts of interest. The results show that phonological 'well-formedness' modulates implicit processing of speech at different levels: universally dispreferred phonological structure elicits early, medium and late latency differences in the evoked potential. On the contrary, the language-specific phonotactic contrast selectively modulates a medium latency component of the event-related potentials around 400 ms. Using a novel event-related potential-lesion approach allowed us to furthermore supply first evidence that implicit processing of these different phonotactic levels relies on partially separable brain areas in the left hemisphere: contrasting forward to reversed speech the approach delineated an area comprising supramarginal and angular gyri. Conversely, the contrast between legal versus illegal phonotactics consistently projected to anterior and middle portions of the middle temporal and superior temporal gyri. Our data support the notion that phonological structure acts on different stages of phonologically and lexically driven steps of speech comprehension. In the context of previous work we propose context-dependent sensitivity to different levels of phonotactic well-formedness.

Study 1 provided active training with sticky mittens that enables grasping and object manipulation in prereaching 4-month-olds. After training, EEG was recorded while infants observed images of hands grasping toward (congruent) or away from (incongruent) objects. We demonstrate that brief active training facilitates social perception as indexed by larger amplitude of the P400 ERP component to congruent compared with incongruent trials. Study 2 presented 4-month-old infants with passive training in which they observed an experimenter perform goal-directed reaching actions, followed by an identical ERP session to that used in Study 1. The second study did not demonstrate any differentiation between congruent and incongruent trials. These results suggest that (1) active experience alters the brains' response to goal-directed actions performed by others and (2) visual exposure alone is not sufficient in developing the neural networks subserving goal processing during action observation in infancy.

The target place (bathroom door) was designed to be recognized during a virtual wayfinding in a realistic reproduction of a house environment. Different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a remote home automation control, were applied to the target and standard places, all the doors being illuminated in white (W), and only target doors colored with a green (G) or red (R) spotlight. Three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). EEG was recorded from 57 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects in the 60-80 year age range (O-old group) and 12 normal cases in the 20-30 year age range (Y-young group). Results: In Young group, all the target stimuli determined a significant increase in P3b amplitude on the parietal, occipital and central electrodes compared to frequent stimuli condition, whatever was the color of the target door, while in elderly group the P3b obtained by the green and red colors was significantly different from the frequent stimulus, on the parietal, occipital, and central derivations, while the White stimulus did not evoke a significantly larger P3b with respect to frequent stimulus. Discussion: The modulation of P3b amplitude, obtained by color and luminance change of target place, suggests that cortical resources, able to compensate the age-related progressive loss of cognitive performance, need to be facilitated even in normal elderly. The event-related responses obtained by virtual reality may be a reliable method to test the environmental feasibility to age-related cognitive changes.

Until now, no clear comparison on linear modelling in different modalities has been done. Therefore, specific differences observed in both visual and auditory paradigms were computed with linear modelling The Coefficient of Determination through the explained variance (R2) in Linear Modelling was sought in visual and auditory modalities. ERP scalp series of time from 100 to 300 ms for the visual task and around 150 ms to 400 for the auditory task were also plotted. Although these paradigms use different regressors, both paradigms showed reliable R2 signatures across the participants and reliable ERP scalp maps. Results accounted for different magnitudes in greater R2 values for visual modality. Auditory R2 results appeared with a reliable linear modelling when compared with R2 studies in other subjects.

Memantine Improves Attentional Processes in Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome: Electrophysiological Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; FMR1 PREMUTATION; SYNDROME FXTAS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PREPULSE INHIBITION; DOUBLE-BLIND; CARRIERS	Progressive cognitive deficits are common in patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), with no targeted treatment yet established. In this substudy of the first randomized controlled trial for FXTAS, we examined the effects of NMDA antagonist memantine on attention and working memory. Data were analyzed for patients (24 in each arm) who completed both the primary memantine trial and two EEG recordings (at baseline and follow-up) using an auditory "oddball" task. Results demonstrated significantly improved attention/working memory performance after one year only for the memantine group. The event-related potential P2 amplitude elicited by non-targets was significantly enhanced in the treated group, indicating memantine-associated improvement in attentional processes at the stimulus identification/discrimination level. P2 amplitude increase was positively correlated with improvement on the behavioral measure of attention/working memory during target detection. Analysis also revealed that memantine treatment normalized the P2 habituation effect at the follow-up visit. These findings indicate that memantine may benefit attentional processes that represent fundamental components of executive function/dysfunction, thought to comprise the core cognitive deficit in FXTAS. The results provide evidence of target engagement of memantine, as well as therapeutically relevant information that could further the development of specific cognitive or disease-modifying therapies for FXTAS.

J	Walentowska, W; Moors, A; Paul, K; Pourtois, G				Walentowska, Wioleta; Moors, Agnes; Paul, Katharina; Pourtois, Gilles			Goal relevance influences performance monitoring at the level of the FRN and P3 components	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; FRN; P3; CRN; Performance monitoring; Goal relevance	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; REWARD PREDICTION; ERROR-DETECTION; BAD OUTCOMES; ERP; REINFORCEMENT; POSITIVITY	The feedback-related negativity (FRN) provides a reliable ERP marker of performance monitoring (PM). It is usually larger for negative compared to positive feedback, and for unexpected relative to expected feedback. In two experiments, we assessed whether these effects could be modulated by goal relevance, defined as feedback informativeness (reliability) and/or impact on a person's goals. EEG (64-channel) was recorded while 30 participants (in each experiment) performed a speeded go/no-go task across blocks in which the feedback on task performance was deemed either relevant or not. At the ERP level, the FRN component was larger for (frequent) negative compared to (deviant) positive feedback exclusively when the feedback was relevant (Experiment 1). When the probability of positive and negative feedback was balanced (Experiment 2), this valence-driven FRN effect was absent. However, across these two experiments, the FRN was always larger for irrelevant than relevant feedback. Moreover, the subsequent P300 component was larger for feedback in the relevant than the irrelevant blocks. This effect was valence unspecific in Experiment 1, while in Experiment 2 larger P3 amplitudes were recorded for negative than positive (relevant) feedback. Across the two experiments, a larger correct-related negativity in the irrelevant than relevant context was also observed, suggesting that PM is flexible. These ERP findings indicate that goal relevance influences feedback (and response) processing during PM, with two nonoverlapping neurophysiological effects: It gates reward prediction error brain mechanisms (FRN effect), before enhancing subsequent motivational processes (P300 effect).

Changes in P3b Latency and Amplitude Reflect Expertise Acquisition in a Football Visuomotor Learning Task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; VISUAL-STIMULI; RARE TARGET; CONTEXT; P300; ASSOCIATIONS; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Learning is not a unitary phenomenon. Rather, learning progresses through stages, with the stages reflecting different challenges that require the support of specific cognitive processes that reflect the functions of different brain networks. A theory of general learning proposes that learning can be divided into early and late stages controlled by corticolimbic networks located in frontal and posterior brain regions, respectively. Recent human studies using dense-array EEG (dEEG) support these results by showing progressive increases in P3b amplitude (an Event Related Potential with estimated sources in posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus) as participants acquire a new visuomotor skill. In the present study, the P3b was used to track the learning and performance of participants as they identify defensive football formations and make an appropriate response. Participants acquired the task over three days, and P3b latency and amplitude significantly changed when participants learned the task. As participants demonstrated further proficiency with extensive training, amplitude and latency changes in the P3b continued to closely mirror performance improvements. Source localization results across all days suggest that an important source generator of the P3b is located in the posterior cingulate cortex. Results from the study support prior findings and further suggest that the careful analysis of covert learning mechanisms and their underlying electrical signatures are a robust index of task competency.

It becomes extremely difficult for clinicians and caretakers to accurately assess the level of preserved auditory functioning in these children, an issue of obvious clinical import. Non-invasive electrophysiological techniques allow for the interrogation of auditory cortical processing without the need for overt behavioral responses. In particular, the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) provides an excellent and robust dependent measure of change detection and auditory sensory memory. Here, we asked whether females with Rett syndrome would produce the MMN to occasional changes in pitch in a regularly occurring stream of auditory tones. Methods: Fourteen girls with genetically confirmed Rett syndrome and 22 age-matched neurotypical controls participated (ages 3.9-21.1 years). High-density electrophysiological recordings from 64 scalp electrodes were made while participants passively listened to a regularly occurring stream of 503-Hz auditory tone pips that was occasionally (15 % of presentations) interrupted by a higher-pitched deviant tone of 996 Hz. The MMN was derived by subtracting the AEP to these deviants from the AEP produced to the standard. Results: Despite clearly anomalous morphology and latency of the AEP to simple pure-tone inputs in Rett syndrome, the MMN response was evident in both neurotypicals and Rett patients. However, we found that the pitch-evoked MMN was both delayed and protracted in duration in Rett, pointing to slowing of auditory responsiveness. Conclusions: The presence of the MMN in Rett patients suggests preserved abilities to process pitch changes in auditory sensory memory. This work represents a beginning step in an effort to comprehensively map the extent of auditory cortical functioning in Rett syndrome. These easily obtained objective brain measures of auditory processing have promise as biomarkers against which future therapeutic efforts can be assayed.

Methods: Scalp EEG was simulated by forward modeling 20-200 simultaneously active sources covering the cortical surface of a realistic neonatal head model. We assessed systematically how the number of scalp electrodes (11-85), analysis montage, or the size of cortical sources affect the detection of cortical phase synchrony. Statistical metrics were developed for quantifying the resolution and reliability of the montages. Results: The findings converge to show that an increase in the number of recording electrodes leads to a systematic improvement in the detection of true cortical phase synchrony. While there is always a ceiling effect with respect to discernible cortical details, we show that the average and Laplacian montages exhibit superior specificity and sensitivity as compared to other conventional montages. Conclusions: Reliability in assessing true neonatal cortical synchrony is directly related to the choice of EEG recording and analysis configurations. Because of the high conductivity of the neonatal skull, the conventional neonatal EEG recordings are spatially far too sparse for pertinent studies, and this loss of information cannot be recovered by re-montaging during analysis. Significance: Future neonatal EEG studies will need prospective planning of recording configuration to allow analysis of spatial details required by each study question. Our findings also advice about the level of details in brain synchrony that can be studied with existing datasets or by using conventional EEG recordings.

However, the accuracy and information transmission rate were relatively low for practical use. To solve the problem, researchers focused on two aspects of paradigms and classifiers. P300-speller with familiar face paradigm achieved a better performance. In addition, Bayesian linear discriminate analysis (BLDA) was successfully applied to classifier in the P300-speller with familiar face paradigm. However, BLDA needed the large scale of training set to ensure the accuracy of classification. Subjects gradually got sleepy during the period of training set collection, which resulted in an ambiguous unobvious difference between the attended and unattended characters, and affected the accuracy of classification. Support vector machine (SVM) is a strong classification method which achieves a very good classification in the case of small training set. However, whether SVM has a good performance on a familiar face paradigm or not remains unclear. In this study, we compared the classification performance of BLDA and SVM in BCI P300-speller with familiar face paradigm. In the condition in which the size of the training set is very small, P300-speller achieved a better performance using SVM classifier than using BLDA classifier. Along with gradually increasing of the size of the training set, the difference of classification performance between SVM and BLDA becomes small. Our results demonstrated the classification performance of SVM is better than that of BLDA in P300-speller with familiar face paradigm using a small training set.

Reduced temporal processing in older, normal-hearing listeners evident from electrophysiological responses to shifts in interaural time difference	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aging; auditory temporal processing; binaural hearing; hemifield code; electroencephalography; auditory event-related potentials	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; MEDIAL SUPERIOR OLIVE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SOUND LOCALIZATION; GAP DETECTION; INHIBITORY CONTROL; ADULTS; LATERALIZATION; MECHANISMS; STIMULI	Previous electrophysiological studies of interaural time difference (ITD) processing have demonstrated that ITDs are represented by a nontopographic population rate code. Rather than narrow tuning to ITDs, neural channels have broad tuning to ITDs in either the left or right auditory hemifield, and the relative activity between the channels determines the perceived lateralization of the sound. With advancing age, spatial perception weakens and poor temporal processing contributes to declining spatial acuity. At present, it is unclear whether age-related temporal processing deficits are due to poor inhibitory controls in the auditory system or degraded neural synchrony at the periphery. Cortical processing of spatial cues based on a hemifield code are susceptible to potential age-related physiological changes. We consider two distinct predictions of age-related changes to ITD sensitivity: declines in inhibitory mechanisms would lead to increased excitation and medial shifts to rate-azimuth functions, whereas a general reduction in neural synchrony would lead to reduced excitation and shallower slopes in the rate-azimuth function. The current study tested these possibilities by measuring an evoked response to ITD shifts in a narrow-band noise. Results were more in line with the latter outcome, both from measured latencies and amplitudes of the global field potentials and source-localized waveforms in the left and right auditory cortices. The measured responses for older listeners also tended to have reduced asymmetric distribution of activity in response to ITD shifts, which is consistent with other sensory and cognitive processing models of aging.

Schizophrenia proper has been associated with anomalies in dopaminergic neurotransmission and deficits in neurophysiological markers of self-monitoring, such as low amplitude in cognitive event-related brain potentials (ERPs) like the error-related negativity (ERN), and the error positivity (Pe). These components occur after performance errors, rely on adequate fronto-striatal function, and are sensitive to dopaminergic modulation. Here we postulated that analogous to observations in schizophrenia, SPD individuals would show deficits in self-monitoring, as measured by the ERN and the Pe. We also assessed the capacity of dopaminergic antagonists to reverse these postulated deficits. Methods: We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 9 SPD individuals and 12 healthy controls in two separate experimental sessions while they performed the Eriksen Flanker Task, a classical task recruiting behavioral monitoring. Participants received a placebo or 1 mg risperidone according to a double-blind randomized design. Results: After placebo, SPD individuals showed slower reaction times to hits, longer correction times following errors and reduced ERN and Pe amplitudes. While risperidone impaired performance and decreased ERN and Pe in the control group, it led to behavioral improvements and ERN amplitude increases in the SPD individuals. Conclusions: These results indicate that SPD individuals show deficits in self-monitoring analogous to those in schizophrenia. These deficits can be evidenced by neurophysiological measures, suggest a dopaminergic imbalance, and can be reverted by dopaminergic antagonists. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Fast fMRI can detect oscillatory neural activity in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; hemodynamics; imaging; BOLD	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BOLD FMRI; BALLOON MODEL; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; IMPULSE-RESPONSE; SLOW WAVES	Oscillatory neural dynamics play an important role in the coordination of large-scale brain networks. High-level cognitive processes depend on dynamics evolving over hundreds of milliseconds, so measuring neural activity in this frequency range is important for cognitive neuroscience. However, current noninvasive neuroimaging methods are not able to precisely localize oscillatory neural activity above 0.2 Hz. Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have limited spatial resolution, whereas fMRI has limited temporal resolution because it measures vascular responses rather than directly recording neural activity. We hypothesized that the recent development of fast fMRI techniques, combined with the extra sensitivity afforded by ultra-high-field systems, could enable precise localization of neural oscillations. We tested whether fMRI can detect neural oscillations using human visual cortex as a model system. We detected small oscillatory fMRI signals in response to stimuli oscillating at up to 0.75 Hz within single scan sessions, and these responses were an order of magnitude larger than predicted by canonical linear models. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI and simulations based on a biophysical model of the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity suggested that the blood oxygen level-dependent response becomes faster for rapidly varying stimuli, enabling the detection of higher frequencies than expected. Accounting for phase delays across voxels further improved detection, demonstrating that identifying vascular delays will be of increasing importance with higher-frequency activity. These results challenge the assumption that the hemodynamic response is slow, and demonstrate that fMRI has the potential to map neural oscillations directly throughout the brain.

J	Ou, JH; Law, SP				Ou, Jinghua; Law, Sam-Po			Individual differences in processing pitch contour and rise time in adults: A behavioral and electrophysiological study of Cantonese tone merging	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; BRAIN; COARTICULATION; INFORMATION; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; LANGUAGE; SPEAKERS	One way to understand the relationship between speech perception and production is to examine cases where the two dissociate. This study investigates the hypothesis that perceptual acuity reflected in event-related potentials (ERPs) to rise time of sound amplitude envelope and pitch contour [reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN)] may associate with individual differences in production among speakers with otherwise comparable perceptual abilities. To test this hypothesis, advantage was taken of an on-going sound change-tone merging in Cantonese, and compared the ERPs between two groups of typically developed native speakers who could discriminate the high rising and low rising tones with equivalent accuracy but differed in the distinctiveness of their production of these tones. Using a passive oddball paradigm, early positive-going EEG components to rise time and MMN to pitch contour were elicited during perception of the two tones. Significant group differences were found in neural responses to rise time rather than pitch contour. More importantly, individual differences in efficiency of tone discrimination in response latency and magnitude of neural responses to rise time were correlated with acoustic measures of F0 offset and rise time differences in productions of the two rising tones.

J	Stock, AK; Steenbergen, L; Colzato, L; Beste, C				Stock, Ann-Kathrin; Steenbergen, Laura; Colzato, Lorenza; Beste, Christian			The system neurophysiological basis of non-adaptive cognitive control: Inhibition of implicit learning mediated by right prefrontal regions	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						automatic processing; cognitive control; EEG; rIFG; source localization	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; WORKING-MEMORY; CONFLICT; BRAIN; ERP; MECHANISMS; SELECTION; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION	Cognitive control is adaptive in the sense that it inhibits automatic processes to optimize goal-directed behavior, but high levels of control may also have detrimental effects in case they suppress beneficial automatisms. Until now, the system neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomy underlying these adverse effects of cognitive control have remained elusive. This question was examined by analyzing the automatic exploitation of a beneficial implicit predictive feature under conditions of high versus low cognitive control demands, combining event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization. It was found that cognitive control prohibits the beneficial automatic exploitation of additional implicit information when task demands are high. Bottom-up perceptual and attentional selection processes (P1 and N1 ERPs) are not modulated by this, but the automatic exploitation of beneficial predictive information in case of low cognitive control demands was associated with larger response-locked P3 amplitudes and stronger activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG, BA47). This suggests that the rIFG plays a key role in the detection of relevant task cues, the exploitation of alternative task sets, and the automatic (bottom-up) implementation and reprogramming of action plans. Moreover, N450 amplitudes were larger under high cognitive control demands, which was associated with activity differences in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA9). This most likely reflects a stronger exploitation of explicit task sets which hinders the exploration of the implicit beneficial information in case of high cognitive control demands.

In the stage related to the decision-making process, graph theoretical analysis was applied to the binary directed network derived from EEG signals at nine electrodes in the frontal, central, and parietal regions in delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha(1) (8-10 Hz), alpha(2) (11-13 Hz), and beta (14-30 Hz) frequency bands based on directed transfer function. Results: A weakened outgoing information flow, a decrease in out-degree, and an increase in in-degree were found in the parietal region in VaD patients, compared to healthy controls. In VaD patients, the parietal region may also lose its hub status in brain networks. In addition, the clustering coefficient was significantly lower in VaD patients. Conclusions: Impairment might be present in the parietal region or its connections with other regions, and it may serve as one of the causes for cognitive decline in VaD patients. The brain networks of VaD patients were significantly altered toward random networks. Significance: The present study extended our understanding of VaD from the perspective of brain functional networks, and it provided possible interpretations for cognitive deficits in VaD patients.

Regulating task-monitoring systems in response to variable reward contingencies and outcomes in cocaine addicts	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Reward; Task monitoring; EEG; ERP; Motivation; Substance abuse; Addiction; Anhedonia	INHIBITORY CONTROL PROCESSES; MONETARY REWARD; FORMER COCAINE; ABUSERS; ANHEDONIA; DEFICITS; CORTEX; HYPERSENSITIVITY; SENSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY	We investigated anticipatory and consummatory reward processing in cocaine addiction. In addition, we set out to assess whether task-monitoring systems were appropriately recalibrated in light of variable reward schedules. We also examined neural measures of task-monitoring and reward processing as a function of hedonic tone, since anhedonia is a vulnerability marker for addiction that is obviously germane in the context of reward processing. High-density event-related potentials were recorded while participants performed a speeded response task that systematically varied anticipated probabilities of reward receipt. The paradigm dissociated feedback regarding task success (or failure) from feedback regarding the value of reward (or loss), so that task-monitoring and reward processing could be examined in partial isolation. Twenty-three active cocaine abusers and 23 age-matched healthy controls participated. Cocaine abusers showed amplified anticipatory responses to reward predictive cues, but crucially, these responses were not as strongly modulated by reward probability as in controls. Cocaine users also showed blunted responses to feedback about task success or failure and did not use this information to update predictions about reward. In turn, they showed clearly blunted responses to reward feedback. In controls and users, measures of anhedonia were associated with reward motivation. In cocaine users, anhedonia was also associated with diminished monitoring and reward feedback responses. Findings imply that reward anticipation and monitoring deficiencies in addiction are associated with increased responsiveness to reward cues but impaired ability to predict reward in light of task contingencies, compounded by deficits in responding to actual reward outcomes.

At a neurophysiological level, P3 amplitude responses that are associated with attention allocation have been found to be reduced to task-relevant stimuli during emotional conditions as compared to neutral conditions suggesting a draining impact of emotion on cognitive resources. Attachment theory claims that how individuals regulate their emotions is guided by an internal working model (IWM) of attachment that has formed early in life. While securely attached individuals are capable of freely evaluating their emotions insecurely attached ones tend to either suppress or heighten the emotional experience in a regulatory effort. To explore how attachment quality moderates the impact of emotional contexts on information processing event related potentials (ERPs) in 41 individuals were assessed. Subjects were instructed to detect neutral target letters within an oddball paradigm. Various images taken from the International Affective Picture System (ZAPS) served as background pictures and represented negative, positive and neutral task-irrelevant contexts. Attachment representation was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and individuals were assigned to one of three categories (secure, insecure-dismissing, insecure preoccupied). At a behavioral level, the study revealed that negative emotionally conditions were associated with the detection of less target stimuli in insecure dismissing subjects. Accordingly, ERPs yielded reduced P3 amplitudes in insecure dismissing subjects when given a negative emotional context. We interpret these findings in terms of less sufficient emotion regulation strategies in insecure-dismissing subjects at the cost of accurate behavioral performance. The study suggests that attachment representation differentially moderates the relationship between emotional contexts and information processing most evident in insecure-dismissing subjects.

Despite of promising investigations on neurofeedback as a tool for cognitive rehabilitation in neurological diseases, such as after stroke, there is still a lack of research on feasibility and efficiency of neurofeedback in this field. Methods: The present study aimed at investigating behavioral and electrophysiological effects of 10 sessions of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback in a 74-years-old stroke patient (UG20). Based on previous results in healthy young participants, we hypothesized that SMR neurofeedback leads to a decrease in sensorimotor interferences and improved stimulus processing, reflected by changes in event related potentials (ERPs) and electrophysiological coherence. To assess whether UG20 benefited from the training as much as healthy persons of a similar age, a healthy control group of N = 10 elderly persons was trained as well. Before and after neurofeedback training, participants took part in a multichannel electroencephalography measurement conducted during a non-verbal and a verbal learning task. Results: Both UG20 and the healthy controls were able to regulate their SMR activity during neurofeedback training. Moreover, in a non-verbal learning task, changes in ERPs and coherence were observed after training: UG20 showed a better performance in the non-verbal learning task and a higher P3 amplitude after training than before, and coherence between central and parietal electrodes decreased after training. The control group also showed a behavioral improvement in the non-verbal learning task and tendencies for higher P3 amplitudes and decreased central-parietal coherence after training. Single-case analyses indicated that the changes observed in UG20 were not smaller than the changes in healthy controls. Conclusion: Neurofeedback can be successfully applied in a stroke patient and in healthy elderly persons. We suggest that SMR neurofeedback leads to a shutting-down of sensorimotor interferences which benefits semantic encoding and retrieval.

To investigate this phenomenon, we designed a scenario involving three flying scenarios corresponding to three different level of difficulty along with an oddball paradigm in a motion flight simulator. This preliminary study was conducted with one pilot equipped with a 32-channel EEG. The results shown that manipulating the three levels of task difficulty led respectively to rates of 0, 37, and 54% missed alarms. The EEG analyses revealed that this decrease in performance was associated with lower spectral power within the alpha band and reduced N100 component amplitude. This latter finding suggested the involvement of inattentional deafness mechanisms at an early stage of the auditory processing. Eventually, we implemented a processing chain to enhance the discriminability of ERPs for mental state monitoring purposes. The results indicated that this chain could be used in a quite ecological setting (i.e. three-axis motion flight simulator) as attested by the good results obtained for the oddball task, but also for more subtle mental states such as mental demand and stress level and the detection of target, that is to say the inattentional deafness phenomenon.

Both structures may facilitate adaptive responses to emotional challenge by linking perception, attention, memory, and motor circuits. We provide an initial exploration of these hypotheses by recording simultaneous EEG-fMRI in eleven participants viewing affective pictures. MPFC- and amygdala-seeded functional connectivity maps were generated by applying the beta-series correlation method. The mPFC-seeded correlation map encompassed visual regions, sensorimotor areas, prefrontal cortex, and medial temporal lobe structures, exclusively for pleasant content. For the amygdala-seeded correlation map, a similar set of distributed brain areas appeared in the unpleasant-neutral contrast, with the addition of structures such as the insula and thalamus. A substantially sparser network was recruited for the pleasant-neutral contrast. Using the late positive potential (LPP) to index the intensity of emotional engagement, functional connectivity was found to be stronger in trials with larger LPP. These results demonstrate that mPFC-mediated functional interactions are engaged specifically during appetitive processing, whereas the amygdala is coupled to distinct sets of brain regions during both aversive and appetitive processing. The strength of these interactions varies as a function of the intensity of emotional engagement.

In the present EEG study, we investigated the effect of emotional intensity of different emotional facial expressions on P1, N170, early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) while varying the amount of available attentional resources. A new stimulus set comprising 90 full color pictures of neutral, happy (low, high intensity), and angry (low, high intensity) expressions was developed. These facial expressions were presented centrally, superimposed by two horizontal bars, and participants engaged in a focal bars task. Availability of attentional resources was varied in two conditions by manipulating the difficulty of the focal bars task (low vs. high perceptual load). Our findings demonstrate intensity and valence effects of task-irrelevant facial expressions on early (N170) and intermediate processing stages (EPN). In addition, task-related effects of perceptual load evolved at intermediate processing stages and were full blown in the time window of LPP. In line with limited resource accounts, valence effects on N170 and EPN were reduced under high perceptual load. Interestingly, apart from this valence by load interaction no further interactions between stimulus and task-driven factors were obtained: Effects of emotional intensity were not modulated by the perceptual load of the focal bars task, indicating that emotional intensity was processed even though attentional resources were heavily restricted.

Recent studies give evidence for memory deficits in infected older adults. To investigate working memory dysfunction in infected elderly, a double-blinded electrophysiological study was conducted. 84 persons derived from a sample of 131 healthy participants with the mean age of 70 years were assigned to two groups of 42 non-infected and 42 infected individuals. The outcome measures were behavioral performance, target and response-related ERPs, and time-frequency wavelets during performance in a n-back working-memory task. The infected individuals showed a reduced rate of detected targets and diminished P3b amplitude both in target-locked as well as response-locked data compared to the non-infected group. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG-signals revealed lower evoked power in the theta frequency range in the target-locked as well as in the response-locked data in infected individuals. The reported effects were comparable with differences between healthy young and old adults described previously. Taking together, the reduced working-memory performance accompanied by an attenuated P3b and frontal theta activity may suggest neurotransmitter imbalance like dopamine and norepinephrine in T. gondii infected individuals.

Several studies have shown the benefits of early nutrition on children's neurocognitive development. However, the evidence with regard to the attention system is scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term effects of FO, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), or FO+5-MTHF prenatal supplementation on attention networks. Design: Participants were 136 children born to mothers from the NUHEAL (Nutraceuticals for a Healthy Life) project (randomly assigned to receive FO and/or 5-MTHF or placebo prenatal supplementation) who were recalled for a new examination 8.5 y later. The response conflict-resolution ability (using congruent and incongruent conditions)), alerting, and spatial orienting of attention were evaluated with behavioral measures (Attention Network Test), electroencephalography/event-related potentials (ERPs), and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results: Children born to mothers supplemented with 5-MTHF alone solved the response conflict more quickly than did the placebo and the FO+5-MTHF groups (all P < 0.05). Differences between ERP amplitudes for the conflict conditions were also observed. sLORETA analysis showed higher activation of the right midcingulate cortex for the incongruent condition. In addition, a significant slowing down of response speed depending on the warning cue in the 5-MTHF and FO groups was observed. Conclusions: Folate supplementation during pregnancy, rather than FO or FO+5-MTHF supplementation, improves children's ability to solve response conflicts. This advantage seems to be based on the higher activation of the midcingulate cortex, indicating that early nutrition influences the functionality of specific brain areas involved in executive functions. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01180933.

Contextual processing in unpredictable auditory environments: the limited resource model of auditory refractoriness in the rhesus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory deficits; EEG; habituation; response suppression; rhesus	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SENSORY MEMORY; MACAQUE MONKEY; IN-VIVO	Auditory refractoriness refers to the finding of smaller electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to tones preceded by shorter periods of silence. To date, its physiological mechanisms remain unclear, limiting the insights gained from findings of abnormal refractoriness in individuals with schizophrenia. To resolve this roadblock, we studied auditory refractoriness in the rhesus, one of the most important animal models of auditory function, using grids of up to 32 chronically implanted cranial EEG electrodes. Four macaques passively listened to sounds whose identity and timing was random, thus preventing animals from forming valid predictions about upcoming sounds. Stimulus onset asynchrony ranged between 0.2 and 12.8 s, thus encompassing the clinically relevant timescale of refractoriness. Our results show refractoriness in all 8 previously identified middle-and long-latency components that peaked between 14 and 170 ms after tone onset. Refractoriness may reflect the formation and gradual decay of a basic sensory memory trace that may be mirrored by the expenditure and gradual recovery of a limited physiological resource that determines generator excitability. For all 8 components, results were consistent with the assumption that processing of each tone expends similar to 65% of the available resource. Differences between components are caused by how quickly the resource recovers. Recovery time constants of different components ranged between 0.5 and 2 s. This work provides a solid conceptual, methodological, and computational foundation to dissect the physiological mechanisms of auditory refractoriness in the rhesus. Such knowledge may, in turn, help develop novel pharmacological, mechanism-targeted interventions.

This is a composite signal that receives contributions from multiple neural sources, yet interpreting its nature and significance may be hindered by several confounding factors and technical limitations. By and large, the main factor defining the amplitude of LFPs is the geometry of the current sources, over and above the degree of synchronization or the properties of the media. As such, similar levels of activity may result in potentials that differ in several orders of magnitude in different populations. The geometry of these sources has been experimentally inaccessible until intracerebral high density recordings enabled the co-activating sources to be revealed. Without this information, it has proven difficult to interpret a century's worth of recordings that used temporal cues alone, such as event or spike related potentials and frequency bands. Meanwhile, a collection of biophysically ill-founded concepts have been considered legitimate, which can now be corrected in the light of recent advances. The relationship of LFPs to their sources is often counterintuitive. For instance, most LFP activity is not local but remote, it may be larger further from rather than close to the source, the polarity does not define its excitatory or inhibitory nature, and the amplitude may increase when source's activity is reduced. As technological developments foster the use of LFPs, the time is now ripe to raise awareness of the need to take into account spatial aspects of these signals and of the errors derived from neglecting to do so.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograph (EEG) studies have shown abnormal cue reactivity in various conditions between nicotine or alcohol addicts and the healthy. Although the causes of these abnormalities are still unclear, cultural effect can not be ignored. We conduct an review of fMRI and EEG studies about the cue reactivity in nicotine and alcohol addiction and highlight the cultural perspective. We suggest that cultural cue reactivity is a field worth of exploring which may has an effect on addictive behavior through emotion and attention. The cultural role of nicotine and alcohol addiction would provide new insight into understanding the mechanisms of nicotine and alcohol addiction and developing culture-specific therapies. We consider that culture as a context may be a factor that causes confusing outcomes in exploring nicotine and alcohol addiction which makes it possible to control the cultural influences and further contribute to the more consistent results.

Common and differential electrophysiological mechanisms underlying semantic object memory retrieval probed by features presented in different stimulus types	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Semantics; Memory retrieval; Neural oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA POWER; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNATURES; RESPONSES; DELTA	How the brain combines the neural representations of features that comprise an object in order to activate a coherent object memory is poorly understood, especially when the features are presented in different modalities (visual vs. auditory) and domains (verbal vs. nonverbal). We examined this question using three versions of a modified Semantic Object Retrieval Test, where object memory was probed by a feature presented as a written word, a spoken word, or a picture, followed by a second feature always presented as a visual word. Participants indicated whether each feature pair elicited retrieval of the memory of a particular object. Sixteen subjects completed one of the three versions (N = 48 in total) while their EEG were recorded simultaneously. We analyzed EEG data in four separate frequency bands (delta: 1-4 Hz, theta: 4-7 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 13-19 Hz) using a multivariate data-driven approach. We found that alpha power time-locked to response was modulated by both cross-modality (visual vs. auditory) and cross-domain (verbal vs. nonverbal) probing of semantic object memory. In addition, retrieval trials showed greater changes in all frequency bands compared to non-retrieval trials across all stimulus types in both response-locked and stimulus-locked analyses, suggesting dissociable neural subcomponents involved in binding object features to retrieve a memory. We conclude that these findings support both modality/domain-dependent and modality/domain-independent mechanisms during semantic object memory retrieval. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Feasibility Study in Healthy Participants	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Neurofeedback; Resting state; Microstates; Modelling; Schizophrenia	EEG; NETWORKS; NAIVE; ATTENTION; ADHD; FMRI; MIND	Spontaneous EEG signal can be parsed into sub-second periods of stable functional states (microstates) that assumingly correspond to brief large scale synchronization events. In schizophrenia, a specific class of microstate (class "D") has been found to be shorter than in healthy controls and to be correlated with positive symptoms. To explore potential new treatment options in schizophrenia, we tested in healthy controls if neurofeedback training to self-regulate microstate D presence is feasible and what learning patterns are observed. Twenty subjects underwent EEG-neurofeedback training to up-regulate microstate D presence. The protocol included 20 training sessions, consisting of baseline trials (resting state), regulation trials with auditory feedback contingent on microstate D presence, and a transfer trial. Response to neurofeedback was assessed with mixed effects modelling. All participants increased the percentage of time spent producing microstate D in at least one of the three conditions (p < 0.05). Significant between-subjects across-sessions results showed an increase of 0.42 % of time spent producing microstate D in baseline (reflecting a sustained change in the resting state), 1.93 % of increase during regulation and 1.83 % during transfer. Within-session analysis (performed in baseline and regulation trials only) showed a significant 1.65 % increase in baseline and 0.53 % increase in regulation. These values are in a range that is expected to have an impact upon psychotic experiences. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between alpha power and microstate D contribution during neurofeedback training. Given that microstate D has been related to attentional processes, this result provides further evidence that the training was to some degree specific for the attentional network. We conclude that microstate-neurofeedback training proved feasible in healthy subjects. The implementation of the same protocol in schizophrenia patients may promote skills useful to reduce positive symptoms by means of EEG-neurofeedback.

Despite the large number of studies having been carried out to evaluate its effectiveness, it is widely elusive what neuronal mechanisms related to the core symptoms of ADHD are modulated by neurofeedback. 19 children with ADHD undergoing 8 weeks of theta/beta neurofeedback and 17 waiting list controls performed a Go/Nogo task in a pre-post design. We used neurophysiological measures combining high-density EEG recording with source localization analyses using sLORETA. Compared to the waiting list ADHD control group, impulsive behaviour measured was reduced after neurofeedback treatment. The effects of neurofeedback were very specific for situations requiring inhibitory control over responses. The neurophysiological data shows that processes of perceptual gating, attentional selection and resource allocation processes were not affected by neurofeedback. Rather, neurofeedback effects seem to be based on the modulation of response inhibition processes in medial frontal cortices. The study shows that specific neuronal mechanisms underlying impulsivity are modulated by theta/beta neurofeedback in ADHD. The applied neurofeedback protocol could be particularly suitable to address inhibitory control. The study validates assumed functional neuroanatomical target regions of an established neurofeedback protocol on a neurophysiological level.

Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene variant moderates neural index of cognitive disruption during nicotine withdrawal	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alpha-1; cannabinoid; CNR1; cognitive control; EEG; ERP; genetics; nicotine withdrawal; smoking	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG; ANTAGONIST; DEPENDENCE; POLYMORPHISMS; ASSOCIATION; DEPRIVATION; CHILDREN; SMOKERS	Nicotine withdrawal-related disruption of cognitive control may contribute to the reinforcement of tobacco use. Identification of gene variants that predict this withdrawal phenotype may lead to tailored pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Variation on the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1) has been related to nicotine dependence, and CNR1 antagonists may increase attention and memory functioning. We targeted CNR1 variants as moderators of a validated neural marker of nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption. CNR1 polymorphisms comprising the TAG' haplotype (rs806379, rs1535255 and rs2023239) were tested independently, as no participants in this sample possessed this haplotype. Nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption was indexed as increased resting electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha-1 power density across 17 electrodes. Seventy-three Caucasian Non-Hispanic smokers (15 cigarettes per day) visited the laboratory on two occasions following overnight smoking/nicotine deprivation. Either two nicotine or two placebo cigarettes were smoked prior to collecting EEG data at each session. Analyses showed that rs806379 moderated the effects of nicotine deprivation increasing slow wave EEG (P = 0.004). Smokers homozygous for the major allele exhibited greater nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption. The current findings suggest potential efficacy of cannabinoid receptor antagonism as a pharmacotherapy approach for smoking cessation among individuals who exhibit greater nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption.

Opposite effects of cannabis and cocaine on performance monitoring	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabis; Cocaine; Performance monitoring; Error-related negative; Error positivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INHIBITORY CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; ANTISACCADE TASK; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ERROR; COMPONENTS; BRAIN	Drug use is often associated with risky and unsafe behavior. However, the acute effects of cocaine and cannabis on performance monitoring processes have not been systematically investigated. The aim of the current study was to investigate how administration of these drugs alters performance monitoring processes, as reflected in the error-related negativity (ERN), the error positivity (Pe) and post-error slowing. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized three-way crossover design was used. Sixty-one subjects completed a Flanker task while EEG measures were obtained. Subjects showed diminished ERN and Pe amplitudes after cannabis administration and increased ERN and Pe amplitudes after administration of cocaine. Neither drug affected post-error slowing. These results demonstrate diametrically opposing effects on the early and late phases of performance monitoring of the two most commonly used illicit drugs of abuse. Conversely, the behavioral adaptation phase of performance monitoring remained unaltered by the drugs. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Movement-related phase locking in the delta-theta frequency band	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Finger tapping; Movement initiation; Voluntary motor action; Externally triggered motor action	MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; ACTIVATION; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; ARTIFACTS; DYNAMICS	Movements result from a complex interplay of multiple brain regions. These regions are assembled into distinct functional networks depending on the specific properties of the action. However, the nature and details of the dynamics of this complex assembly process are unknown. In this study, we sought to identify key markers of the neural processes underlying the preparation and execution of motor actions that always occur irrespective of differences in movement initiation, hence the specific neural processes and functional networks involved. To this end, EEG activity was continuously recorded from 18 right-handed healthy participants while they performed a simple motor task consisting of button presses with the left or right index finger. The movement was performed either in response to a visual cue or at a self-chosen, i.e., non-cued point in time. Despite these substantial differences in movement initiation, dynamic properties of the EEG signals common to both conditions could be identified using time-frequency and phase locking analysis of the EEG data. In both conditions, a significant phase locking effect was observed that started prior to the movement onset in the delta-theta frequency band (2-7 Hz), and that was strongest at the electrodes nearest to the contralateral motor region (M1). This phase locking effect did not have a counterpart in the corresponding power spectra (i.e., amplitudes), or in the event-related potentials. Our finding suggests that phase locking in the delta-theta frequency band is a ubiquitous movement-related signal independent of how the actual movement has been initiated. We therefore suggest that phase-locked neural oscillations in the motor cortex are a prerequisite for the preparation and execution of motor actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The potential of science educational neuroscience is to bridge the gap of research trends, methodologies, and applications between science education and neuroscience, and to translate research challenges into opportunities. In this area, researchers combine science education and the fundamental techniques of cognitive neuroscience such as electroencephalograms (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide specific and objective suggestions to science learners, educators, and curriculum designers. In recent years, a lot of educational neuroscience researchers have focused on students' cognitive abilities and emotions by analyzing neuroscience data. However, few studies have highlighted students' science learning abilities and strategies by engaging neuroscience. Furthermore, the orientations of methodology, data analysis, and philosophy differ between science education and neuroscience. Although there are many research challenges to face, there are some studies that provide practical implications for engaging neuroscience in science education.

For nonnegative multiway array data analysis, we propose a nonnegative TT (NTT) decomposition algorithm for the NTT model and a hybrid model called the NTT-Tucker model. By employing the hierarchical alternating least squares approach, each fiber vector of core tensors is optimized efficiently at each iteration. We compared the performances of the proposed method with a standard nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) algorithm by using benchmark data sets including event-related potential data and facial image data in multi-domain feature extraction and clustering tasks. It is illustrated that the proposed algorithm extracts physically meaningful features with relatively low storage and computational costs compared to the standard NTD model.

The literature that assesses CRN and ERN in psychopathy is still limited and findings are mixed. However, a dimensional probabilistic analysis of psychopathy is promising and might clarify the inconsistent results systematically found in taxonomic models. Grounded on previous research it is hypothesised that impaired ERN and CRN modulation would be specifically related to disinhibition traits (and not boldness). A community sample assessed by Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) performed the Simon's task during an EEG recording session. Confirming our hypothesis, disinhibition predicted ERN reduced amplitude and increased latency. The lack of endogenous feedback from errors may explain the high incidence of disruptive behaviour in impulsive individuals. An opposite pattern was found for boldness scores, suggesting that enhanced ERN amplitude may explain high social efficiency in boldness traits. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report this main dissociation. CRN was not predicted by psychopathic traits, supporting that ERN and CRN components point to independent processes of behaviour monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Manuel, AL; Schnider, A				Manuel, Aurelie L.; Schnider, Armin			Differential processing of immediately repeated verbal and non-verbal stimuli: an evoked-potential study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consolidation; electroencephalographic; episodic memory; source localization; spatio-temporal analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MATERIAL-SPECIFIC LATERALIZATION; CUED-MEMORY TASKS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RETRIEVAL	Stimuli are better retained in memory if they are repeated after a delay than if they are immediately repeated. This effect is called the spacing effect (SE). Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) studies showed that delayed repetition of meaningful designs in a continuous recognition task induces an evoked response very similar to new presentations. In contrast, immediately repeated designs induced circumscribed, stronger activation of the left medio-temporal lobe (MTL) at 200-300 ms. In amnesic subjects, this signal was missing, indicating that it has a memory-protective effect. Here, high-density EEG was used in humans to explore whether meaningless verbal (non-words) and non-verbal (geometric designs) stimuli also have a SE associated with such lateralized, temporally limited activation of the left MTL upon immediate repetition. The results revealed a SE for both materials. Timing and localization of brain activity differed as a function of stimulus material. Specific responses to immediate repetitions occurred at 200-285 ms for non-verbal stimuli and at 285-380 ms for verbal material. Source estimations revealed increased activity in right inferior frontal areas for immediate non-verbal repetitions and in left fronto-parietal areas for immediate verbal repetition in comparison to new presentations. These findings show that, while the SE is a ubiquitous phenomenon, the neural processes underlying it vary according to stimulus material.

Compensatory Neural Activity in Response to Cognitive Fatigue	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive; event related potential; fatigue; Stroop	MENTAL FATIGUE; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; MODULATION; NETWORK; LOAD; FMRI	Prolonged continuous performance of a cognitively demanding task induces cognitive fatigue and is associated with a time-related deterioration of objective performance, the degree of which is referred to cognitive fatigability. Although the neural underpinnings of cognitive fatigue are poorly understood, prior studies report changes in neural activity consistent with deterioration of task-related networks over time. While compensatory brain activity is reported to maintain motor task performance in the face of motor fatigue and cognitive performance in the face of other stressors (e.g., aging) and structural changes, there are no studies to date demonstrating compensatory activity for cognitive fatigue. High-density electroencephalography was recorded from human subjects during a 160 min continuous performance of a cognitive control task. While most time-varying neural activity showed a linear decline over time, we identified an evoked potential over the anterior frontal region which demonstrated an inverted U-shaped time-on-task profile. This evoked brain activity peaked between 60 and 100 min into the task and was positively associated with better behavioral performance only during this interval. Following the peak and during subsequent decline of this anterior frontal activity, the rate of performance decline also accelerated. These findings demonstrate that this anterior frontal brain activity, which is not part of the primary task-related activity at baseline, is recruited to compensate for fatigue-induced impairments in the primary task-related network, and that this compensation terminates as cognitive fatigue further progresses. These findings may be relevant to understanding individual differences in cognitive fatigability and developing interventions for clinical conditions afflicted by fatigue.

Even if Event Related Potentials can be detected, the EEG band power perturbation and the Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) seems to be the most appropriate way to assess such a brain dynamics. In this study 13 borderline subject with a child maltreatment history were studied in respect to 11 controls without any psychopathologic history. Both group were exposed to the Odd Ball Paradigm and related EEG activities were recorded from 256 electrodes on the scalp. The maltreated people resulted in higher levels of dystimia and worst behavioral performances as well as with a higher emotional dysregulation. Electro-physiological correlates were assessed with a different brain dynamics detected in maltreated group when target stimuli were presented. The results confirm the importance of the PAC and of the assessment of Cross Frequency Modulation (CfM). The results support the role of such a method for clinical diagnostics and suggest an explanation for the use of brain entrainment effect for therapeutic interventions. More over the presence of these oscillatory phenomena and this kind of brain dynamics suggest the compatibility of such results with scale free structures in the brain network architectures, where a small number of hubs, with high connection degrees, are embedded within a large assembly of neurons with low connection degrees.

Subjects were asked to read them silently. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were averaged for each stimulus type, and event related potentials (ERPs) were obtained. The equivalent current dipole source localization (ECDL) method has been applied to these ERPs. In both cases, ECDs were localized to areas related to the working memory for spatial perception, i.e. the right upper or the right middle frontal areas. And the opposite directional arrows had opposite dipoles in these areas. Taking into account these facts, the group recorded EEGs from subjects looking and recalling ten types of images of robot movement presented on a CRT. The group investigated a single trial EEGs of the subject precisely after the latency at 400 ms, and determined effective sampling latencies for the discriminant analysis to ten types of images. They sampled EEG data at latencies from 400 ms to 900 ms at 25 ms intervals by the four channels such as Fp2, F4, C4 and F8. Results of the discriminant analysis with jack knife (cross validation) method for ten type objective varieties, the discriminant rates for three subjects were almost 90 %. We could control a micro robot with ten commands only to recall corresponding movement image.

Training leads to increased auditory brain-computer interface performance of end-users with motor impairments	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Assistive technology; Communication; Brain-computer interfaces; End-user evaluation	P300 SPELLING SYSTEM; LOCKED-IN STATE; CENTERED DESIGN; COMMUNICATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; IMPLEMENTATION; TRANSITION; PLASTICITY; SCLEROSIS	Objective: Auditory brain-computer interfaces are an assistive technology that can restore communication for motor impaired end-users. Such non-visual brain-computer interface paradigms are of particular importance for end-users that may lose or have lost gaze control. We attempted to show that motor impaired end-users can learn to control an auditory speller on the basis of event-related potentials. Methods: Five end-users with motor impairments, two of whom with additional visual impairments, participated in five sessions. We applied a newly developed auditory brain-computer interface paradigm with natural sounds and directional cues. Results: Three of five end-users learned to select symbols using this method. Averaged over all five endusers the information transfer rate increased by more than 1800% from the first session (0.17 bits/min) to the last session (3.08 bits/min). The two best end-users achieved information transfer rates of 5.78 bits/ min and accuracies of 92%. Conclusions: Our results show that an auditory BCI with a combination of natural sounds and directional cues, can be controlled by end-users with motor impairment. Training improves the performance of endusers to the level of healthy controls. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first time end-users with motor impairments controlled an auditory brain-computer interface speller with such high accuracy and information transfer rates. Further, our results demonstrate that operating a BCI with event-related potentials benefits from training and specifically end-users may require more than one session to develop their full potential.

Electrophysiological Evidence for Alternative Motor Networks in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta oscillations; Parkinson's disease; REM sleep behavior disorder; sleep; subthalamic nucleus	PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT	Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show mostly unimpaired motor behavior during REM sleep, which contrasts strongly to coexistent nocturnal bradykinesia. The reason for this sudden amelioration of motor control in REM sleep is unknown, however. We set out to determine whether movements during REM sleep are processed by different motor networks than movements in the waking state. We recorded local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and scalp EEG (modified 10/20 montage) during sleep in humans withPDand RBD. Time-locked event-related beta band oscillations were calculated during movements in REMsleep compared with movements in the waking state and during NREM sleep. Spectral analysis of STN local field potentials revealed elevated beta power during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep and beta power in REM sleep reached levels similar as in the waking state. Event-related analysis showed time-locked beta desynchronization during WAKE movements. In contrast, we found significantly elevated beta activity before and during movements in REM sleep and NREM sleep. Corticosubthalamic coherence was reduced during REM and NREM movements. We conclude that sleep-related movements are not processed by the same corticobasal ganglia network as movements in the waking state. Therefore, the well-known seemingly normal motor performance during RBD in PD patients might be generated by activating alternative motor networks for movement initiation. These findings support the hypothesis that pathological movement-inhibiting basal ganglia networks in PD patients are bypassed during sleep.

Vocal and Neural Responses to Unexpected Changes in Voice Pitch Auditory Feedback During Register Transitions	JOURNAL OF VOICE			English	Article						Voice; Pitch shift; Register; EEG; ERPs	ERROR-DETECTION; MAGNITUDE; SPEECH; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; INTENSITY; TRACT	Objective/Hypothesis. It is known that singers are able to control their voice to maintain a relatively constant vocal quality while transitioning between vocal registers; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect are not understood. It was hypothesized that greater attention to the acoustical feedback of the voice and increased control of the vocal musculature during register transitions compared with singing within a register would be represented as neurological differences in event-related potentials. Study Design/Methods. Nine singers sang musical notes at the high end of the modal register (the boundary between the modal and the head/falsetto registers) and at the low end (the boundary between the modal and the fry/pulse registers). While singing, the pitch of the voice auditory feedback was unexpectedly shifted either into the adjacent register ("toward" the register boundary) or within the modal register ("away from" the boundary). Singers were instructed to maintain a constant pitch and ignore any changes to their voice feedback. Results. Vocal response latencies and magnitude of the accompanying N1 and P2 event-related potentials were greatest at the lower (modal-to-fry) boundary when the pitch shift carried the subjects' voices into the fry register as opposed to remaining within the modal register. Conclusions. These findings suggest that when a singer lowers the pitch of his or her voice such that it enters the fry register from the modal register, there is increased sensory-motor control of the voice, reflected as increased magnitude of the neural potentials to help minimize qualitative changes in the voice.

J	Euler, MJ; Niermeyer, MA; Suchy, Y				Euler, Matthew J.; Niermeyer, Madison A.; Suchy, Yana			Neurocognitive and Neurophysiological Correlates of Motor Planning During Familiar and Novel Contexts	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						action planning; executive functioning; motor sequencing; movement-related cortical potentials; novelty	SCALE-ELECTRONIC VERSION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TURN-TAPTAP TASK; AREA SYNDROME; SUPPLEMENTARY; READINESS; MOVEMENTS; VOLUNTARY; ATTENTION; TIME	Objective: Research suggests that behavioral indices of motor planning (i.e., latencies that precede motor output) (a) relate to processing speed (PS) and executive functioning (EF), but not working memory (WM), and (b) deteriorate in novel contexts. It is not clear whether an electrophysiological index of motor planning (i.e., movement-related cortical potentials; MRCPs) also relates to PS and EF, and whether it deteriorates in novel contexts. This study sought to clarify associations among these variables while manipulating contextual novelty. Method: Forty healthy adults completed standardized measures of PS, EF, and WM. Participants performed highly familiar motor sequences in familiar versus novel contexts during EEG recording, while motor planning latencies and peak MRCPs were obtained. Hierarchical regressions assessed the relative contributions of PS, EF, and WM to motor planning latencies and MRCPs. Results: Novel contexts elicited longer planning latencies (g(av) = 1.96) and reduced MRCPs (g(av) = .24) compared to familiar contexts. PS predicted planning times in both familiar (R-2 = .12) and novel contexts (R-2 = .15), while EF contributed additional variance during novel contexts only (R-2 Change = .10). EF was the sole predictor of MRCPs in both familiar (R-2 = .12) and novel contexts (R-2 = .18). WM did not predict planning latencies or MRCPs. Conclusions: Contextual novelty alone can decrease performance and neural activation during complex sequencing. The general link between preparatory activation and EF suggests that capacity limitations drive novelty effects, and implies a common substrate underlying motor planning and higher-order behavioral control.

Such MMIs make use of a virtual environment and can therefore make the operator immerse him-/herself into the environment of the robot. In this paper, we present our developed MMI for multi-robot control. Our MMI can adapt to changes in task load and task engagement online. Applying our approach of embedded Brain Reading we improve user support and efficiency of interaction. The level of task engagement was inferred from the single-trial detectability of P300-related brain activity that was naturally evoked during interaction. With our approach no secondary task is needed to measure task load. It is based on research results on the single-stimulus paradigm, distribution of brain resources and its effect on the P300 event-related component. It further considers effects of the modulation caused by a delayed reaction time on the P300 component evoked by complex responses to task-relevant messages. We prove our concept using single-trial based machine learning analysis, analysis of averaged event-related potentials and behavioral analysis. As main results we show (1) a significant improvement of runtime needed to perform the interaction tasks compared to a setting in which all subjects could easily perform the tasks. We show that (2) the single-trial detectability of the event-related potential P300 can be used to measure the changes in task load and task engagement during complex interaction while also being sensitive to the level of experience of the operator and (3) can be used to adapt the MMI individually to the different needs of users without increasing total workload. Our online adaptation of the proposed MMI is based on a continuous supervision of the operator's cognitive resources by means of embedded Brain Reading. Operators with different qualifications or capabilities receive only as many tasks as they can perform to avoid mental overload as well as mental underload.

J	Li, P; Baker, TE; Warren, C; Li, H				Li, Peng; Baker, Travis E.; Warren, Chris; Li, Hong			Oscillatory profiles of positive, negative and neutral feedback stimuli during adaptive decision making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Theta; Beta-gamma; Feedback-related negativity; Neutral feedback; Reinforcement learning	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; REWARD PREDICTION ERROR; GAMMA ACTIVITY; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; DELTA; EXPECTATION; ADAPTATION; MODEL; TASK	The electrophysiological response to positive and negative feedback during reinforcement learning has been well documented over the past two decades, yet, little is known about the neural response to uninformative events that often follow our actions. To address this issue, we recorded the electroencephalograph (EEG) during a time-estimation task using both informative (positive and negative) and uninformative (neutral) feedback. In the time-frequency domain, uninformative feedback elicited significantly less induced beta-gamma activity than informative feedback. This result suggests that beta-gamma activity is particularly sensitive to feedback that can guide behavioral adjustments, consistent with other work. In contrast, neither theta nor delta activity were sensitive to the difference between negative and neutral feedback, though both frequencies discriminated between positive, and non-positive (neutral or negative) feedback. Interestingly, in the time domain, we observed a linear relationship in the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (neutral > negative > positive), a component of the event-related brain potential thought to index a specific kind of reinforcement learning signal called a reward prediction error. Taken together, these results suggest that the reinforcement learning system treats neutral feedback as a special case, providing valuable information about the electrophysiological measures used to index the cognitive function of frontal midline cortex.

In the past few years there has been a growing interest in studying brain functioning in natural, real-life situations. Mobile EEG allows to study the brain in real unconstrained environments but it faces the intrinsic challenge that it is impossible to disentangle observed changes in brain activity due to increase in cognitive demands by the complex natural environment or due to the physical involvement. In this work we aim to disentangle the influence of cognitive demands and distractions that arise from such outdoor unconstrained recordings. Approach. We evaluate the ERP and single trial characteristics of a three-class auditory oddball paradigm recorded in outdoor scenario's while peddling on a fixed bike or biking freely around. In addition we also carefully evaluate the trial specific motion artifacts through independent gyro measurements and control for muscle artifacts. Main results. A decrease in P300 amplitude was observed in the free biking condition as compared to the fixed bike conditions. Above chance P300 single-trial classification in highly dynamic real life environments while biking outdoors was achieved. Certain significant artifact patterns were identified in the free biking condition, but neither these nor the increase in movement (as derived from continuous gyrometer measurements) can explain the differences in classification accuracy and P300 waveform differences with full clarity. The increased cognitive load in real-life scenarios is shown to play a major role in the observed differences. Significance. Our findings suggest that auditory oddball results measured in natural real-life scenarios are influenced mainly by increased cognitive load due to being in an unconstrained environment.

We recorded high-density event-related potentials while 3-month-old infants were listening to trials consisting of CV syllables produced with different vowels (/bX/ or /gX/). The consonant remained the same for the first three syllables, followed (or not) by a change in the fourth position. A consonant change evoked a significant difference around the second auditory peak (400-600ms) relative to control trials. This mismatch response demonstrates that the infants robustly categorized the consonant despite coarticulation that blurs the phonetic cues, and at an age at which they do not produce these consonants themselves. This response was obtained even when infants had no visual articulatory information to help them to track the consonant repetition. In combination with previous studies establishing categorical perception and normalization across speakers, this result demonstrates that preverbal infants already have abstract phonetic representation integrating over acoustical features in the first months of life.

In the learning phase, participants viewed a target individual's face (expression neutral or faint smile) paired with either negative, neutral or positive sentences describing previous typical behavior of the target. In the following EEG testing phase, participants completed gender judgments of the learned faces. Statistical analyses were conducted on measures of neural activity during the gender judgment task. Repeated measures ANOVA of FRP data showed that faces described as having a negative personality elicited larger N170 than did those with a neutral or positive description. The early posterior negativity (EPN) showed the same result pattern, with larger amplitudes for faces paired with negative personality than for others. The size of the late positive potential was larger for faces paired with positive personality than for those with neutral and negative personality. The current study indicates that affective personality information is associated with an automatic, top down modulation on face processing.

Oddball paradigms are used in BCI to generate Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), like the P300 response, on targets selected by the user. A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300, allows the user to spell characters. The P300 speller is divided into in two classification problems. The first classification is for detect P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The second one for determining the desired symbol by user. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). The architecture of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 response in the time domain. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature extraction. These models are tested and compared on the Data set III of BCI competition (2004). The proposed approach provides also a new way for analyzing brain activities due to the receptive field of the RBFNN models.

These regions constitute the limbic structure in non-conscious perception of emotions and modulate cortical activity either directly or indirectly(2). In contrast, the conscious representation of emotions is more pronounced in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex for directing voluntary attention to details in faces(3,4). Asperger's syndrome (AS)(5,6) represents an atypical mental disturbance that affects sensory, affective and communicative abilities, without interfering with normal linguistic skills and intellectual ability. Several studies have found that functional deficits in the neural circuitry important for facial emotion recognition can partly explain social communication failure in patients with AS(7-9). In order to clarify the interplay between conscious and non-conscious representations of emotional faces in AS, an EEG experimental protocol is designed with two tasks involving emotionality evaluation of either photograph or line-drawing faces. A pilot study is introduced for selecting face stimuli that minimize the differences in reaction times and scores assigned to facial emotions between the pretested patients with AS and IQ/gender-matched healthy controls. Information from the pretested patients was used to develop the scoring system used for the emotionality evaluation. Research into facial emotions and visual stimuli with different spatial frequency contents has reached discrepant findings depending on the demographic characteristics of participants and task demands(2). The experimental protocol is intended to clarify deficits in patients with AS in processing emotional faces when compared with healthy controls by controlling for factors unrelated to recognition of facial emotions, such as task difficulty, IQ and gender.

EEG beta power and heart rate variability describe the association between cortical and autonomic arousals across sleep	AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC & CLINICAL			English	Article						Cortical arousal; Autonomic arousal; Heart rate variability; NREM sleep; REM sleep; Beta power	PERIODIC LEG MOVEMENTS; CARDIAC ACTIVATION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; TIME; FRAGMENTATION; STIMULATION; WAKEFULNESS; HIERARCHY; PRESSURE; APNEA	Cortical and autonomic arousals have been found to be closely associated. As arousal events are not evenly dispersed across sleep, we hypothesized the relationship between high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) power and autonomic arousal indices differ between non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. One night of polysomnographic recording was performed on a group of 18 subjects using a portable recorder. The EEG was collected from C3/Fz. Sleep stages and cortical arousals were visually scored. Cardiac autonomic modulation was assessed from heart rate variability, where the high frequency power (HF) indicates parasympathetic modulation, and the low frequency to high frequency power ratio (LF/HF) represents sympathetic modulation. During NREM sleep, EEG beta power was significantly correlated with LF/HF (r = 0.40 +/- 0.06), and the relationships were more positive than during REM sleep (LF/HF: r = 0.20 +/- 0.08; EOG power: r = -0.13 +/- 0.05). The relationship of beta power with LF/HF was associated with the incidence of cortical arousal, particularly during NREM sleep. With respect to alpha power, it was only marginally related to HF or LF/HF. In addition, the coefficients of determination were lower for alpha power than for beta power in terms of the relationships to HF, LF/HF and EOG power. This study shows a higher relationship between cortical and autonomic activation during NREM sleep, and the association is better described by beta power. This finding suggests NREM sleep may be of greater therapeutic potential in view of reducing cardiovascular disease associated with sleep fragmentation, and beta power may provide a better index to evaluate the effect.

Five consistently identified major trait dimensions, also referred to as "big five" (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), are considered to account for virtually all personality variances in both healthy people and those with psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present study was, for the first time, to establish the link between 40-Hz ASSR and "big five" major personality trait dimensions in young healthy adults. Ninety-four young healthy volunteers participated (38 males and 56 females; mean age +/- A SD 22.180 +/- A 2.75). The 40-Hz click trains were presented for each subject 30 times with an inter-train interval of 1-1.5 s. The EEG responses were recorded from F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz and P4 locations according to 10/20 electrode placement system. Phase-locking index (PLI) and event-related power perturbation (ERSP) were calculated, each providing the following characteristics: peak time, entrainment frequency, peak value and mean value. For assessing "big five" personality traits, NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R) was used. No significant correlation between 40-Hz ASSR PLI or ERSP and "big five" personality traits was observed. Our results indicate that there is no dependence between 40-Hz ASSR entrainment and personality traits, demonstrating low individual 40-Hz variability in this domain. Our results support further development of 40-Hz ASSR as a neurophysiological marker allowing distinguishing between healthy population and patients with psychiatric disorders.

Prior behavioral studies with younger and older adults have yielded mixed findings with respect to age differences in three putative attention networks (alerting, orienting, and executive control). To overcome the limitations of behavioral data, the current study combined behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Twenty-four healthy younger adults (aged 18-29 years) and 24 healthy older adults (aged 60-76 years) completed the ANT while EEG data were recorded. Behaviorally, older adults showed reduced alerting, but did not differ from younger adults in orienting or executive control. Electrophysiological components related to alerting and orienting (P1, N1, and CNV) were similar in both age groups, whereas components related to executive control (N2 and P3) showed age-related differences. Together these results suggest that comparisons of network effects between age groups using behavioral data alone may not offer a complete picture of age differences in selective attention, especially for alerting and executive control networks.

In the healthy population, face-inversion leads to stronger negative amplitudes and prolonged latencies of the N170, effects not being present in patients with autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD). ASD has frequently been associated with differences in oxytocinergic neurotransmission. This ERP-study aimed to investigate the face-inversion effect in association with oxytocinergic candidate genes. It was expected that risk-allele-carriers of the oxytocinreceptor-gene-polymorphism (rs53576) and of CD38 (rs379863) responded similar to upright and inverted faces as persons with ASD. Additionally, reactions to different facial emotional expressions were studied. As there have been difficulties with replications of those molecular genetic association studies, we aimed to replicate our findings in a second study. Method Seventy-two male subjects in the first-, and seventy-eight young male subjects in the replication -study conducted a face-inversion-paradigm, while recording EEG. DNA was extracted from buccal cells. Results Results revealed stronger N170-amplitudes and longer latencies in reaction to inverted faces in comparison to upright ones. Furthermore, effects of emotion on N170 were evident. Those effects were present in the first and in the second study. Whereas we found molecular-genetic associations of oxytocinergic polymorphisms with the N170 in the first study, we failed to do so in the replication sample. Conclusion Results indicate that a deeper theoretical understanding of this research-field is needed, in order to generate possible explanations for these findings. Results, furthermore, support the hypotheses that success of reproducibility is correlated with strength of lower original p values and larger effect sizes in the original study.	[Munk, Aisha J.

These neural responses have been investigated with functional MRI and EEG in numerous studies, which have reported face-selective activations in the occipital-temporal cortex and an electrophysiological face-selective response that peaks 170 ms after stimulus onset at occipital-temporal sites. Evidence for face-selective processes has also been consistently reported in cognitive studies, which investigated the face inversion effect, the composite face effect and the left visual field (LVF) superiority. These cognitive effects indicate that the perceptual representation that we generate for faces differs from the representation that is generated for inverted faces or non-face objects. In this review, I will show that the fMRI and ERP face-selective responses are strongly associated with these three well-established behavioral face-selective measures. I will further review studies that examined the relationship between fMRI and EEG face-selective measures suggesting that they are strongly linked. Taken together these studies imply that a holistic representation of a face is generated at 170 ms after stimulus onset over the right hemisphere. These findings, which reveal a strong link between the various and complementary cognitive and neural measures of face processing, allow to characterize where, when and how faces are represented during the first 200 ms of face processing.

Multidisciplinary investigation links backward-speech trait and working memory through genetic mutation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NEURAL BASIS; RIC-3; LANGUAGE; REPRESENTATION; INTERFERENCE; INVOLVEMENT; PERCEPTION; RECEPTORS; FREQUENCY; BLOCKADE	Case studies of unusual traits can provide unique snapshots of the effects of modified systems. In this study, we report on an individual from a Serbian family with the ability to rapidly, accurately and voluntarily speak backwards. We consider psychological, neural and genetic correlates of this trait to identify specific relevant neural mechanisms and new molecular pathways for working memory and speech-related tasks. EEG data suggest that the effect of word reversal precedes semantic integration of visually presented backward-words, and that event-related potentials above the frontal lobe are affected by both word reversal and the maintenance of backward-words in working memory. fMRI revealed that the left fusiform gyrus may facilitate the production of backward-speech. Exome sequencing identified three novel coding variants of potential significance in the RIC3, RIPK1 and ZBED5 genes. Taken together, our data suggest that, in this individual, the ability to speak backwards is afforded by an extraordinary working memory capacity. We hypothesise that this is served by cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain to the frontal cortex and supported by visual semantic loops within the left fusiform gyrus and that these neural processes may be mediated by a genetic mutation in RIC3; a chaperone for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

We address this question by combining subjective behavioral and objective neurochemical and neurophysiologica I measures. The present study involved 21 stabilized and mildly symptomatic patients with schizophrenia and 21 control subjects. We applied electrical stimulations below the pain threshold and assessed sensations of pain and unpleasantness with rating scales, and Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs/EEG). We also measured attention, two neurochemical stress indices (ACTH/cortisol), and subjective VEPs/EEG responses to visual emotional stimuli. Our results revealed that, subjectively, patients' evaluations do not differ from controls. However, the amplitude of EEG evoked potentials was greater in patients than controls as early as 50 ms after electrical stimulations and beyond one second after visual processing of emotional pictures. Such responses could not be linked to the stress induced by the stimulations, since stress hormone levels were stable.

The experiential blink: Mapping the cost of working memory encoding onto conscious perception in the attentional blink	CORTEX			English	Article						Attention; Consciousness; Electroencephalography; P300; Subjective visibility	TEMPORAL ATTENTION; AWARENESS; P3; ACCESS; PROBABILITY; POTENTIALS; SIGNATURES; EVENTS; MODEL; TASK	The attentional blink (AB) represents a cognitive deficit in reporting the second of two targets (T2), when that second target appears 200-600 msec after the first (T1). However, it is unclear how this paradigm impacts the subjective visibility (that is, the conscious perception) of T2, and whether the temporal profile of T2 report accuracy matches the temporal profile of subjective visibility. In order to compare report accuracy and subjective visibility, we asked participants to identify T1 and T2, and to rate the subjective visibility of T2 across two experiments. Event-related potentials were also measured. The results revealed different profiles for the report of T2 versus the subjective visibility of T2, particularly when T1 and T2 appeared within 200 msec of one another. Specifically, T2 report accuracy was high but T2 visibility was low when the two targets appeared in close temporal succession, suggesting what we call the Experiential Blink is different from the classic AB. Electrophysiologically, at lag-1, the P3 component was modulated more by subjective visibility than by report accuracy. Collectively, the data indicate that the deficit in accurately reporting T2 is not the same as the deficit in subjectively experiencing T2. This suggests that traditional understandings of the AB may require adjustment and that, consistent with other findings, working memory (WM) encoding and conscious perception may not be synonymous.

We combined eye-tracking and EEG to systematically investigate the impact of all three factors on brain-electric activity during reading. Participants read lists of words either actively with eye movements (eliciting fixation-related potentials) or maintained fixation while the text moved passively through foveal vision at a matched pace (RSVP-with-flankers paradigm, eliciting ERPs). The preview of the upcoming word was manipulated by changing the number of parafoveally visible letters. Processing load was varied by presenting words of varying lexical frequency. We found that all three factors have strong interactive effects on the brain's responses to words: Once a word was fixated, occipitotemporal N1 amplitude decreased monotonically with the amount of parafoveal information available during the preceding fixation; hence, the N1 component was markedly attenuated under reading conditions with preview. Importantly, this preview effect was substantially larger during active reading (with saccades) than during passive RSVP with flankers, suggesting that the execution of eye movements facilitates word recognition by increasing parafoveal preprocessing. Lastly, we found that the N1 component elicited by a word also reflects the lexical processing load imposed by the previously inspected word. Together, these results demonstrate that, under more natural conditions, words are recognized in a spatiotemporally distributed and interdependent manner across multiple eye fixations, a process that is mediated by active motor behavior.

Here we use continuous telemetric electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake active rat pups to map functional nociceptive processing in the developing brain over the first 4 weeks of life. Cross-sectional and longitudinal recordings show that baseline S1 ECoG energy increases steadily with age, with a distinctive beta component replaced by a distinctive theta component in week 3. Event-related potentials were evoked by brief noxious hindpaw skin stimulation at all ages tested, confirming the presence of functional nociceptive spinothalamic inputs in S1. However, hindpaw incision, which increases pain sensitivity at all ages, did not increase S1 ECoG energy until week 3. A significant increase in gamma (20-50 Hz) energy occurred in the presence of skin incision at week 3 accompanied by a longer-lasting increase in theta (4-8Hz) energy at week 4. Continuous ECoG recording demonstrates specific postnatal functional stages in the maturation of S1 cortical nociception. Somatosensory cortical coding of an ongoing pain "state" in awake rat pups becomes apparent between 2 and 4 weeks of age.

J	Weiner, OM; Thien, TDV				Weiner, Oren M.; Thien Thanh Dang-Vu			Spindle Oscillations in Sleep Disorders: A Systematic Review	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; ALTERNATING PATTERN CAP; RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; EEG POWER SPECTRA; NREM SLEEP; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; PRIMARY INSOMNIA; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION	Measurement of sleep microarchitecture and neural oscillations is an increasingly popular technique for quantifying EEG sleep activity. Many studies have examined sleep spindle oscillations in sleep-disordered adults; however reviews of this literature are scarce. As such, our overarching aim was to critically review experimental studies examining sleep spindle activity between adults with and without different sleep disorders. Articles were obtained using a systematic methodology with a priori criteria. Thirty-seven studies meeting final inclusion criteria were reviewed, with studies grouped across three categories: insomnia, hypersomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders (including parasomnias). Studies of patients with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing were more abundant relative to other diagnoses. All studies were cross-sectional. Studies were largely inconsistent regarding spindle activity differences between clinical and nonclinical groups, with some reporting greater or less activity, while many others reported no group differences. Stark inconsistencies in sample characteristics (e.g., age range and diagnostic criteria) and methods of analysis (e.g., spindle bandwidth selection, visual detection versus digital filtering, absolute versus relative spectral power, and NREM2 versus NREM3) suggest a need for greater use of event-based detection methods and increased research standardization. Hypotheses regarding the clinical and empirical implications of these findings, and suggestions for potential future studies, are also discussed.

However, smoking-related long-term effects on brain function remain largely uncertain. Previous studies suggest that nicotine affects serotonergic signaling, and the intensity dependence (alias loudness dependence) of the auditory evoked N1-P2 potential has been proposed as a marker of serotonergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we assesed the effects of chronic smoking on amplitude and intensity dependence of the auditory evoked N1-P2 potential. Subjects underwent a 15-min intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IAEP) paradigm. From N = 1739 eligible subjects (40-79 years), we systematically matched current smokers, ex-smokers, and never-smokers by sex, age, alcohol and caffeine consumption, and socioeconomic status. Between-group differences and potential dose-dependencies were evaluated. Analyses revealed higher N1-P2 amplitudes and intensity dependencies in never-smokers relative to ex- and current smokers, with ex-smokers exhibiting intermediate intensity dependencies. Moreover, we observed pack years and number of cigarettes consumed per day to be inversely correlated with amplitudes in current smokers. According to the IAEP serotonin hypothesis, our results suggest serotonin activity to be highest in current smokers, intermediate in ex-smokers, and lowest in never-smokers. To our knowledge, the present study is the first providing evidence for a dose-dependent reduction in N1-P2 amplitudes. Further, we extend prior research by showing reduced amplitudes and intensity dependencies in ex-smokers even 25 years, on average, after cessation. While we can rule out several smoking-related confounders to bias observed associations, causal inferences remain to be established by future longitudinal studies.

Nicotine-induced cortical activation among nonsmokers with moderation by trait cognitive control	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotine; Smoking; EEG; Personality; Cognitive control	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; WORKING-MEMORY; RESTING EEG; SMOKERS; PERFORMANCE; NORMALIZATION; DEPRIVATION; INVOLVEMENT	Considerable research suggests that nicotine enhances cognitive control-related processes (e.g., attention, memory) among nicotine-deprived smokers, both in terms of behavior and neural indices (e.g., ERP, slow-wave EEG). Nicotine may also increase cognitive control among nonsmokers, and this may vary as a function of trait cognitive control. It is important to examine the effects of nicotine on cognitive control-related processes among nonsmokers as these effects may provide a path for the initiation of smoking. The objectives of the study were to examine in nonsmokers (1) the effect of nicotine on resting cortical activity, an indirect measure of cognitive control, and (2) trait cognitive control as a moderator of nicotine-induced cortical activity changes. Eighty participants were given placebo and 7-mg nicotine patches in separate sessions for this counter-balanced, double-blind, within-subject study. Resting cortical activity was measured with EEG for a 3-min period with eyes opened. Average alpha-1 band power density values in frontal and central regions were lower during the nicotine versus placebo condition, which provides evidence of nicotine-induced cortical activation. Furthermore, those with lower self-reported cognitive control exhibited greater nicotine-induced reductions in alpha-1 power density values. These individual differences in nicotine-induced cortical activation are consistent with a model of nicotine self-medication whereby individuals with lower cognitive control may find smoking more reinforcing via amelioration of related cognitive deficits.

Brain laterality, depression and anxiety disorders: New findings for emotional and verbal dichotic listening in individuals at risk for depression	LATERALITY			English	Article						Depression; anxiety disorders; risk for depression; laterality; dichotic listening	PERCEPTUAL ASYMMETRY DIFFERENCES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CEREBRAL LATERALITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RELIABILITY; PARENTS; AROUSAL; EEG; GRANDCHILDREN	Studies using dichotic listening tests and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of hemispheric asymmetry have reported evidence of abnormal brain laterality in patients having depressive disorders. We present new findings from a multigenerational study of risk for depression, in which perceptual asymmetry was measured in dichotic listening tests of emotional and verbal processing. Biological offspring and grandchildren of probands with a major depressive disorder (MDD) who were at high risk and those of nondepressed controls who were at low risk were tested on dichotic emotional recognition and consonant-vowel syllable tests. In the emotion test, individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of MDD had a smaller right hemisphere advantage than those without a MDD, but there was no difference between high- and low-risk groups or between those with or without an anxiety disorder. In the syllable test, a smaller left hemisphere advantage was found in individuals with an anxiety disorder compared to those without an anxiety disorder, but there was no difference between high- and low-risk groups or between those with or without a MDD. This double dissociation indicates that lifetime diagnosis of MDD and anxiety disorders have a differential impact on lateralized hemispheric processing of emotional and verbal information.

J	Plewan, T; Wascher, E; Falkenstein, M; Hoffmann, S				Plewan, Thorsten; Wascher, Edmund; Falkenstein, Michael; Hoffmann, Sven			Classifying Response Correctness across Different Task Sets: A Machine Learning Approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; FLANKER TASK	Erroneous behavior usually elicits a distinct pattern in neural waveforms. In particular, inspection of the concurrent recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) typically reveals a negative potential at fronto-central electrodes shortly following a response error (Ne or ERN) as well as an error-awareness-related positivity (Pe). Seemingly, the brain signal contains information about the occurrence of an error. Assuming a general error evaluation system, the question arises whether this information can be utilized in order to classify behavioral performance within or even across different cognitive tasks. In the present study, a machine learning approach was employed to investigate the outlined issue. Ne as well as Pe were extracted from the single-trial EEG signals of participants conducting a flanker and a mental rotation task and subjected to a machine learning classification scheme (via a support vector machine, SVM). Overall, individual performance in the flanker task was classified more accurately, with accuracy rates of above 85%. Most importantly, it was even feasible to classify responses across both tasks. In particular, an SVM trained on the flanker task could identify erroneous behavior with almost 70% accuracy in the EEG data recorded during the rotation task, and vice versa. Summed up, we replicate that the response-related EEG signal can be used to identify erroneous behavior within a particular task. Going beyond this, it was possible to classify response types across functionally different tasks. Therefore, the outlined methodological approach appears promising with respect to future applications.

Quentin			Asymmetries in the representation of space in the human auditory cortex depend on the global stimulus context	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory cortex; cerebral dominance; event-related potentials; human auditory system; lateralization; spatial processing	INTERAURAL TIME; SOUND LOCALIZATION; NEURAL CODE; CHANNELS; DYNAMICS; LOCATION	Studies on humans and other mammals have provided evidence for a two-channel or three-channel representation of horizontal space in the auditory system, with one channel maximally responsive to each of the left hemispace, the right hemispace and, possibly, the midline. Mammalian studies have suggested that the contralateral channel is larger in both cortices, but human studies have found this contralateral preference in only one of the cortices. However, human studies are in conflict as to whether the contralateral preference is in the left or the right auditory cortex, and there are a number of methodological differences that this conflict could be attributed to. A key difference between studies is the duration of the silent interval preceding each stimulus and any perception of sound-source movement that the absence of a silent interval creates. We presented auditory noises that alternated between -90 degrees (left) and +90 degrees (right) and recorded neural responses (event-related potentials) using electroencephalography. We randomly varied the duration of the silent interval preceding each stimulus to create a condition with an immediate (local) stimulus context similar to that used in a study reporting contralateral preference in the left auditory cortex, a condition with a local context similar to that in a study reporting contralateral preference in the right auditory cortex, and an intermediate condition. Surprisingly, we found that both auditory cortices exhibited a similarly strong contralateral preference under all conditions, with responses 27% greater, on average, to the contralateral than the ipsilateral space. This suggests that both the cortices can exhibit a contralateral preference, but whether these preferences manifest depends on the global, rather than the local, stimulus context.

Recent studies suggest that people proactively adjust response parameters in anticipation of a stop signal. In three experiments, we tested the hypothesis that proactive inhibitory control involves adjusting both attentional and response settings, and we explored the relationship with other forms of proactive and anticipatory control. Subjects responded to the color of a stimulus. On some trials, an extra signal occurred. The response to this signal depended on the task context subjects were in: in the 'ignore' context, they ignored it; in the 'stop' context, they had to withhold their response; and in the 'double-response' context, they had to execute a secondary response. An analysis of event-related brain potentials for no signal trials in the stop context revealed that proactive inhibitory control works by biasing the settings of lower-level systems that are involved in stimulus detection, action selection, and action execution. Furthermore, subjects made similar adjustments in the double-response and stop-signal contexts, indicating an overlap between various forms of proactive action control. The results of Experiment 1 also suggest an overlap between proactive inhibitory control and preparatory control in task-switching studies: both require reconfiguration of task-set parameters to bias or alter subordinate processes. We conclude that much of the top-down control in response inhibition tasks takes place before the inhibition signal is presented. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A hallmark of central sensitization is increased mechanical pinprick sensitivity in the area surrounding the injured skin. The aim of the present study was to identify changes in brain activity related to this increased pinprick sensitivity. In 20 healthy volunteers, increased pinprick sensitivity was induced using high frequency electrical stimulation of the forearm skin (HFS). Mechanical pinprick stimulation (64 and 90 mN) was used to elicit event related brain potentials (ERPs). The recordings were performed before, 20 min after and 45 min after applying HFS. The contralateral non-sensitized arm served as control. Pinprick stimulation of 64 mN, but not 90 mN, applied in the area of increased pinprick sensitivity elicited a significant increase of a late-latency positive wave, between 300 and 1100 ms after stimulus onset and was maximal at midline posterior electrodes. Most importantly, this increase in EEG activity followed the time course of the increase in pinprick perception, both being present 20 and 45 min after applying HFS. Our results show that the central sensitization of mechanical nociceptive pathways, manifested behaviorally as increased pinprick sensitivity, is associated with a long-lasting increase in pinprick-evoked brain potentials provided that a 64 mN stimulation intensity is used.

Estimation of a user's interest or search intention is necessary to recommend and retrieve relevant information from these collections. We introduce a brain-information interface used for recommending information by relevance inferred directly from brain signals. In experiments, participants were asked to read Wikipedia documents about a selection of topics while their EEG was recorded. Based on the prediction of word relevance, the individual's search intent was modeled and successfully used for retrieving new relevant documents from the whole English Wikipedia corpus. The results show that the users' interests toward digital content can be modeled from the brain signals evoked by reading. The introduced brain-relevance paradigm enables the recommendation of information without any explicit user interaction and may be applied across diverse information-intensive applications.

This paper presents a novel attempt to remotely control an animal's behavior by human BCI using a hybrid of Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI protocols. The turtle was chosen as the target animal, and we developed a head-mounted display, wireless communication, and a specially designed stimulation device for the turtle. These devices could evoke the turtle's instinctive escape behavior to guide its moving path, and turtles were remotely controlled in both indoor and outdoor environments. The system architecture and design were presented. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, experimental tests were performed under various conditions. Our system could act as a framework for future human-animal interaction systems.

They can be assessed at numerous levels of analysis; here, we review electrophysiological endophenotypes that have shown promise in helping us understand schizophrenia from a more mechanistic point of view. For each endophenotype, we describe typical experimental procedures, reliability, heritability, and reported gene and neurobiological associations. We discuss recent findings regarding the genetic architecture of specific electrophysiological endophenotypes, as well as converging evidence from EEG studies implicating disrupted balance of glutamatergic signaling and GABAergic inhibition in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We conclude that refining the measurement of electrophysiological endophenotypes, expanding genetic association studies, and integrating data sets are important next steps for understanding the mechanisms that connect identified genetic risk loci for schizophrenia to the disease phenotype.

However, it is so far unknown what is the brain dynamics underlying the semantic priming effect induced by music, and its relation to language. To elucidate these issues, we compare the brain oscillatory response to visual words that have been semantically primed either by a musical excerpt or by an auditory sentence. We found that semantic violation between music-word pairs triggers a classical ERP N400, and induces a sustained increase of long-distance theta phase synchrony, along with a transient increase of local gamma activity. Similar results were observed after linguistic semantic violation except for gamma activity, which increased after semantic congruence between sentence-word pairs. Our findings indicate that local gamma activity is a neural marker that signals different ways of semantic processing between music and language, revealing the dynamic and self-organized nature of the semantic processing.

Until now, these different action cascading strategies have, however, not been examined with respect to possible effects of aging. We tackled this question in a systems neurophysiological study using EEG and source localization in healthy older adults and employing mathematical constraints to determine the strategy applied. The results suggest that older adults seem to apply a less efficient strategy when cascading different actions. Compared to younger adults, older adults seem to struggle to hierarchically organize their actions, which leads to an inefficient and more parallel processing of different task goals. On a systems level, the observed deficit is most likely due to an altered processing of task goals at the response selection level (P3 ERP) and related to changes of neural processes in the temporo-parietal junction.

However, the extent to which emotional salience is processed during sleep is unknown. To address this concern, we investigated night sleep in healthy adults regarding brain reactivity to the emotionally (happily, fearfully) spoken meaningless syllables dada, along with correspondingly synthesized nonvocal sounds. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were continuously acquired during an entire night of sleep while we applied a passive auditory oddball paradigm. During all stages of sleep, mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to emotional syllables, which is an index for emotional salience processing of voices, was detected. In contrast, MMN to acoustically matching nonvocal sounds was undetected during Sleep Stage 2 and 3 as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Post-MMN positivity (PMP) was identified with larger amplitudes during Stage 3, and at earlier latencies during REM sleep, relative to wakefulness. These findings clearly demonstrated the neural dynamics of emotional salience processing during the stages of sleep.

The P1-N1-P2 and T-complex to the syllables /pat/ and /sat/ within 70 natural word productions each were examined. EEG was recorded while participants heard nonsense word pairs and performed a syllable identification task to the second word in the pairs. Single trial auditory evoked potentials (AEP) to the first words were analyzed. Results found P1-N1-P2 and T-complex to reflect spectral and temporal feature processing. Also, results identified preliminary benchmarks for single trial response variability for individual subjects for sensory processing between 50 and 600 ms. P1-N1-P2 and T-complex, at least at group level, may serve as phenotypic signatures to identify deficits in spectro-temporal feature recognition and to determine area of deficit, the superior temporal plane or lateral superior temporal gyrus.

J	Mento, G; Vallesi, A				Mento, Giovanni; Vallesi, Antonino			Spatiotemporally dissociable neural signatures for generating and updating expectation over time in children: A High Density-ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Temporal Orienting; Children; N1; CNV; Anticipatory Anterior Index; Brain source reconstruction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; ORIENTING ATTENTION; BRAIN; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; FOREPERIOD; FMRI; EEG; MODULATION	Temporal orienting (TO) is the allocation of attentional resources in time based on the a priori generation of temporal expectancy of relevant stimuli as well as the a posteriori updating of this expectancy as a function of both sensory-based evidence and elapsing time. These processes rely on dissociable cognitive mechanisms and neural networks. Yet, although there is evidence that TO may be a core mechanism for cognitive functioning in childhood, the developmental spatiotemporal neural dynamics of this mechanism are little understood. In this study we employed a combined approach based on the application of distributed source reconstruction on a high spatial resolution ERP data array obtained from eighteen 8- to 12-year-old children completing a TO paradigm in which both the cue (Temporal vs. Neutral) and the SOA (Short vs. Long) were manipulated. Results show both cue (NI) and SOA (CNV, Omission Detection Potential and Anterior Anticipatory Index) ERP effects, which were associated with expectancy generation and updating, respectively. Only cue-related effects were correlated with age, as revealed by a reduction of the N1 delta effect with increasing age. Our data suggest that the neural correlates underlying TO are already established at least from 8 to 12 years of age. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Though promising results have been found in laboratory experiments, there are no smart reading aids that are capable to estimate difficulty during normal reading. This paper presents a new concept that aims to tackle this challenge. Based on a literature study and an experiment, we have identified several indicators for characterizing word processing difficulty by interpreting electroencelography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We have defined a computational model based on fuzzy set theory, which estimates the probability of word processing and comprehension difficulty during normal reading. The paper also presents a concept and functional prototype of a smart reading aid, which is used to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution. The results of our research proves that it is possible to implement a smart reading aid that is capable to detect reading difficulty in real time. We show that the most reliable indicators are related to eye movement (i.e. fixation and regression), while brain signals are less dependable sources for indicating word processing difficulty during continuous reading.

MEG has been clinically applied to various neurological diseases, including epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction. In the past decade, MEG has also emerged as an important investigatory tool in neurodevelopmental studies. It is therefore an opportune time to review how MEG is able to contribute to the study of atypical brain development. We limit this review to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relevant published work for children was accessed using PubMed on 5 January 2015. Case reports, case series, and papers on epilepsy were excluded. Owing to their accurate separation of brain activity in the right and left hemispheres and the higher accuracy of source localization, MEG studies have added new information related to auditory-evoked brain responses to findings from previous electroencephalography studies of children with ASD. In addition, evidence of atypical brain connectivity in children with ASD has accumulated over the past decade. MEG is well suited for the study of neural activity with high time resolution even in young children. Although further studies are still necessary, the detailed findings provided by neuroimaging methods may aid clinical diagnosis and even contribute to the refinement of diagnostic categories for neurodevelopmental disorders in the future.

A total of 21 healthy participants (10 male, mean age +/- SD 22.82 +/- 1.12 years) were recruited and tested in this study. EEG recordings were taken from 40 channels. Single type of non-painful tactile stimuli was applied to the two fingers of the right hand by means of pneumatic stimulator. Sleep stages were scored according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine sleep scoring systems. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were analyzed for PS and each of sleep stages. While P50, N100, P200, N300, P900 and N_late components were recorded both PS and during the sleep, P300 and N450 were observed only in PS. Likewise, P450 and N550 components were observed only during the sleep cycle (light, deep and REM). P50, N100 and P200 components related to sensorial processing had relatively higher amplitudes in PS than in the sleep cycle. On the other hand, N300, P450, P900 and N_late responses had the highest amplitudes during sleep. The changes in brain responses to non-painful tactile stimuli PS and during the sleep were presented in this study. To our knowledge, it is the first study to demonstrate the eight SEP components all at once. Early components have been related to sensory processing and thus hint at the limitation of the brain towards external world for sleep, whereas later components show the network activity for sustaining the sleep environment.

It is crucial to explore the influence of anxiety on cognitive processes. In this study we recorded EEG activity from 73 subjects (35 patients, 38 controls, matched for age and education) during performance of the Continuous Attention Task. We used low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for evaluation of mechanisms of impaired cognitive performance in anxiety disorders. Analysis showed that patients with anxiety disorders committed more errors than the controls, had a short latency of P300 and higher amplitude of ERPs at all steps of stimulus processing. Furthermore, we showed that there was a relationship between the scores of Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory, and amplitudes and latencies of ERPs. The results of LORETA analysis showed that enhanced neural responses were found within circuits mediating visual information processing, sustained attention and anxiety. Also, we found higher current density within areas playing an important role in the brain fear network - anterior cingulate and anterior part of insula. Electrophysiological neuroimaging showed greater recruitment of cognitive resources in anxiety disorders, evidenced by higher current density and activation of greater number of brain areas. Despite the strategy employed to compensate for cognitive problems, the anxiety patients did not achieve the same performance as controls. Present study demonstrates that anxiety disorders influence processing of neutral stimuli and this influence is observable at both behavioral and electrophysiological level. The data suggests instability of neural systems responsible for information selection, working memory, engagement and focusing of attention.

CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adult ADHD; contingent negative variation; skin conductance level; arousal; hypoarousal; biofeedback; neurofeedback	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE-TEST; COGNITIVE-ENERGETIC MODEL; PALMAR SKIN-CONDUCTANCE; AUTONOMIC AROUSAL; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VARIATION CNV	In children and adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a general slowing of spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity and a decrease of event-related potential amplitudes such as the contingent negative variation (CNV) are observed. Additionally, some studies have reported decreased skin conductance level (SCL) in this clinical population leading to the hypothesis of a peripheral hypoarousal, which may be a target of biofeedback treatment in addition to or instead of neurofeedback. To our knowledge, the relationship between SCL and CNV has not been simultaneously investigated in one experiment. Using the theoretical background of the hypoarousal model, this article aims to gain more insight into the differences and correlations of cortical (CNV) and peripheral (SCL) arousal in adults with ADHD. A sample of 23 adults with ADHD and 22 healthy controls underwent an auditory Go-NoGo task with simultaneous 22-channel EEG and SCL recordings. Reaction time (RT) and reaction time variability (RTV) were also measured to assess task performance. Significantly decreased CNV amplitude and significantly higher RTV were observed in the ADHD group, reflecting cortical underarousal and problems with sustained attention. No significant correlation between peripheral underarousal and cortical underarousal was observed in the ADHD group or the control group. The observed cortical underarousal reflected in the decreased CNV supports the notion of a reduced CNV amplitude as a possible biomarker for ADHD. However, the connection between cortical and peripheral arousal is not as clear as is suggested in previous research investigating both separately. Implications of these results for new treatment options for ADHD such as biofeedback are discussed.

Many implanted children master the acquisition of spoken language successfully, yet we still have little knowledge of the actual input they receive with the implant and specifically which language sensitive cues they hear. This would be important however, both for understanding the flexibility of the auditory system when presented with stimuli after a (life-) long phase of deprivation and for planning therapeutic intervention. In rhythmic languages the general stress pattern conveys important information about word boundaries. Infant language acquisition relies on such cues and can be severely hampered when this information is missing, as seen for dyslexic children and children with specific language impairment. Here we ask whether children with a cochlear implant perceive differences in stress patterns during their language acquisition phase and if they do, whether it is present directly following implant stimulation or if and how much time is needed for the auditory system to adapt to the new sensory modality. We performed a longitudinal ERP study, testing in bimonthly intervals the stress pattern perception of 17 young hearing impaired children (age range: 9-50 months; mean: 22 months) during their first 6 months of implant use. An additional session before the implantation served as control baseline. During a session they passively listened to an oddball paradigm featuring the disyllable "baba," which was stressed either on the first or second syllable (trochaic vs. iambic stress pattern). A group of age-matched normal hearing children participated as controls. Our results show, that within the first 6 months of implant use the implanted children develop a negative mismatch response for iambic but not for trochaic deviants, thus showing the same result as the normal hearing controls. Even congenitally deaf children show the same developing pattern. We therefore conclude (a) that young implanted children have early access to stress pattern information and (b) that they develop ERP responses similar to those of normal hearing children.

BCIs can also be useful for healthy individuals in situations limiting their movement or where other computer interaction modalities need to be supplemented. Event-related and steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are the top two brain signal types used in developing BCIs that allow the user to make a choice from a discrete set of options, including the selection of commands from a menu for a robot or computer to perform, as well as typing letters, symbols, or icons for communication. Popular BCI speller paradigms, such as the P300 Matrix Speller, RSVP Keyboard or SSVEP spellers in which the letters on the keyboard display flicker, are sensitive to the font, size and presentation speed. In addition, sensitivity to eye gaze control plays a significant role in usability of most of these keyboards. We present a code-VEP based BCI, utilized in a language model assisted keyboard application. Utilizing a cursor based selection method, stimuli and targets are separated. FlashType (TM) separates visual stimulation from alphabet presentation to achieve performance invariance under presentation variations. Therefore, FlashType (TM) can be used for all languages, including the ones containing symbols and icons. FlashType (TM), contains a Static Keyboard, a row of Suggested Characters and a row of Predicted Words. FlashType (TM), by default, uses only one EEG electrode and four stimuli. The system can operate using only one stimulus at a lower selection rate, useful for individuals with limited or no gaze control. This feature is to be explored in future. Replacing letters with text or icons representing commands would allow controlling a computer or robot. In this study, FlashType (TM) has been evaluated by three individuals performing 10 Mastery tasks. In depth experimentation, such as assessing the system with potential end users writing long passages of text, will be done in future.

The study aimed to evaluate the hyperactivity of the frontal lobes in a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorders. Case description. A 21-year-old female met the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 since her behaviour was characterized by a preoccupations with negative thoughts and by repetitive attempts to decrease or stop those behaviours. Two working hypotheses were tested to find neuromarkers of OCD and anxiety in the patient described. In agreement with the 'OCD hypothesis' an increase of the frontal beta activity and an increase of the parietalalpha activity pattern was found. The 'anxiety' hypothesis found confirmation in an increased left temporal P1 wave in response to the visual stimuli observed in ERPs. In all three conditions (EO, EC, GO/NOGO task), two characteristics were deviant from the normative average data in EEG spectra. First, an increase of frontal beta activity and the increase of parietal alpha activity was noted. The independent component analysis applied for 700 ms EEG fragments in GO and NOGO conditions revealed a strong activation over the central areas. Conclusions. Specific patterns of QEEG and ERPs, the increase of beta activity frontally, and the increase of parietal alpha activity pattern which produce hyper-frontality, might be useful in the diagnosis of an OCD patient. ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used in the assessment of functional brain changes in OCD patients.

We investigated the role of motor experience in auditory memory recognition processes by musicians using behavioral, ERP, and neural source current density measures. Skilled pianists learned one set of novel melodies by producing them and another set by perception only. Pianists then completed an auditory memory recognition test during which the previously learned melodies were presented with or without an out-of-key pitch alteration while the EEG was recorded. Pianists indicated whether each melody was altered from or identical to one of the original melodies. Altered pitches elicited a larger N2 ERP component than original pitches, and pitches within previously produced melodies elicited a larger N2 than pitches in previously perceived melodies. Cortical motor planning regions were more strongly activated within the time frame of the N2 following altered pitches in previously produced melodies compared with previously perceived melodies, and larger N2 amplitudes were associated with greater detection accuracy following production learning than perception learning. Early sensory (N1) and later cognitive (P3a) components elicited by pitch alterations correlated with predictions of sensory echoic and schematic tonality models, respectively, but only for the perception learning condition, suggesting that production experience alters the extent to which performers rely on sensory and tonal recognition cues. These findings provide evidence for distinct time courses of sensory, schematic, and motoric influences within the same recognition task and suggest that learned auditory-motor associations influence responses to out-of-key pitches.

Experiment 2, published elsewhere (Jonczyk et al., Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci 16(3): 527-540, 2016), is distilled to its essence. In experiment 1, participants viewed noun-adjective pairs (e.g. war-dead), and were asked to determine whether the pair was related in meaning. In experiment 2, the same adjectives were embedded in natural sentential context (e.g. Incurably ill Patrick did not realise that in a month he would already be dead); here, participants decided whether the sentences were meaningful. This "pragmatic twist" in the design enabled for the first time to uncover robust differences in cortical activation to affective adjectives in L1 and L2 that revealed themselves both in the early (N400 modulation) and late (LPC modulation) stages of processing. This effect was limited to adjectives embedded in affectively salient sentences, providing evidence that affective experience is boosted when individuals read natural language, which, in turn, may reveal differences in affect processing in the bilinguals' respective languages.

Electrical activities of the brain are recorded using electroencephalograph where analysis can then be made and results can lead towards an objective diagnosis assessment of dyslexia. The benchmark of the assessment design is based on methods employed by the Dyslexia Association of Malaysia. There are six tasks in the overall assessment that looks into the subject visual and phonics processing, along with their reading, writing and spelling proficiencies. Eight electrode positions were applied on the scalp based on the brain learning pathway to look into areas of activation, C3, C4, CZ, P3, P4, F8, F7 and T7. The computer based assessment provide the basis of activities to be presented to a dyslexic subject with an age range of 7 to 12 that evaluates their learning capabilities and present the marker that can lead towards the diagnosis of dyslexia. Coupled with EEG recording, it provides a view on the working of the brain giving information for practitioner in the design of pedagogical approach or even neurofeedback protocol.

Recently, anomalous sensory and perceptual function has gained an increased level of recognition as an important feature of ASD. A specific impairment in the ability to integrate information across brain networks has been proposed to contribute to these disruptions. A crucial mechanism for these integrative processes is the rhythmic synchronization of neuronal excitability across neural populations; collectively known as oscillations. In ASD there is believed to be a deficit in the ability to efficiently couple functional neural networks using these oscillations. This review discusses evidence for disruptions in oscillatory synchronization in ASD, and how disturbance of this neural mechanism contributes to alterations in sensory and perceptual function. The review also frames oscillatory data from the perspective of prevailing neurobiologically-inspired theories of ASD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the nature of the relationship between motor imagery and phantom experiences remains unknown. In this study, the influence of phantom limb perception on motor imagery was investigated using a hand mental rotation task by means of behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Compared with healthy controls, significantly prolonged response time for both the intact and missing hand were observed specifically in amputees who perceived a phantom limb during the task but not in amputees without phantom limb perception. Event-related desynchronization of EEG in the beta band (beta-ERD) in central and parietal areas showed an angular disparity specifically in amputees with phantom limb perception, with its source localized in the right inferior parietal lobule. The response time as well as the beta-ERD values were significantly positively correlated with phantom vividness. Our results suggest that phantom limb perception during the task is an important interferential factor for motor imagery after amputation and the interference might be related to a change of the body representation resulting from an unnatural posture of the phantom limb.

Subjects performed 250 maximal compressions of a handgrip dynamometer in response to the target acoustic stimulus. Stimuli were presented in three paradigms with different levels of cognitive load: (1) the reaction task with one type of signals (2) the acoustic stimuli recognition task with the 50% target and 50% non-target stimuli, where voluntary attention was involved, (3) the recognition task with the 17% target and 83% non target stimuli, that led to the activation of voluntary and involuntary attention systems. As fatigue indicators amplitude of compression force in response to the target stimulus, the maximum voluntary contraction and rating of perceived exertion were used. Our results showed the reduced level of fatigue in experiment with the activation of voluntary and involuntary attention systems. Moreover, the activation of involuntary attention, accompanied by mismatch negativity in the EEG, enhanced the effect of voluntary attention.	[Aleksandrov, A. A.; Knyazeva, V.

Here we attempt to integrate the evidence presented in this series of papers for the special issue on MMN in schizophrenia together with evidence from other new relevant research and ask what have we learnt? While MMN research was the purview for decades of psychophysiologists interested in event-related potentials derived from scalp recorded EEG, it is now part of mainstream neuroscience research attracting the interest of basic auditory neuroscientists, neurobiologists and computational modellers. The confluence of these developments together with increasing clinical research has certainly advanced our understanding of the causes of reduced MMN in schizophrenia as this integrative review attempts to demonstrate but much remains to be learnt. Future advances will rely on the application of multiple methodologies and approaches in order to arrive at better understanding of the neurobiology of MMN and implications for schizophrenia.

Methods: In this study, we use steady-state visually evoked potential event-related partial coherence as a measure of brain FC to examine functional connectivity differences between a typically developing (TD) group of 25 boys and an age/IQ-matched group of 42 drug naive boys newly diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD group). Functional connectivity was estimated while both groups performed a low-demand reference task and the A-X version of the continuous performance task (CPT A-X). Results: While the TD and ADHD groups exhibited similar prefrontal FC increases prior to the appearance of the target in the reference task, these groups demonstrated significant FC differences in the interval preceding the appearance of the target in the CPT A-X task. Specifically, the ADHD group exhibited robust prefrontal and parieto-frontal FC increases that were not apparent in the TD group. Conclusion: The FC differences observed in the ADHD group are discussed in the context of inadequate suppression of cortical networks that may interfere with task performance.

J	Jalbert, J; Roberts, T; Beretta, A				Jalbert, Joseph; Roberts, Tyler; Beretta, Alan			Neurophysiological effects of prediction on head reassignment in German compounds	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalography; German compounds; grammatical gender; prediction	SEMANTIC TRANSPARENCY; WORDS; REPRESENTATION	Recent research on noun-noun compounds has suggested that the parser may commit to the first noun (N1) as the head and then have to revise that commitment when the second noun (N2) is encountered. However, it remains unclear under what circumstances head commitment at N1 occurs, and whether it involves both semantic and syntactic revisions at N2. In two event-related potential experiments in German, we explored these questions by manipulating gender matches between a determiner and N1/N2 in compounds. In Experiment 1, a determiner-noun match in gender at N1 compared with a mismatch yielded an effect at N2 for the matching condition (increased negativity at 480-550ms, strongest in the left hemisphere); there was a similar effect for the gender violation at N2. The observed negativity could have been due to either semantic or syntactic head revision, or both. Experiment 2 increased expectations that an N2 was imminent, which attenuated syntactic, but not semantic, effects at N2. We found N400-like effects, often associated with semantic integration, suggesting that, in Experiment 1, the syntactic effects had masked the semantic costs. Taken together, these results support the idea that both semantic and syntactic head commitment and revision occur during compound processing.

The core techniques used in current research either measure neuronal activity directly (e.g., electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography) or measure aspects of brain metabolism that provide indirect measures of neuronal activity (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). Each technique presents a distinct set of strengths and limitations; some have superior ability to localize processing within the brain (spatial resolution), while others have better capability for evaluating the timing of processing (temporal resolution). As these techniques have matured, they have been applied to an increasingly diverse range of research questions. This chapter highlights some key advances associated with functional neuroimaging, with a focus on research that studies higher cognition and decision making.

They bridge the impaired connection in the sensorimotor loop by providing brain-state dependent proprioceptive feedback with orthotic devices attached to the hand or arm of the patients. The underlying neurophysiology of this BRI neuromodulation is still largely unknown. We investigated changes of corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation in thirteen right-handed healthy subjects who performed 40 min of kinesthetic motor imagery receiving proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis attached to the left hand contingent to event-related desynchronization of the right sensorimotor cortex in the beta-band (16-22 Hz). Neural correlates of this BRI intervention were probed by acquiring the stimulus-response curve (SRC) of both motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitudes and areas under the curve. In addition, a motor mappingwas obtained. The specificity of the effects was studied by comparing two neighboring hand muscles, one BRI-trained and one control muscle. Robust changes of MEP amplitude but not MEP area occurred following the BRI intervention, but only in the BRI-trained muscle. The steep part of the SRC showed an MEP increase, while the plateau of the SRC showed an MEP decrease. MEP mapping revealed a distributed pattern with a decrease of excitability in the hand area of the primary motor cortex, which controlled the BRI, but an increase of excitability in the surrounding somatosensory and premotor cortex. In conclusion, the BRI intervention induced a complex pattern of modulated corticospinal excitability, which may boost subsequent motor learning during physiotherapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While initial activities in operculo-insular and mid-cingulate cortices have been extensively assessed, the activation timing of most areas supporting conscious pain has barely been studied. Here we used intracranial EEG to investigate the dynamics of 16 brain regions (insular, parietal, prefrontal, cingulate, hippocampal and limbic) during the first second following nociceptive-specific laser pulses. Three waves of activation could be defined according to their temporal relation with conscious perception, ascertained by voluntary motor responses. Pre-conscious activities were recorded in the posterior insula, operculum, mid-cingulate and amygdala. Antero-insular, prefrontal and posterior parietal activities started later and developed during time-frames consistent with conscious voluntary reactions. Responses from hippocampus, perigenual and perisplenial cingulate developed latest and persisted well after conscious perception occurred. Nociceptive inputs reach simultaneously sensory and limbic networks, probably through parallel spino-thalamic and spino-parabrachial pathways, and the initial limbic activation precedes conscious perception of pain. Access of sensory information to consciousness develops concomitant to fronto-parietal activity, while late-occurring responses in the hippocampal region, perigenual and posterior cingulate cortices likely underlie processes linked to memory encoding, self-awareness and pain modulation.

Methods: This project utilized a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate effects of mild jugular vein (neck) compression (collar) relative to controls (no collar) during a competitive hockey season (males; 16.3 +/- 1.2 years). The collar was designed to mildly compress the jugular vein bilaterally with the goal to increase intracranial blood volume to reduce risk of brain slosh injury during head impact exposure. Helmet sensors were used to collect daily impact data in excess of 20 g (games and practices) and the primary outcome measures, which included changes in white matter (WM) microstructure, were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, four DTI measures: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity (RD) were used in the study. These metrics were analyzed using the tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) approach - a voxel-based analysis. In addition, electroencephalography-derived event-related potentials were used to assess changes in brain network activation (BNA) between study groups. Results: For athletes not wearing the collar, DTI measures corresponding to a disruption of WM microstructure, including MD and RD, increased significantly from pre-season to mid-season (p < 0.05). Athletes wearing the collar did not show a significant change in either MD or RD despite similar accumulated linear accelerations from head impacts (p > 0.05). In addition to these anatomical findings, electrophysiological network analysis of the degree of congruence in the network electrophysiological activation pattern demonstrated concomitant changes in brain network dynamics in the non-collar group only (p < 0.05). Similar to the DTI findings, the increased change in BNA score in the non-collar relative to the collar group was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Changes in DTI outcomes were also directly correlated with altered brain network dynamics (r = 0.76; p < 0.05) as measured by BNA. Conclusion: Group differences in the longitudinal changes in both neuroanatomical and electrophysiological measures, as well as the correlation between the measures, provide initial evidence indicating that mild jugular vein compression may have reduced alterations in the WM response to head impacts during a competitive hockey season. The data indicate sport-related alterations in WM microstructure were ameliorated by application of jugular compression during head impact exposure. These results may lead to a novel line of research inquiry to evaluate the effects of protecting the brain from sports-related head impacts via optimized intracranial fluid dynamics.

Flicker Regularity Is Crucial for Entrainment of Alpha Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; entrainment; alpha; flicker; SSVEP; oscillations; visual perception	VISUAL-STIMULATION; DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE; TEMPORAL EXPECTATION; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; EEG ALPHA; TOP-DOWN; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; TOOLBOX; CORTEX	Previous studies have shown that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in human electroencephalogram (EEG) modulate perception via phase-dependent inhibition. If entrained to an external driving force, inhibition maxima and minima of the oscillation appear more distinct in time and make potential phase-dependent perception predictable. There is an ongoing debate about whether visual stimulation is suitable to entrain alpha oscillations. On the one hand, it has been argued that a series of light flashes results in transient event-related responses (ERPs) superimposed on the ongoing EEG. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that alpha oscillations become entrained to a series of light flashes if they are presented at a certain temporal regularity. This raises the question under which circumstances a sequence of light flashes causes entrainment, i.e., whether an arrhythmic stream of light flashes would also result in entrainment. Here, we measured detection rates in response to visual targets at two opposing stimulation phases during rhythmic and arrhythmic light stimulation. We introduce a new measure called "behavioral modulation depth" to determine differences in perception. This measure is capable of correcting for inevitable artifacts that occur in visual detection tasks during visual stimulation. The physical concept of entrainment predicts that increased stimulation intensity should produce stronger entrainment. Thus, two experiments with medium (Experiment 1) and high (Experiment 2) stimulation intensity were performed. Data from the first experiment show that the behavioral modulation depth (alpha phase-dependent differences in detection threshold) increases with increasing entrainment of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, individual alpha phase delays of entrained alpha oscillations determine the behavioral modulation depth: the largest behavioral modulation depth can be found if targets presented during the minimum of the entrained oscillation are compared to those presented during the maximum. In the second experiment stimulation with higher light intensity during both rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation lead to an increased behavioral modulation depth, supposedly as a consequence of stronger entrainment during rhythmic stimulation. Altogether, our results reveal evidence for rhythmic and arrhythmic visual stimulation to induce fundamentally different processes in the brain: we suggest that rhythmic but not arrhythmic stimulation interacts with ongoing alpha oscillations via entrainment.

Modulation of mGlu2 Receptors, but Not PDE10A Inhibition Normalizes Pharmacologically-Induced Deviance in Auditory Evoked Potentials and Oscillations in Conscious Rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A INHIBITORS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; GATING DEFICITS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P50; GLUTAMATE; DOPAMINE; AGONIST	Improvement of cognitive impairments represents a high medical need in the development of new antipsychotics. Aberrant EEG gamma oscillations and reductions in the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) are neurophysiological biomarkers for schizophrenia that indicate disruption in sensory information processing. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (i.e. PDE10A) and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) signaling are believed to provide antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether this occurs with cognition-enhancing potential. The present study used the auditory paired click paradigm in passive awake Sprague Dawley rats to 1) model disruption of AEP waveforms and oscillations as observed in schizophrenia by peripheral administration of amphetamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP); 2) confirm the potential of the antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine to attenuate these disruptions; 3) evaluate the potential of mGluR2 agonist LY404039 and PDE10 inhibitor PQ-10 to improve AEP deficits in both the amphetamine and PCP models. PCP and amphetamine disrupted auditory information processing to the first click, associated with suppression of the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude, and increased cortical gamma oscillations. Risperidone and olanzapine normalized PCP and amphetamine-induced abnormalities in AEP waveforms and aberrant gamma/alpha oscillations, respectively. LY404039 increased P1/N1 complex peak amplitudes and potently attenuated the disruptive effects of both PCP and amphetamine on AEPs amplitudes and oscillations. However, PQ-10 failed to show such effect in either models. These outcomes indicate that modulation of the mGluR2 results in effective restoration of abnormalities in AEP components in two widely used animal models of psychosis, whereas PDE10A inhibition does not.

Previous reports from our lab have shown that those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have decreased activity and/or coherence in delta, theta, alpha and beta cognitive responses. In the current study, we investigated gamma responses in visual SEO and ERO in 15 patients with AD and in 15 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. The following parameters were analyzed over the parietal-occipital regions in both groups: (i) latency of the maximum gamma response over a 0800 ms time window; (ii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses in 3 frequency ranges (25-30, 30-35, 40-48 Hz); and (iii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses over a 0-800 ms time block containing four divided time windows (0-200, 200-400, 400-600, and 600-800 ms). There were main group effects in terms of both latency and peak-to-peak amplitudes of gamma ERO. However, peak-to-peak gamma ERO amplitude differences became noticeable only when the time block was divided into four time windows. SEO amplitudes in the 25-30 Hz frequency range of the 0-200 ms time window over the left hemisphere were greater in the healthy controls than in those with AD. Gamma target ERO latency was delayed up to 138 ms in AD patients when compared to healthy controls. This finding may be an effect of lagged neural signaling in cognitive circuits, which is reflected by the delayed gamma responses in those with AD. Based on the results of this study, we propose that gamma responses should be examined in a more detailed fashion using multiple frequency and time windows. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A new error function based on the minimization of squared error difference between desired and designed responses of filter with controlled ripple in passband (pb) and stopband (sb), is proposed and for optimizing the error function, a new hybrid optimization technique based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed. Stability of the designed filter is guaranteed with less complex structure utilized during iterative computation. A comparative study of performance of the developed hybrid technique with classical methods is presented that illustrates the improved performance of the proposed method.

Movement Anticipation and EEG: Implications for BCI-Contingent Robot Therapy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); man machine systems; rehabilitation robotics	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; BETA SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHMS; REHABILITATION; STIMULATION; MODULATION; PATTERNS; FINGER	Brain-computer interfacing is a technology that has the potential to improve patient engagement in robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy. For example, movement intention reduces mu ( 8-13 Hz) oscillation amplitude over the sensorimotor cortex, a phenomenon referred to as event-related desynchronization ( ERD). In an ERD-contingent assistance paradigm, initial BCI-enhanced robotic therapy studies have used ERD to provide robotic assistance for movement. Here we investigated how ERD changed as a function of audio-visual stimuli, overt movement from the participant, and robotic assistance. Twelve unimpaired subjects played a computer game designed for rehabilitation therapy with their fingers using the FINGER robotic exoskeleton. In the game, the participant and robot matched movement timing to audio-visual stimuli in the form of notes approaching a target on the screen set to the consistent beat of popular music. The audio-visual stimulation of the game alone did not cause ERD, before or after training. In contrast, overt movement by the subject caused ERD, whether or not the robot assisted the finger movement. Notably, ERD was also present when the subjects remained passive and the robot moved their fingers to play the game. This ERD occurred in anticipation of the passive finger movement with similar onset timing as for the overt movement conditions. These results demonstrate that ERD can be contingent on expectation of robotic assistance; that is, the brain generates an anticipatory ERD in expectation of a robot-imposed but predictable movement. This is a caveat that should be considered in designing BCIs for enhancing patient effort in robotically-assisted therapy.

J	Hitokoto, H; Glazer, J; Kitayama, S				Hitokoto, Hidefumi; Glazer, James; Kitayama, Shinobu			Cultural shaping of neural responses: Feedback-related potentials vary with self-construal and face priming	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; Individual differences; EEG	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ASIAN-AMERICAN; UNITED-STATES; NEUROSCIENCE; ENHANCEMENT; NEGATIVITY; DISSONANCE; POSITIVITY	Previous work shows that when an image of a face is presented immediately prior to each trial of a speeded cognitive task (face-priming), the error-related negativity (ERN) is upregulated for Asians, but it is downregulated for Caucasians. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that images of generalized other vary cross-culturally such that they evoke anxiety for Asians, whereas they serve as safety cues for Caucasians. Here, we tested whether the cross-cultural variation in the face-priming effect would be observed in a gambling paradigm. Caucasian Americans, Asian Americans, and Asian sojourners were exposed to a brief flash of a schematic face during a gamble. For Asian Americans, face-priming resulted in significant increases of both negative-going deflection of ERP upon negative feedback (feedback-related negativity [FRN]) and positive-going deflection of ERP upon positive feedback (feedback-related positivity [FRP]). For Caucasian Americans, face-priming showed a significant reversal, decreasing both FRN and FRP. The cultural difference in the face-priming effect in FRN and FRP was partially mediated by interdependent self-construal. Curiously, Asian sojourners showed a pattern similar to the one for Caucasian Americans. Our findings suggest that culture shapes neural pathways in both systematic and highly dynamic fashion.

J	Cecotti, H				Cecotti, Hubert			Single-Trial Detection With Magnetoencephalography During a Dual-Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Task	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Event-related fields; magnetoencephalography (MEG); rapid serial visual presentation; single-trial detection	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; REMOVAL; MODEL; P300; EEG; MEG	Goal: The detection of brain responses corresponding to the presentation of a particular class of images is a challenge in brain-machine interface. Current systems based on the detection of brain responses during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks possess advantages for both healthy and disabled people, as they are gaze independent and can offer a high throughput. Methods: We propose a novel paradigm based on a dual-RSVP task that assumes a low target probability. Two streams of images are presented simultaneously on the screen, the second stream is identical to the first one, but delayed in time. Participants were asked to detect images containing a person. They follow the first stream until they see a target image, then change their attention to the second stream until the target image reappears, finally they change their attention back to the first stream. Results: The performance of single-trial detection was evaluated on both streams and their combination of the decisions with signal recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the dual-RSVP task. We compare classification performance across different sets of channels (magnetometers, gradiometers) with a BLDA classifier with inputs obtained after spatial filtering. Conclusion: The results suggest that single-trial detection can be obtained with an area under the ROC curve superior to 0.95, and that an almost perfect accuracy can be obtained with some subjects thanks to the combination of the decisions from two trials, without doubling the duration of the experiment. Significance: The present results show that a reliable accuracy can be obtained with the MEG for target detection during a dual-RSVP task.

The three main ERPs, i.e., N170, P300, N400 were obtained after appropriate time windows selection for different response peaks and averaging EEG waveforms from all trials for each channel. Following that, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was applied on each ERP waveform and a vector of six morphological CWT-based features was constructed and fed to two well-known classifiers, i.e., SVM and k-NN. The selected ERPs were drawn from those channels where they are known to be observed more frequently. The experimental results have shown that P300 provides higher classification rates than N170 and N400, reaching a classification accuracy of 76%. Moreover, SVM and k-NN showed similar performance, with the latter being slightly more efficient. Finally, gender factorization of data contributed to a maximum classification accuracy of 80%. The proposed analysis paves the way for better understanding of the activity of the brain in different attention scenarios as reflected in the CWT domain, exploring the time-frequency characteristics of the related ERPs, contributing to the detection of potential attention disorders.

Despite this endeavor, it remains unclear exactly when metacognitive experiences develop during task performance. To investigate this, the current study used EEG to temporally and spatially dissociate task-related activity from metacognitive activity. In a masked priming paradigm, metacognitive experiences of difficulty were induced by manipulating congruency between prime and target. As expected, participants more frequently rated incongruent trials as difficult and congruent trials as easy, while being completely unable to perceive the masked primes. Results showed that both the N2 and the P3 ERP components were modulated by congruency, but that only the P3 modulation interacted with metacognitive experiences. Single-trial analysis additionally showed that the magnitude of the P3 modulation by congruency accurately predicted the metacognitive response. Source localization indicated that the N2 task-related activity originated in the ACC, whereas the P3-interplay between task related activation and metacognitive experiences originated from the precuneus. We conclude that task related activity can be dissociated from later metacognitive processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Campbell, J; Sharma, A				Campbell, Julia; Sharma, Anu			Visual Cross-Modal Re-Organization in Children with Cochlear Implants	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPOKEN LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; PRELINGUALLY DEAF-CHILDREN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; HEARING; PLASTICITY; MOTION; CORTEX	Background Visual cross-modal re-organization is a neurophysiological process that occurs in deafness. The intact sensory modality of vision recruits cortical areas from the deprived sensory modality of audition. Such compensatory plasticity is documented in deaf adults and animals, and is related to deficits in speech perception performance in cochlear-implanted adults. However, it is unclear whether visual cross-modal re-organization takes place in cochlear-implanted children and whether it may be a source of variability contributing to speech and language outcomes. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if visual cross-modal re-organization occurs in cochlear-implanted children, and whether it is related to deficits in speech perception performance. Methods Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded via high-density EEG in 41 normal hearing children and 14 cochlear-implanted children, aged 5-15 years, in response to apparent motion and form change. Comparisons of VEP amplitude and latency, as well as source localization results, were conducted between the groups in order to view evidence of visual cross-modal re-organization. Finally, speech perception in background noise performance was correlated to the visual response in the implanted children. Results Distinct VEP morphological patterns were observed in both the normal hearing and cochlear-implanted children. However, the cochlear-implanted children demonstrated larger VEP amplitudes and earlier latency, concurrent with activation of right temporal cortex including auditory regions, suggestive of visual cross-modal re-organization. The VEP N1 latency was negatively related to speech perception in background noise for children with cochlear implants. Conclusion Our results are among the first to describe cross modal re-organization of auditory cortex by the visual modality in deaf children fitted with cochlear implants. Our findings suggest that, as a group, children with cochlear implants show evidence of visual cross-modal recruitment, which may be a contributing source of variability in speech perception outcomes with their implant.

J	Wolff, N; Roessner, V; Beste, C				Wolff, Nicole; Roessner, Veit; Beste, Christian			Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for increased cognitive flexibility in late childhood	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; WORKING-MEMORY; LIFE-SPAN; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VARIABLE ANALYSIS; SWITCH COSTS	Executive functions, like the capacity to control and organize thoughts and behavior, develop from childhood to young adulthood. Although task switching and working memory processes are known to undergo strong developmental changes from childhood to adulthood, it is currently unknown how task switching processes are modulated between childhood and adulthood given that working memory processes are central to task switching. The aim of the current study is therefore to examine this question using a combined cue- and memory-based task switching paradigm in children (N = 25) and young adults (N = 25) in combination with neurophysiological (EEG) methods. We obtained an unexpected paradoxical effect suggesting that memory-based task switching is better in late childhood than in young adulthood. No group differences were observed in cue- based task switching. The neurophysiological data suggest that this effect is not due to altered attentional selection (P1, N1) or processes related to the updating, organization, and implementation of the new task-set (P3). Instead, alterations were found in the resolution of task-set conflict and the selection of an appropriate response (N2) when a task has to be switched. Our observation contrasts findings showing that cognitive control mechanisms reach their optimal functioning in early adulthood.

J	Hestvik, A; Durvasula, K				Hestvik, Arild; Durvasula, Karthik			Neurobiological evidence for voicing underspecification in English	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SPEECH; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; EEG; PCA	In long-term memory, the phoneme units that make up words are coded for the distinctive features and feature values that are necessary to distinguish between words in the mental lexicon. Underspecification theory says that the phonemes that have unmarked feature values are even more abstract in that the feature is omitted from the representation altogether. This makes phoneme representations in words more sparse than the fully specified phonetic representations of the same words. Eulitz and Lahiri (2004) demonstrated that this theory predicts certain asymmetries in the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response to phoneme contrasts. We expand on this research by demonstrating underspecification-driven asymmetry in the brain response to laryngeal feature contrasts in English (i.e. what makes /d/ and /t/ different). We add a new test by showing that the asymmetry disappears if the MMN paradigm is modified to encourage the formation of phonetic memory traces instead of phonemic memory traces. This result adds further neurobiological evidence that long-term phonological representations are more sparsely represented than phonetic representations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Jungnickel, E; Gramann, K				Jungnickel, Evelyn; Gramann, Klaus			Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) of Physical Interaction with Dynamically Moving Objects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobile brain/body imaging; EEG; embodied cognition; independent component analysis; P300; oddball paradigm; MoBI	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG; SEPARATION; COGNITION	The non-invasive recording and analysis of human brain activity during active movements in natural working conditions is a central challenge in Neuroergonomics research. Existing brain imaging approaches do not allow for an investigation of brain dynamics during active behavior because their sensors cannot follow the movement of the signal source. However, movements that require the operator to react fast and to adapt to a dynamically changing environment occur frequently in working environments like assembly-line work, construction trade, health care, but also outside the working environment like in team sports. Overcoming the restrictions of existing imaging methods would allow for deeper insights into neurocognitive processes at workplaces that require physical interactions and thus could help to adapt work settings to the user. To investigate the brain dynamics accompanying rapid volatile movements we used a visual oddball paradigm where participants had to react to color changes either with a simple button press or by physically pointing towards a moving target. Using a mobile brain/body imaging approach (MoBI) including independent component analysis (ICA) with subsequent backprojection of cluster activity allowed for systematically describing the contribution of brain and non-brain sources to the sensor signal. The results demonstrate that visual event-related potentials (ERPs) can be analyzed for simple button presses and physical pointing responses and that it is possible to quantify the contribution of brain processes, muscle activity and eye movements to the signal recorded at the sensor level even for fast volatile arm movements with strong jerks. Using MoBI in naturalistic working environments can thus help to analyze brain dynamics in natural working conditions and help improving unhealthy or inefficient work settings.

However, for proper interpretation, it is important to know whether these measures depend on stimulus/behavioral conditions or the reference scheme used to analyze data. We recorded local field potential (LFP) from an array of microelectrodes chronically implanted in area V1 of monkeys under different stimulus/behavioral conditions and computed PSD slopes, coherence, and phase difference between LFPs as a function of frequency and interelectrode distance while using four reference schemes: single wire, average, bipolar, and current source density. PSD slopes were dependent on reference scheme at low frequencies (below 200 Hz) but became invariant at higher frequencies. Average phase differences between sites also depended critically on referencing, switching from 0 degrees for single-wire to 180 degrees for average reference. Results were consistent across different stimulus/behavioral conditions. We were able to account for these results based on the coherence profile across sites and properties of the spectral estimator. Our results show that using different reference schemes can have drastic effects on phase differences and PSD slopes and therefore must be interpreted carefully to gain insights about network properties.

Methods: Participants took part in two separate sessions. The first session consisted of three computerized tasks. The List Sorting Working Memory Task was used to measure working memory, the Picture Vocabulary Test was used to measure general intelligence, and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test was used to measure executive function, specifically cognitive flexibility. The second session consisted of a P300-based BCI copy-spelling task. Results: The results indicate that both working memory and general intelligence are significant predictors of BCI performance. Conclusions: This suggests that working memory training could be used to improve performance on a BCI task. Significance: Working memory training may help to reduce a portion of the individual differences that exist in BCI performance allowing for a wider range of users to successfully operate the BCI system as well as increase the BCI performance of current users.

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of preserved consciousness in VS and MCS as revealed by fMRI and EEG, including command following (active paradigms), cortical functional connectivity elicited by external stimuli (passive paradigms) and default mode networks (resting state). Studies were selected from multiple indexing databases until February 2015 and evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. 37 studies were identified, including 1041 patients (mean age 43 years, range 16-89; male/female 2.1: 1; 39.5% traumatic brain injuries). MCS patients were more likely than VS patients to follow commands during active paradigms (32% vs 14%; OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.90 to 4.27; p<0.0001)) and to show preserved functional cortical connectivity during passive paradigms (55% vs 26%; OR 3.53 (95% CI 2.49 to 4.99; p<0.0001)). Passive paradigms suggested preserved consciousness more often than active paradigms (38% vs 24%; OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.54; p<0.0001)). Data on resting state paradigms were insufficient for statistical evaluation. In conclusion, active paradigms may underestimate the degree of consciousness as compared to passive paradigms. While MCS patients show signs of preserved consciousness more frequently in both paradigms, roughly 15% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of VS are able to follow commands by modifying their brain activity. However, there remain important limitations at the single-subject level; for example, patients from both categories may show command following despite negative passive paradigms.

ADVANCES IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						motor imagery; fine motor skill; learning; motor execution; motor preparation; DSP task; EEG	MENTAL PRACTICE; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; IMPROVEMENT; MODULATION; STRENGTH; CORTEX; ERP	Motor imagery is generally thought to share common mechanisms with motor execution. In the present study, we examined to what extent learning a fine motor skill by motor imagery may substitute physical practice. Learning effects were assessed by manipulating the proportion of motor execution and motor imagery trials. Additionally, learning effects were compared between participants with an explicit motor imagery instruction and a control group. A Go/NoGo discrete sequence production (DSP) task was employed, wherein a five-stimulus sequence presented on each trial indicated the required sequence of finger movements after a Go signal. In the case of a NoGo signal, participants either had to imagine carrying out the response sequence (the motor imagery group), or the response sequence had to be withheld (the control group). Two practice days were followed by a final test day on which all sequences had to be executed. Learning effects were assessed by computing response times (RTs) and the percentages of correct responses (PCs). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was additionally measured on this test day to examine whether motor preparation and the involvement of visual short term memory (VSTM) depended on the amount of physical/mental practice. Accuracy data indicated strong learning effects. However, a substantial amount of physical practice was required to reach an optimal speed. EEG results suggest the involvement of VSTM for sequences that had less or no physical practice in both groups. The absence of differences between the motor imagery and the control group underlines the possibility that motor preparation may actually resemble motor imagery.

They are used to broadly represent cortical structures with their given sensory-cognitive functions. In recent decades, the analysis of brain oscillations has become important in the correlation of brain functions. Moreover, spectral connectivity can provide further information on the dynamic connectivity between various structures. In addition, brain responses are dynamic in nature and structural localization is almost impossible, according to Luria (1966). Therefore, brain functions are very difficult to localize; hence, a combined analysis of oscillation and event-related coherences is required. In this study, a model termed as "CLAIR" is described to enrich and possibly replace the concept of the Brodmann areas. A CLAIR model with optimum function may take several years to develop, but this study sets out to lay its foundation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The scarcity heuristic impacts reward processing within the medial-frontal cortex	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalography; feedback; medial-frontal cortex; heuristic; P300; reinforcement learning; reward; reward positivity; scarcity; value	ERROR; MAGNITUDE; FEEDBACK; BRAIN; POSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; VALENCE; TASK	Objects that are rare are often perceived to be inherently more valuable than objects that are abundant - a bias brought about in part by the scarcity heuristic. In the present study, we sought to test whether perception of rarity impacted reward evaluation within the human medial-frontal cortex. Here, participants played a gambling game in which they flipped rare and abundant "cards' on a computer screen to win financial rewards while electroencephalographic data were recorded. Unbeknownst to participants, reward outcome and frequency was random and equivalent for both rare and abundant cards; thus, only a perception of scarcity was true. Analysis of the electroencephalographic data indicated that the P300 component of the event-related brain potential differed in amplitude for wins and losses following the selection of rare cards, but not following the selection of abundant cards. Importantly, then, we found that the perception of card rarity impacted reward processing even though reward feedback was independent of and subsequent to card selection. Our data indicate a top-down influence of the scarcity heuristic on reward evaluation, and specifically the processing of reward magnitude, within the human medial-frontal cortex.

The Emerging (Social) Neuroscience of SES	SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; NEURAL RESPONSES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MU-SUPPRESSION; RACIAL BIAS; BRAIN; CULTURE; OTHERS; CONTEXTUALISM; ADOLESCENTS	Social scientists have long been interested in understanding how socioeconomic status (SES) affects the way people think, feel, and behave. Neuroscience has provided new tools (fMRI, EEG, and ERP) to allow us to answer these questions, demonstrating, for example, that lower SES is linked to stronger mirror neural responses, greater mentalizing, enhanced vigilance to threat, and lesser likelihood to spontaneously infer traits based on limited information. The present paper (i) reviews evidence that SES affects neural responses involved in a wide range of psychological processes, (ii) highlights the value of neural methods in investigations of SES, (iii) discusses cultural neuroscience as a potential framework to understand why SES has the effects it does on the brain, (iv) considers previous developmental neuroscience findings regarding SES and attention in light of cultural neuroscience, and (v) discusses future challenges, opportunities, and questions for this emerging field.

Participants passively viewed photos of their romantic partners, celebrities, and strangers during a computerized facial processing task. All participants demonstrated enhanced positivity to partner faces at late ERP components (P3 and LPP), furthering the notion that significant others elicit more motivated and sustained attention than do other familiar or unfamiliar individuals. Neural responses to romantic partner faces were influenced by factors including overall relationship quality, investment, and communication quality, with associations varying by gender. Results highlight the key role that relationship quality factors play in the immediate processing of romantic partnersa finding with implications for couples counseling and research.

The study purpose was to investigate the resolution processes during a choice stepping reaction task at the cortical level using electroencephalography and compare the results with a control task involving ankle dorsiflexion responses. Twelve young adults either stepped forward or dorsiflexed the ankle in response to a visual imperative stimulus presented on a computer screen. We used the Simon task and examined the error-related negativity (ERN) that follows an incorrect response and the correct-response negativity (CRN) that follows a correct response. Error was defined as an incorrect initial weight transfer for the stepping task and as an incorrect initial tibialis anterior activation for the control task. Results revealed that ERN and CRN amplitudes were similar in size for the stepping task, whereas the amplitude of ERN was larger than that of CRN for the control task. The ERN amplitude was also larger in the stepping task than the control task. These observations suggest that a choice stepping reaction task involves a strategy emphasizing post-response conflict and general performance monitoring of actual and required responses and also requires greater cognitive load than a choice dorsiflexion reaction. The response conflict resolution processes appear to be different for stepping tasks and reaction tasks performed in a seated position.

This review highlights the challenges unique to neurodevelopmental disorders that have limited biomarker development.Recent findingsThe field of neurodevelopmental disorders requires objective quantification of biological processes to enable designation of subgroups likely to benefit from specific treatments, index diagnostic status/risk, demonstrate engagement of targeted systems, and provide more rapid assessment of change than traditional clinical observation and caregiver report measures.SummaryUseful biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders must be reliable across development, evident at the individual level, and specific to a unit of analysis, be it diagnostic status or functional process. The ultimate value of biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders will relate to their ease of use, cost, scalability, sensitivity, and methodological objectivity.

Support vector machine (SVM) ensemble has been successfully applied to classify in the P300-speller. However, large scale of training data was needed for the sub-classifiers to ensure the performance of classification. Subjects gradually got fatigue during the period of training data collection, which resulted in an obvious difference of EEG data from early to later and affected the performance of classification. In present study, we adopted a random selection strategy to construct the training set for SVM sub-classifiers in a BCI P300-speller with familiar face paradigm. Our results showed that the random selection strategy improved the classification accuracy of SVM ensemble in BCI P300-speller.

Various cognition-related brain functions (i.e., attention, intelligence, and working memory) and multiple brain regions (i.e., prefrontal, frontal, and parietal) are reported to be involved in the elicitation of P300. However, these studies do not investigate the instant interactions across the neural cortices from the hierarchy of milliseconds. Importantly, time-varying network analysis among these brain regions can uncover the detailed and dynamic information processing in the corresponding cognition process. In the current study, we utilize the adaptive directed transfer function to construct the time-varying networks of P300 based on scalp electroencephalographs, investigating the time-varying information processing in P300 that can depict the deeper neural mechanism of P300 from the network. Our analysis found that different stages of P300 evoked different brain networks, i.e., the center area performs as the central source during the decision process stage, while the source region is transferred to the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) in the neuronal response stage. Moreover, during the neuronal response stage, the directed information that flows from the rPFC to the parietal cortex are remarkably important. These findings indicate that the two brain hemispheres exhibit asymmetrical functions in processing related information for different P300 stages, and this work may provide new evidence for our better understanding of the neural mechanism of P300 generation.

Atypical visual and somatosensory adaptation in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SENSORY PROCESSING DEFICITS; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; UNAFFECTED 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; SHORT-TERM HABITUATION; HIGH-DENSITY EEG; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES; NMDA RECEPTORS; 2-POINT DISCRIMINATION	Neurophysiological investigations in patients with schizophrenia consistently show early sensory processing deficits in the visual system. Importantly, comparable sensory deficits have also been established in healthy first-degree biological relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in first-episode drug-naive patients. The clear implication is that these measures are endophenotypic, related to the underlying genetic liability for schizophrenia. However, there is significant overlap between patient response distributions and those of healthy individuals without affected first-degree relatives. Here we sought to develop more sensitive measures of sensory dysfunction in this population, with an eye to establishing endophenotypic markers with better predictive capabilities. We used a sensory adaptation paradigm in which electrophysiological responses to basic visual and somatosensory stimuli presented at different rates (ranging from 250 to 2550 ms interstimulus intervals, in blocked presentations) were compared. Our main hypothesis was that adaptation would be substantially diminished in schizophrenia, and that this would be especially prevalent in the visual system. High-density event-related potential recordings showed amplitude reductions in sensory adaptation in patients with schizophrenia (N = 15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2) compared with age-matched healthy controls (N= 15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2), and this was seen for both sensory modalities. At the individual participant level, reduced adaptation was more robust for visual compared with somatosensory stimulation. These results point to significant impairments in short-term sensory plasticity across sensory modalities in schizophrenia. These simple-to-execute measures may prove valuable as candidate endophenotypes and will bear follow-up in future work.	[Andrade, G. N.; Butler, J. S.; Peters, G. A.; Molholm, S.; Foxe, J.

Effects of multisensory integration processes on response inhibition in adolescent autism spectrum disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; EEG; executive functions; multisensory processing; response inhibition	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; GO/NO-GO TASK; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; POTENTIAL ERP; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; STIMULI; ADULTS	BackgroundIn everyday life it is often required to integrate multisensory input to successfully conduct response inhibition (RI) and thus major executive control processes. Both RI and multisensory processes have been suggested to be altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is, however, unclear which neurophysiological processes relate to changes in RI in ASD and in how far these processes are affected by possible multisensory integration deficits in ASD.MethodCombining high-density EEG recordings with source localization analyses, we examined a group of adolescent ASD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) using a novel RI task.ResultsCompared to controls, RI processes are generally compromised in adolescent ASD. This aggravation of RI processes is modulated by the content of multisensory information. The neurophysiological data suggest that deficits in ASD emerge in attentional selection and resource allocation processes related to occipito-parietal and middle frontal regions. Most importantly, conflict monitoring subprocesses during RI were specifically modulated by content of multisensory information in the superior frontal gyrus.ConclusionsRI processes are overstrained in adolescent ASD, especially when conflicting multisensory information has to be integrated to perform RI. It seems that the content of multisensory input is important to consider in ASD and its effects on cognitive control processes.	[Chmielewski, W.

Different theoretical frameworks have been put forward with the "Theory of Event Coding (TEC)" being one of the most influential. In the current study, we focus on the concept of 'event files' within TEC and examine what sub-processes being dissociable by means of cognitive-neurophysiological methods are involved in voluntary event coding. This was combined with EEG source localization. We also introduce reward manipulations to delineate the neurophysiological sub-processes most relevant for performance variations during event coding. The results show that processes involved in voluntary event coding included predominantly stimulus categorization, feature unbinding and response selection, which were reflected by distinct neurophysiological processes (the P1, N2 and P3 ERPs). On a system's neurophysiological level, voluntary event-file coding is thus related to widely distributed parietal-medial frontal networks. Attentional selection processes (N1 ERP) turned out to be less important. Reward modulated stimulus categorization in parietal regions likely reflecting aspects of perceptual decision making but not in other processes. The perceptual categorization stage appears central for voluntary event-file coding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Method: EEG was recorded from 45 DOC patients and 14 healthy participants while listening to an auditory oddball paradigm presented in a passive - just listen - and an active - count the odd tones - condition. In patients, the experiment was repeated after a minimum of one week. Results: Prevalence of the P300 was higher in healthy participants (71%) than in patients, but did not discriminate between VS (T1: similar to 10%; T2: similar to 11%) and MCS (T1: similar to 13%; T2: 25%) patients. Conclusion: Results cast doubt on whether this simple auditory stimulation paradigm, which requires cognitive action from the listener, is sensitive enough to discriminate between patients with DOC. Significance: The sensitivity of the P300 ERP obtained in a short two-tone oddball paradigm presented in a passive and an active condition appears to be too low for routine application in a clinical setting aiming at distinguishing between VS and MCS patients.

This chapter looks at how people process affective meaning in the domain of single words, such as love or hate. A comprehensive review is presented of the cognitive and neurocognitive correlates of affective word processing. The reviewed cognitive evidence focuses on the impact of affective valence on participants' behavioural performance in visual word recognition (lexical decision task) and word naming (emotional Stroop task). In general, these studies reveal a processing facilitation for affective words, with some studies reporting valence-specific effects. The reviewed neurocognitive evidence reports neurophysiological responses to affective words in a variety of tasks (e.g. lexical decision task, semantic decision task, silent reading task), with a particular emphasis on event-related potential (ERPs) studies. Here, a robust impact of affective valence on word comprehension is found at the pre-lexical (e.g. P1, N1), lexico-semantic (EPN, N400), and post-lexico-semantic (LPC) processing stages. The cognitive and neurocognitive findings are discussed in light of the proposed theories of affective word recognition, i.e. the motivated attention, attentional vigilance, and negativity-bias hypotheses. The chapter ends with a discussion of potential concerns about the reliability of a reductionist approach to affective language investigation.

The aim of this study is to search for the possible neural correlates of different grades of visual awareness investigating the Event Related Potentials to reduced contrast visual stimuli whose perceptual clarity was rated on the four-point Perceptual Awareness Scale. Results revealed a left centro-parietal negative deflection (Visual Awareness Negativity; VAN) peaking at 280-320 ms from stimulus onset, related to the perceptual content of the stimulus, followed by a bilateral positive deflection (Late Positivity; LP) peaking at 510-550 ms over almost all electrodes, reflecting post-perceptual processes performed on such content. Interestingly, the amplitude of both deflections gradually increased as a function of visual awareness. Moreover, the intracranial generators of the phenomenal content (VAN) were found to be located in the left temporal lobe. The present data thus seem to suggest (1) that visual conscious experience is characterized by a gradual increase of perceived clarity at both behavioral and neural level and (2) that the actual content of perceptual experiences emerges from early local activation in temporal areas, without the need of later widespread frontal engagement.

Participants might cope with these demands on timing by installing a slow, broadly tuned rhythm of activation, serving as an internal trigger for executing movements in time. The BP might reflect the rising phase of this activation, culminating at the movement. If so (i) not only should BP amplitudes become larger, but BPs should also have their onsets earlier before movements when longer minimum intervals are required between movements (Experiment 1). Further, (ii) BP amplitudes should covary with demands on internal timing: decrease when internal timing is less necessary and increase in the other case. Variation of timing demands was realized by requiring participants to count vs. not to count the seconds between movements (Experiment 1) and by regular vs. irregular vs. no ticking of a clock (Experiment 2). Prediction (i) was confirmed while prediction (ii) was not. Thus, BP onsets did vary in accordance with the temporal constraints about when the movements should be performed, suggesting some relation to timing mechanisms, but we could not provide evidence for the notion that the process reflected by BPs is this timing mechanism.

The N400 Effect during Speaker-Switch-Towards a Conversational Approach of Measuring Neural Correlates of Languages	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						mobile EEG; prediction; N400; social interaction; conversation; language; dialogue; turn-taking	SPEECH RHYTHM; TURN-TAKING; COMPONENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; SCANNER; EEG	Language occurs naturally in conversations. However, the study of the neural underpinnings of language has mainly taken place in single individuals using controlled language material. The interactive elements of a conversation (e.g., turn-taking) are often not part of neurolinguistic setups. The prime reason is the difficulty to combine open unrestricted conversations with the requirements of neuroimaging. It is necessary to find a trade-off between the naturalness of a conversation and the restrictions imposed by neuroscientific methods to allow for ecologically more valid studies. Here, we make an attempt to study the effects of a conversational element, namely turn-taking, on linguistic neural correlates, specifically the N400 effect. We focus on the physiological aspect of turn-taking, the speaker-switch, and its effect on the detectability of the N400 effect. The N400 event-related potential reflects expectation violations in a semantic context; the N400 effect describes the difference of the N400 amplitude between semantically expected and unexpected items. Sentences with semantically congruent and incongruent final words were presented in two turn-taking modes: (1) reading aloud first part of the sentence and listening to speaker-switch for the final word, and (2) listening to first part of the sentence and speaker-switch for the final word. A significant N400 effect was found for both turn-taking modes, which was not influenced by the mode itself. However, the mode significantly affected the P200, which was increased for the reading aloud mode compared to the listening mode. Our results show that an N400 effect can be detected during a speaker-switch. Speech articulation (reading aloud) before the analyzed sentence fragment did also not impede the N400 effect detection for the final word. The speaker-switch, however, seems to influence earlier components of the electroencephalogram, related to processing of salient stimuli. We conclude that the N400 can effectively be used to study neural correlates of language in conversational approaches including speaker-switches.

Early selectivity for vocal and musical sounds: electrophysiological evidence from an adaptation paradigm	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERPs; music; neural adaptation; neural selectivity; speech prosody; voice	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL ADAPTATION; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; LANGUAGE; WORDS; REPETITION; RESPONSES; EMOTION; FACES	There is growing interest in characterizing the neural basis of music perception and, in particular, assessing how similar, or not, it is to that of speech. To further explore this question, we employed an EEG adaptation paradigm in which we compared responses to short sounds belonging to the same category, either speech (pseudo-sentences) or music (piano or violin), depending on whether they were immediately preceded by a same- or different-category sound. We observed a larger reduction in the N100 component magnitude in response to musical sounds when they were preceded by music (either the same or different instrument) than by speech. In contrast, the N100 amplitude was not affected by the preceding stimulus category in the case of speech. For P200 component, we observed a diminution of amplitude when speech sounds were preceded speech, compared to music. No such decrease was found when we compared the responses to music sounds. These differences in the processing of speech and music are consistent with the proposal that some degree of category selectivity for these two classes of complex stimuli already occurs at early stages of auditory processing, possibly subserved by partly separated neuronal populations.

A Cognitive Neuroscience View of Voice-Processing Abnormalities in Schizophrenia: A Window into Auditory Verbal Hallucinations?	HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						auditory verbal hallucinations; cognitive neuroscience; EEG; event-related potential; neuroimaging; voice affect; voice identity; voice speech	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; INNER SPEECH; CORTICAL RESPONSIVENESS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; SENSORY CONTRIBUTIONS; MONITORING FAILURE; GYRUS ACTIVATION; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a core symptom of schizophrenia. Like real voices, AVH carry a rich amount of linguistic and paralinguistic cues that convey not only speech, but also affect and identity, information. Disturbed processing of voice identity, affective, and speech information has been reported in patients with schizophrenia. More recent evidence has suggested a link between voice-processing abnormalities and specific clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, especially AVH. It is still not well understood, however, to what extent these dimensions are impaired and how abnormalities in these processes might contribute to AVH. In this review, we consider behavioral, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological data to investigate the speech, identity, and affective dimensions of voice processing in schizophrenia, and we discuss how abnormalities in these processes might help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying specific phenomenological features of AVH. Schizophrenia patients exhibit behavioral and neural disturbances in the three dimensions of voice processing. Evidence suggesting a role of dysfunctional voice processing in AVH seems to be stronger for the identity and speech dimensions than for the affective domain.

We investigated if it is possible to use auditory stimuli to create a BCI for the Japanese Hiragana syllabary, which has 46 Hiragana characters. Additionally, we investigated if training has an effect on accuracy despite the high amount of different stimuli involved. Able-bodied participants (N = 6) were asked to select 25 syllables (out of fifty possible choices) using a two step procedure: First the consonant (ten choices) and then the vowel (five choices). This was repeated on 3 separate days. Additionally, a person with spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in the experiment. Four out of six healthy participants reached Hiragana syllable accuracies above 70% and the information transfer rate increased from 1.7 bits/min in the first session to 3.2 bits/min in the third session. The accuracy of the participant with SCI increased from 12% (0.2 bits/min) to 56% (2 bits/min) in session three. Reliable selections from a 10 x 5 matrix using auditory stimuli were possible and performance is increased by training. We were able to show that auditory P300 BCIs can be used for communication with up to fifty symbols. This enables the use of the technology of auditory P300 BCIs with a variety of applications.

Two groups of subjects were evaluated for this purpose: 32 participants were required to either tell the truth or to lie when facing certain stimuli, and their electroencephalogram signals on 12 electrodes were recorded. The experimental results revealed that deceptive responses elicited greater connectivity strength than truthful responses, particularly in the. band on specific electrode pairs primarily involving connections between the prefrontal/frontal and central regions and between the prefrontal/ frontal and left parietal regions. These results indicate that these brain regions play an important role in executing lying responses. Additionally, three time-and frequency-dependent functional connectivity networks were proposed to thoroughly reflect the functional coupling of brain regions that occurs during lying. Furthermore, the wavelet coherence values for the connections shown in the networks were extracted as features for support vector machine training. High classification accuracy suggested that the proposed network effectively characterized differences in functional connectivity between the two groups of subjects over a specific time-frequency area and hence could be a sensitive measurement for identifying deception.

Retino-cortical stimulus frequency-dependent gamma coupling: evidence and functional implications of oscillatory potentials	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Oscillations; perception; synchrony	ELECTRORETINOGRAM	Long-range gamma band EEG oscillations mediate information transmission between distant brain regions. Gamma band-based coupling may not be restricted to cortex-to-cortex communication but may include extracortical parts of the visual system. The retinogram and visual event-related evoked potentials exhibit time-locked, forward propagating oscillations that are candidates of gamma oscillatory coupling between the retina and the visual cortex. In this study, we tested if this gamma coupling is present as indicated by the coherence of gamma-range (70-200 Hz) oscillatory potentials (OPs) recorded simultaneously from the retina and the primary visual cortex in freely moving, adult rats. We found significant retino-cortical OP coherence in a wide range of stimulus duration (0.01-1000 msec), stimulus intensity (800-5000 mcd/mm(2)), interstimulus interval (10-400 msec), and stimulus frequency (0.25-25 Hz). However, at low stimulus frequencies, the OPs were time-locked, flickering light at 25 Hz entrained continuous OP coherence (steady-state response, SSR). Our results suggest that the retina and the visual cortex exhibit oscillatory coupling at high-gamma frequency with precise time locking and synchronization of information transfer from the retina to the visual cortex, similar to cortico-cortical gamma coupling. The temporal fusion of retino-cortical gamma coherence at stimulus rates of theater movies may explain the mechanism of the visual illusion of continuity. How visual perception depends on early transformations of ascending sensory information is incompletely understood. By simultaneous measurement of flash-evoked potentials in the retina and the visual cortex in awake, freely moving rats, we demonstrate for the first time that time-locked gamma oscillatory potentials exhibit stable retino-cortical synchrony across a wide range of stimulus parameters and that the temporal continuity of coherence changes with stimulus frequency according to the expected change in the visual illusion of continuity.

J	Bouwer, FL; Werner, CM; Knetemann, M; Honing, H				Bouwer, Fleur L.; Werner, Carola M.; Knetemann, Myrthe; Honing, Henkjan			Disentangling beat perception from sequential learning and examining the influence of attention and musical abilities on ERP responses to rhythm	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Musical rhythm; Attention; Beat perception; ERP; Sequential learning	METER PERCEPTION; BRAIN; REGULARITIES; SEQUENCES; IMPLICIT; INFANTS; OSCILLATIONS; MUSICIANS; DYNAMICS; SOUND	Beat perception is the ability to perceive temporal regularity in musical rhythm. When a beat is perceived, predictions about upcoming events can be generated. These predictions can influence processing of subsequent rhythmic events. However, statistical learning of the order of sounds in a sequence can also affect processing of rhythmic events and must be differentiated from beat perception. In the current study, using EEG, we examined the effects of attention and musical abilities on beat perception. To ensure we measured beat perception and not absolute perception of temporal intervals, we used alternating loud and soft tones to create a rhythm with two hierarchical metrical levels. To control for sequential learning of the order of the different sounds, we used temporally regular (isochronous) and jittered rhythmic sequences. The order of sounds was identical in both conditions, but only the regular condition allowed for the perception of a beat. Unexpected intensity decrements were introduced on the beat and offbeat. In the regular condition, both beat perception and sequential learning were expected to enhance detection of these deviants on the beat. In the jittered condition, only sequential learning was expected to affect processing of the deviants. ERP responses to deviants were larger on the beat than offbeat in both conditions. Importantly, this difference was larger in the regular condition than in the jittered condition, suggesting that beat perception influenced responses to rhythmic events in addition to sequential learning. The influence of beat perception was present both with and without attention directed at the rhythm. Moreover, beat perception as measured with ERPs correlated with musical abilities, but only when attention was directed at the stimuli. Our study shows that beat perception is possible when attention is not directed at a rhythm. In addition, our results suggest that attention may mediate the influence of musical abilities on beat perception. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Incubation of Cue-Induced Craving in Adults Addicted to Cocaine Measured by Electroencephalography	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							TIME-DEPENDENT CHANGES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; DRUG RELAPSE; WITHDRAWAL; ABSTINENCE; SEVERITY; AMYGDALA; CHOICE; QUESTIONNAIRE	IMPORTANCE A common trigger for relapse in drug addiction is the experience of craving via exposure to cues previously associated with drug use. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated incubation of cue-induced drug-seeking during the initial phase of abstinence, followed by a decline over time. In humans, the incubation effect has been shown for alcohol, nicotine, and methamphetamine addictions, but not for heroin or cocaine addiction. Understanding the trajectory of cue-induced craving during abstinence in humans is of importance for addiction medicine. OBJECTIVE To assess cue-induced craving for cocaine in humans using both subjective and objective indices of cue-elicited responses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Seventy-six individuals addicted to cocaine with varying durations of abstinence (ie, 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year) participated in this laboratory-based cross-sectional study from June 19, 2007, to November 26, 2012. The late positive potential component of electroencephalography, a recognized marker of incentive salience, was used to track motivated attention to drug cues across these self-selected groups. Participants also completed subjective ratings of craving for cocaine before presentation of a cue, and ratings of cocaine "liking" (hedonic feelings toward cocaine) and "wanting" (craving for cocaine) after presentation of cocaine-related pictures. Data analysis was conducted from June 5, 2015, to March 30, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The late positive potential amplitudes and ratings of liking and wanting cocaine in response to cocaine-related pictures were quantified and compared across groups. RESULTS Among the 76 individuals addicted to cocaine, 19 (25%) were abstinent for 2 days, 20 (26%) were abstinent for 1 week, 15 (20%) were abstinent for 1 month, 12 (16%) were abstinent for 6 months, and 10 (13%) were abstinent for 1 year. In response to drug cues, the mean (SD) late positive potential amplitudes showed a parabolic trajectory that was higher at 1 (1.26 [1.36] mu V) and 6 (1.17 [1.19] mu V) months of abstinence and lower at 2 days (0.17 [1.09] mu V), 1week (0.36 [1.26] mu V), and 1 year (-0.27 [1.74] mu V) of abstinence (P =.02, partial eta(2) = 0.16). In contrast, the subjective assessment of baseline craving (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 26.05 [9.85]; 1week, 18.70 [11.01]; 1 month, 10.87 [10.70]; 6 months, 6.92 [8.47]; and 1 year, 3.00 [3.77]) and cue-induced liking (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.06 [2.34]; 1week, 2.33 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.15 [2.03]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.24]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.26]) and wanting (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.44 [2.62]; 1week, 2.72 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.46 [2.33]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.16]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.55]) of cocaine showed a linear decline from 2 days to 1 year of abstinence (P <= .001, partial eta(2) > 0.26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The late positive potential responses to drug cues, indicative of motivated attention, showed a trajectory similar to that reported in animal models. In contrast, we did not detect incubation of subjective cue-induced craving. Thus, the objective electroencephalographic measure may possibly be a better indicator of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse than subjective reports of craving, although this hypothesis must be empirically tested. These results suggest the importance of deploying intervention between 1 month and 6 months of abstinence, when addicted individuals may be most vulnerable to, and perhaps least cognizant of, risk of relapse.

PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials testing the effects of SCT in functional and structural brain measurements of adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. A total of 11 studies were included: five used fMRI, two used EEG and ERP, one used ERP only, two used MEG and one study used MRI. Data extracting and processing regarding sociodemographic and clinical variables, intervention characteristics, neuroimaging procedures, neuroplastic findings, effect sizes and study quality criteria was completed by two raters. Results indicate a wide range of structural and functional changes in numerous regions and circuits of the social brain, including early perceptual areas, the limbic system and prefrontal regions. Despite the small number of trials currently available, evidence suggests that SCT is associated with neuroplastic changes in the social brain and concomitant improvements in social cognitive performance. There is a lack of extensive knowledge about the neural mechanisms that underlie social cognitive enhancement after treatment, but the reported findings may shed light on the neural substrates of social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and how improved treatment procedures can be developed and applied.

Abnormal Complex Auditory Pattern Analysis in Schizophrenia Reflected in an Absent Missing Stimulus Mismatch Negativity	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Complex MMN; Prediction error; Psychosis; Sensory adaptation; Temporal lobe	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; SENSORY MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; MMN; CORTEX; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; SPECIFICITY; INTEGRATION	The simple mismatch negativity (MMN) to tones deviating physically (in pitch, loudness, duration, etc.) from repeated standard tones is robustly reduced in schizophrenia. Although generally interpreted to reflect memory or cognitive processes, simple MMN likely contains some activity from non-adapted sensory cells, clouding what process is affected in schizophrenia. Research in healthy participants has demonstrated that MMN can be elicited by deviations from abstract auditory patterns and complex rules that do not cause sensory adaptation. Whether persons with schizophrenia show abnormalities in the complex MMN is unknown. Fourteen schizophrenia participants and 16 matched healthy underwent EEG recording while listening to 400 groups of 6 tones 330 ms apart, separated by 800 ms. Occasional deviant groups were missing the 4th or 6th tone (50 groups each). Healthy participants generated a robust response to a missing but expected tone. The schizophrenia group was significantly impaired in activating the missing stimulus MMN, generating no significant activity at all. Schizophrenia affects the ability of "primitive sensory intelligence" and pre-attentive perceptual mechanisms to form implicit groups in the auditory environment. Importantly, this deficit must relate to abnormalities in abstract complex pattern analysis rather than sensory problems in the disorder. The results indicate a deficit in parsing of the complex auditory scene which likely impacts negatively on successful social navigation in schizophrenia. Knowledge of the location and circuit architecture underlying the true novelty-related MMN and its pathophysiology in schizophrenia will help target future interventions.

Hedonic aspects of gustatory processing have never been explored using gustatory evoked potentials (GEPs), a high-time-resolution technique. Our aim was to study cerebral processing of hedonic taste in humans using GEPs in response to sucrose solutions in subjects with different ratings of pleasantness regarding sucrose. In this exploratory study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomly stimulated with 3 sucrose solutions. The sucrose stimulus was presented to the tongue for 1 s 20 times. GEPs were recorded from 9 cortical sites with EEG sensors at Cz, Fz, Pz, C3, C4, F3, F4, Fp1, and Fp2 (10/20 system). The main result was that subjects who preferred the high-concentration (20 g/100 mL) sucrose solution had higher GEP amplitudes on the Pz, Cz, and Fz electrodes than did subjects who preferred the low-concentration (5 g/100 mL) or the moderate-concentration (10 g/100 mL) solutions regardless of stimulus intensity. The difference in P1N1 amplitude on the Pz, Cz, and Fz electrodes according to sucrose preference of the subjects was described with stronger significance with stimulation by the 20 g-sucrose solution than by the 5 and 10g sucrose solutions. Using the reliable and safe GEP technique, we provide an original demonstration of variability of the gustatory response on the Pz, Cz, and Fz electrodes according to a sweet preference in humans. Further studies are needed to correlate the electric signal recorded by surface electrodes to the neural generator.

J	Takaura, K; Fujii, N				Takaura, Kana; Fujii, Naotaka			Facilitative effect of repetitive presentation of one stimuluson cortical responses to other stimuli in macaquemonkeys - a possible neural mechanism for mismatch negativity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; auditory; electrocorticogram; roving oddball paradigm	AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SENSORY MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; ADAPTATION; DEVIANCE; NEURONS	The event-related potential mismatch negativity' (MMN) is an indicator of a perceiver's ability to detect deviations in sensory signal streams. MMN and its homologue in animals, mismatch activity (MMA), are differential neural responses to a repeatedly presented stimulus and a subsequent deviant stimulus (oddball). Because neural mechanisms underlying MMN and MMA remain unclear, there is a controversy as to whether MMN and MMA arise solely from stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), in which the response to a stimulus cumulatively attenuates with its repetitive presentation. To address this issue, we used electrocorticography and the auditory roving-oddball paradigm in two awake macaque monkeys. We examined the effect of stimulus repetition number on MMA and on responses to repeated stimuli and oddballs across the cerebral cortex in the time-frequency domain. As the repetition number increased, MMA spread across the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, and each electrode yielded a larger MMA. Surprisingly, this increment in MMA largely depended on response augmentation to the oddball rather than on SSA to the repeated stimulus. Following sufficient repetition, the oddball evoked a spectral power increment in some electrodes on the frontal cortex that had shown no power increase to the stimuli with less or no preceding repetition. We thereby revealed that repetitive presentation of one stimulus not only leads to SSA but also facilitates the cortical response to oddballs involving a wide range of cortical regions. This facilitative effect might underlie the generation of MMN-like scalp potentials in macaques that potentially shares similar neural mechanisms with MMN in humans.

An electrophysiological marker of the desire to quit in smokers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						addiction; cessation; craving; EEG; quitting; smoking	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION THEORY; REWARD CONTINGENCIES; SMOKING URGES; ADDICTION; QUESTIONNAIRE; IMPULSIVITY; SYSTEMS; CUES; METAANALYSIS	For many smokers, the motivational state of craving is a central feature of their dependence on nicotine, and is often at odds with a general desire to quit. How this desire to quit may influence the craving for a cigarette, however, is unclear. In the current study, we manipulated the level of craving in 24 regular smokers, and recorded EEG measures of brain activity during a rare target detection task utilizing addiction-unrelated stimuli. In response to the non-targets, we observed that smokers wanting to quit showed an enhanced late frontal activation when they were craving vs. not craving, whereas smokers not wanting to quit showed the opposite pattern of activity. A dissociation was also present in the target-related P300 response as a function of craving and desire to quit, with smokers who did not want to quit processing targets differentially between the states of craving and non-craving. The data suggest that distinct top-down control mechanisms during craving may be implemented by people who wish to quit smoking, as compared to those who do not wish to quit. This pattern of findings establishes this ERP activity as a potential biomarker that may help to differentiate people who want to quit their addiction from those who wish to continue to use their substance of choice.

Here, we examined whether depression was associated with the neural correlates of infant face and cry perception during pregnancy. In 36 women between 34 and 38 weeks gestation, we examined the P300 elicited by infant emotional (happy, distressed, and neutral) faces and cries (high-and low-distress cries and a neutral tone). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II were employed to measure current depression symptomatology. Higher depression symptoms were associated with an attenuated P300 to distressed infant faces, but not with happy or neutral infant faces. There was no association between depression symptoms and the P300 elicited by infant cries. These results suggest that depression symptoms during pregnancy may affect neural processing of infant faces, especially when the infant face is expressing distress.	[Rutherford, Helena J.

Self-initiated actions result in suppressed auditory but amplified visual evoked components in healthy participants	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motor control; Visual processes; ERPs; Action monitoring	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; SENSORY ATTENUATION; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; N1; ANTICIPATION; STIMULATION; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; SOUNDS	Self-suppression refers to the phenomenon that sensations initiated by our own movements are typically less salient, and elicit an attenuated neural response, compared to sensations resulting from changes in the external world. Evidence for self-suppression is provided by previous ERP studies in the auditory modality, which have found that healthy participants typically exhibit a reduced auditory N1 component when auditory stimuli are self-initiated as opposed to externally initiated. However, the literature investigating self-suppression in the visual modality is sparse, with mixed findings and experimental protocols. An EEG study was conducted to expand our understanding of self-suppression across different sensory modalities. Healthy participants experienced either an auditory (tone) or visual (pattern-reversal) stimulus following a willed button press (self-initiated), a random interval (externally initiated, unpredictable onset), or a visual countdown (externally initiated, predictable onsetto match the intrinsic predictability of self-initiated stimuli), while EEG was continuously recorded. Reduced N1 amplitudes for self- versus externally initiated tones indicated that self-suppression occurred in the auditory domain. In contrast, the visual N145 component was amplified for self- versus externally initiated pattern reversals. Externally initiated conditions did not differ as a function of their predictability. These findings highlight a difference in sensory processing of self-initiated stimuli across modalities, and may have implications for clinical disorders that are ostensibly associated with abnormal self-suppression.

The cognitive performance, mental state, flow experience, and brain cortical activity of 11 ultramarathon runners (6 female, 5 male) were assessed before, several times during, and after a 6-h run. A decrease in cortical activity (beta activity) was measured in the frontal cortex, whereas no changes were measured for global beta, frontal or global alpha activity. Perceived physical relaxation and flow state increased significantly after 1 h of running but decreased during the following 5 h. Perceived physical state and motivational state remained stable during the first hour of running but then decreased significantly. Cognitive performance as well as the underlying neurophysiological events (recorded as event-related potentials) remained stable across the 6-h run. Despite the fact that women reported significant higher levels of flow, no further gender effects were noticeable. Supporting the theory of a transient hypofrontality, a clear decrease in frontal cortex activity was noticeable. Interestingly, this had no effect on cognitive performance. The fact that self-reported flow experience only increased during the first hour of running before decreasing, leads us to assume that changes in cortical activity, and the experience of flow may not be linked as previously supposed.

Here, we recorded the brain signals (ERPs and fMRI) associated with phonological recoding (i.e., V-P conversion processes) in an artificial learning situation in which participants had to learn the associations between 24 unknown visual symbols (Japanese Katakana characters) and 24 arbitrary monosyllabic names. During the learning phase on Day 1, the strength of V-P associations was manipulated by varying the proportion of correct and erroneous associations displayed during a two-alternative forced choice task. Recording event related potentials (ERPs) during the learning phase allowed us to track changes in the processing of these visual symbols as a function of the strength of V-P associations. We found that, at the end of the learning phase, ERPs were linearly affected by the strength of V-P associations in a time-window starting around 200 ms post-stimulus onset on right occipital sites and ending around 345 ms on left occipital sites. On Day 2, participants had to perform a matching task during an fMRI session and the strength of these V-P associations was again used as a probe for identifying brain regions related to phonological recoding. Crucially, we found that the left fusiform gyrus was gradually affected by the strength of V-P associations suggesting that this region is involved in the brain network supporting phonological recoding processes.

Previous studies have mainly focused on using electroencephalograms (EEGs) for feedback evaluation in reinforcement learning tasks by measuring event related potentials. Few studies have investigated the time frequency (TF) profiles of a cue that manifested whether a following feedback is available or not after decision-making. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the TF profiles of the cue interact with different agents to whom the feedback related. In this study we used the TF approach to test EEG oscillations of the cue stimuli in three agents ('Self', 'Other', and 'Computer') conditions separately. The results showed that the increased central posterior delta power was elicited by the feedback unavailable cues more so than with the feedback available cue within 200-350 ms after the onset of the cue, but only in the self-condition. Moreover, a frontal-central theta oscillation had enhanced power when following the feedback unavailable cue as opposed to the feedback available cue across three agencies. These findings demonstrated that the cue for knowing an outcome produced reward prediction error-like signals, which were mirrored by the delta and theta oscillations during decision-making. More importantly, the present study demonstrated that the theta and delta oscillations reflected separable components of the advanced cue processing before the feedback in decision-making.

Methods: Forty healthy adolescents aged 16-22 y (19 females) participated in the study. Heart rate (HR) fluctuations associated with spontaneous and evoked KCs were investigated on two nights, one with (event-related potential night) and one without auditory tones presented across the night. Results: There was a clear biphasic cardiac response to evoked and spontaneous KCs, with an initial acceleration in HR followed by a deceleration (P < 0.001). HR acceleration occurred immediately to KCs in response to tones presented in the first third of the interbeat interval, but was delayed a beat when the tone occurred later in the cardiac cycle (P < 0.05). Sex differences were also evident. Pretone baseline HR was higher, and the magnitude of the HR response was blunted and delayed, in female compared to male adolescents (P < 0.001). Also, pretone baseline HR was lower when a tone elicited a KC compared to when it did not (P < 0.001), suggesting that KCs are possibly more likely to be elicited by external stimuli in states of reduced cardiac activation. Conclusions: The strict dependency observed between KCs and cardiac control indicates a potential role of KCs in modulating the cardiovascular system during sleep. Sex differences in the KC-cardiac response indicate the sensitivity of this measure in capturing sex differences in cardiac regulatory physiology.

To quantitatively map the nature of sleep-induced modulations in sensory responses we presented participants with auditory stimuli possessing different levels of linguistic complexity. Ten participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the waking state and after falling asleep. Sleep staging was based on heart rate measures validated independently on 20 participants using concurrent EEG and heart rate measurements and the results were confirmed using permutation analysis. Participants were exposed to three types of auditory stimuli: scrambled sounds, meaningless word sentences and comprehensible sentences. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, we found diminishing brain activation along the hierarchy of language processing, more pronounced in higher processing regions. Specifically, the auditory thalamus showed similar activation levels during sleep and waking states, primary auditory cortex remained activated but showed a significant reduction in auditory responses during sleep, and the high order language-related representation in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) cortex showed a complete abolishment of responses during NREM sleep. In addition to an overall activation decrease in language processing regions in superior temporal gyrus and IFG, those areas manifested a loss of semantic selectivity during NREM sleep. Our results suggest that the decreased awareness to linguistic auditory stimuli during NREM sleep is linked to diminished activity in high order processing stations.

A hybrid three-class brain-computer interface system utilizing SSSEPs and transient ERPs	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; BCI; steady-state somatosensory evoked potential; SSSEP; P300; tERP; hybrid	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TACTILE; VIBRATION; STIMULATION; ARTIFACTS; FREQUENCY; FINGERS; HAND	Objective. This paper investigates the fusion of steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs) and transient event-related potentials (tERPs), evoked through tactile simulation on the left and right-hand fingertips, in a three-class EEG based hybrid brain-computer interface. It was hypothesized, that fusing the input signals leads to higher classification rates than classifying tERP and SSSEP individually. Approach. Fourteen subjects participated in the studies, consisting of a screening paradigm to determine person dependent resonance-like frequencies and a subsequent online paradigm. The whole setup of the BCI system was based on open interfaces, following suggestions for a common implementation platform. During the online experiment, subjects were instructed to focus their attention on the stimulated fingertips as indicated by a visual cue. The recorded data were classified during runtime using a multi-class shrinkage LDA classifier and the outputs were fused together applying a posterior probability based fusion. Data were further analyzed offline, involving a combined classification of SSSEP and tERP features as a second fusion principle. The final results were tested for statistical significance applying a repeated measures ANOVA. Main results. A significant classification increase was achieved when fusing the results with a combined classification compared to performing an individual classification. Furthermore, the SSSEP classifier was significantly better in detecting a non-control state, whereas the tERP classifier was significantly better in detecting control states. Subjects who had a higher relative band power increase during the screening session also achieved significantly higher classification results than subjects with lower relative band power increase. Significance. It could be shown that utilizing SSSEP and tERP for hBCIs increases the classification accuracy and also that tERP and SSSEP are not classifying control- and non-control states with the same level of accuracy.

J	VanRullen, R				VanRullen, Rufin			How to Evaluate Phase Differences between Trial Groups in Ongoing Electrophysiological Signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perceptual cycles; rhythmic perception; discrete perception; oscillations; phase; phase opposition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; DETECTION PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY BANDS; STIMULUS ONSET; BRAIN STATES	A growing number of studies endeavor to reveal periodicities in sensory and cognitive functions, by comparing the distribution of ongoing (pre-stimulus) oscillatory phases between two (or more) trial groups reflecting distinct experimental outcomes. A systematic relation between the phase of spontaneous electrophysiological signals, before a stimulus is even presented, and the eventual result of sensory or cognitive processing for that stimulus, would be indicative of an intrinsic periodicity in the underlying neural process. Prior studies of phase-dependent perception have used a variety of analytical methods to measure and evaluate phase differences, and there is currently no established standard practice in this field. The present report intends to remediate this need, by systematically comparing the statistical power of various measures of "phase opposition" between two trial groups, in a number of real and simulated experimental situations. Seven measures were evaluated: one parametric test (circular Watson-Williams test), and three distinct measures of phase opposition (phase bifurcation index, phase opposition sum, and phase opposition product) combined with two procedures for non-parametric statistical testing (permutation, or a combination of z-score and permutation). While these are obviously not the only existing or conceivable measures, they have all been used in recent studies. All tested methods performed adequately on a previously published dataset (Busch et al., 2009). On a variety of artificially constructed datasets, no single measure was found to surpass all others, but instead the suitability of each measure was contingent on several experimental factors: the time, frequency, and depth of oscillatory phase modulation; the absolute and relative amplitudes of post-stimulus event-related potentials for the two trial groups; the absolute and relative trial numbers for the two groups; and the number of permutations used for non-parametric testing. The concurrent use of two phase opposition measures, the parametric Watson-Williams test and a non-parametric test based on summing inter-trial coherence values for the two trial groups, appears to provide the most satisfactory outcome in all situations tested. Matlab code is provided to automatically compute these phase opposition measures.

Investigation of the effects of 'piperazine-containing party pills' and dexamphetamine on interhemispheric communication using electroencephalography	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Benzylpiperazine; Trifluromethylphenylpiperazine; Central nervous system stimulants; Interhemispheric transfer; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Humans	N-SUBSTITUTED PIPERAZINES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; SEROTONIN RELEASE; TRANSMISSION; AMPHETAMINE; GLUTAMATE; STRIATUM; BRAIN; RATS	'Piperazine-containing party pills' were marketed and sold as legal alternatives to methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) until 2008 in New Zealand. The major constituents of these 'pills' were benzylphenylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). Despite their popularity, there is a paucity of knowledge about their central effects in humans. This study investigated their effects on human neural processing using electroencephalographic techniques. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of an acute dose of these compounds on the interhemispheric transfer of information (IHTT) using the Poffenberger task. Reaction time data were also collected. Healthy, right-handed males were given an oral dose of either BZP (n = 13) (200 mg), TFMPP (n = 15) (60 mg), a combination of BZP + TFMPP (n = 15) (100 mg/30 mg), dexamphetamine (n = 16) (20 mg), or placebo (n = 23) and tested both before and 120 min after drug administration. A mixed factorial repeated measures analysis of variance of absolute N160 latency and contrast analysis revealed that only TFMPP (F ((1,77)) = 17.30, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) significantly reduced the absolute N160 latency. Analysis of the IHTT revealed that only TFMPP (F ((1,77)) = 5.266, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.02) significantly reduced the IHTT, while BZP, BZP + TFMPP and dexamphetamine had no effect. Contrast analysis revealed that both TFMPP (F ((1,77)) = 17.30, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) and placebo (F ((1,77)) = 15.08, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) preserved the laterality of information transfer from one hemisphere to the other. Reaction time (p > 0.05) was not significantly affected by any of the drug treatments. The usual directional asymmetry (i.e. faster R-to-L transfer relative to L-to-R) observed in healthy control group was absent following the administration of either BZP, BZP + TFMPP or dexamphetamine.

Neural and behavioral correlates of selective stopping: Evidence for a different strategy adoption	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Selective stopping; Stimulus-selective stop-signal task; Strategy; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Source localization	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SIGNAL TASK; BRAIN; EEG; LOCALIZATION; IMPULSIVITY; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION	The present study examined the neural and behavioral correlates of selective stopping, a form of inhibition that has scarcely been investigated. The selectivity of the inhibitory process is needed when individuals have to deal with an environment filled with multiple stimuli, some of which require inhibition and some of which do not. The stimulus-selective stop-signal task has been used to explore this issue assuming that all participants interrupt their ongoing responses selectively to stop but not to ignore signals. However, recent behavioral evidence suggests that some individuals do not carry out the task as experimenters expect, since they seemed to interrupt their response non-selectively to both signals. In the present study, we detected and controlled the cognitive strategy adopted by participants (n = 57) when they performed a stimulus-selective stop-signal task before comparing brain activation between conditions. In order to determine both the onset and the end of the response cancellation process underlying each strategy and to fully take advantage of the precise temporal resolution of event-related potentials, we used amass univariate approach. Source localization techniques were also employed to estimate the neural underpinnings of the effects observed at the scalp level. Our results from scalp and source level analysis support the behavioral-based strategy classification. Specific effects were observed depending on the strategy adopted by participants. Thus, when contrasting successful stop versus ignore conditions, increased activation was only evident for subjects who were classified as using a strategy whereby the response interruption process was selective to stop trials. This increased activity was observed during the P3 time window in several left-lateralized brain regions, including middle and inferior frontal gyri, as well as parietal and insular cortices. By contrast, in those participants who used a strategy characterized by stopping non-selectively, no activation differences between successful stop and ignore conditions were observed at the estimated time at which response interruption process occurs. Overall, results from the current study highlight the importance of controlling for the different strategies adopted by participants to perform selective stopping tasks before analyzing brain activation patterns.

If distinct neuronal populations are engaged in coding pain expressions of different races, repetition suppression (RS) of neural activity to pain expressions, that is, decreased neural responses to target faces preceded by pain versus neutral adaptors, should occur when an adaptor and a target are of the same race but not when they are of different races. We found that neural responses to adaptor faces at 128-188 ms (P2) and 200-300 ms (N2) over the frontal/central areas were positively shifted by pain versus neutral expressions. Moreover, RS of neural responses to target faces in the P2/N2 windows occurred when an adaptor and a target were of the same race but not when their racial identities differed, and these effects were observed in both Chinese and Caucasian participants. Our results suggest that perception of pain expressions of different races may recruit distinct neuronal assemblies at a specific stage of the processing stream.

One of them is the ability to inhibit responses, for which the dopaminergic systems is known to play an important role. Many lines of psychophysiological research substantiate that two distinct response inhibition subprocesses exist, but it has remained elusive whether they can be attributed to distinct neurobiological factors governing the dopaminergic system. We, therefore, investigated this question by examining the effects of DRD1 (rs4532) and DRD2 (rs6277) receptor polymorphisms on electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition subprocesses (i.e., Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3) in 195 healthy human subjects with a standard Go/Nogo task. The results show that response inhibition performance at a behavioral level is affected by DRD1 and DRD2 receptor variation. However, from an electrophysiological point of view these effects emerge via different mechanisms selectively affected by DRD1 and DRD2 receptor variation. While the D1 receptor system is associated with pre-motor inhibition electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition processes (Nogo-N2), the D2 receptor system is associated with electrophysiological correlates of outcome evaluation processes. Dissociable cognitive-neurophysiological subprocesses of response inhibition are hence attributable to distinct dopamine receptor systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

The experimental design used a cross-modal priming paradigm in which the normal adult participants were presented a visual prime followed by an auditory target. Primes were facial expressions that systematically varied in emotional content (happy or angry) and mouth shape (corresponding to /a/ or /i/ vowels). Targets were spoken words that varied by emotional prosody (happy or angry) and vowel (/a/ or /i/). In both the phonetic and prosodic conditions, participants were asked to judge congruency status of the visual prime and the auditory target. Behavioral results showed a congruency effect for both percent correct and reaction time. Two ERP responses, the N400 and late positive response (LPR), were identified in both conditions. Source localization and inter-trial phase coherence of the N400 and LPR components further revealed different cortical contributions and neural oscillation patterns for selective processing of phonetic and emotional information in speech. The results provide corroborating evidence for the necessity of differentiating brain mechanisms underlying the representation and processing of co-existing linguistic and paralinguistic information in spoken language, which has important implications for theoretical models of speech recognition as well as clinical studies on the neural bases of language and social communication deficits.

Single Versus Multiple Events Error Potential Detection in a BCI-Controlled Car Game With Continuous and Discrete Feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); continuous feedback; electroencephalogram (EEG); error potential (ErrP)	BRAIN; EEG; COMMUNICATION; IMAGERY; ERP	Objective: This work aimed to find and evaluate a new method for detecting errors in continuous brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Instead of classifying errors on a single-trial basis, the new method was based on multiple events (MEs) analysis to increase the accuracy of error detection. Methods: In a BCI-driven car game, based on motor imagery (MI), discrete events were triggered whenever subjects collided with coins and/or barriers. Coins counted as correct events, whereas barriers were errors. This new method, termed ME method, combined and averaged the classification results of single events (SEs) and determined the correctness of MI trials, which consisted of event sequences instead of SEs. The benefit of this method was evaluated in an offline simulation. In an online experiment, the new method was used to detect erroneous MI trials. Such MI trials were discarded and could be repeated by the users. Results: We found that, even with low SE error potential (ErrP) detection rates, feasible accuracies can be achieved when combining MEs to distinguish erroneous from correct MI trials. Online, all subjects reached higher scores with error detection than without, at the cost of longer times needed for completing the game. Conclusion: Findings suggest that ErrP detection may become a reliable tool for monitoring continuous states in BCI applications when combining MEs. Significance: This paper demonstrates a novel technique for detecting errors in online continuous BCI applications, which yields promising results even with low single-trial detection rates.

Effect of working memory load on electrophysiological markers of visuospatial orienting in a spatial cueing task simulating a traffic situation	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Working memory; Orienting; ERPs; Alpha rhythm	NATURAL SCENE CATEGORIZATION; COGNITIVE LOAD; ALPHA RHYTHMS; ATTENTION; CAPACITY; EEG; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; COMPONENT; CORTEX	Visuospatial attentional orienting has typically been studied in abstract tasks with low ecological validity. However, real-life tasks such as driving require allocation of working memory (WM) resources to several subtasks over and above orienting in a complex sensory environment. The aims of this study were twofold: firstly, to establish whether electrophysiological signatures of attentional orienting commonly observed under simplified task conditions generalize to a more naturalistic task situation with realistic-looking stimuli, and, secondly, to assess how these signatures are affected by increased WM load under such conditions. Sixteen healthy participants performed a dual task consisting of a spatial cueing paradigm and a concurrent verbal memory task that simulated aspects of an actual traffic situation. Behaviorally, we observed a load-induced detriment of sensitivity to targets. In the EEG, we replicated orienting-related alpha lateralization, the lateralized ERPs ADAN, EDAN, and LDAP, and the P1-N1 attention effect. When WM load was high (i.e., WM resources were reduced), lateralization of oscillatory activity in the lower alpha band was delayed. In the ERPs, we found that ADAN was also delayed, while EDAN was absent. Later ERP correlates were unaffected by load. Our results show that the findings in highly controlled artificial tasks can be generalized to spatial orienting in ecologically more valid tasks, and further suggest that the initiation of spatial orienting is delayed when WM demands of an unrelated secondary task are high.

Western and Eastern participants made self-referent judgments on positive and negative traits while we recorded their electroencephalography signals. At the judgmental level, we assessed trait endorsement (judgments of traits self-descriptiveness) and reaction times (speed of such judgments). Participants endorsed more positive traits as self-descriptive and more negative traits as non-self-descriptive, although the magnitude of this effect (level of self-positivity) was higher in the Western than Eastern sample. Moreover, all participants responded faster to positive self-descriptive traits and to negative non-self-descriptive traits, indicating that the self-enhancement motive is equally potent across cultures. At the neurophysiological level, we assessed N170 and LPP. Negative traits elicited larger N170 among Easterners, indicating initial allocation of attentional resources to the processing of negative information. However, negative compared to positive self-descriptive traits elicited a larger LPP, whereas negative and positive non-self-descriptive traits did not differ in the LPP they elicited. This pattern generalized across samples, pointing to a pancultural physiological correlate of the self-enhancement motive.

Methods After two familiarisation sessions, 23 participants performed a test battery [typing test, Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT), Stroop test and Rosvold continuous performance test (RCPT)] with electroencephalography recording while cycling and sitting on a conventional chair. Results Typing performance, performance on the RAVLT and accuracy on the Stroop test and the RCPT did not differ between conditions. Reaction times on the Stroop test and the RCPT were shorter while cycling relative to sitting (p < 0.05). N200, P300, N450 and conflict SP latency and amplitude on the Stroop test and N200 and P300 on the RCPT did not differ between conditions. Conclusions This study showed that typing performance and short-term memory are not deteriorated when people cycle at 30% Wmax. Furthermore, cycling had a positive effect on response speed across tasks requiring variable amounts of attention and inhibition.

Mechanistic Pathways of Mindfulness Meditation in Combat Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						meditation; mindfulness; veteran; combat; posttraumatic stress disorder	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PTSD; SYMPTOMS; PROGRAM; EEG; PARTICIPATION; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION; REDUCTION	ObjectiveThis study's objective was to evaluate the effect of two common components of meditation (mindfulness and slow breathing) on potential mechanistic pathways. MethodsA total of 102 combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomized to (a) the body scan mindfulness meditation (MM), (b) slow breathing (SB) with a biofeedback device, (c) mindful awareness of the breath with an intention to slow the breath (MM+SB), or (d) sitting quietly (SQ). Participants had 6 weekly one-on-one sessions with 20 minutes of daily home practice. The mechanistic pathways and measures were as follows: (a) autonomic nervous system (hyperarousal symptoms, heart rate [HR], and heart rate variability [HRV]); (b) frontal cortex activity (attentional network task [ANT] conflict effect and event-related negativity and intrusive thoughts); and (c) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (awakening cortisol). PTSD measures were also evaluated. ResultsMeditation participants had significant but modest within-group improvement in PTSD and related symptoms, although there were no effects between groups. Perceived impression of PTSD symptom improvement was greater in the meditation arms compared with controls. Resting respiration decreased in the meditation arms compared with SQ. For the mechanistic pathways, (a) subjective hyperarousal symptoms improved within-group (but not between groups) for MM, MM+SB, and SQ, while HR and HRV did not; (b) intrusive thoughts decreased in MM compared with MM+SB and SB, while the ANT measures did not change; and (c) MM had lower awakening cortisol within-group (but not between groups). ConclusionTreatment effects were mostly specific to self-report rather than physiological measures. Continued research is needed to further evaluate mindfulness meditation's mechanism in people with PTSD.

Electrophysiological and Behavioral Effects of Combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Alcohol Approach Bias Retraining in Hazardous Drinkers	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						tDCS; CBM; EEG; Alcohol; Hazardous Drinkers	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUTOMATIC ACTION-TENDENCIES; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; POTENTIAL REACTIVITY; CHANGE QUESTIONNAIRE; CUES; MODULATION; PLASTICITY; DEPENDENCE; READINESS	BackgroundCognitive bias modification (CBM) can be used to retrain automatic approach tendencies for alcohol. We investigated whether changing cortical excitability with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could enhance CBM effects in hazardous drinkers. We also studied the underlying mechanisms by including behavioral (craving, implicit associations, approach tendencies) and electrophysiological (event-related potentials) measurements. MethodsThe analytical sample consisted of 78 hazardous drinkers (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test >8) randomly assigned to 4 conditions in a 2-by-2 factorial design (control/active CBM and sham/active tDCS). The intervention consisted of 3 sessions of CBM, specifically alcohol approach bias retraining, combined with 15minutes 1 mA tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There was a pre- and postassessment before and after the intervention that included experimental tasks (Approach Avoidance Task, Implicit Association Task) and an electroencephalogram with an oddball and cue-reactivity task. ResultstDCS decreased cue-induced craving (but not overall craving) on postassessment. CBM did not induce an avoidance bias during assessment. During the training, active and control-CBM only differed in bias score during the first session. We found no enhancement effects of tDCS on CBM. Electrophysiological data showed no clear effects of active tDCS or CBM on the P300. ConclusionsThere were no electrophysiological or behavioral effects of repeated CBM and/or tDCS, except for an effect of tDCS on craving. Applied in these specific ways these techniques appear to have limited effects in a hazardous drinking population.

While the network supporting agency-attribution, action-understanding, and grasping of others' mental state is quite known, the actual mental chronometry of such social perception processes is still not clear. We then designed an exploratory study to investigate electrophysiological correlates (ERPs and source localization) of information-processing for the detection of potential agents in realistic interaction scenes. Morphological and statistical analyses of electrophysiological data highlighted that the manipulation the nature of a potential agent, the gesture it executed and the relative position of an interagent was differently associated to the modulation of specific relevant middle-latency ERP components, labelled as P200 and N250, and of their relative intra-cortical current density distribution within the first 300 ms from the appearance of the stimulus.

Individual stimuli were presented at one corner of a square centered at fixation, and each response was made with the left or right hand or foot. In Experiment 1, the correct response was determined by stimulus location, whereas in Experiment 2 it was determined by stimulus identity. Horizontal and vertical compatibility affected both RT and response accuracy, but the LRP and LSP results suggested that compatibility had little or no direct effect on the duration of motor processes. In addition, the results suggest that the relatively new LSP measure is a useful index of motor activation processes. Its insensitivity to horizontal stimulus artifacts makes it especially useful for studying the effects of horizontal spatial compatibility.

One of the consistent behavioural effects in both tasks is the Stroop-like effect: The reaction time (RT) is longer on incongruent trials than on congruent trials. The effect in the Stroop task is usually linked to word planning, whereas the effect in the PWI task is associated with either word planning or perceptual encoding. To adjudicate between the word planning and perceptual encoding accounts of the effect in PWI, we conducted an EEG experiment consisting of three tasks: a standard colour-word Stroop task (three colours), a standard PWI task (39 pictures), and a Stroop-like version of the PWI task (three pictures). Participants overtly named the colours and pictures while their EEG was recorded. A Stroop-like effect in RTs was observed in all three tasks. ERPs at centro-parietal sensors started to deflect negatively for incongruent relative to congruent stimuli around 350 ms after stimulus onset for the Stroop, Stroop-like PWI, and the Standard PWI tasks: an N400 effect. No early differences were found in the PWI tasks. The onset of the Stroop-like effect at about 350 ms in all three tasks links the effect to word planning rather than perceptual encoding, which has been estimated in the literature to be finished around 200-250 ms after stimulus onset. We conclude that the Stroop-like effect arises during word planning in both Stroop and PWI.

This study investigated how brain networks are organized to optimize a suprapostural motor task when the postural load increases and shifts postural control into a less automatic process. Fourteen volunteers executed a designated force-matching task from a level surface (a relative automatic process in posture) and from a stabilometer board while maintaining balance at a target angle (a relatively controlled process in posture). Task performance of the postural and suprapostural tasks, synchronization likelihood (SL) of scalp EEG, and graph-theoretical metrics were assessed. Behavioral results showed that the accuracy and reaction time of force-matching from a stabilometer board were not affected, despite a significant increase in postural sway. However, force-matching in the stabilometer condition showed greater local and global efficiencies of the brain networks than force matching in the level surface condition. Force-matching from a stabilometer board was also associated with greater frontal cluster coefficients, greater mean SL of the frontal and sensorimotor areas, and smaller mean SL of the parietal-occipital cortex than force-matching from a level surface. The contrast of supra threshold links in the upper alpha and beta bands between the two stance conditions validated load-induced facilitation of inter-regional connections between the frontal and sensorimotor areas, but that contrast also indicated connection suppression between the right frontal-temporal and the parietal-occipital areas for the stabilometer stance condition. In conclusion, an increase in stance difficulty alters the neurocognitive processes in executing a postural-suprapostural task. Suprapostural performance is not degraded by increase in postural load, due to (1) increased effectiveness of information transfer, (2) an anterior shift of processing resources toward frontal executive function, and (3) cortical dissociation of control hubs in the parietal occipital cortex for neural economy.

While findings to date are quite inconsistent, studies reporting a decrement in cognitive performance have generally not been able to distinguish between the direct influence of microgravity, and any associated influence of stress. Furthermore, the currently available findings are primarily based on behavioral observations, and there is a need to better understand the underlying neurophysiological responses. The current study aimed to determine the effects of microgravity on neurophysiological processing during a mental arithmetic task (executive function). During the normal-and microgravity phases of a parabolic flight, four levels of a mental arithmetic task were presented on a touchscreen tablet. The latency between the appearance of the problem and the participants' response was identified as reaction time. In addition visual evoked potentials N1 and P2 were determined using an active EEG system and analyzed using source localization algorithms. Results showed an increase in reaction time with increasing levels of task difficulty. During the most complex levels, reaction time was significantly reduced during microgravity. This observation was independent of previous parabolic flight experience as well as the use of anti-motion-sickness medication. P2 amplitude decrease during microgravity was concomitant to a related involvement of the superior frontal and medial frontal gyrus. It is concluded that cortical processes are enhanced during microgravity, and that previously reported impairments in cognitive performance are likely attributable to increased stress rather than weightlessness itself.

Facilitation and inhibition in attention: Functional dissociation of pre-stimulus alpha activity, P1, and N1 components	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; ERP; Alpha; P1; Brain; EEG	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SENSORY GAIN-CONTROL; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; TARGET DETECTION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS	Attention - the ability to attend to some things while ignoring others - can be best described as an emergent property of many neural mechanisms, facilitatory and inhibitory, working together to resolve competition for processing resources and control of behavior. Previous EEG and MEG studies examining the neural mechanisms underlying facilitation and inhibition of stimulus processing typically used paradigms requiring alternating shifts of attention in the spatial domain, with stimuli occurring at both attended and unattended locations. These studies generally observed greater pre-stimulus alpha oscillations over task-irrelevant vs. relevant posterior regions and bilateral attentional modulations of early sensory processing. In contrast, in the current series of experiments, participants continuously attended to only one hemifield and stimuli were only presented at the attended location, affording us an opportunity to elucidate the inhibitory and facilitatory effects of attention in the brain in a context in which spatial relevance was fixed. We found that continuous attention to one hemifield did not modulate prestimulus alpha activity in ipsilateral regions but did result in a perfectly lateralized P1 attention effect to ipsilateral posterior regions. Moreover, we found a bilateral N1 effect. These findings suggest that pre-stimulus alpha activity, the P1 and the N1 reflect qualitatively different aspects of attention; While pre-stimulus alpha-band activity may reflect a top-down inhibitory mechanism that critically depends on functional competition between task-relevant and irrelevant sensory regions, the ipsilateral P1 effect may reflect stimulus-triggered blocking of sensory processing in irrelevant networks, and the N1 effect facilitation of task-relevant processing.

The aim of the study was to find a neuromarker of perioperative anxiety in a patient with critical carotid stenosis through the use of neuromarkers in Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event Related Potentials (ERPs). The indirect purpose of the research was evaluation of improvement in the patient's quality of life. Case study. A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Interventions at the John Paul II Hospital in Krakow, with the diagnosis of critical internal carotid stenosis (over 80%), confirmed by Doppler Ultrasound and Angio-CT examinations. Before hospitalization, the patient had not presented any symptoms of brain ischemia. It was found that severe anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) was worse before the surgery. After the operation, a reduction anxiety in occurred as well as an improvement in the majority of the dimensions of health. Therefore, her quality of life improved. Conclusions. Significant changes were observed on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Modern neurotechnologies measures are necessary to capture all the changes in the symptoms of anxiety before and after the operation for a carotid stenosis. ERPs might be used to select patients with neuromarker of perioperative anxiety, and subsequently to serve in proper psychological care and minimalize the perioperative risk of complications.

Pragmatic skills predict online counterfactual comprehension: Evidence from the N400	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Counterfactuals; Pragmatics; Event-related potentials; N400; Autistic traits	PROPOSITIONAL TRUTH-VALUE; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; FALSE BELIEF; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EMPATHY QUOTIENT; WEAK COHERENCE; MIND; KNOWLEDGE; CHILDREN; IF	Counterfactual thought allows people to consider alternative worlds they know to be false. Communicating these thoughts through language poses a social-communicative challenge because listeners typically expect a speaker to produce true utterances, but counterfactuals per definition convey information that is false. Listeners must therefore incorporate overt linguistic cues (subjunctive mood, such as in If I loved you then) in a rapid way to infer the intended counterfactual meaning. The present EEG study focused on the comprehension of such counterfactual antecedents and investigated if pragmatic ability-the ability to apply knowledge of the social-communicative use of language in daily life-predicts the online generation of counterfactual worlds. This yielded two novel findings: (1) Words that are consistent with factual knowledge incur a semantic processing cost, as reflected in larger N400 amplitude, in counterfactual antecedents compared to hypothetical antecedents (If sweets were/are made of sugar). We take this to suggest that counterfactuality is quickly incorporated during language comprehension and reduces online expectations based on factual knowledge. (2) Individual scores on the Autism Quotient Communication subscale modulated this effect, suggesting that individuals who are better at understanding the communicative intentions of other people are more likely to reduce knowledge-based expectations in counterfactuals. These results are the first demonstration of the real-time pragmatic processes involved in creating possible worlds.

Exploring the unknown: electrophysiological and behavioural measures of visuospatial learning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; P3; P3b; visual learning; visuospatial memory	TO-TARGET INTERVAL; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; TASK; ACCUMULATION; PROBABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Visuospatial memory describes our ability to temporarily store and manipulate visual and spatial information and is employed for a wide variety of complex cognitive tasks. Here, a visuospatial learning task requiring fine motor control is employed to investigate visuospatial learning in a group of typically developing adults. Electrophysiological and behavioural data are collected during a target location task under two experimental conditions: Target Learning and Target Cued. Movement times (MTs) are employed as a behavioural metric of performance, while dynamic P3b amplitudes and power in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz) are explored as electrophysiological metrics during visuospatial learning. Results demonstrate that task performance, as measured by MT, is highly correlated with P3b amplitude and alpha power at a consecutive trial level (trials 1-30). The current set of results, in conjunction with the existing literature, suggests that changes in P3b amplitude and alpha power could correspond to different aspects of the learning process. Here it is hypothesized that changes in P3b correspond to a diminishing inter-stimulus interval and reduced stimulus relevance, while the corresponding changes in alpha power represent an automation of response as habituation occurs in participants. The novel analysis presented in the current study demonstrates how gradual electrophysiological changes can be tracked during the visuospatial learning process under the current paradigm.

Self-relevant threat contexts enhance early processing of fear-conditioned faces	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						P1; Emotion regulation; Pavlovian conditioning; Face processing	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTIONAL PICTURES; EXTINGUISHED FEAR; TIME-COURSE; EXTINCTION; ATTENTION; ERP; REAPPRAISAL; MODULATE; HUMANS	Anxiety states are characterized by attentional biases to threat and increased early brain responses to potentially threat signaling stimuli. How such stimuli are processed further depends on prior learning experiences (e.g. conditioning and extinction) and the context in which a stimulus appears. Whether context information and prior learning experiences interact with early threat processing in humans is largely unknown. Here, EEG was recorded while healthy participants (N = 20) viewed faces that were fear conditioned and/or extinguished 24 h before. Faces were either passively viewed or presented within different contexts, which were created by describing scenarios that could either involve participants directly (self-threatening), or made them observers (other-threatening) of a potentially dangerous situation. Early brain responses (i.e., P1 amplitudes) were specifically enhanced during the self-threatening condition in response to non-extinguished versus extinguished fear-conditioned faces. This finding suggests that top-down contextual information is incorporated into early attention modulation of previously learned threat signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To avoid incorrect responses, both reactive and proactive modes of control have been postulated. Little is known, however, regarding the brain implementation of proactive mechanisms, which are deployed prior to an actual need to inhibit a response. Via a combination of electrophysiological and neuroimaging measures (recorded in 21 and 16 participants, respectively), we describe the brain localization and timing of neural activity that underlies the anticipatory proactive mechanism. From these results, we conclude that proactive control originates in the inferior Frontal gyrus, is established well before stimulus perception, and is released concomitantly with stimulus appearance. Stimulus perception triggers early activity in the anterior insula and intraparietal cortex contralateral to the responding hand; these areas likely mediate the transition from perception to action. The neural activities leading to the decision to act or not to act are described in the framework of a three-stage model that includes perception, action, and anticipatory functions taking place well before stimulus onset.

Short and long term outcomes (after 3 and 6 months, respectively) were evaluated. We measured, at multiple time points, the manual dexterity using a validated clinical scale (ARAT), electroencephalography auditory event related potentials, and neuropsychological performances in patients with chronic stroke of middle severity. Thirty four patients were enrolled and randomized. The intervention group was treated with a NIBS protocol longer than usual, applying a second cycle of stimulation, after a washout period, using different techniques in the two cycles (rTMS/tDCS). We compared the results with a control group treated with sham stimulation. We split the data analysis into three studies. In this first study we examined if a cumulative effect was clinically visible. In the second study we compared the effects of the two techniques. In the third study we explored if patients with minor cognitive impairment have most benefit from the treatment and if cognitive and motor outcomes were correlated. We found that the impairment in some cognitive domains cannot be considered an exclusion criterion for rehabilitation with NIBS. ERR improved, related to cognitive and attentional processes after stimulation on the motor cortex, but transitorily. This effect could be linked to the restoration of hemispheric balance or by the effects of distant connections. In our study the effects of the two NIBS were comparable, with some advantages using tDCS vs. rTMS in stroke rehabilitation. Finally we found that more than one cycle (2-4 weeks), spaced out by washout periods, should be used, only in responder patients, to obtain clinical relevant results.

A pragmatic comparison of noise burst and electric shock unconditioned stimuli for fear conditioning research with many trials	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Fear conditioning; Fear extinction; Unconditioned stimulus (US); Electric shock; White noise burst	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; UNILATERAL TEMPORAL LOBECTOMY; NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; US DURATION; HEART-RATE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXTINGUISHED FEAR	Several methods that are promising for studying the neurophysiology of fear conditioning (e.g., EEG, MEG) require a high number of trials to achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. While electric shock and white noise burst are among the most commonly used unconditioned stimuli (US) in conventional fear conditioning studies with few trials, it is unknown whether these stimuli are equally well suited for paradigms with many trials. Here, N=32 participants underwent a 260-trial differential fear conditioning and extinction paradigm with a 240-trial recall test 24 h later and neutral faces as conditioned stimuli. In a between-subjects design, either white noise bursts (n=16) or electric shocks (n=16) served as US, and intensities were determined using the most common procedure for each US (i.e., a fixed 95 dB noise burst and a work-up procedure for electric shocks, respectively). In addition to differing US types, groups also differed in closely linked US-associated characteristics (e.g., calibration methods, stimulus intensities, timing). Subjective ratings (arousal/valence), skin conductance, and evoked heart period changes (i.e., fear bradycardia) indicated more reliable, extinction-resistant, and stable conditioning in the white noise burst versus electric shock group. In fear conditioning experiments where many trials are presented, white noise burst should serve as US.	[Sperl, Matthias F.

Participants were asked to complete an implicit task (i.e. to judge the color of the name stimuli). This study found that SN elicited larger N170 amplitudes than all other names, whereas there were no differences between its amplitudes elicited by all other names. There were no differences between P300 amplitudes elicited by SN and CON, whereas the above two names elicited larger P300 amplitudes than FPN and UN. These findings suggest that the preferential processing of SN is not only because of self-relevance and familiarity that could differentiate between names with high self-relevance and high familiarity (i.e. SN and CON) and names with less self-relevance/self-irrelevance and less familiarity/unfamiliarity (i.e. FPN and UN) but also because of self-specificity that could differentiate between SN and all other names.

Combining Exergame Training with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Effect on Neuronal Structure/Function in the Elderly Brain	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						older adults; exergame training; video game; nutritional supplementation; omega-3 fatty acid; brain function; brain structure	COGNITIVE-MOTOR INTERVENTION; DUAL-TASK CONDITIONS; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ADULT LIFE-SPAN; OLDER-ADULTS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIALS	A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 x 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age-and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain. This study has been registered in the Swiss National Clinical Trials (SNCTP000001623) and the ISRCTN (ISRCTN12084831) Portals.

In the current electroencephalography-study, we investigated the neuronal interplay of action-based somatosensory simulation and felt touch. We presented index or middle finger tapping movements of a human or a wooden hand, while simultaneously presenting 'tap-like' tactile sensations to either the corresponding or non-corresponding fingertip of the participant. We focused on an early stage of somatosensory processing [P50, N100 and N140 sensory evoked potentials (SEPs)] and on a later stage of higher-order processing (P3-complex). The results revealed an interaction effect of animacy and congruency in the early P50 SEP and an animacy effect in the N100/N140 SEPs. In the P3-complex, we found an interaction effect indicating that the influence of congruency was larger in the human than in the wooden hand. We argue that the P3-complex may reflect higher-order self-other distinction by signaling simulated action-based touch that does not match own tactile information. As such, the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm might help understand higher-order social processes from a somatosensory point of view.

Management of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage	CRITICAL CARE			English	Review						Delayed cerebral ischemia; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Vasospasm; Multimodality monitoring	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; CONTROLLED CLINICAL-TRIAL; BRAIN-TISSUE HYPOXIA; BLOOD-FLOW; DOUBLE-BLIND; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; CEREBROVASCULAR AUTOREGULATION; SPREADING DEPOLARIZATIONS; INDUCED HYPERTENSION	For patients who survive the initial bleeding event of a ruptured brain aneurysm, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is one of the most important causes of mortality and poor neurological outcome. New insights in the last decade have led to an important paradigm shift in the understanding of DCI pathogenesis. Large-vessel cerebral vasospasm has been challenged as the sole causal mechanism; new hypotheses now focus on the early brain injury, microcirculatory dysfunction, impaired autoregulation, and spreading depolarization. Prevention of DCI primarily relies on nimodipine administration and optimization of blood volume and cardiac performance. Neurological monitoring is essential for early DCI detection and intervention. Serial clinical examination combined with intermittent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and CT angiography (with or without perfusion) is the most commonly used monitoring paradigm, and usually suffices in good grade patients. By contrast, poor grade patients (WFNS grades 4 and 5) require more advanced monitoring because stupor and coma reduce sensitivity to the effects of ischemia. Greater reliance on CT perfusion imaging, continuous electroencephalography, and invasive brain multimodality monitoring are potential strategies to improve situational awareness as it relates to detecting DCI. Pharmacologically-induced hypertension combined with volume is the established first-line therapy for DCI; a good clinical response with reversal of the presenting deficit occurs in 70 % of patients. Medically refractory DCI, defined as failure to respond adequately to these measures, should trigger step-wise escalation of rescue therapy. Level 1 rescue therapy consists of cardiac output optimization, hemoglobin optimization, and endovascular intervention, including angioplasty and intra-arterial vasodilator infusion. In highly refractory cases, level 2 rescue therapies are also considered, none of which have been validated. This review provides an overview of current state-of-the-art care for DCI management.

Proactive, but Not Reactive, Distractor Filtering Relies on Local Modulation of Alpha Oscillatory Activity	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; IRRELEVANT INFORMATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURAL BASIS	Filter mechanisms that prevent irrelevant information from consuming the limited storage capacity of visual STM are critical for goal-directed behavior. Alpha oscillatory activity has been related to proactive filtering of anticipated distraction. Yet, distraction in everyday life is not always anticipated, necessitating rapid, reactive filtering mechanisms. Currently, the oscillatory mechanisms underlying reactive distractor filtering remain unclear. In the current EEG study, we investigated whether reactive filtering of distractors also relies on alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms and explored possible contributions by oscillations in other frequency bands. To this end, participants performed a lateralized change detection task in which a varying and unpredicted number of distractors were presented both in the relevant hemifield, among targets, and in the irrelevant hemifield. Results showed that, whereas proactive distractor filtering was accompanied by lateralization of alpha-band activity over posterior scalp regions, reactive distractor filtering was not associated with modulations of oscillatory power in any frequency band. Yet, behavioral and post hoc ERP analyses clearly showed that participants selectively encoded relevant information. On the basis of these results, we conclude that reactive distractor filtering may not be realized through local modulation of alpha-band oscillatory activity.

High affinity in human (hH(3)R K-i = 2.0 +/- 0.2 nM) and rat (rH(3)R K-i = 3.6 +/- 0.7 nM) H3R radioligand binding assays was demonstrated. Potent functional antagonism (K-b = 0.3 +/- 0.1 nM) and inverse agonism (EC30 = 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM) were demonstrated in [S-35]guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding assays. Oral bioavailability and dose-related exposure was consistent among rat, dog, and monkey. After oral dosing, occupancy of H3R by CEP-32215 was estimated by the inhibition of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (ED50 = 0.1 mg/kg p.o.). Functional antagonism in brain was demonstrated by the inhibition of R-alpha-methylhistamine-induced drinking in the rat dipsogenia model (ED30 = 0.92 mg/kg). CEP-32215 significantly increased wake duration in the rat EEG model at 3 -30 mg/kg p.o. Increased motor activity, sleep rebound or undesirable events (such as spike wave or seizure activity) was not observed following doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., indicating an acceptable therapeutic index. CEP-32215 may have potential utility in the treatment of a variety of sleep disorders. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Histamine Receptors'. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, currently only a few results are available on how to use AO effectively. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate whether MI practice can be improved more effectively by synchronous AO than by asynchronous AO. Methods: Ten patients with upper limb motor dysfunction following stroke were selected as the participants. They were divided into two groups to perform MI practice combined with a daily conventional rehabilitation for four consecutive weeks. The control group was asked to perform MI guided by asynchronous AO (MIAAO), and the experimental group was asked to perform the same MI but guided by synchronous AO (MISAO). The event-related power decrease (ERD) in sensorimotor rhythms of electroencephalograph was calculated to reflect the sensorimotor cortex activation and to assess the cortex excitability during MI. Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and pinch strength test (PST) were used to assess the limb motor recovery. Results: The ERD pattern of the experimental group not only had greater amplitude and longer duration, but also included more frequency components. Furthermore, the effect sizes of ERD values between the two groups continuously increased (d(ES) > 0.8) during the course of treatment. Moreover, the FMA and PST scores achieved with MISAO were also significantly higher than those achieved with MIAAO (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with MIAAO, MISAO can enhance the excitation of sensorimotor cortex more effectively and lead to a more rapid neurorehabilitation of stroke patients.

Prediction Signatures in the Brain: Semantic Pre-Activation during Language Comprehension	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						semantics; prediction; language; MEG; N400	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN; TIME-COURSE; MENTAL REPRESENTATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORD RECOGNITION; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; EYE-TRACKING; NEURAL BASIS; EEG-DATA	There is broad agreement that context-based predictions facilitate lexical-semantic processing. A robust index of semantic prediction during language comprehension is an evoked response, known as the N400, whose amplitude is modulated as a function of semantic context. However, the underlying neural mechanisms that utilize relations of the prior context and the embedded word within it are largely unknown. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) data while participants were listening to simple German sentences in which the verbs were either highly predictive for the occurrence of a particular noun (i.e., provided context) or not. The identical set of nouns was presented in both conditions. Hence, differences for the evoked responses of the nouns can only be due to differences in the earlier context. We observed a reduction of the N400 response for highly predicted nouns. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was observed for the preceding verbs: highly predictive (that is more informative) verbs yielded stronger neural magnitude compared to less predictive verbs. A negative correlation between the N400 effect of the verb and that of the noun was found in a distributed brain network, indicating an integral relation between the predictive power of the verb and the processing of the subsequent noun.

J	Stekelenburg, JJ; Keetels, M				Stekelenburg, Jeroen J.; Keetels, Mirjam			The effect of synesthetic associations between the visual and auditory modalities on the Colavita effect	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Synesthetic congruency; Audiovisual integration; Colavita effect; Event-related potentials	MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; SEMANTIC CONGRUENCY; SPATIAL COINCIDENCE; CROSSMODAL BINDING; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DOMINANCE; SPEECH; VENTRILOQUISM; MODULATE	The Colavita effect refers to the phenomenon that when confronted with an audiovisual stimulus, observers report more often to have perceived the visual than the auditory component. The Colavita effect depends on low-level stimulus factors such as spatial and temporal proximity between the unimodal signals. Here, we examined whether the Colavita effect is modulated by synesthetic congruency between visual size and auditory pitch. If the Colavita effect depends on synesthetic congruency, we expect a larger Colavita effect for synesthetically congruent size/pitch (large visual stimulus/low-pitched tone; small visual stimulus/high-pitched tone) than synesthetically incongruent (large visual stimulus/high-pitched tone; small visual stimulus/low-pitched tone) combinations. Participants had to identify stimulus type (visual, auditory or audiovisual). The study replicated the Colavita effect because participants reported more often the visual than auditory component of the audiovisual stimuli. Synesthetic congruency had, however, no effect on the magnitude of the Colavita effect. EEG recordings to congruent and incongruent audiovisual pairings showed a late frontal congruency effect at 400-550 ms and an occipitoparietal effect at 690-800 ms with neural sources in the anterior cingulate and premotor cortex for the 400- to 550-ms window and premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule and the posterior middle temporal gyrus for the 690- to 800-ms window. The electrophysiological data show that synesthetic congruency was probably detected in a processing stage subsequent to the Colavita effect. We conclude that-in a modality detection task-the Colavita effect can be modulated by low-level structural factors but not by higher-order associations between auditory and visual inputs.

J	Mertes, C; Wascher, E; Schneider, D				Mertes, Christine; Wascher, Edmund; Schneider, Daniel			From Capture to Inhibition: How does Irrelevant Information Influence Visual Search? Evidence from a Spatial Cuing Paradigm	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual selective attention; N2pc; cognitive control; distractor positivity; CDA	CONTINGENT ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; STIMULUS-DRIVEN; TARGET; DISTRACTORS; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; REPRESENTATIONS; DISSOCIATION; ALLOCATION	Even though information is spatially and temporally irrelevant, it can influence the processing of subsequent information. The present study used a spatial cuing paradigm to investigate the origins of this persisting influence by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. An irrelevant color cue that was either contingent (color search) or non-contingent (shape search) on attentional sets was presented prior to a target array with different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOA; 200, 400, 800 ms). Behavioral results indicated that color cues captured attention only when they shared target-defining properties. These same-location effects persisted over time but were pronounced when cue and target array were presented in close succession. N2 posterior contralateral (N2pc) showed that the color cue generally drew attention, but was strongest in the contingent condition. A subsequently emerging contralateral posterior positivity referred to the irrelevant cue (i.e., distractor positivity, Pd) was unaffected by the attentional set and therefore interpreted as an inhibitory process required to enable a re-direction of the attentional focus. Contralateral delay activity (CDA) was only observable in the contingent condition, indicating the transfer of spatial information into working memory and thus providing an explanation for the same-location effect for longer SOAs. Inhibition of this irrelevant information was reflected by a second contralateral positivity triggered through target presentation. The results suggest that distracting information is actively maintained when it resembles a sought-after object. However, two independent attentional processes are at work to compensate for attentional distraction: the timely inhibition of attentional capture and the active inhibition of mental representation of irrelevant information.

Loneliness and implicit attention to social threat: A high-performance electrical neuroimaging study	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Chicago electrical neuroimaging analytics (CENA); EEG/ERP; Hypervigilance; Loneliness; Perceived social isolation; Social rejection; Social threat	DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION; ANXIOUSNESS; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; EXCLUSION; CONSTRUCT; COGNITION	Prior research has suggested that loneliness is associated with an implicit hypervigilance to social threats-an assumption in line with the evolutionary model of loneliness that indicates feeling socially isolated (or on the social perimeter) leads to increased attention and surveillance of the social world and an unwitting focus on self-preservation. Little is known, however, about the temporal dynamics for social threat (vs. nonsocial threat) in the lonely brains. We used high-density electrical neuroimaging and a behavioral task including social and nonsocial threat (and neutral) pictures to investigate the brain dynamics of implicit processing for social threat vs. nonsocial threat stimuli in lonely participants (N = 10), compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 9). The present study provides evidence that social threat images are differentiated from nonsocial threat stimuli more quickly in the lonely (similar to 116 ms after stimulus onset) than nonlonely (similar to 252 ms after stimulus onset) brains. That speed of threat processing in lonely individuals is in accord with the evolutionary model of loneliness. Brain source estimates expanded these results by suggesting that lonely (but not nonlonely) individuals showed early recruitment of brain areas involved in attention and self-representation.

It involves a mapping from continuous acoustic waveforms onto the discrete phonological units computed to store words in the mental lexicon. In this article, we review the magnetoencephalographic studies that have explored the timing and morphology of the Ni m component to investigate how vowels and consonants are computed and represented within the auditory cortex. The neurons that are involved in the Nlm act to construct a sensory memory of the stimulus due to spatially and temporally distributed activation patterns within the auditory cortex. Indeed, localization of auditory fields maps in animals and humans suggested two levels of sound coding, a tonotopy dimension for spectral properties and a tonochrony dimension for temporal properties of sounds. When the stimulus is a complex speech sound, tonotopy and tonochrony data may give important information to assess whether the speech sound parsing and decoding are generated by pure bottom-up reflection of acoustic differences or whether they are additionally affected by top-down processes related to phonological categories. Hints supporting pure bottom-up processing coexist with hints supporting top-down abstract phoneme representation. Actually. N1 m data (amplitude, latency, source generators, and hemispheric distribution) are limited and do not help to disentangle the issue. The nature of these limitations is discussed. Moreover, neurophysiological studies on animals and neuroimaging studies on humans have been taken into consideration. We compare also the N1m findings with the investigation of the magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) component and with the analogous electrical components, the N1 and the MMN. We conclude that N1 seems more sensitive to capture lateralization and hierarchical processes than N1 m, although the data are very preliminary. Finally, we suggest that MEG data should be integrated with EEG data in the light of the neural oscillations framework	[Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy; [Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy		Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy.; Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy.	mirko.grimaldi@unisalento.it		Grimaldi, Mirko/0000-0002-0940-3645	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research [PRIN 20128YAFKB_006]	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))	We thank Francesco Sigona for the technical assistance in developing some of the Figures and Bianca Sisinni for providing us the data for the Figure 2.

P300 has been studied extensively in cognitive tasks using, in particular, the three stimulus oddball paradigm. This paradigm revealed two sub-components, known as P3a and P3b, whose relative contributions depend on saliency and task-relevance, respectively. However, the existence and roles of these sub-components in response to low-level errors are poorly understood. Here we investigated responses to low level errors generated by disturbances including target and cursor jumps, versus responses to distractors, i.e., environmental changes that are irrelevant to the reaching task. Additionally, we examined the response to matching cursor and target jumps (dual jumps), which generate estimation errors, and are thus considered task relevant disturbances, but do not generate low level errors. We found that a significant P3a-like component is evoked by both disturbances and distractors, whereas the P3b-like component is significantly stronger in response to disturbances than distractors. The P3b-like component appears also in response to dual jumps, even though there are no low level errors. We conclude that disturbances and distractors elicit distinct responses, and that the P3b-like component reflects estimation errors rather than low-level errors.

In communication, however, both semantic and affective meaning are constructed in and shaped by the broadly construed context (e.g. linguistic, pragmatic, social, cultural, introspective). Studying affective language in context, rather than in isolation, will therefore help us better understand how people comprehend affective content in everyday communication. The pragmatic side of affective communication lies at the heart of this chapter. In the first sections, the reader will be familiarised with the pillar of pragmatic investigation, i.e. the study of language in context. Here, a distinction will be drawn between the views of the traditional cognitive pragmatics and the relatively recent affective pragmatics on which the discussion is centered. At the empirical heart of this chapter lies a review of the recent neuropragmatic studies of language in general and affective language in particular. Particular attention is given to electrophysiological (EEG) studies looking at how linguistic, pragmatic, and socio-personal context modulates cortical activation to affective words, which is mainly reflected on the EPN, N400, and LPC waves. The reviewed neuropragmatic evidence testifies to the profound impact of contextual information on affective language processing.

A comparative study of Cuckoo search (CS), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) nature inspired optimization methods in the field of linear phase FIR filter design is also presented. For this purpose, an improved L-1 weighted error function is formulated in frequency domain, and minimized through CS, PSO and ABC respectively. The error or objective function has a controlling parameter wt which controls the amount of ripple in the desired band of frequency. The performance of FIR filter is examined through three key parameters; Maximum Pass Band Ripple (MPR), Maximum Stopband Ripple (MSR) and Stopband Attenuation (A(s)). Comparative study and the simulation results reveal that the designed filter with CS gives better performance in terms of Maximum Stopband Ripple (MSR), and Stopband Attenuation (A(s)) for low order filter design, and for higher order it also gives better performance in term of Maximum Passband Ripple (MPR). Superiority of the proposed technique is also shown through comparison with other recently proposed methods. (C) 2016 Karabuk University. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

Research into the pathophysiology of PTSD has focused primarily on emotional reactivity, showing evidence of heightened neural response during negative affect provocation. By comparison, studies of brain functioning during the voluntary regulation of negative affect are limited. In the current study, combat-exposed U.S. military veterans with (n=25) and without (n=25) PTSD performed an emotion regulation task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. The late positive potential (LPP) was used as a measure of sustained attention toward, and processing of, negative and neutral pictures, and was scored prior to and after instructions to either maintain or down-regulate emotional response using the strategy of cognitive reappraisal. Results showed that groups did not differ in picture-elicited LPP amplitude either prior to or during cognitive reappraisal; reappraisal reduced the LPP in both groups over time. Time-dependent increases in LPP amplitude as a function of emotional reactivity maintenance were evident in the non-PTSD group only. This latter finding may signal PTSD-related deficits in sustained engagement with emotion-processing over the course of several seconds. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The N400 response to semantic and world-knowledge violations during sentence processing	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Language comprehension; Semantic violations; World-knowledge violations; N400; EEG/ERP	BRAIN POTENTIALS; COMPLETION NORMS; LANGUAGE; INTEGRATION; VALIDATION; PARAFOVEAL; EXPECTANCY; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; INSIGHTS	The distinction between linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge is particularly relevant because it is related to the principle of compositionality during sentence comprehension. Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, and Petersson (2004) challenged the distinction between linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge. Here, we investigate how linguistic and non-linguistic violations are processed in a setting adapted from Hagoort et al., whilst in contrast to Hagoort, keeping the critical word identical. In line with the findings by Hagoort et al., our results showed largest N400 amplitudes for semantic violations (Journeys are stripy'), followed by non-linguistic world-knowledge violations ('Ladybirds are stripy') and contingent sentences ('Trousers are stripy'), and finally by correct sentences ('Zebras are stripy'). Traditional fractional area and relative criterion measures of peak and onset latencies showed no effect of violation type. Interestingly, the semantic violation condition crossed a fixed criterion earlier than the word-knowledge violation condition. In conclusion, our data suggests that the question regarding the distinction between linguistic- and non-linguistic knowledge in terms of language integration remains open. Implications for future studies addressing the difference between linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Visual search performance is predicted by both prestimulus and poststimulus electrical brain activity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							OSCILLATORY-ALPHA-ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EFFECT SIZE; ATTENTION; ERP; CORTEX; TASK; DICHOTOMIZATION; STATISTICS; INCREASES	An individual's performance on cognitive and perceptual tasks varies considerably across time and circumstances. We investigated neural mechanisms underlying such performance variability using regression-based analyses to examine trial-by-trial relationships between response times (RTs) and different facets of electrical brain activity. Thirteen participants trained five days on a color-popout visual-search task, with EEG recorded on days one and five. The task was to find a color-popout target ellipse in a briefly presented array of ellipses and discriminate its orientation. Later within a session, better preparatory attention (reflected by less prestimulus Alpha-band oscillatory activity) and better poststimulus early visual responses (reflected by larger sensory N1 waves) correlated with faster RTs. However, N1 amplitudes decreased by half throughout each session, suggesting adoption of a more efficient search strategy within a session. Additionally, fast RTs were preceded by earlier and larger lateralized N2pc waves, reflecting faster and stronger attentional orienting to the targets. Finally, SPCN waves associated with target-orientation discrimination were smaller for fast RTs in the first but not the fifth session, suggesting optimization with practice. Collectively, these results delineate variations in visual search processes that change over an experimental session, while also pointing to cortical mechanisms underlying performance in visual search.

Visual Task Demands and the Auditory Mismatch Negativity: An Empirical Study and a Meta-Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PUZZLINGLY HIGH CORRELATIONS; ATTENTIONAL LOAD; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; DISTRACTION PARADIGM; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOCIAL COGNITION	Because the auditory system is particularly useful in monitoring the environment, previous research has examined whether task-irrelevant, auditory distracters are processed even if subjects focus their attention on visual stimuli. This research suggests that attentionally demanding visual tasks decrease the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) to simultaneously presented auditory distractors. Because a recent behavioral study found that high visual perceptual load decreased detection sensitivity of simultaneous tones, we used a similar task (n = 28) to determine if high visual perceptual load would reduce the auditory MMN. Results suggested that perceptual load did not decrease the MMN. At face value, these nonsignificant findings may suggest that effects of perceptual load on the MMN are smaller than those of other demanding visual tasks. If so, effect sizes should differ systematically between the present and previous studies. We conducted a selective meta-analysis of published studies in which the MMN was derived from the EEG, the visual task demands were continuous and varied between high and low within the same task, and the task-irrelevant tones were presented in a typical oddball paradigm simultaneously with the visual stimuli. Because the meta-analysis suggested that the present (null) findings did not differ systematically from previous findings, the available evidence was combined. Results of this meta-analysis confirmed that demanding visual tasks reduce the MMN to auditory distracters. However, because the meta-analysis was based on small studies and because of the risk for publication biases, future studies should be preregistered with large samples (n > 150) to provide confirmatory evidence for the results of the present meta-analysis. These future studies should also use control conditions that reduce confounding effects of neural adaptation, and use load manipulations that are defined independently from their effects on the MMN.

We performed a search of medical, psychological, and sociological databases on all relevant literature published between January 2011 and March 2016. Seventeen manuscripts met the study inclusion criteria. Seven assessment measures were used in more than 1 study, 4 of which were clinically administered (Vivo Checklist of War, Detention, and Torture; Clinically Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and 3 of which were self-report measures (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25); Post Migrational Living Difficulties (PMLD)). Two studies reported on psychological treatment, both of which administered Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET); no other systematic psychological treatments were identified. Several biomarkers were investigated but only in a single study each, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lateral prefrontal regions, right inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral isthmus of the cingulate, EEG event-related potentials, hypercortisolemia, and elevated heart rate. On the basis of these findings, we advocate the use of the HTQ, HSCL-25, and PMLD to exclude PTSD noncases and the CAPS for diagnosis of PTSD in Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian refugees in Canada. We further suggest NET as the psychological treatment currently with the strongest evidence base in this population. Finally, we advocate continued research into biomarkers as a means of improving and objectifying psychological assessment and treatment of PTSD in Canadian refugee populations.

Methods: We used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to study connectivity models for healthy adults and adolescents. MMN was elicited with an auditory oddball paradigm in two groups of healthy subjects with mean age 14 (n = 52) and 26 (n = 26). We tested models with different hierarchical complexities including up to five cortical nodes. Results: We showed that the network generating MMN consisted of 5 nodes that could modulate all intra- and internodal connections. The inversion of this model showed that adolescents had reduced backward connection from rIFG to rSTG (p < 0.04) together with increased excitatory activity in rSTG (p < 0.02). There was a reduced modulation of excitability in rSTG (p < 0.02) and of forward connectivity from lA1 to lSTG (p < 0.03). Conclusion: The cortical network generating MMN continues to develop in adolescence up to adulthood. Cortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes, involved in auditory processing, mature with increasing fronto-temporal connectivity together with increased sensitivity in the temporal regions for changes in sound stimuli. Significance: This study may offer an explanation for the neurobiological maturation of the MMN in adolescence. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Even though in everyday life feedback is rarely immediate, to date very few studies have investigated whether the feedback-related negativity (FRN), a relative negativity in the ERP approximately 200 to 300 ms after feedback that is sensitive to feedback valence and predictability, is modulated by feedback timing, and findings are inconsistent. The present study investigated effects of gradually increasing feedback delays on feedback processing in the FRN time window. Subjects completed a probabilistic learning task in which feedback was provided after short, intermediate, or long delays. Difference wave-based analyses showed that amplitudes decreased linearly with increasing feedback delay. A distinct pattern was observed for the FRN as defined in the original waveforms, with FRN amplitudes being largest for long and smallest for short delays. This pattern of results is consistent with the notion that the neural systems underlying feedback processing vary depending on feedback timing. The gradually reduced difference wave signal might reflect a gradual shift away from processing in frontostriatal circuits toward medial temporal involvement. To what extent increased signal amplitudes for longer delays in the original waveforms are related to processing in certain brain structures will need to be determined in future studies.

We used a relationship recognition paradigm and recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to explore the neural mechanism underlying the asymmetrical representations of causal relations in semantic memory. The results revealed that the verification of causal relations is faster if two words appear in cause-effect order (e.g., virus-epidemic) than if they appear in effect-cause order (e.g., epidemic-virus), whereas no such asymmetrical representation was found for the verification of hierarchical relations with reverse orders (e.g., bird-sparrow vs. sparrow-bird) in Experiment 1. Furthermore, the P2 amplitude elicited by superordinate-subordinate order was larger than that when in reverse order, whereas the N400 effect elicited by cause-effect order was smaller (more positive) than when in reverse order. However, no such asymmetry, as well as P2 and N400 components, were observed when verifying the existence of a general associative relation in Experiment 2. We suggested that the smaller N400 in cause-effect order indicates their increased salience in semantic memory relative to the effect-cause order. These results provide evidence for dissociable neural processes, which are related to role binding, contributing to the generation of causal asymmetry.

However, reward dysfunction is not unique to depression, as it is also common across disorders of poor impulse control. We examined the interrelationships of depression (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale [DASS-21]) and impulsivity (UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale) with reward sensitivity among a large, representative sample (N = 260). ERPs were recorded to isolate two neural indicators of consummatory reward processing: initial evaluation of rewards in the 250-350 ms time window postonset of feedback (reward positivity [RewP]), and salience to monetary outcomes (P3). Significant interactions were observed between depression and impulsivity facets across these two stages of reward processing: depression and positive urgency predicted RewP amplitude to reward outcomes (win vs. loss); depression and one other impulsivity trait, (lack of) premeditation, predicted P3 amplitude to monetary outcomes. Conversely, high symptoms of depression were related to three biobehavioral profiles: (1) blunted RewP in conjunction with high positive urgency, (2) combination of blunted RewP and low (lack of) premeditation, and (3) blunted P3 to monetary wins/losses, in conjunction with low (lack of) premeditation. Findings illustrate that reward-related dysfunctions may be optimally conceptualized when examining the interactions between dimensions of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.

CORTEX			English	Article						Mirror neurons; EEG; Frequency; Mu suppression; Alpha; Beta; Methods; Baseline	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA BAND; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; GENERIC METHOD; EEG EVIDENCE	Mu suppression has been proposed as a signature of the activity of the human mirror neuron system (MNS). However the mu frequency band (8-13 Hz) overlaps with the alpha frequency band, which is sensitive to attentional fluctuation, and thus mu suppression could potentially be confounded by changes in attentional engagement. The specific baseline against which mu suppression is assessed may be crucial, yet there is little consistency in how this is defined. We examined mu suppression in 61 typical adults, the largest mu suppression study so far conducted. We compared different methods of base lining, and examined activity at central and occipital electrodes, to both biological (hands) and non-biological (kaleidoscope) moving stimuli, to investigate the involvement of attention and alpha activity in mu suppression. We also examined changes in beta power, another candidate index of MNS engagement. We observed strong mu suppression restricted to central electrodes when participants performed hand movements, demonstrating that mu is indeed responsive to the activity of the motor cortex. However, when we looked for a similar signature of mu suppression to passively observed stimuli, the baselining method proved to be crucial. Selective suppression for biological versus non biological stimuli was seen at central electrodes only when we used a within-trial baseline based on a static stimulus: this method greatly reduced trial-by-trial variation in the suppression measure compared with baselines based on blank trials presented in separate blocks. Even in this optimal condition, 16-21% of participants showed no mu suppression. Changes in beta power also did not match our predicted pattern for MNS engagement, and did not seem to offer a better measure than mu. Our conclusions are in contrast to those of a recent meta-analysis, which concluded that mu suppression is a valid means to examine mirror neuron activity. We argue that mu suppression can be used to index the human MNS, but the effect is weak and unreliable and easily confounded with alpha suppression. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In everyday situations, response inhibition performance might be altered when irrelevant input is presented simultaneously with the information relevant for response inhibition. More specifically, irrelevant concurrent information may either brace or interfere with response-relevant information, depending on whether these inputs are redundant or conflicting. The aim of this study is to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms and the network underlying such modulations using EEG beamforming as method. The results show that in comparison to a baseline condition without concurrent information, response inhibition performance can be aggravated or facilitated by manipulating the extent of conflict via concurrent input. This depends on whether the requirement for cognitive control is high, as in conflicting trials, or whether it is low, as in redundant trials. In line with this, the total theta frequency power decreases in a right hemispheric orbitofrontal response inhibition network including the SFG, MFG, and SMA, when concurrent redundant information facilitates response inhibition processes. Vice versa, theta activity in a left-hemispheric response inhibition network (i.e., SFG, MFG, and IFG) increases, when conflicting concurrent information compromises response inhibition processes. We conclude that concurrent information bi-directionally shifts response inhibition performance and modulates the network architecture underlying theta oscillations which are signaling different levels of the need for cognitive control.

A prominent theory holds that the reward positivity reflects a reward prediction error signal that is sensitive to outcome valence, being larger for unexpected positive events relative to unexpected negative events (Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Although the theory has found substantial empirical support, most of these studies have utilized either monetary or performance feedback to test the hypothesis. However, in apparent contradiction to the theory, a recent study found that unexpected physical punishments also elicit the reward positivity (Talmi, Atkinson, & El-Deredy, 2013). The authors of this report argued that the reward positivity reflects a salience prediction error rather than a reward prediction error. To investigate this finding further, in the present study participants navigated a virtual T maze and received feedback on each trial under two conditions. In a reward condition, the feedback indicated that they would either receive a monetary reward or not and in a punishment condition the feedback indicated that they would receive a small shock or not. We found that the feedback stimuli elicited a typical reward positivity in the reward condition and an apparently delayed reward positivity in the punishment condition. Importantly, this signal was more positive to the stimuli that predicted the omission of a possible punishment relative to stimuli that predicted a forthcoming punishment, which is inconsistent with the salience hypothesis.

Neurophysiological dissociations in processing different word classes, particularly nouns and verbs, have been extensively documented, supporting the contribution of grammatical class to lexical organization. However, the contribution of semantic properties to these processing differences is still unresolved. We aim to isolate this contribution by comparing ERP5 to verbs (e.g. wade), object nouns (e.g. cookie), and event nouns (e.g. concert) in a paired similarity judgment task, as event nouns share grammatical category with object nouns but some semantic properties with verbs. We find that event nouns pattern with verbs in eliciting a more positive response than object nouns across left anterior electrodes 300-500 ms after word presentation. This time window has been strongly linked to lexical-semantic access by prior electrophysiological work. Thus, the similarity of the response to words referring to concepts with more complex participant structure and temporal continuity extends across grammatical class (event nouns and verbs), and contrasts with the words that refer to objects (object nouns). This contrast supports a semantic, as well as syntactic, contribution to the differential neural organization and processing of lexical items. We also observed a late (500-800 ms post-stimulus) posterior positivity for object nouns relative to event nouns and verbs at the second word of each pair, which may reflect the impact of semantic properties on the similarity judgment task.

Such states are referred to as disorders of consciousness. Their clinical diagnosis, as based on complex behavioural criteria, is still prone to error and may lead to ambiguous cases. This article is an overview of the recent experimental approaches aimed at the assessment of the structure and function of the central nervous system, based on neuroimaging and employing the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of consciousness. All these approaches are aimed at identifying the most efficient measure to enable a reliable diagnosing. The first approach is based on structural imaging that provides information on the organisation and state of neural connections within the brain. Other approaches are functional studies divided into passive and active ones. Passive paradigms evaluate the ability of the neural networks in the patient's brain to sustain consciousness without them having to take part in an experimental task, while the active ones enable the assessment of the state of consciousness on the basis of neural correlates of volitional activities recorded as the patient performs mental tasks. The latter approach rests on an assumption that volitional activity requires conscious processing and cannot be explained in terms of stereotypic reaction to stimulation. While a significant number of approaches presented herein works quite well with respect to differentiating the states on the group level, still only a few of them allow such differentiation on the level of an individual patient. On the latter level, the most important challenge (when it comes to choose a particular care for a patient) could be carried out by a complementary use of several methods at the same time or the evaluation of brain function based on various neuroimaging techniques (EEG and fMRI).

Prediction error signals coded by midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are projected to the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). It has been suggested that neuronal activity shifts away from the DA system when feedback is delayed. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), an ERP that is generated in the ACC and has been shown to be sensitive to feedback valence and prediction error magnitude, was found to be reduced for delayed feedback. It has, however, not yet been investigated if the FRN for delayed feedback reflects a reward prediction error. In this study, effects of feedback delay (1 s vs. 7 s) on the processing of expected and unexpected positive and negative feedback were investigated in a between-subjects design in healthy human participants conducting a probabilistic feedback learning task. FRN and P300 amplitudes were decreased for subjects learning from delayed compared to immediate feedback. Importantly, the FRN, extracted from the negative-positive feedback difference wave, was significantly smaller for expected compared to unexpected feedback for both the immediate and delayed feedback conditions. Expectancy effects for the P300 were also seen, but did not interact with feedback valence. These results demonstrate an influence of feedback expectancy, and thus the prediction error, on early feedback processing even for delayed feedback, suggesting that neuronal structures underlying feedback processing are comparable for immediate and delayed feedback, at least to some extent. Modulations of the P300 by feedback delay may be linked to feedback salience.

Previous research identified a network of cortical regions that is relevant for motor sequence learning, namely primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, superior parietal cortex, and subcortical regions, including basal ganglia and cerebellum. Here, we investigated learning-related changes in oscillatory activity (theta, alpha and gamma power) and cross-frequency interactions (theta- and alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling) within cortical regions during sensorimotor memory formation. EEG was recorded from a large group of participants (n = 73) performing the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Posterior parietal alpha power was larger early-on during sequence learning and smaller in later sessions. Alpha/low-gamma (8-13 Hz and 30-48 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was significantly smaller during sequence learning over right superior parietal cortex and frontal cortex. During the transition from sequential stimuli to random stimuli, participants made more errors, indicating that they still implicitly attempted to implement the learned motor sequence. At the same time, alpha/low-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was found to be smaller during the transition relative to later random trials. Our results show that learning and implementing a learned motor sequence reduces alpha/low-gamma PAC over parietal and frontal cortex. Fronto-parietal alpha/low-gamma PAC might be relevant for visuomotor mapping which becomes less relevant once the motor sequence has been encoded. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using EEG recorded in 12 adults with autism and age-matched controls performing a visual target detection task, we characterized the influence of a certain context (targets preceded by a predictive sequence of three distinct stimuli) or an uncertain context (random targets) on behavior and electrophysiological markers of predictive processing. During an uncertain context, adults with autism were faster than controls to detect targets. They also had an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding all random stimuli indexing enhanced preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier N2 to targets reflecting faster information processing compared to controls. During a certain context, both controls and adults with autism presented an increase in P3 amplitude to predictive stimuli indexing information encoding of the predictive sequence, an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding predictable targets corresponding to the deployment of preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier P3 to predictable targets reflecting efficient prediction building and implementation. These results suggest an efficient extraction of predictive information to generate predictions in both controls and adults with autism during a certain context. However, adults with autism displayed a failure to decrease mu power during motor preparation accompanied by a reduced benefit in reaction times to predictable targets. The data reveal that patients with autism over-anticipate stimuli occurring in an uncertain context, in accord with their sense of being overwhelmed by incoming information. These results suggest that adults with autism cannot flexibly modulate cortical activity according to changing levels of uncertainty.

J	Zioga, L; Luft, CD; Bhattacharya, J				Zioga, Loanna; Luft, Caroline Di Bernardi; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Musical training shapes neural responses to melodic and prosodic expectation	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Expectation; Musical training; Language; Prosody	EMOTIONAL PROSODY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; SPEECH	Current research on music processing and syntax or semantics in language suggests that music and language share partially overlapping neural resources. Pitch also constitutes a common denominator, forming melody in music and prosody in language. Further, pitch perception is modulated by musical training. The present study investigated how music and language interact on pitch dimension and whether musical training plays a role in this interaction. For this purpose, we used melodies ending on an expected or unexpected note (melodic expectancy being estimated by a computational model) paired with prosodic utterances which were either expected (statements with falling pitch) or relatively unexpected (questions with rising pitch). Participants' (22 musicians, 20 nonmusicians) ERPs and behavioural responses in a statement/question discrimination task were recorded. Participants were faster for simultaneous expectancy violations in the melodic and linguistic stimuli. Further, musicians performed better than nonmusicians, which may be related to their increased pitch tracking ability. At the neural level, prosodic violations elicited a front-central positive ERP around 150 ms after the onset of the last word/note, while musicians presented reduced P600 in response to strong incongruities (questions on low-probability notes). Critically, musicians' P800 amplitudes were proportional to their level of musical training, suggesting that expertise might shape the pitch processing of language. The beneficial aspect of expertise could be attributed to its strengthening effect of general executive functions. These findings offer novel contributions to our understanding of shared higher-order mechanisms between music and language processing on pitch dimension, and further demonstrate a potential modulation by musical expertise.

However, limits in the processing capacity to allocate resources can prevent unexpected visual stimuli from gaining access to VWM and thereby to consciousness. Using a novel approach to create unbiased stimuli of increasing saliency, we investigated visual processing during a visual search task in individuals who show a high or low propensity to neglect unexpected stimuli. When propensity to inattention is high, ERP recordings show a diminished amplification concomitantly with a decrease in theta band power during the N1 latency, followed by a poor target enhancement during the N2 latency. Furthermore, a later modulation in the P3 latency was also found in individuals showing propensity to visual neglect, suggesting that more effort is required for conscious maintenance of visual information in VWM. Effects during early stages of processing (N80 and P1) were also observed suggesting that sensitivity to contrasts and medium-to-high spatial frequencies may be modulated by low-level saliency (albeit no statistical group differences were found). In accordance with the Global Workplace Model, our data indicate that a lack of resources in low-level processors and visual attention may be responsible for the failure to "ignite" a state of high-level activity spread across several brain areas that is necessary for stimuli to access awareness. These findings may aid in the development of diagnostic tests and intervention to detect/reduce inattention propensity to visual neglect of unexpected stimuli.

Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a valuable model to study reward mechanisms because both the disease process and the anti-Parkinson medications influence dopamine neurotransmission. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether the level of levodopa differently modulates learning from positive and negative feedback and its electrophysiological correlate, the error related negativity (ERN), in PD. Ten PD patients and ten healthy participants performed a two-stage reinforcement learning task. In the Learning Phase, they had to learn the correct stimulus within a stimulus pair on the basis of a probabilistic positive or negative feedback. Three sets of stimulus pairs were used. In the Testing Phase, the participants were tested with novel combinations of the stimuli previously experienced to evaluate whether they learned more from positive or negative feedback. PD patients performed the task both ON- and OFF-levodopa in two separate sessions while they remained on stable therapy with dopamine agonists. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the task. PD patients were less accurate in negative than positive learning both OFF- and ON-levodopa. In the OFFlevodopa state they were less accurate than controls in negative learning. PD patients had a smaller ERN amplitude OFF- than ON-levodopa only in negative learning. In the OFF-levodopa state they had a smaller ERN amplitude than controls in negative learning. We hypothesize that high tonic dopaminergic stimulation due to the dopamine agonist medication, combined to the low level of phasic dopamine due to the OFF-levodopa state, could prevent phasic "dopamine dips" indicated by the ERN needed for learning from negative feedback.

J	Daliri, A; Max, L				Daliri, Ayoub; Max, Ludo			Modulation of Auditory Responses to Speech vs. Nonspeech Stimuli during Speech Movement Planning	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech; speech planning; auditory modulation; auditory evoked potentials; EEG/ERP	SELF-INITIATED SOUNDS; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SENSORY SUPPRESSION; NEURAL ATTENUATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PREDICTION; COMPONENT; CORTEX; ADULTS; PERCEPTION	Previously, we showed that the N100 amplitude in long latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) elicited by pure tone probe stimuli is modulated when the stimuli are delivered during speech movement planning as compared with no-speaking control conditions. Given that we probed the auditory system only with pure tones, it remained unknown whether the nature and magnitude of this pre-speech auditory modulation depends on the type of auditory stimulus. Thus, here, we asked whether the effect of speech movement planning on auditory processing varies depending on the type of auditory stimulus. In an experiment with nine adult subjects, we recorded LLAEPs that were elicited by either pure tones or speech syllables when these stimuli were presented prior to speech onset in a delayed-response speaking condition vs. a silent reading control condition. Results showed no statistically significant difference in pre speech modulation of the N100 amplitude (early stages of auditory processing) for the speech stimuli as compared with the nonspeech stimuli. However, the amplitude of the P200 component (later stages of auditory processing) showed a statistically significant pre-speech modulation that was specific to the speech stimuli only. Hence, the overall results from this study indicate that, immediately prior to speech onset, modulation of the auditory system has a general effect on early processing stages but a speech-specific effect on later processing stages. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that pre-speech auditory modulation may play a role in priming the auditory system for its role in monitoring auditory feedback during speech production.

J	Townsend, G; Platsko, V				Townsend, G.; Platsko, V.			Pushing the P300-based brain-computer interface beyond 100bpm: extending performance guided constraints into the temporal domain	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; P300; event-related potential; rehabilitation	PARADIGM	Objective. A new presentation paradigm for the P300-based brain computer interface (BCI) referred to as the 'asynchronous paradigm' (ASP) is introduced and studied. It is based on the principle of performance guided constraints (Townsend et al 2012 Neurosci. Lett. 531 63-8) extended from the spatial domain into the temporal domain. The traditional constraint of flashing targets in predefined constant epochs of time is eliminated and targets flash asynchronously with timing based instead on constraints intended to improve performance. Approach. We propose appropriate temporal constraints to derive the ASP and compare its performance to that of the `checkerboard paradigm' (CBP), which has previously been shown to be superior to the standard `row/column paradigm' introduced by Farwell and Donchin (1988 Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 70 510-23). Ten participants were tested in the ASP and CBP conditions both with traditional flashing items and with flashing faces in place of the targets (see Zhang et al 2012 J. Neural Eng. 9 026018; Kaufmann and Kiibler 2014 J. Neural Eng. 11; Chen et al 2015 J. Neurosci. Methods 239 18-27). Eleven minutes of calibration data were used as input to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to derive classification coefficients used for online classification. Main results. Accuracy was consistently high for both paradigms (87% and 93%) while information transfer rate was 45% higher for the ASP than the CBP. In a free spelling task, one subject spelled a 66 character sentence (from a 72 item matrix) with 100% accuracy in 3 min and 24 s demonstrating a practical throughput of 120 bits per minute (bpm) with a theoretical upper bound of 258 bpm. The subject repeated the task three times in a row without error. Significance. This work represents an advance in P300 speller technology and raises the ceiling that was being reached on P300 -based BCIs. Most importantly, the research presented here is a novel and effective general strategy for organising timing for flashing items. The ASP is only one possible implementation of this work since in general it can be used to describe all previous existing presentation paradigms as well as any possible new ones. This may be especially important for people with neuromuscular disabilities.

The neural dynamics of stimulus and response conflict processing as a function of response complexity and task demands	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Conflict; Stroop; Flanker; EEG; N2; N450; LPC; LRP	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL PROCESSES; STROOP INTERFERENCE; TIME-COURSE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ATTENTION; COMPATIBILITY; ACTIVATION; ERP; INVOLVEMENT	Both stimulus and response conflict can disrupt behavior by slowing response times and decreasing accuracy. Although several neural activations have been associated with conflict processing, it is unclear how specific any of these are to the type of stimulus conflict or the amount of response conflict. Here, we recorded electrical brain activity, while manipulating the type of stimulus conflict in the task (spatial [Flanker] versus semantic [Stroop]) and the amount of response conflict (two versus four response choices). Behaviorally, responses were slower to incongruent versus congruent stimuli across all task and response types, along with overall slowing for higher response-mapping complexity. The earliest incongruency-related neural effect was a short-duration frontally-distributed negativity at similar to 200 ms that was only present in the Flanker spatial-conflict task. At longer latencies, the classic fronto-central incongruency-related negativity 'N-inc' was observed for all conditions, but was larger and similar to 100 ms longer in duration with more response options. Further, the onset of the motor-related lateralized readiness potential (LRP) was earlier for the two vs. four response sets, indicating that smaller response sets enabled faster motor-response preparation. The late positive complex (LPC) was present in all conditions except the two-response Stroop task, suggesting this late conflict-related activity is not specifically related to task type or response-mapping complexity. Importantly, across tasks and conditions, the LRP onset at or before the conflict-related N-inc, indicating that motor preparation is a rapid, automatic process that interacts with the conflict-detection processes after it has begun. Together, these data highlight how different conflict-related processes operate in parallel and depend on both the cognitive demands of the task and the number of response options.

J	Takaura, K; Tsuchiya, N; Fujii, N				Takaura, Kana; Tsuchiya, Naotsugu; Fujii, Naotaka			Frequency-dependent spatiotemporal profiles of visual responses recorded with subdural ECoG electrodes in awake monkeys: Differences between high- and low-frequency activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electrocorticography; Frequency band; Visual response; Spatiotemporal profile; Monkey	HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PRESTRIATE CORTEX; FIELD POTENTIALS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEURONAL MECHANISMS	Electrocorticography (ECoG) constitutes a powerful and promising neural recording modality in humans and animals. ECoG signals are often decomposed into several frequency bands, among which the so-called high-gamma band (80-250 Hz) has been proposed to reflect local cortical functions near the cortical surface below the ECoG electrodes. It is typically assumed that the lower the frequency bands, the lower the spatial resolution of the signals; thus, there is not much to gain by analyzing the event-related changes of the ECoG signals in the lower-frequency bands. However, differences across frequency bands have not been systematically investigated. To address this issue, we recorded ECoG activity from two awake monkeys performing a retinotopic mapping task. We characterized the spatiotemporal profiles of the visual responses in the time-frequency domain. We defined the preferred spatial position, receptive field (RF), and response latencies of band-limited power (BLP) (i.e., alpha [3.9-11.7 Hz], beta [15.6-23.4 Hz], low [30-80 Hz] and high [80-250 Hz] gamma) for each electrode and compared them across bands and time-domain visual evoked potentials (VEPs). At the population level, we found that the spatial preferences were comparable across bands and VEPs. The high-gamma power showed a smaller RF than the other bands and VEPs. The response latencies for the alpha band were always longer than the latencies for the other bands and fastest in VEPs. Comparing the response profiles in both space and time for each cortical region (V1, V4+, and TEO/TE) revealed regional idiosyncrasies. Although the latencies of visual responses in the beta, low-, and high-gamma bands were almost identical in V1 and V4+, beta and low-gamma BLP occurred about 17 ms earlier than high-gamma power in TEO/TE. Furthermore, TEO/TE exhibited a unique pattern in the spatial response profile: the alpha and high-gamma responses tended to prefer the foveal regions, whereas the beta and low-gamma responses preferred the peripheral visual fields with larger RFs. This suggests that neurons in TEO/TE first receive less selective spatial information via beta and low-gamma BLP but later receive more fine-tuned spatial foveal information via high-gamma power. This result is consistent with a hypothesis previously proposed by Nakamura et al. (1993) that states that visual processing in TEO/TE starts with coarse-grained information, which primes subsequent fine-grained information. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ECoG can be a potent tool for investigating the nature of the neural computations in each cortical region that cannot be fully understood by measuring only the spiking activity, through the incorporation of the knowledge of the spatiotemporal characteristics across all frequency bands.
